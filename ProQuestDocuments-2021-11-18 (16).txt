Texto completo: A lighthearted look at the news of the day:
The Salt Lake area received more than 3.5 inches of rain in May alone, and nearly 11 inches so far this spring. Now I understand why the government is considering letting astronauts land here later this year. This is becoming the perfect place for a splashdown.
---
Now that June is here, however, it might be a good time to open your coin purses and leave them on your lawn. The experts say to expect change in the weather.
---
It’s OK if you don’t have a coin purse. You can always hope for a rain check.
---
If one thing is clear in Washington these days, it is that no one should come dressed as John McCain to the White House this Halloween.
---
The New York Times says the White House ordered the Navy to hide the destroyer John S. McCain while the president recently visited Japan, so its name wouldn’t appear in photographs. The president attributed the decision to a “well meaning” subordinate and said he knew nothing about it.
Aren’t modern politics so much nastier than in the past? Just imagine what would have happened if, say, Franklin Roosevelt had removed the name of a political rival from some big project like a dam or something… near Boulder City, Nevada, for instance.
---
Congress finally named the Nevada structure Hoover Dam in 1947, reversing FDR’s unofficial “Boulder Dam” moniker. But anyone who has lived in Nevada will tell you the name still depends on your party affiliation. Trump could end that controversy, you know, by buying the whole thing and turning it into a Trump Hotel.
---
Robert Mueller is one person who won’t be allowed to stay at a Trump Hotel any time soon. Last week he said the Justice Department prohibits him from charging a sitting president, but that the Constitution provides a different remedy, a word he wouldn’t mention that begins with an “i”. Hmm. Judging by the president’s reaction, that word must be “insult.”

Assange is a spy, not a journalist

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a "nonstate hostile intelligence service." Apparently Julian Assange agrees. In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an "intelligence agency" for the people.
Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his "thermonuclear device" -- releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables "included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential. These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety."
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange's decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, "We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them."
Assange's stolen classified documents didn't just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered "a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks" as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange's disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his "Gitmo files "which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him. One of Assange's stolen documents -- the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida's captured operational commander -- revealed that Faraj had "reported on al-Qaida's methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means"; that he had "received a letter from UBL's designated courier" who was "the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan"; and that "in mid-2003, [Faraj] moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar," Pakistan. The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike "reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections." So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. He engaged in espionage against the United States. And he has no remorse for the harm he has caused. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures "collateral damage" and admitted WikiLeaks might get "blood on our hands." Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

Impeachment is the new litmus test for Democratic candidates

Autor: Pindell, James.

Texto completo: In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic Party has moved to the left on a number of policy issues.
Think Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, free public college tuition, marijuana legalization, $15 federal minimal wage, and reparations. Recall that it was just a couple elections ago that many Democrats — especially those from politically moderate areas — had to defend their support for abortion rights to their own party members.
Not so much anymore. Today, if a Democratic presidential candidate doesn't support any of the aforementioned, primary voters often push them to explain why not . And, as the adage goes in politics: If you're explaining, you're losing.
This week, a new litmus test emerged for the 2020 Democratic field: whether candidates want to begin impeachment proceedings for President Trump.
Sure, some White House hopefuls, such as Representative Seth Moulton of Salem, were in favor of beginning impeachment proceedings in late 2017. But the issue really took off with the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report a month ago.
Back in April, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts led the Democratic field in forcefully calling for the impeachment proceedings to begin on Trump for obstruction of justice. She said she believed the Mueller report detailed 10 instances of Trump doing so during the investigation of Russian involvement in the last presidential election.
While some of her White House competitors quickly joined her on that call, others were more wary.
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, for example, appeared to defer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's more cautious path. US Senator Bernie Sanders opposed impeachment because he said he believes that the proceedings play into Trump's hands politically. Washington Governor Jay Inslee and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more investigations.
But Mueller's televised press conference on Wednesday changed that. Mueller mostly reiterated what was in the report, but his appearance — at least politically — changed the contours of the Democratic presidential primary.
Six of the 24 Democratic presidential candidates supported impeachment proceedings before the Mueller press conference: Warren, Moulton, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro, Senator Kamala Harris of California, former US representative Beto O'Rourke, and Miramar, Fla. Mayor Wayne Messum.
In the hours afterward, that count ticked up to 10 candidates, with Booker, Gillibrand, Buttigieg, and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper joining the pro-impeachment camp.
This means impeachment is now supported by something approaching half of 24 Democratic presidential candidates. If a Democratic candidate doesn't support it, they will need to explain why not.
This debate could have reverberations beyond presidential politics. Democratic primaries for US House and Senate could be partly defined by how candidates stand on the issue.
For example, US Senator Edward J. Markey is more cautious on the impeachment question. He hasn't directly called for it, but he's said that “Trump seems to want to set the table for his own impeachment" by not complying with House oversight inquiries. While his primary opponent, Brookline employment law attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, came out Wednesday in favor, writing on Twitter “We need to impeach Trump."
Now consider this: NBC found that only 51 of the 235 House Democratic caucus members support beginning impeachment proceedings. That leaves plenty of opportunity for congressional primary challengers to get some distances between them and the incumbents.
Granted, Markey has time to change his mind. In Representative Ayanna Pressley's high-profile upset over incumbent Mike Capuano in last year's Democratic primary, both candidates backed impeachment.
But regardless of whether impeachment is warranted — or even a smart political bet for Democrats — the issue is clearly not disappearing from the presidential campaign trail.
In fact, the discussion might only be beginning.

VON BULOW, 92; Convicted, acquitted in bid to kill rich wife

Texto completo: Claus von Bulow, the millionaire socialite famously convicted and later acquitted of attempting to murder his heiress wife with insulin injections at their Rhode Island mansion, has died.
He passed away Saturday at his home in London, The New York Times reported, citing son-in-law Riccardo Pavoncelli.
He was 92.
Von Bulow was indicted for allegedly trying to kill his wealthy wife Martha "Sunny" von Bulow during back-to-back Christmas vacations at their Newport home in 1979 and 1980 in an attempt to claim a $14 million inheritance.
Sunny slipped into comas after both holidays and spent nearly three decades in a vegetative state before she died in a nursing home in 2008 at age 76.
Von Bulow was found guilty in a televised 1982 trial and sentenced to 30 years.
He vehemently maintained his innocence and later won an appeal masterminded by Alan Dershowitz, then a professor at Harvard Law School, and future New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who was one of Dershowitz's students.
Former U.S. Attorney Thomas Puccio led his defense during the second trial which ended with acquittal on all charges in 1985.
His story was the subject of the 1990 movie "Reversal of Fortune" starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close that was based on the 1986 book of the same name written by Dershowitz.
Irons won an Academy Award for his complicated portrayal of von Bulow that never fully resolved the question of whether a crime was committed.
In his book, Dershowitz wrote, "This case has everything. It has money, sex, drugs; it has Newport, New York and Europe; it has nobility; it has maids, butlers, a gardener."
On Thursday, Dershowitz said von Bulow loved his book but hated the film.
"The movie left the issue open, with everyone leaving the theater coming to a different conclusion, and he didn't like that," Dershowitz, who remained friends with von Bulow until his death, told the Daily News.
Dershowitz called von Bulow a "fascinating man with a bizarre sense of humor" who took his advice and moved away to Europe to lead a quiet life out of the public eye after his retrial and acquittal.
The lawyer said von Bulow lost his ability to walk during his final years but remained close with his daughter and grandchildren and still took an active interest in theater and opera.
"His whole life has been defined by this accusation, which we were able to disprove in court through use of medical and scientific evidence. But he still went through life with this hanging over his head," Dershowitz said.

Texto completo: Q. Can you tell me the approximate value of old newspapers and magazines? I have the full copy of The New York Times newspaper from Saturday April 15, 1865, with the headline "Awful Event, President Lincoln Shot by an Assassin," as well as a newspaper of Kennedy's assassination. I also have old Playboy magazines from the 1950s-'70s.
A. Old newspapers covering major events, like the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake and other major catastrophes, sell for the highest prices. The front page of the April 15, 1865, New York Times sold at auction for $450 last year. A copy of the same issue, with eight pages, sold for $1,200 three years ago. Most Playboy magazines sell for only a couple of dollars. A collection of 30 magazines sold for $76. But beware, many copies have been made of the famous newspapers. Old newspapers yellow and fall apart unless properly stored.
Q. I am trying to find out what my silver tray is worth. It is oval and has a rope twist rim. There is a mark on the bottom with a three-leaf stem, a crown and a standing lion over two more lions and a star. The mark also has old-English-looking letters: EBM & S.
A. The letters on your tray are actually EGW & S, which stand for E.G. Webster & Son of New York City and Brooklyn. The Elizur G. Webster firm started in New York City in 1860. In 1864, Webster partnered with William Dupree and the firm became Webster & Dupree. After a few changes in partnerships with William Dupree and Webster's brother Adelbert Webster, E.G. partnered with his son Fred H. Webster in 1886, and the firm became E.G. Webster & Son. E.G. died in 1900. His son continued the business until 1928, when it was sold to International Silver Co. In 1981, it was sold to Oneida. Your tray is silver plate and the pattern is No. 210. The mark dates it from 1886 to 1928. Medium-sized silver-plated serving trays in good condition are worth $35 to $50.
Q. I have an antique buffet that I bought 30 years ago at an antiques shop in Florida. It has two long drawers and two cupboards with interior shelves. There is a paper label that says "Fulton Street at Hoyt, Abraham & Straus, Brooklyn" and "No. 445-1" is burned into the wood. I'd like to know more about the buffet and its value.
A. Abraham & Straus started in 1865 as Wechsler & Straus. The name became Abraham & Straus in 1893 after the Straus family bought out Weschler. It became part of Federated Department Stores in 1900. The name Abraham and Straus continued to be used until 1995. The number is probably the model number. Your buffet was made in the first half of the 20th century. Many reproductions of earlier styles of furniture were made before 1960. A buffet would sell for about $750-$1,000 depending on style and condition.
Q. Is there any value to an old box of phonograph needles? I have an unopened tin that contains 200 needles. It says "Columbia medium tone needles" on the lid. It says "Brilliant" above that and "Use each needle once only" below. It's yellow with brown and white and has music notes on either side of the writing.
A. Tin phonograph needle cases appeal to people who collect phonographs, music memorabilia or advertising items. The tins are very small, about 2 inches across, and often have attractive graphic designs lithographed on the top and sides. Your tin is from the 1920s and sells online for about $15. The unused needles are also wanted by those who play their old records.

Claus von Bulow, the Danish-born socialite who avoided a 30-year prison sentence in the 1980s after he was retried and acquitted of attempting to murder his wealthy wife with insulin injections, has died. He was 92.
He died on Saturday at his home in London, the New York Times reported, citing Riccardo Pavoncelli, his son-in-law.
Von Bulow was embroiled in one of America’s most notorious criminal cases after he was indicted for trying to kill his wife, Martha “Sunny” von Bulow, on successive Christmas vacations in 1979 and 1980 at their seaside mansion in Newport, R.I. The heiress, who slipped into comas on both occasions, spent almost 28 years in a vegetative state after the second incident, which two of her children claimed deliberately had been caused by Claus von Bulow. She died in a nursing home in 2008 at age 76.
He was found guilty in a televised 1982 trial and was handed a 30-year sentence before winning an appeal led by Alan Dershowitz, who was then a professor at Harvard Law School. Von Bulow won a 1985 retrial that captivated the nation with a classic whodunit tale involving money, sex and betrayal.
“This is the story of how Claus von Bulow was convicted of a crime that probably never happened and then succeeded in vindicating himself — both in the eyes of the law and in the minds of many, though certainly not all, observers,” Dershowitz wrote in his 1986 book Reversal of Fortune. A 1990 film adaptation earned Jeremy Irons an Academy Award for his portrayal of von Bulow; actress Glenn Close played his doomed wife.
The prosecution asserted that von Bulow had injected his wife with insulin to cause her death and claim a $14 million inheritance from her will. Her net worth at the time was about $75 million. He also had a mistress, television soap-opera actress Alexandra Isles, whom he had wanted to marry. The defense, led by Thomas Puccio in the retrial, painted Sunny von Bulow as a drug addict and alcoholic who had overdosed. Puccio died in 2012.
“There was no animosity between Sunny and me,” von Bulow said in a 1985 interview with television personality Barbara Walters. “There was an irreconcilable difference about her wish to lead a retired life and my wish to still work.”
Debonair and articulate, von Bulow continued with his high-society lifestyle and took up with Hungarian-born aristocrat Andrea Reynolds after Isles testified against him in the first trial. His two stepchildren, Annie-Laurie and Alexander von Auersperg, as well as Sunny von Bulow’s longtime maid, Maria Schrallhammer, also attempted to incriminate him at the trials. His daughter, Cosima — born to Sunny von Bulow — took her father’s side, prompting her maternal grandmother to disinherit Cosima.
“Whatever one felt personally about the guilt or innocence of the man, one could not deny his charm, which was enormous, in a European, upper-class, courtly sort of way,” Dominick Dunne wrote in a 1985 Vanity Fair article.
Claus von Bulow was born as Claus Cecil Borberg on Aug. 11, 1926, in Copenhagen. His father was a playwright and theater critic who was accused of collaborating with the Nazis and his mother was the daughter of a former Danish justice minister.
Von Bulow’s parents divorced when he was 4 and he was raised by his mother in London after being smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Denmark during World War II. He attended Cambridge University and earned a law degree after the war. Von Bulow apprenticed as a barrister and then worked for oil baron J. Paul Getty as a chief assistant.
In 1966, von Bulow married the former “Sunny” Crawford, who was the only child of George Crawford, the founder of Columbia Gas & Electric. They had met at a London dinner party a few years earlier while she was married to Prince Alfred von Auersperg, an heir to Austria’s Habsburg dynasty. Von Bulow added the aristocratic “von” to his name around the time of his marriage, Dershowitz wrote.
The von Bulows lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan and their Newport summer mansion, Clarendon Court. In a 1987 out-of-court settlement with his stepchildren, who had filed a $56 million civil lawsuit against him after his acquittal, von Bulow agreed to divorce his comatose wife, give up claims to her estate and relinquish the right to make money by writing books or giving speeches about the case. In return, Cosima von Bulow was to receive a one-third share of her maternal grandmother’s estate.
“This was a tragedy and it satisfied all of Aristotle’s definitions of tragedy,” von Bulow said in a forum at Harvard Law School several weeks after his acquittal. “Everyone is wounded, some fatally.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Just weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died in August.
It reveals that Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' " and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller's role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.
Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year.
The letter drew on information discovered on Hofeller's hard drives, which were found by Hofeller's estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census "would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats" and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers' letter to Furman.
The evidence, first reported by The New York Times, contradicts testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court Thursday for "sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony" by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU on Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to "respectfully inform" it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting "and that Petitioners (the government) obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations."
The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion. The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
"Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census," Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. "Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday's hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments."
The Supreme Court heard the case April 23.
Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public.
On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump's election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
"It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing," he said.
Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence.
The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and to determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.

McConnell vacancy flip opens wounds

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reopened a constitutional debate — and lingering political wounds — when he said with a smile that filling a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy is on the table during the 2020 presidential election.
The about-face comes three years after the Kentucky Republican made his most memorable Machiavellian maneuver by refusing to give President Barack Obama's last appointee to the high court, Judge Merrick Garland, a Senate hearing.
"We will look forward to the American people deciding who they want to make this appointment through their own votes," McConnell said in 2016.
Kentucky and national Democrats cried hypocrisy at McConnell, the self-described "Grim Reaper" to liberals, who has poked fun at blocking Garland on his reelection campaign website.
"Reveling in your own hypocrisy," Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, said via Twitter.
McGrath is a rumored Democratic Senate candidate in 2020, who has reportedly huddled with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about challenging McConnell next year.
"It's a reminder that McConnell's oath to the Republican swamp always takes priority over his oath to the Constitution," said Democratic strategist Mark Nickolas, a McGrath adviser who ran her 2018 congressional bid.
McConnell spoke in Paducah on Tuesday at the city's chamber luncheon. He made the remark in response to a question from an audience member asking what McConnell, who is also up for reelection in 2020, would do if a similar Supreme Court vacancy arose.
U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, who is Kentucky's lone Democrat in Washington, said if that were to happen, it would further escalate the partisan court fights.
"What you'll see is an outcry from Democrats to increase the size of the Supreme Court with a Democratic president," Yarmuth said. "I think Mitch is inviting that."
Kentucky radio sports host Matt Jones, another possible contender for the U.S. Senate next year, said McConnell's U-turn underscores how political power trumps everything for the Bluegrass State's senior senator.
"This is a perfect example of the fact to Mitch McConnell there are no rules, there are no principles, there are no beliefs," Jones told the Courier Journal. "It's just about getting power in the most aggressive way possible, and once again McConnell makes moves to make politics worse and to sacrifice the future for his own immediate political gain."
Ben Self, chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party, said it's no surprise that with a Republican president in office, McConnell has changed his mind.
"McConnell holds no beliefs sacred — they change as it becomes politically convenient. He's the worst kind of politician: a self-serving hypocrite," he said.
But McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer defended the senator's comments in a statement to the Courier Journal. He said McConnell's statement on Tuesday was in line with previous remarks over the past three years about how Supreme Court nominations rarely go through in a divided government.
"I'm glad to see everyone cares as much as they do about what Leader McConnell said in Paducah, but those reporting it as somehow inconsistent are wrong," Steurer said.
McConnell has noted on several occasions that since the 1880s a Supreme Court vacancy hasn't been filed during a presidential year when the Senate and White House are held by opposing parties.
"His comments in Paducah yesterday simply repeated this," Steurer said Wednesday. "If there is a vacancy next year, because the White House and the Senate are the same party, we would vote to fill the slot."
But fact-checkers have regularly dinged McConnell for "selectively omitting parts" of what he said to justify blocking Garland in 2016.
The New York Times last year called attention to how McConnell's argument in refusing to consider Garland at the time emphasized "that voters should have a say in the selection" more than one about divided government.
A Republican-led Senate has confirmed a nominee put forth by a Democratic president only once. That was in 1895, when it approved President Grover Cleveland's choice of Justice Rufus W. Peckham. But a Democratic-controlled Senate has approved 13 nominees by Republican presidents during that same time period, according to Supreme Court historical information.
As far as Supreme Court appointments during presidential election years, there have been seven justices appointed by the Senate since the 1880s. Only once during an election has a nomination failed, and that was in 1968 when Justice Abe Fortas withdrew a bid to be chief justice.
The most recent appointment during a presidential election year was in 1988 when a Democrat-controlled Senate approved Republican President Ronald Reagan's selection of Justice Anthony Kennedy by a 97-to-0 vote after a seven-month confirmation process.
Steurer, the senator's spokesman, said Kennedy doesn't count because the confirmation began in 1987.
McConnell has made changing the judiciary a cornerstone of his legacy that will likely be a centerpiece of his reelection campaign next year.
"The reason I started with judges, as important as all these other things we're talking about, if you want to have a long-lasting positive impact on the country — everything else changes," McConnell said to the Paducah chamber luncheon on Tuesday.
McConnell has repeatedly stressed to conservative voters that unlike agenda items such as tax reform, which can be immediately altered by a new Congress, the courts have lasting change.
"What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment of a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of the judge is to follow the law," he said. "That's the most important thing we've done for the country, which cannot be undone."
Josh Douglas, a University of Kentucky law professor, said a legacy of the Trump administration will be one of reshaping the federal judiciary. He said no one is more responsible for that than McConnell. "This recent statement is now par for the course in a brazen power grab — one which worked out spectacularly for the Republicans previously," Douglas said.
Besides escorting two of President Donald Trump's appointees to the Supreme Court through the Senate since 2017, McConnell has ushered in dozens of lower level nominees.
This year, he used a party-line vote to unleash the so-called nuclear option that gave Trump appointees a speedier confirmation. The GOP leader is moving at such a break-neck speed that observers say there will be few vacancies at the circuit and district court levels to fill should a Democrat seize the White House.
"Through sheer brazen politics, McConnell has been able to reshape that judiciary unlike few before him," Douglas said.

Texto completo: It's going to be more difficult for Democratic presidential candidates to the make the stage of the third and fourth debates, according to new qualifying rules released by the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.
For debates scheduled for September and October, candidates will have to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors, according to the DNC guidance.
For the first and second rounds of debates, the DNC is requiring candidates to either hit at least 1% in three polls or receive campaign contributions from at least 65,000 donors.
The higher polling threshold could certainly narrow who from the nearly two dozen candidate field will make it to the stage.
So far, eight candidates have hit received 2% or more support in four national or early-state voting polls: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke.
For the September debate, each poll must be publicly released between June 28, 2019, and August 28, 2019.
The DNC said it will announce deadlines for qualifying polls ahead of the October debate will be released in the future.
The approved polling includes surveys conducted by the Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), Quinnipiac University, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post, and Winthrop University.
The DNC also announced Wednesday that the third debate will be hosted on Sept. 12 by ABC News, in partnership with Univision.
A second night of debating will be held to accommodate a large field if necessary, according to the DNC.
The first debate is scheduled to be held over two nights on June 26 and 27 in Miami, and the second round is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit.
The campaigns of Biden, Sanders, Harris, Warren, Buttigieg, O'Rourke, Booker as well as entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro and Marianne Williamson, say they have met both the polling and donor qualifications to take part in the first two rounds of debates.
Klobuchar, former Rep. John Delaney, Gov. Jay Inslee, former Gov. John Hickenlooper, Gov. Steve Bullock, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. Tim Ryan and Rep. Eric Swalwell report they've met one of the thresholds to take part in the first debate.
Rep. Seth Moulton, Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam, Sen. Michael Bennet and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have yet to meet either qualifying threshold.
The DNC is capping participation at 20 candidates for the first two round of debates and says it will announce who will make it to the stage about two weeks before each scheduled debate.

Texto completo: The White House asked the Navy to hide a destroyer named after Senator John McCain in order to avoid having the ship appear in photographs taken while President Trump was visiting Japan this week, White House and military officials said Wednesday.
Although Navy officials insisted they did not hide the ship, the John S. McCain, they did give all of the sailors aboard the day off on Tuesday as Mr. Trump visited Yokosuka Naval Base.
Two Navy sailors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that the McCain sailors were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak that day aboard the amphibious assault ship Wasp, while sailors from other American warships at the base were.
A Navy service member based on Yokosuka said that all of the American warships in the harbor were invited to send 60 to 70 sailors to hear Mr. Trump's address, with the exception of the McCain. When several sailors from the McCain showed up anyway, wearing their uniforms with the ship's insignia, they were turned away, the service member said.
White House aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly, confirmed the request was made but said that Mr. Trump did not know about it. A United States official said on Wednesday that the White House sent an email to the Navy with the request on May 15.
But the president denied on Twitter on Wednesday night having any involvement: "I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan."
Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who died last year from brain cancer, was derided repeatedly during his life by Mr. Trump, who once disparaged Mr. McCain's service because he had been held as a war prisoner in Vietnam, saying, "I like people who weren't captured."
The president's animosity toward the senator did not subside with his death.
Navy officials approached last week by The New York Times about plans for the McCain during Mr. Trump's visit declined to comment. But one official said on Thursday that sailors aboard the destroyer were told to hide signs that identified that warship during Mr. Trump's visit.
The White House request to hide the name of Mr. Trump's rival, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is the second episode to engulf the Navy in Mr. Trump's single visit to the Wasp.
At least a few service members wore round patches emblazoned with a likeness of Mr. Trump and the words "Make Aircrew Great Again" -- a play on the president's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again" -- on their flight suits while listening to their commander in chief speak.
Images of the patches promptly went viral. "They're inappropriate & against regulation," tweeted Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army general.
Just days later, the Navy was embroiled in the McCain news. "All ships remained in normal configuration during the president's visit," said Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Navy spokesman.
In a statement late Wednesday, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, said that Mr. Shanahan "was not aware of the directive to move the U.S.S. John S. McCain, nor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive."
The disclosure that the Navy entertained a request to hide a warship named after an American war hero from a president who did not serve is likely to resurface questions about whether Mr. Trump has politicized the military.
Mr. Shanahan, the president's pick to become defense secretary -- and who was in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Thursday and who will soon be visiting Tokyo -- has taken pains to go along with White House requests, many of which were delayed by his predecessor, Jim Mattis. But this effort could make Mr. Shanahan's confirmation fight in Congress more difficult.
The destroyer John S. McCain is named after the senator, as well as his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam era.
Meghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, spoke out on Twitter on Wednesday night against the White House request. Ms. McCain, who has rebuked the president over how he has spoken about her father, wrote that Mr. Trump was "threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life," adding that in the "nine months since he passed, Trump won't let him RIP."

Leave those millennials alone

Texto completo: Millennials! They are, according to many pundits and politicians, ungrateful and wasteful, and come with an angry and humorless social justice streak on the side.
“No faction on the Democratic side more richly deserves rebuking,” New York Times columnist Bret Stephens darkly proclaimed last week, before going on to say he didn’t mean the whole group, just the ones inclined to “histrionic self-pity and moral self-righteousness.”
Or you can hear it from former Vice President Joe Biden, who said last year, “The younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break. No, no, I have no empathy for it,” before telling them to get more involved in politics.
True, complaining about the wasteful habits and lack of respect that younger generations show their elders is likely as old a habit as human existence itself. Horace did it. So did Geoffrey Chaucer. But millennial-bashing is also a prime example of a particularly nasty tradition: assuming individual behavior is the cause of economic woes, and not the result of them.
If millennials aren’t growing up the way their elders think they should, it is in no small part because they cannot afford to do so. As the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend, millennials are falling behind economic markers set by all generations since the Great Depression, with “less wealth, less property, lower marriage rates and fewer children.” At the same time, the average student-loan balance has skyrocketed in recent years. Child care is now so expensive, it costs more than sending the same child to a public college in more than half the states.
But instead of wrestling with the implications of these financial head winds, many toss blame around instead. You can catch the nastiness at play when you break down some of the critiques. It’s likely that millennials are more likely to live with their parents in adulthood than previous generations because of surging rents and stagnating salaries, not because their helicopter moms are stunting their maturity.
If you are going to critique them for brunching on avocado toast, it’s helpful to remember that the baby boomers - otherwise once known as the “Me” generation and yuppies - turned such things as eating quiche for brunch at a thing called fern bars into a cliche. (There was even a best-selling parody book called “Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche.”)
Or take the reaction to polls showing millennials are critical of capitalism and increasingly likely to take a favorable view of socialism. Common sense says this shouldn’t be that hard to understand - if a system doesn’t work that well for you, chances are you might develop some doubts about it. And if you are really angry about the turn toward socialism, why also condemn millennials for seeking to make a buck as social media influencers?
And let’s not forget the politics of it all. First the millennials were “too quiet,” as the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote in 2007. But when the millennials got mad - well, that wasn’t good enough, either. They didn’t get angry about the right things. When they went to Occupy Wall Street, comedian Adam Carolla complained the protesters were “self-entitled pricks who think the world owes them a living.”
More recently, Stephens implied the social justice warriors of Twitter and elite college campuses would drive people to vote for President Trump unless the Democratic Party leaders called them out. Come on. If someone pulls a lever for Trump, the fact that a bunch of Harvard University students are furious a professor is representing Harvey Weinstein isn’t first - or even 10th - on that voter’s list of reasons why. That’s excuse-making at its worst.
Could millennials do better? Of course! Like many a younger generation, they don’t vote at the rate of those senior to them. The politically correct call-outs can grate on those middle-aged and older, especially because, in the way of the world, they - well, we - are almost always the ones getting found wanting by the young ones.
And I admit, if I were going to pass judgment on the cohort’s protest habits, I’d suggest giving less attention to campus politics, and using that anger and energy to protest student loans, which are causing them to lose out before they even get started, and climate change, which will make their older years much harder and difficult than those of the current generation of middle aged and elderly.
But here’s the thing: I am not a millennial. It’s going to be their world, and they deserve the right to make it as they will. I’ve got faith in them. Avocado toast is a lot better than quiche, after all.

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
HANOVER — Maleah Wenzel, a junior at Dartmouth College, has four different leftovers in her fridge. There’s the free Thai and Indian food from two public events, a chicken bowl from a dining hall and a take-out container from the Class of ’53 Commons, the college’s major all-you-can-eat dining hall.
The leftovers are all a part of how Wenzel, who is from Alaska and is the first person in her family to go to college, manages to stay fed during the term while using her meal plan as frugally as possible.
At Dartmouth, students living on campus pay between $1,835 and $2,085 for a fixed amount of meal swipes and “dining dollars” every term. The leftovers allow Wenzel to get more than one meal out of a meal swipe, and the food from lectures and events allows her to save money on her meal plan.
Although a New York Times analysis of data for the class of 2013 found that about 20% of Dartmouth students come from the top 1% of the income distribution, the college also has a number of students from families on limited incomes, and many of them struggle to find a reliable and nutritious source of food during the term and when staying on campus between semesters.
Dartmouth offers financial aid to almost half of undergraduate students — the full “sticker price” to attend Dartmouth next year will be almost $74,000 — but the aid doesn’t cover all of their costs while in Hanover.
The free food events are essential, said Andrew Sosanya, a junior at Dartmouth who is also a first-generation college student. He estimated that he plans on attending about three events a week, though that becomes difficult when there are stretches of time without any free food events around campus.
Wenzel added that attending so many events, most of which take at least an hour, is especially difficult when she is also juggling her course load and a part-time job.
According to Sosanya, who is from New Jersey, students receive financial aid in their accounts and then choose a meal plan. However, there’s an incentive to choose cheaper meal plans so that that money can be refunded or spent on other expenses.
Wenzel said she considers herself lucky. The scholarships she receives outside of her Dartmouth financial aid allow her to choose a generous meal plan. But that also means trying to strike a balance between buying some food for her friends, who run out of dining dollars by the end of the term, while trying to stay full herself.
It’s an issue that has attracted attention within higher education and at other elite institutions.
According to a recent survey by Temple University, 45% of student respondents from over 100 institutions had been food insecure in the last month. Last December, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started a meal swipe sharing program and two years ago, Columbia University opened a food pantry.
Dartmouth has similar programs, though most of them target the students who stay on campus between semesters, and are spearheaded by different departments and organizations.
One recent initiative is a food shelf for Dartmouth students who need the help, which Dominique Walton, a clinical services coordinator at the college, started after she learned that undergraduate and graduate students were struggling to find food.
The food shelf, which holds canned goods, pasta, peanut butter and other staples, relies on donations and is intentionally located in the basement of Dick’s House, which holds such services as Safety and Security and the infirmary, for privacy, Walton said.
The food shelf opened last November as the Dartmouth Student Assembly happened to be working on a report on food insecurity which recommended just that. Nicole Knape, a senior and the vice president of the student assembly, said the issue of food insecurity had come up over and over while she and the student assembly president Monik Walters had been campaigning.
A few weeks ago, the Dartmouth student assembly announced a program to give out $25 vouchers for food insecure students to use at the Hanover Co-Op Food Stores. Within three hours, all 100 vouchers were claimed.
In particular, low-income students are challenged for food on campus between semesters, when most dining halls are closed and the meal plans are no longer in effect. Many low-income students choose to stay on campus during breaks rather than spend money to travel home.
“I would say people do eat less while they’re here on break. Definitely. That’s just a fact,” said Sosanya.
Hanover restaurants are too expensive to rely on, said sophomore Vi Nguyen, another first-generation student. That leaves either walking to CVS or the Co-Op Food Store, which is also expensive, or taking the bus to Wal-Mart in West Lebanon, she said.
Access to food between semesters received special attention four years ago when the Dartmouth academic schedule changed to include a six-week long winter break. Senior associate dean of student affairs Liz Agosto said since then, a team between the First-Year Enrichment Program and the Office of Pluralism and Leadership has “professionalized” a schedule of provided meals. Now, they aim to provide two free meals a day with groceries on the weekends for students staying in Hanover during the long break, she said, and spent about $35,000 through the two programs.
During this winter’s break, daily meals were sponsored by various departments and the housing communities.
There was also a fixed menu at the Class of ’53 commons and the Skinny Pancake available to students on financial aid.
While Nguyen, who is from Atlanta, said she appreciated the support, the meals quickly became monotonous.
Sosanya said he also appreciated how the meals during break provided a sense of community during a time when few students are on campus, adding that the program has improved since he was a freshman.
However, those with specific nutritional needs are still challenged. Wenzel has a health condition that requires her to have a high calorie and fat diet.
Otherwise, she loses weight rapidly, she said, which is stressful when trying to find certain foods like whole milk during the term or skipping meals during the interim break. The interim meals are good supplements but “just enough” on their own, she said.
“Admittedly, we’re a little constrained. We do what we can to accommodate,” said dean of undergraduate students Brian Reed, who also works with Agosto.
Several students said that having more flexible meal plans would help. Walters and Knape, from the Student Assembly, said they had also met with someone from Dartmouth Dining Services about adopting the swipe-donation program as MIT does but was told it couldn’t be implemented due to technology barriers.
While Agosto and Reed said they primarily work on providing meals over break and have limited control over Dartmouth Dining Services, they said conversations on food security are happening at Dartmouth at a higher level.
Wenzel said in her freshman year in 2016, she had no idea any programming would be available during the winter break and in preparation had started taking cereal and food from ’53 Commons.
She stored vegetables and lunch meat in her discount mini-fridge. It’s a strategy that she doesn’t hesitate to recommend to other students.
“Honestly, if I hadn’t done that I wouldn’t have had food over that break,” she said.

What's Streaming
HISTORICAL ROASTS Stream on Netflix. Consider this new comedy series a history lesson for millennials that swaps the booze in "Drunk History" for scathing roasts. The comic Jeff Ross invites A-list comedians to dress up as historical figures who he then mocks under the made-up title of Roastmaster General of the Union Army. With the exception of Hitler (Gilbert Gottfried), the guests in the hot seat play people that Ross considers heroes, such as Anne Frank, Cleopatra and Muhammad Ali. On the surface, the show is about poking fun. But during an interview with Jimmy Fallon on "The Tonight Show," Ross said there's a little more to it than that: "People have to remember these stories." He also took a jab at Abraham Lincoln: "Yeah, Abe. You should have tried emancipating that mole from your cheek!"
What's on TV
THE HOT ZONE 9 p.m. on National Geographic. This six-part series, based on Richard Preston's 1994 nonfiction thriller, stars Julianna Margulies as Nancy Jaax, a scientist for the United States Army who works in a facility near Washington, D.C. In 1989, Jaax discovers that a strain of Ebola virus -- which, at the time, had a fatality rate of up to 90 percent -- has reached American soil for the first time. Her colleagues (played by Topher Grace and Robert Wisdom) are skeptical at first, but after Nancy and her mentor (Liam Cunningham of "Game of Thrones") reveal the difficult truth, chaos ensues: A potential outbreak looms over the researchers' heads as they spar over the best way to contain it. Airing over three nights, the show has a lasting effect; the story is terrifying mostly because it's true.
MEMORIAL DAY MARATHON 6 a.m. on TCM. Get in the spirit of the holiday by revisiting some classic military films, including the World War II romance "From Here to Eternity" (1953) and the Civil War drama "Glory" (1989).
BIOGRAPHY: CHRIS FARLEY -- ANYTHING FOR A LAUGH 9 p.m. on A&E. Chris Farley's professional career may have been cut short, but the versatile comedian proved unforgettable. Farley, who died in 1997 at 33, came up in the Chicago improv scene before joining "Saturday Night Live" in 1990. He became one of the so-called Bad Boys of "S.N.L." (alongside Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and David Spade) and went on to star in a number of comedies, including "Beverly Hills Ninja." Featuring interviews with celebrities like John Goodman and Kevin Nealon, this new portrait looks back at Farley's memorable performances and his struggle with addiction.
COLIN QUINN: RED STATE BLUE STATE (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. The New York comedian Colin Quinn brings his political Off Broadway show to the small screen in CNN's first comedy special. Writing in The New York Times, Laura Collins-Hughes called the performance "a smart, if sometimes shaggy, monologue that ponders an ideologically riven nation."

Writing for Immigrants, and Eavesdroppers, Too

Texto completo: Before he sold his first novel, "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous," for a hefty advance, Ocean Vuong was writing poetry. Which means he was broke. Which means he was making $ 8 an hour cleaning toilets at a Panera Bread.
If you worked your way to regional manager, you could make 60 grand a year. "That would be considered fancy where I'm from," Vuong says.
It's not clear what he means by where he's from. There's Ho Chi Minh City, where he was born and lived until he immigrated to the U.S. at age 2. Or Hartford, Conn., where he was raised by his mother and grandmother. Or he could simply mean people who didn't grow up with much.
At Brooklyn College, where he studied American literature after dropping out of business school, he bopped around cheap sublets and couches of newfound friends in the poetry community. One of his teachers was the poet and author Ben Lerner.
"It was unclear if Ocean was aware of the immensity of his talent," Lerner says, "but everybody around him was."
As an undergraduate, Vuong worked on what would eventually be collected in "Night Sky With Exit Wounds," published through an open submission competition by Copper Canyon Press. The poems are intensely personal, wrestling with Vuong's understanding of his own race, queerness and memory. For that vulnerability, he won the T.S. Eliot Prize and Whiting Award.
After the accolades, people asked Vuong when he would write his next collection. "For what?" Vuong would say. "There's nothing left." The novel that would become "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" started as an experiment, one Vuong never set out to finish. (It shares a title with one of the poems in "Night Sky.")
When he shopped the new book around to publishers, it surprised some editors, including one who admitted to never thinking about Vietnamese nail-salon workers also dining at their workplaces.
In "On Earth," there's a scene where Vuong's point-of-view stand-in, Little Dog, is served jasmine tea over rice. "True peasant food," his grandmother says. "This is our fast food, Little Dog. This is our McDonald's!" In the novel, being poor is portrayed not by its tragedy but by its rare moments of delight. Whereas poverty is often used in fiction as a plot mechanism, Vuong writes it as a texture, a fact of life.
Envisioning 'a new gaze'
Vuong, 30, lives in a handsome single-story home in Northampton, Mass., where he teaches creative writing at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. When I visit, I am first greeted by his dog, a Shih Tzu-poodle mix named Tofu. We sit at a reclaimed wood dining table, where Vuong has laid out "Beloved," "Gilead," "Moby Dick" and other books that have inspired him. On the wall, there is an LP of Frank Ocean's "Blonde."
Vuong likes the quiet, domestic rhythms of living in Northampton. Before, he was living on Long Island, commuting two-and-a-half hours each way to teach poetry at New York University. He lived among roommates with kids. It was a noisy home, so Vuong would write in his bedroom closet. (As a queer author, he says, "The irony is not lost on me.") It was a refuge: a laptop, lamp and Vuong with his headphones on, likely listening to Frank Ocean.
Throughout the many revisions, the conceit was always clear: the novel would be a letter addressed to Vuong's mother, who is illiterate. It uses a narrative structure called kishōtenketsu, commonly seen in the work of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, a form that refuses to deploy conflict as a means of progressing the story.
"It insists that a narrative structure can survive and thrive on proximity alone," Vuong says. "Proximity builds tension."
There are no villains, no victims, and no clear arcs. His goal: to create "a new gaze, a new attribution to American identity," he says.
As a writer, Vuong believes speaking Vietnamese gives him an advantage. It's a tonal language, which requires the listener to pay attention. He gives an example: má, mả, ma. In Vietnamese, they mean wildly different things: mother, grave, ghost. For him, hearing these distinctions translates to writing with that level of precision.
I ask if he's writing for Vietnamese Americans, and Vuong clarifies it's for young Vietnamese Americans, first and foremost. But what about older Vietnamese, like my parents and grandparents, the ones who have suppressed their firsthand experiences of the war? Vuong says it's hard for him to imagine, since his family can't read -- he could barely read until the age of 16. But he understands. For many Vietnamese refugees, the war is too painful.
Memory is a theme that shows up consistently in the works of recently decorated Vietnamese-American authors: Diana Khoi Nguyen's poetry book "Ghost Of" (a National Book Award finalist), Thi Bui's graphic novel "The Best We Could Do" (an American Book Award winner) and Viet Thanh Nguyen's Pulitzer-winning novel "The Sympathizer," which challenged Americans' reflection of the Vietnam War.
"We have an obligation to remember, especially tragic, complicated pasts," Viet Thanh Nguyen says. "And yet at the same time, we need to move on. We need to forget in order to move on. How do you balance these two things?"
'I don't have to care about my book anymore'
Vuong says his mother doesn't care about the book. I find that hard to believe.
"She's very proud," he says. "She goes to my readings, and because she doesn't understand, she'll face the audience, because she wants to see the audience react. She wants to see older white folks."
There is always the white reader. "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" may not have been written toward that sensibility, but Vuong knows most of his readers will arrive from there.
"In order to read the book, people have to eavesdrop as a secondary audience upon a conversation between two Vietnamese people," he says.
Vuong lives across from a cemetery, where he goes in the morning to perform a Zen Buddhist practice called "death meditation" that he's been practicing since he was 15. Among tombstones, he summons the saddest, grimmest thoughts he can -- deaths of family members, of friends, of Tofu -- as a means of cleansing his thoughts.
Recently, he's not had to extend his imagination much. Five weeks before our meeting in Northampton, Vuong's mother was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. It had spread to the spine.
The doctor explained it to Vuong, who sobbed in the ER. His mother asked him what was going on. She couldn't understand the doctor's English, so Vuong told her in Vietnamese.
"The only silver lining in her diagnosis is that I don't have to care about my book anymore," Vuong says. "My mother has cancer. She's going to die. The novel, publicity, it's all just so small."
He would be content if his entire career is just one collection of poetry and one novel, and he is glad his mother got to see him succeed this much already. After the news of her health, Vuong considered canceling his book tour. He still might. But he is excited to perform his work. To him, the book is fossilized, but aloud, it can have another life.
Vuong says: "To read from the book is a second chance."

Texto completo: Frugality is in my bones.
From attending a community college before public university to living with my wife in a stunning tree house that I built from salvaged materials to driving my 15-year-old Volvo— I’ve always avoided expensive stuff.
Here are my sometimes silly cheapskate tricks I've collected from a long life of adventures, at home and abroad.
At home and work:
A 1/2-inch binder clip beats any wallet. It holds cash, credit cards, and the rest. It’s smaller — takes less pocket space so it’s more comfortable — and costs basically nothing.
New suits and dress shirts? I’ve always gotten the cheapest machine washable available, these days via Amazon. Saving here never stopped me from becoming wealthy. You’ll never get rich via looks — unless it’s Hollywood or by marrying rich.
BBQ warning: Sorry, but you're grilling your burgers wrong, and it could kill you
Gas price guide: As you head out for Memorial Day, watch out for the 10 states where gas prices are highest
I’m a compulsive walker. By visiting a good cobbler before they’re shot, dress shoes last virtually forever. Over the decades, you'll save big by avoiding buying shoes repeatedly. Good cobblers can handle leather and luggage repairs; so my classic briefcase looks five years old but is now over 25.
I haven’t suffered a barber in over 40 years. Cutting your own hair saves money and time, big time. I use scissors and comb, like barbers. But self-cutting kits are easy and cheap online.
Anyone can save hundreds to thousands via energy savers like dropping your thermostat five degrees at night while using an electric blanket. Google: “home energy savers”
Things I never leave home without:
Paper clips can multi-task. When a zipper pull-tab breaks, on pants, suitcase, whatever— the clip threads through the zipper’s hole. Works for months. I’ve never, ever replaced it on one pair of pants. I have large clips permanently zippering my beloved old suitcase. They’re as comfortable as manufacturer’s tabs.
But $15 buys enough zipper repair gear online for permanent fix-its. Paper clips also make temporary fasteners (like a chain link or key chain). With one end straightened they make great pokers—or a hook to pull—when things get stuck in small awkward places. Safety pins make great fasteners, too.
Duct tape fixes almost anything. Stuck inside clothing it patches most rips temporarily—avoiding embarrassment. Learn to sew and carry traveler’s kits. They’re tiny and cheap. These fix-its salvage clothes, otherwise destroyed, and lets you keep truckin’. I learned sewing via my Boy Scout merit badge days. Its paid off endlessly. And one tiny super glue is super useful and indispensable for so many breaks.
Online $3-to-12 buys a foreign made metal nail clipper with a two-inch knife blade hidden inside—which makes it through airport security. A blade is oh-so handy traveling.
Finally, wherever you are:
Google the phrase learning to sleep well anywhere, anytime. It’s an art form. Makes life comfier. Saves money, too. How? Get the very cheapest, clean, safe hotels — and only be in them for sleeping and hygiene. Get out and do stuff. You’re not traveling to stare at fancy, expensive hotel walls. Motel 6? OK, but Motel 5 1/4 will do.
My biggest, best money saver and cheapskate trick? Never get divorced. Commit to learn to fix each other when broken. My boss and I almost killed each other repeatedly when young. Fix it; you’ll be glad later you did.
Pay up for quality where it really counts; like top-tier healthcare. Otherwise, it’s just blowing money down some rat hole. You won’t become a multi-billionaire by saving money. But saving a little along the way never hurts.

Texto completo: Scott Gilmour and Claire McKenzie write musicals together, under the joint moniker Noisemaker. Their latest, "Hi, My Name is Ben," has a main character who makes hardly any noise at all.
"Hi, My Name is Ben" is based on the real-life story of Bernhardt Wichmann III, who lived in a small apartment on East 74th Street in New York City. The complications of a medical operation on his larynx rendered Wichmann mute. He communicated through a notepad and his wide, welcoming smiles. His generous spirit and upbeat attitude made him a beloved figure in the neighborhood and led to him being profiled in the New York Times, which also published a touching obituary when Wichmann died in 2016.
"Claire and I were in New York on a different project," Gilmour says, "and we saw the obituary. "We read about how, in 2015, when Ben had been suffering from cancer, his voice came back. He was able to speak for the final year of his life. He was able to talk to people.
"Immediately, Claire and I thought 'It's a musical'."
Noisemaker's not from around here - Gilmour and McKenzie are Scottish, and "Hi, My Name is Ben" is a co-production between Goodspeed Musicals and Scotland's Dundee Rep, whose artistic director Andrew Panton is directing it.
"A big part of telling this story is wondering if we are the right people to do it. But as an homage to New York, it's nice to have an outsider's perspective. We're starstruck by the city and stuff," McKenzie says.
"We went to East 74th Street. We went to the New York Times and talked to the journalist who'd written about Ben. We met with the local community who knew Ben."
The process of writing "Hi, My Name is Ben" began at the Goodspeed, when Noisemaker was attending the Johnny Mercer Writers Colony, the theater's wintertime residency program for musical theater creators. The show had its first public reading and workshop period at Dundee Rep. Now the show is back at Goodspeed getting a developmental full production at the Norma Terris Theater. "We're really pleased," Gilmour says, "that the first production is at the same place where we wrote the first notes."
"We have heard this show out loud a number of times, but this is the first time with a full American cast. They can tell us 'Some of these words sound rather Scottish.'
"As hard as it is to believe," Gilmour laughs, "musical theater is not a big thing in Scotland. But music and song is a massive part of our heritage. It's quite a recent thing that musical theater has started to emerge in Scotland."
The division of labor for Noisemaker is that Gilmour writes the words and McKenzie composes the music. "We come up with the story, the structure, together, then I leave the room and we get started," McKenzie says. "I write the script and lyrics," Gilmour adds, "and Claire makes them sound very good."
At the Norma Terris, McKenzie's score will be played by a four-piece band that has its own onstage platform. "It's led by strings," the composer says. "It sounds classical, or close to that; Ben liked opera in real life. But there's some folk, jazz, a big band moment."
The 10-person cast includes two actors in the title role. Westport native Adam Kaplan (seen on Connecticut stages as the star of "Kinky Boots" when that tour came to the Shubert and the Waterbury Palace in 2016) plays "Young Ben," who talks and sings, while Joel Rooks, a longtime Broadway and off-Broadway veteran, plays the late-in-life Ben.
"This is the first professional musical I've done," Rooks says. "Mostly my background is straight theater. My friend was working on a reading of this, and told me 'The guy doesn't sing. You should go for it.' I'm a stranger in a strange land here. I have a newfound respect for guys who do musicals."
"What's crazy for Joel," Kaplan says, "is that he has to mouth certain lines, make these gestures - it's choreography."
"I play Ben from high school age into his 30s," Kaplan continues. "Joel brilliantly plays him after he loses his voice." The actors worked up gestures and tics they could both do to convey the same character.
"The things Adam does as Young Ben are things I do as Old Ben," Rooks says.
"It suggests," Kaplan says. "When you first see Young Ben, he's very different from where he ends up. It's important for the audience to get the full effect of seeing this man lose everything."
"The Young Ben," Rooks explains, "has all the trappings of success, but is not happy. Old Ben has nothing of value materially, but he's full of this inner joy."
The show continues to evolve as rehearsals continue. "Things are changing constantly, but not drastically," Rooks says. Kaplan adds "This is what Goodspeed's for. So a show can grow and change. A new musical is a living, breathing thing."
"The way Andrew [Panton, the director] has approached this show, it's beautiful in its simplicity," Kaplan says. "It doesn't rely on special effects. Everyone in the cast, except for Joel, plays multiple characters. What the choreographer, Emily-Jane Boyle, has done so beautifully is show the movement of a city, this sort of brightened pedestrianism. It flows really beautifully, capturing the energy and the pulse of the city."
The two Bens in "Hi, My Name is Ben" find the show's style completely appropriate for the real-life story. "What Ben was able to do as a person was slow things down, give people time to talk and listen," Kaplan says. Rooks agrees: "He relaxed these people in New York City, got them to listen to each other."
"HI, MY NAME IS BEN" by Scott Gilmour and Claire McKenzie, runs through June 9 at the Norma Terris Theatre, 33 North Main St., Chester. Performances are Wednesday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 6:30 p.m. 860-8738668, goodspeed.org.

Trump’s corruption leaks into intel agencies

Texto completo: For
Because this is the Donald Trump era, the news that the president has “repeatedly urged” the Army Corps of Engineers to give a lucrative contract to a GOP donor and frequent Fox News guest is only the second most scandalous story of the day. The most scandalous is this one that reported: “President Trump has granted Attorney General William P. Barr ‘full and complete authority’ to declassify government secrets, issuing a memorandum late Thursday that orders U.S. intelligence agencies to cooperate promptly with Barr’s audit of the investigation into Russia’s election interference in 2016.
“The president’s move gives Barr broad powers to unveil carefully guarded intelligence secrets about the Russia investigation, which the attorney general requested to allow him to quickly carry out his review, according to the memo.”
Barr’s “investigation” is nothing but a propaganda exercise, an effort to provide ballast to the lunatic idea that there should never have been any investigation at all into Russia’s attempts to help Trump get elected president. But we have to be clear about just how shocking this order from Trump is.
The executive order not only gives Barr permission to “declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence” to whatever degree he likes, but also orders the leaders of every intelligence agency to give him whatever he wants. If he wants to declassify something and they object, tough luck for them. The New York Times reports that this is “likely to irk the intelligence community: “One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters, said previously that Mr. Barr wanted to know more about what foreign assets the C.I.A. had in Russia in 2016 and what those informants were telling the agency about how President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election.”
Needless to say, the identity of foreign assets is one of the most sensitive categories of information intelligence agencies hold. If we had a different attorney general, you might say, “Well, surely he’ll exercise the utmost care in what he reveals to the public.” But with virtually every action Barr has taken and statement he has made, he has shown himself to be someone who is only too happy to deceive the public, mislead Congress, go on Fox News to spin on the president’s behalf, and generally act as though the only purpose of his office is to cover up for Trump. The idea that this political hack would conduct any investigation related to this president with any other goal in mind is, at this point, not even worth discussing.
Which is why it’s so important to emphasize that his investigation is a propaganda exercise.
Its purpose is not to discover some unknown truth, because despite what Trump and Barr have said, we know exactly how the Russia investigation began. It began, as the Mueller report states, when Trump aide George Papadopoulos “suggested to a representative of (Australia) that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton,” and the Australians informed the FBI.
Barr is not trying to learn more about whether there was something fishy about that investigation. He’s looking for information that can then be selectively declassified in order to help Trump and undermine his perceived enemies. If that involves compromising sensitive intelligence, he won’t hesitate for a moment.
We can be pretty sure of what’s going to happen. Barr will scour every record he can to learn as much as possible about the Russia investigation. Whenever he comes across something that can be spun to make the FBI or anyone Trump has decided is his enemy look bad, he’ll put it in the “Declassify” pile. Then he’ll release it all to the public and hold a news conference where he suggests that there was a conspiracy to take down Trump. The president will then take to Twitter to proclaim that he was indeed the victim of a vile witch hunt that has at last been exposed. The news media, in possession of only the materials Barr has chosen to give them, will struggle to avoid amplifying and reinforcing Barr’s claims.
In case you were wondering what happens when an infinitely corrupt president decides to use the powers of the federal government for his own self-interest with the help of lackeys he has installed to protect him, this is it. Now just wait until he tells Barr to go after the Democratic nominee for president.

President is putting us into time of chaos

Texto completo: President is putting us into time of chaos Mr. Trump is calling on Americans to use the power of prayer to end violence. I find this quite humorous since as the top official of the United States, he does more to incite violence than anyone else.
The hatred and violence that is erupting in our country, and the inequality in our justice system is appalling. Mr. Trump says he has done more than any other president. Hmmm, he has managed to introduce white nationalism into the White House and is quite vocal about it; has managed to bring our country down in the eyes of our patriotic citizens and our allies; is managing to bring our country back in time rather than going forward and is ignoring all scientific research on climate change because he knows more than any of the scientists.
He has absolutely no interest in saving our planet for future generations. He wants to bypass congress and go to war with Iran. Now he has the audacity to say he wants to bring those that "spied" on his campaign up for treason and sent to jail. This coming from someone who values Putin’s input over his own advisers.
I cannot think of anyone else that has committed so many acts of obstruction of justice and is getting away with it. We want Congress to act, but then how can they when McConnell, Trump and Barr cut them down every time they can, including telling folks to just ignore the subpoenas they receive?
How is this even possible!
I now realize we are under a dictator who wants nothing more than chaos. If we don’t stop this at the polls, prayer will not help. We are living in very frightening times. Every time I see him raise his right hand in a fist all I can think of is Hitler. Scary folks, very scary.
Sandra Alter Hoffman Estates Barr’s curious comments about judges It was interesting to read William Barr’s comments regarding federal judges and some of their rulings in cases where Trump’s commands were blocked. He took umbrage at the fact that a single judge could block the president’s policies.
I guess it never occurred to Mr. Barr that the president could have proposed policies that addressed the concerns of all Americans. And it didn’t seem to occur to Mr. Barr that he took it upon himself to shape public opinion regarding the Mueller investigation without even a second thought as to what it would do to the public’s confidence in the judiciary system.
Mr. Barr should just accept the fact that once all the arguments were made in the cases, the "baby" then belonged to the judges. It was heartening, though, to see that Mr. Barr is very intelligent when he figured out that the 37 blocked attempts since Trump took office were more than one a month.
Tom Frampton Streamwood Commentaries seek to set up Democrats Taking credit when things go well and blaming someone else when things go poorly isn’t new to Donald Trump. It has long been a part of the conservative playbook, long enough to be honed into an art.
Recently the Daily Herald had a conservative columnist, Byron York, who wrote, "Amid good news can Democrats talk down the economy" and on May 14, the paper published a cartoon that shows the Democratic national headquarters talking about hiring the 3.6% unemployed to trash talk the economy.
Putting aside the stupidity of the concept of creating full employment to trash an economy, it is obvious that they are both setting the stage to blame Democrats when the economy turns down.
In Mr. York’s column he quotes an economic reporter, a columnist, an economic adviser, a financial reporter, and two Republican strategists. Nothing from a Democratic politician or official.
Grabbing Mr. York’s lead, the cartoonist feels free to suggest Democratic officials without naming names or indicating a basis for the observation.
There is no doubt that given time, the economy will hit a slump. How fast and how hard will depend on many factors, including fiscal and social policies and legislation. But to suggest that the Democrats are trashing the economy when the Republicans control so much of our government is weak intellectually and lazy artistically.
Mike Vandeleur Bolingbrook Dog-and-pony show The Daily Herald’s May 9 headline "Trump formally blocks report" is quite misleading. According to the New York Times, what was blocked (redacted) from Mueller’s report is: 69% dealing with ongoing investigations, 18% grand jury testimony that cannot legally be released, 8% classified material and 5% that would infringe on personal privacy rights.
The Justice Department offered 12 congressional leaders — party leaders and the heads of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees — and a staff member each the ability to view a version of the Mueller report that only contained redactions of grand jury material, which the Justice Department has argued it is prohibited by law from sharing without a court order.
While no Democrat has taken the opportunity, six Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham have taken up the offer, along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug Collins, Need more proof that Nadler is running a dog-and-pony show?
Joan Baillie Volo Testing teachers I am a retired teacher. I had contact with teachers who should not have been in a classroom. Now the state is looking to eliminate the Basic Skills test for certification. A fourth grader could pass that test. If a person cannot pass a basic skills test, do you want that person teaching your child?
Doris Aussin Lake in the Hills Vigilance needed to control spending With one week left in Springfield’s regular legislative session, the wheels are spinning. Madigan’s supermajority wants new gas, gambling and pot taxes; will increase property taxes through unfunded local school mandates; and will escalate fees. Notwithstanding the May 31 budget deadline, no proposed budget bill exists, because proposed new spending requires billions of new taxes.
The proposed "graduated" income tax amendment to eliminate the Illinois Constitution’s equal tax treatment has an army of tax lobbyists salivating over opportunities to grease connected insiders’ wheels.
Utterly missing from the debate are bipartisan proposals to amend the Illinois Constitution to reform and restructure what drives the structural deficits: the Illinois pension system.
There is some hope — federal reforms improved our state tax base, generating $1.5 billion dollars in extra revenue for this fiscal year. The governor was rightly pressured by stakeholders on both sides of the aisle to abandon his plan to short the teacher, police and firefighter pensions this year. That doesn’t mean he won’t try again next year.
Illinois’ Department of Revenue estimates $800 million more will arrive in the next fiscal year.
I urged fellow legislators to try something new under the dome: control spending, not raise taxes; and encourage natural economic growth to help balance our budget.
We know the way; we just need the will. We must be vigilant to advocate and insist that the state use all newfound revenues to dig Illinois out of its fiscal hole. Please call our office to learn how you can help.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump acknowledged Friday that his consideration of pardons for U.S. service members accused or convicted of war crimes is "a little bit controversial and suggested he would not be making decisions before Memorial Day.
The New York Times reported last week that Trump could issue pardons in some cases around Memorial Day, a holiday meant to remember the United States' war dead.
Speaking to reporters as he prepared to leave the White House en route to Japan, Trump said that he was "looking at a lot of different pardons for a lot of different people.
"Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard, long, Trump said. "You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight, sometimes they get treated very unfairly.
"So we're going to take a look at it, he continued. "I haven't done anything yet. I haven't made any decisions. There's two or three of them right now. It's a little bit controversial.
He added that in cases of those members who've yet to stand trial, "it's very possible that I'll let the trials go on, and I'll make my decision after the trial.
In a tweet last year, Trump said that he would review the case of Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, who faces a murder charge in the death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker.
Trump also directed the Navy to remove Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward Gallagher from a military brig as he faces a murder charge in the death of an Islamic State detainee. Gallagher is now restricted to his base.
The Times reported that other cases believed to be under review include that of a former Blackwater security contractor recently found guilty in the deadly 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis; and that of a group of Marine Corps snipers charged with urinating on the corpses of dead Taliban fighters.
Reports that Trump was considering issuing the pardons on Memorial Day has prompted considerable criticism, including a USA Today editorial that said it would be "blasphemy to do so on "a holiday honoring all that Americans cherish about the sacrifices of those in uniform.

Texto completo: De acuerdo con un nuevo expediente judicial, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera sólo se queja de la falta de tapones para los oídos y de la falta de actividad al aire libre como un truco para escapar de su prisión en Nueva York, dicen los fiscales.
El narcotraficante mexicano de 61 años afirmó a principios de este mes que se había visto obligado a meterse papel higiénico en los oídos para soportar el ruido de la prisión, y que no tenía nada más que una bicicleta de ejercicios para mantener su estado físico.
Sin embargo, los fiscales dicen que el caprichoso condenado nunca se molestó en pedirle a la Oficina de Prisiones tales lujos, que de todos modos se les habrían negado debido a sus medidas de seguridad extremas.
“En este caso, cualquier ejercicio al aire libre sería particularmente problemático para este acusado”, escribe el gobierno federal de Brooklyn, Brian Cogan.
“El acusado ha planeado y ejecutado con éxito escapes complejos de dos instituciones penales de alta seguridad. Como se detalla en el juicio, uno de los escapes del acusado involucró la construcción de un túnel sofisticado y ventilado que se extendió por más de una milla. Ciertamente, una fuga a través de un techo, usando un helicóptero o cualquier otro medio relacionado sería elemental en comparación”.
Incluso citan un informe de The New York Times de 1981 sobre un intento de fuga de la cárcel en el Centro Correccional Metropolitano, en el que las cohortes de un preso secuestraron un helicóptero y lo metieron en el cableado de la prisión. La trama fue frustrada.
En cuanto a los tapones para los oídos, los fiscales dicen que a Guzmán no se los daría de todos modos, ya que están restringidos para evitar que los reclusos los usen como “truco para ignorar, o pretender no escuchar, las órdenes de los guardias”.
Sobre su solicitud de más botellas de agua, los registros de la prisión muestran que ha estado recibiendo seis botellas semanalmente desde abril, destacó New York Post.
Guzmán fue condenado en febrero por varios cargos de narcotráfico y enfrenta la vida tras las rejas cuando sea sentenciado el 25 de junio.

Texto completo: "I don't really like work where I need to read the wall text," the composer David Lang said recently during a visit to the Whitney Museum of American Art.
He was walking through the galleries of the 2019 Whitney Biennial, explaining some of his problems with political art -- mainly that he doesn't want to be told what to think. Mr. Lang much prefers a head-scratcher, something that reveals itself after days or even weeks of reflection, and even then only in part.
This is the effect he's hoping to achieve in his new opera, "prisoner of the state," a morally complex and conflicted retelling of Beethoven's "Fidelio" that has its premiere on June 6 as part of "Music of Conscience," the New York Philharmonic's season-ending series about politically-minded music in times of strife.
After a trip to the Whitney, where Mr. Lang was most attracted to works that were only obliquely political, he took in something more heavy-handed: a performance of Marc Blitzstein's white-hot musical "The Cradle Will Rock," which makes its pro-union message forcefully clear, at Classic Stage Company.
"This piece has all the examples of the good stuff that works, and all the bad stuff," he said with a laugh over coffee. Still, he acknowledged, there is a place and a purpose for both poetic and more overtly ideological approaches to engaging politics in art.
When writing in response to crisis and current events, composers face a tension between abstraction and explication. The questions are the deepest ones an artist can address: How can particular "content" be conjured in sound? What is the best way to persuade an audience? Is persuasion the proper goal of art? What should music be about, anyway?
The Philharmonic's series wrestles with contrasting paths to politics in the concert hall: pure instrumental music, in John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1 (May 30 and June 1), and theatrical, text-based music, in Mr. Lang's "prisoner of the state" (June 6-8.)
Corigliano: Symphony No. 1
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the early 1980s, Mr. Corigliano was on a plane to a rehearsal in Boston when, looking at someone's copy of The New York Times, he noticed a new, alarming word: "GRID," the early name for what became known as AIDS.
"When I got to the rehearsal, I didn't hear a note of what they were doing," Mr. Corigliano recalled in a recent interview. "I could only think: It's all over. We're going to die."
AIDS colored Mr. Corigliano's life for much of that decade, and after. For a long time he avoided taking an H.I.V. test, out of fear of what the results might be. He lost friends, students, colleagues.
So when he was asked in the late '80s to write a large-scale work as part of a residency with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, he ended up composing his first symphony -- a memorial to those who had died from AIDS. It was the classical music world's most high-profile response to the crisis up to that point.
Inspired in part by the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the four-movement work unfolds as musical portraits of Mr. Corigliano's friends, followed by a patchwork tribute assembled from small themes, and an epilogue that offers consolation and serenity through waves meant to evoke, Mr. Corigliano said, an "image of timelessness."
The symphony is dedicated to the pianist Sheldon Shkolnik, who died shortly after its premiere and inspired the first movement. It opens with a jolt, then becomes calmer and more sorrowful, while an offstage piano plays a Leopold Godowsky transcription of an Isaac Albéniz tango, a favorite of Mr. Shkolnik's.
"I would be speaking to Sheldon on the phone, and he was so full of life," Mr. Corigliano said. "But then I'd get off the phone and go back to writing his memorial."
For the quilt-like series of remembrances in the third movement, Mr. Corigliano asked William H. Hoffman, the librettist of his opera "The Ghosts of Versailles," to write brief epitaphs of people who had died. Mr. Corigliano set those to music, then removed the texts. (He later restored them in a separate choral piece, "Of Rage and Remembrance.")
Even without text, Mr. Corigliano's feelings -- frustration, grief, love -- come through clearly. (Some critics have said too clearly.) But he said that he wants the work to have a powerful effect regardless of whether listeners know it was a response to AIDS.
"Knowing the details makes it more personal and focused," Mr. Corigliano said, "but while the material comes in from a place of feeling, the structure doesn't. It's a tragic symphony."
Lang: 'prisoner of the state'
"It would take more chutzpah than I have to say I could improve on anything Beethoven wrote," Mr. Lang said. But "prisoner of the state" does try to revise the story of Beethoven's only opera, "Fidelio," in which a woman disguises herself as a man to rescue her husband, a political prisoner.
"I'm not trying to say my opera supplants it or makes it better," Mr. Lang added, "but it always seemed there was more to the story than 'Here is this political prisoner, and thank God he's married."'
His characters question the implications of their actions and motivations, on both a personal and societal level. The opera's heroine wonders what her obligation might be to save the men who aren't her husband. The villainous Governor sings a seductively persuasive aria about the nature of knowledge and power.
"I had this idea that what the Governor would sing is so beautiful, smart and compelling that it would take two weeks to figure out why you disagree with him," he said. "I want you to wake up in the middle of the night and say, 'Wait, that's why he's wrong."'
Mr. Lang specifically avoided too much specificity, especially anything that would seem to comment directly on the present. "The temptation to rouse everyone to stand up and condemn our current moment -- it not only would be a cheap trick," he said, "but it would ultimately be self-defeating."
Such a direct message wouldn't be Mr. Lang's style, anyway. He prefers conflicted explorations of complicated issues, like patriotism in "the national anthems" and poverty in his Pulitzer Prize-winning oratorio "the little match girl passion."
But he does usually rely on texts in his politically motivated music. "I think what we depend on for meaning is text," Mr. Lang said. "It's hard to think of what a purely political piece that is abstract could be."

Assange case stirs free-speech concerns

Texto completo: Few reporters would willingly compare themselves to Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder arrested in Britain last month, who's accused of recklessly publishing leaked U.S. military documents that endangered sources and American soldiers.
But the sweeping list of charges the Trump administration filed against Assange yesterday reads in part like a Washington reporter's basic job description: count after count of "obtaining" and "disclosing" classified information. Soliciting leaks from the public on his website. And he faces years in prison for each charge.
The move has chilled not only reporters but also lawyers and international free-speech experts, who see an administration that has long been hostile to the press now moving closer to a potential crackdown.
"It's very, very dangerous," said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a media lawyer who represented CNN's Jim Acosta when he was barred from the White House for two weeks last November, among other high-profile cases.
"I'm not a fan of Julian Assange. He does things no responsible news organization would do," Boutrous said. But "if the government decided they want to do this to Julian Assange, they could next week decide to do it to a journalist the government doesn't like."
He is especially worried because President Trump routinely calls the media "the enemy of the people," and wonders aloud about ways to punish his perceived enemies.
Leaders of some of the largest news outlets in the United States have expressed similar fears since the 18-count indictment against Assange was made public Thursday.
"A fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that journalists have the right to publish truthful information, even when a source may have broken the law to provide that information," reads a statement from Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, which has worked with Assange to publish classified material.
"Dating as far back as the Pentagon Papers case and beyond, journalists have been receiving and reporting on information that the government deemed classified. Wrongdoing and abuse of power were exposed. With the new indictment of Julian Assange, the government is advancing a legal argument that places such important work in jeopardy and undermines the very purpose of the First Amendment," Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said in a statement.
Reporters Without Borders, an international group that tracks the repression of journalists, ranks the United States as 48th in the world for press freedom - just below Romania.
The group's interim North American executive director, Sabine Dolan, said charging someone for publishing classified information reminded her of countries near the rock-bottom of the list - particularly Turkey, where her group counts dozens of reporters jailed since 2016.
The Justice Department has long been aware that prosecuting Assange could alarm mainstream reporters - which is one reason the Obama administration did not press the issue while Assange took refuge inside the Ecuadoran Embassy in London for years. Assistant Attorney General John Demers tried to calm those fears Thursday, telling reporters that "Julian Assange is no journalist" - or at least not a responsible one.
This argument is little comfort to Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, who has argued several significant civil liberties cases, and who advised Assange shortly after he took refuge in the embassy.
Like Boutrous, he said the Constitution and prior case law make no distinction between a responsible journalist and an irresponsible one. Whatever is done to Assange could be done to a reporter from the Times, The Post, or even someone writing a small news blog, he said.
"What's so dangerous about this precedent is it lies like a loaded gun for any Justice Department to use against its enemies," Dershowitz said. And even if the espionage charges eventually collapse, he added, the government has signaled a willingness to punish the press not seen since the days of the Pentagon Papers - when the Times and The Post won a Supreme Court fight to publish leaked government reports about the Vietnam War.
"The Nixon administration had exactly the same theory, and they were going to prosecute" the reporters, said Dershowitz. "In the end, cooler heads prevailed."
The former Times reporter who broke the Pentagon Papers story, Neil Sheehan, is now in his 80s. Reached by phone at his home, he said that while he has not been following the Assange case closely, he remembered being accused of endangering national security back in Nixon's days, and did not sound surprised to learn the same arguments are resurfacing.
Sheehan said, "Reporters and editors are going to have to be very courageous in the times to come."

Texto completo: René Samaniego, detective de NYPD que fungía como el principal cómplice en la red de prostitución y apuestas de Ludwig Paz y su esposa dominicana Arelis Peralta, cobraba $500 dólares semanales por el soborno, detalló The New York Times.
Ellos tres ya se han declararon culpables por el caso, que involucraba a más policías y operaciones en al menos ocho burdeles en Brooklyn, Queens y Long Island, en uno de los peores escándalos policiales en los últimos años en Nueva York.
Las autoridades han dicho que Paz se aprovechó de la experiencia y sus contactos profesionales, pues fue detective de NYPD por dos décadas, hasta retirarse en 2010.
¿Cómo fue atrapado? El año pasado la Oficina de Asuntos Internos del Departamento de Policía recibió una denuncia anónima sobre la operación.
En septiembre, la policía arrestó a 50 personas en relación con los burdeles, incluyendo a Paz, tres sargentos, dos detectives y dos oficiales de NYPD.
Otros dos oficiales fueron despojados de sus armas y distintivos y puestos en servicio administrativo. Peralta también fue arrestada y se declaró culpable de ayudar a su esposo a dirigir los burdeles. La pareja tiene dos hijos.
¿Cómo evadieron a la policía durante tantos años? A Paz le avisaban desde NYPD sobre futuras redadas y agentes encubiertos, lo que le permitía reubicar sus operaciones con prontitud.
Además, siendo ex policía, conocía muy bien los detalles sobre los procedimiento en investigaciones de ese tenor. Por ejemplo, sabía que a los agentes encubiertos no se les permite desnudarse en presencia de una prostituta. Entonces, cada vez que uno llegaba a los burdeles, se les exigía que se desvistiera.
Samaniego era detective en Brooklyn South y se declaró culpable de dos cargos de corrupción el 8 de mayo. Ese mismo día, fue despedido del Departamento de Policía.
Las autoridades dijeron que Samaniego ganaba $500 dólares a la semana a cambio de proporcionar información que ayudó a Paz a evadir a la policía, incluyendo descripciones sobre los investigadores encubiertos, su aspecto y vestuario.
Samaniego fue acusado de pasar esta información mientras estaba de servicio, a veces asignado a un equipo de policía que iba a investigar los burdeles.
Paz se unió a NYPD en 1990. Para 2006 estaba divorciado de su primera esposa y vivía con Peralta en una casa unifamiliar en Ozone Park, Queens.
En 2008, tenía préstamos hipotecarios de alto riesgo y debía $690 mil dólares, con un ingreso anual de $120 mil dólares en salario y horas extra. Por ello se declaró en bancarrota. Ese mismo año comenzó su empresa criminal, y en 2010 se retiró de NYPD.
A former NYPD Vice Squad detective and his wife pleaded guilty to corruption Wednesday, eight months after they were arrested along with seven active cops and charged with running a multi-million dollar brothel and gambling operation.https://t.co/S30UuVLofl

A reset on trade with China is necessary but painful

Texto completo: China has taken advantage of its huge, irresistible market. Who wouldn't do anything to sell in a 1.42 billion person consumer market no matter what the conditions, even if U.S. companies have to share trade secrets with "Chinese joint ventures"? If they don't, China will hack their system and get them anyway, so they might as well play the game. Right?
For three decades China has grown economically at astonishing rates, 6.8% many years, becoming the second biggest economy in the world. By 2019 most products we buy are made in China, even familiar domestic brands. Americans have benefited from abundant and cheap products.
We also have exported lots of goods to China.
According to U.S. Department of Commerce trade numbers, the balance of trade in 1985 was balanced — $3.855 billion in U.S. exports to China and $3.861 billion in imports. By 2018 U.S. exports to China had grown to $120.341 billion but imports from China exploded to $539.503 billion — a deficit of $419.162 billion.
Donald Trump was elected in part because large chunks of America were hollowed out, industries lost, jobs gone, wages shriveled, factories abandoned, and towns decayed by the shift of production to Asia. Trump promised to "Make America Great Again."
Now the process of reversing and correcting these trends is under way with President Trump's hard confrontation and tariff barrage. As we can clearly see, the picture is panoramic. It's about more than unfair trade. It's about American power and the future. Whether Trump's strategy is the correct way of rebalancing is a matter of conflicting analysis. It will be fiercely debated in the 2020 elections. But for now, we are in a protracted cold war with Beijing and a massive global trade deficit.
On the Knowledge@Wharton School of Business show, Ian Sheldon, Anderson Chair of Economics at Ohio State, and I agreed that the impact of these issues on the Iowa economy and on the U.S. agriculture sector is deep and long term. All the tariffs "... look like a more permanent tool to shelter American industry, block imports and banish an undesirable trade deficit," Ana Swanson wrote in a New York Times column.
Wishful thinkers, including many farmers, are hoping that the tariffs will end by fall harvest with a new, fair China trade agreement. Maybe soybeans will bounce back to that high of $17.58, where they were on August 27, 2012, instead of $5.86, where they were in 1980. Perhaps corn, less of a China factor, will spike to $8.10, where it peaked July 30, 2012, not below $3.
This seems unlikely. China has redirected its trade to Brazil and other producers. It will take years to rebuild China's hog stock, now decimated by African swine fever, to again make China a major destination of U.S. grains. On the other hand, corn will suffer from the EPA Renewable Fuels biofuel waivers the Trump administration continues to give to the oil industry. That is seriously hitting corn-based ethanol with losses up to 928.6 million bushels not processed for ethanol.
The Democrats currently have no clear alternative proposals to Trump's policies for resolving the long simmering "China dilemma," although most agree that a reset with China is needed. Going back to the status quo of the past 30 years seems unlikely and unwise. Unfortunately, the coming years will be marked by both uncertainty and, I'm afraid, significant pain.

Texto completo: The New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists announced on Monday that ProPublica won two Deadline Club Awards, which recognize the best work produced by journalists and news organizations in the area.
ProPublica’s Charles Ornstein and The New York Times’ Katie Thomas won in the Business Investigative Reporting category for their series Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Crisis. The project uncovered widespread financial conflicts of interest at Memorial Sloan Kettering, an iconic New York institution, and led to a cascade of reforms not just at the hospital but at leading cancer centers and medical journals across the country. Most notably, within days of publishing their story on how Sloan Kettering’s top medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, failed to disclose the millions of dollars he’d received from drug and health care companies, Baselga was forced to resign from the hospital. He also later resigned from the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Right to Fail, an investigation by ProPublica’s Joaquin Sapien and PBS Frontline’s Tom Jennings, won in the Newspaper or Digital Local News Reporting category. The series examined how New York’s ambitious effort to move hundreds of people with mental illness from group homes to their own supported housing apartments has sometimes proven perilous, even deadly. Sapien and Jennings found at least six questionable deaths and identified more than two dozen cases in which people in supported housing were not able to care for themselves, leaving them in unsafe or inhumane living conditions.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump’s Iran policy appears to be careening between diplomacy and belligerence. One day Trump tweets, “I’m sure that Iran will want to talk soon.” The next he warns that “if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.” Confused? Well, there is a method to the madness.
The Trump administration understands that Iran doesn’t want war because Iran knows it will lose. That’s why Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear via a government Twitter account “no war is to happen.”
Trump’s goal is not to start a war. His administration has three objectives: First, restore deterrence and contain Iran’s expansionism across the Middle East. Second, roll back Iran’s gains and force it back within its borders. And third, give Iran’s leaders a clear choice: They can come to the negotiating table and give up their nuclear and missile ambitions -- or their regime can implode, just like the Soviet Union.
When Trump came into office, Iran was on the march across the Middle East -- in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen -- thanks in part to the massive infusions of cash it received from sanctions relief under President Barack Obama’s Iran deal.
Trump did not simply restore sanctions imposed before the deal; he ramped them up to unprecedented levels. The sanctions have already “wiped $10 billion from Iranian revenue since November,” The Washington Post reported, citing administration officials.
This month, the administration tightened the screws even further, eliminating waivers for eight countries that had previously been allowed to continue importing Iranian oil. The goal, according to American officials, is to reduce Iranian oil exports to “zero.” It’s working. Bloomberg News reports that “Iran’s oil shipments tumbled this month after the U.S. ended sanctions waivers. ... So far, not a single ship has been seen leaving Iran’s oil terminals for foreign ports.”
The new sanctions are forcing Tehran to cut funds to its terrorist proxies. According to The Post, “Iran’s ability to finance allies such as Hezbollah has been curtailed,” while in Lebanon, The New York Times reports, “Syrian militiamen paid by Iran have seen their salaries slashed.” On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that “Iran’s proposed defense budget has been reduced by 25 percent and the [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’] proposed budget by about 10 percent.”
Iran is obviously unhappy with this, and U.S. intelligence saw signs that Iran was preparing to respond with attacks on Americans using terrorist proxies -- just as they did in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and by supplying Shiite militias in Iraq with armor-penetrating roadside bombs that killed hundreds of American soldiers.
So the Trump administration delivered a clear message that America will hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, even if they are carried out by surrogates -- and offered a show of force to back those threats -- providing clarity that makes it less likely Iranian leaders will miscalculate.
Sanctions are inflicting major pain. But if the goal is to roll back Iran’s expansionism, then sanctions alone are not enough. We must also aggressively confront Iran throughout the region, building up our allies inflicting defeats on Iran in critical theaters, just as President Ronald Reagan did to the Soviets. A major drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria is incompatible with a “maximum pressure” approach.
Will Iranian leaders come to the table? Far less draconian sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table under Obama. But Trump has rightly paired tougher sanctions with tougher demands. Pompeo has laid out 12 requirements for a deal with Iran -- including an end to support for Middle East terrorist groups and a complete withdrawal from Syria -- that Iran is unlikely to meet.
If they don’t come to the table, then what is our strategy? Does Trump really want to bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime? It’s not clear. If he does, then, as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Frederick W. Kagan points out, this task may be even harder than it was with the Soviet Union. As North Korea has shown, tyrannical regimes can survive even crippling sanctions.
Certainly, the world will be better if Iran is focused on survival rather than expansion and terror. But it will take more than sanctions to leave the Iranian regime on the ash heap of history. That requires a strategy.

Texto completo: Taylor Mac, who has won both a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" and a Guggenheim fellowship, will begin the 2019-2020 season of Portland Ovations with a performance of the widely lauded and unusually ambitious "A 24-Decade History of Popular Music (abridged)" at the State Theatre on Sept. 19.
Aimee Petrin, Portland Ovations' executive and artistic director, announced the season from the stage of Merrill Auditorium on Wednesday, after a street party outside beforehand. Suzanne Nance, soprano and classical music radio host, performed music from the upcoming season, accompanied by pianist George Lopez.
The season begins dramatically with Mac's history of music. In the original version, Mac dedicated an hour to each decade of music since 1776, performing more than 240 songs for 24 hours. A critic for The New York Times called it "one of the great experiences of my life." Mac will perform an abridged version in Portland.
Among other things, Mac is a playwright, actor, singer-songwriter and performance artist. In addition to the prestigious grants, Mac also won the Doris Duke Award in 2016 and was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2017 for the popular-music history piece.
The season focuses on Maine history, acknowledging the bicentennial by offering programs and performances designed to provide historical context and create a sense of place. Many will feature Maine performers.
Boston Camerata will perform a concert of 18th- and 19th-century songs of resistance in "Free America" on Dec. 1. The concert will include songs from Maine's Shaker community.
The season also includes "Burnt-Out Wife" by Maine choreographer and comedian Sara Juli, a co-commission with Space; a live, local presentation of National Public Radio's "From the Top," which will include young Maine musicians; the national Broadway tour of "Chicago" with a Maine orchestra; Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero; mandolin master Avi Avital with harpist Bridget Kibbey; the New York Philharmonic String Quartet; the International Contemporary Ensemble with a program with work by Maine composer Suzanne Farrin; and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra's tribute to the music of Allen Toussaint.

Want culturally aware fashion? Involve more designers of color.

Texto completo: Headwear resembling a Sikh turban. Slip-on shoes that evoke blackface. A hoodie modeled by a young black child that reads “Coolest monkey in the jungle.” Culturally insensitive – and often racist – missteps by fashion brands seem to pop up every few weeks, prompting outraged tweets and company apologies.  
As recently as February, Gucci was embroiled in a controversy over a black turtleneck with a garish red mouth that reminded many people of blackface.
When a friend texted Brandice Daniel a photo of the sweater, she was deeply disappointed. But as founder and CEO of Harlem’s Fashion Row, Ms. Daniel, who is African American, saw a chance for progress. Raised in Memphis, Tennessee, she says lessons from the civil rights movement are often on her mind.
“If history teaches us anything, it is that usually things get worse before it gets better,” says Ms. Daniel. Mulling over the sweater, she thought, “There’s a benefit here.”
Her openness to possibilities was validated by an invitation to attend a meeting alongside other industry influencers of color in Harlem with Marco Bizzarri, Gucci’s chief executive officer. Soon after, Gucci announced a sweeping new diversity initiative. 
Fashion brands are increasingly calling on the expertise of individuals like Ms. Daniel – a veteran resource for designers of color – to help launch diversity initiatives. As the imperative for inclusivity grows, however, the challenge remains for these campaigns to avoid tokenism.
‘I am a Black man before I am a brand’ Daniel “Dapper Dan” Day was one of the first and fiercest voices to call out Gucci about the sweater.
The luxury streetwear pioneer rose to fame in the 1980s for stitching together the worlds of high fashion and hip-hop through his knockoff designs. Gucci was accused of appropriating one of Mr. Day’s iconic jackets in 2017, but now he and Gucci partner on an appointment-only atelier in Harlem – an homage to his original boutique.
“I am a Black man before I am a brand,” he wrote on Instagram in February, announcing Gucci had agreed to meet. “There cannot be inclusivity without accountability.”
Ms. Daniel says Mr. Day, who declined to be interviewed for this story, invited her to join the meeting with Gucci’s top brass in Harlem. After that meeting, Gucci announced a four-pronged diversity initiative that spans from talent acquisition to scholarships.
Prada also announced a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council in February after retracting a keychain that drew ire for resembling blackface imagery. Filmmaker Ava DuVernay along with artist and activist Theaster Gates, who’s partnered with the brand before, will co-lead. Following backlash in 2018, fast fashion retailer H&M, which was responsible for the “coolest monkey” hoodie, created a diversity campaign that includes training in how to avoid unconscious bias.
But despite what some call progress, slip-ups still occur.  
Last week, social media lit up with protests against Gucci and Nordstrom when news surfaced that the “Indy Full Turban,” for which Gucci had been roundly criticized last year at the Milan spring fashion show, was for sale online. Sikhs accused Gucci of culturally appropriating their commonly worn turban, known as a dastaar .
“The turban is not just an accessory to monetize; it’s a religious article of faith that millions of Sikhs view as sacred,” tweeted advocacy organization Sikh Coalition.
Nordstrom apologized last Wednesday and said it would stop carrying the product, tweeting, “It was never our intent to disrespect this religious and cultural symbol.” (Gucci had not commented as of press time.)
Fashion fails get such viral call-outs because a product’s target audience spans well beyond those who can afford to buy it. (The Gucci sweater cost $890.) Millions of people absorb high fashion through magazines and social media “as a kind of iconography of their daily life,” says Rhonda Garelick, a fashion columnist for New York Magazine’s The Cut.
“We all consume fashion whether we buy it or not,” says Ms. Garelick.
Gucci’s Mr. Bizzarri has claimed the offensive sweater wasn’t intentional, Women’s Wear Daily reported, and said the company actually debuted the red-lipped design at a 2018 runway show without incident before this year’s social media call-out.
“We apologized because of this mistake, because of this ignorance,” Mr. Bizzarri told an audience at Parsons School of Design. “We are coming from a different culture. We are Italian. We don’t know all the cultural differences.”
But in a globalized market, critics say, there’s no excuse for such knowledge gaps. Ludovica Cesareo, assistant professor of marketing at Lehigh University, says companies must conduct extensive market research that takes cultural and other issues into account before selling to a region. European brands’ unawareness of some aspects of American culture could point to poor research, or a dearth of employees who could preempt those missteps.
“The fact that social media amplifies each occurrence tenfold should be an even greater warning sign and deterrent, forcing these companies to better understand the market they’re about to enter,” Dr. Cesareo wrote in an email.
Building bridges Ms. Daniel moved from Tennessee to New York in 2005. Dissatisfied by the lack of platforms for designers of color, she created her own two years later. As CEO of Harlem’s Fashion Row (HFR), Ms. Daniel has supported the careers of more than 75 multicultural designers. She’s also partnered with Google and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a prominent trade association.
A decade into Harlem’s Fashion Row, Ms. Daniel yearned for a brand partnership that would validate underrepresented designers and pair them with a label that consumers already trusted.
A call from Nike answered her prayers. Ms. Daniel convened designers Fe Noel, Kimberly Goldson, and Undra Duncan to co-design a women’s athletic shoe with LeBron James.
The sleek white sneaker sold out within minutes.
On Friday, the same team will release another basketball sneaker, this one in yellow.
“All of these projects that I’ve worked on with HFR have just always been a blessing to me,” says Ms. Duncan, the designer behind Undra Celeste New York.
While grateful for the visibility, Ms. Duncan also says she counts on her own hard work to grow her brand. But as industry inequality persists, Ms. Duncan supports the new diversity campaigns as a way to “change the narrative of the black creative.”
“The only thing I am concerned about is if it’s a marketing thing, and then in a year if it blows over, they get their press impressions, and then it’s back to business as usual,” she says.
Skeptics say new hires and trainings are ways for companies to save face without committing to deeper institutional change.
“I think the best way to ensure designers are not tokenized is by hiring designers that are qualified for the role. This is not about hiring designers just because they are black,” but rather because an individual is both qualified and a person of color, says Ms. Daniel.
To find these talents, she says design houses need to look beyond their usual circles. That’s where Harlem’s Fashion Row can help.
“Our goal is to open their pool by providing designers they may have never found using their traditional approach to talent recruitment,” adds Ms. Daniel.
Gatekeepers, meet Gen Z Some fashion-savvy celebrities aren’t waiting around for the industry to change. Pop star Rihanna is launching her own luxury fashion line, called Fenty, later this week. She told The New York Times Style Magazine that she wants to disrupt the high fashion industry by eliminating runway shows and selling her clothing direct to buyers online. 
Aside from celebrities, most designers must work their way up. Fashion observers say investing in the rising generation is vital for improving diversity in the professional pipeline. Both Prada and Gucci campaigns involve entry-level opportunities like scholarships and internships – industry rites of passage. The companies are planning partnerships with universities and colleges around the world.
Critic Ms. Garelick, who teaches fashion studies at Parsons, says fashion schools need gifted students and faculty from diverse backgrounds. Syllabi should also be reviewed with fresh eyes “to see what biases we’re blind to.”
“We need to be as critically minded as we tell our students they should be,” she says.
Ms. Duncan and Ms. Daniel both squeeze in time to mentor young professionals. And for the more established talents she’s helped cultivate, Ms. Daniel says she receives weekly emails from brands asking for help connecting to multicultural designers. It’s a hopeful sign.
“At the end of the day, everyone just wants to be seen and heard.”

Texto completo: Illustration Ann Coulter Syndicated columnist

Contrary to the image of potheads as peaceful stoners, "cannabis-dependent psychotic patients were four times as likely to be violent," according to a study cited by Alex Berenson in his magnificent new book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence." "No other factor was nearly as important. Alcohol use, which was common among the patients, made no difference."
So where are all the marijuana-induced murders?
As Berenson says, they're hiding in plain sight. But until you're told about the cannabis-psychosis link, you don't even notice. Crime reporters don't want to look uncool by asking about the perp's marijuana use, and, inasmuch as being high isn't a legal defense, neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers have an incentive to request that suspects be tested for pot.
At the end of his book, Berenson runs through a slew of depraved murders, inexplicably gruesome — until you find out the perpetrators were high on marijuana. None of these were reported as cannabis-induced homicides.
In 2016, 35-year-old comic book artist and screenwriter Blake Leibel scalped his girlfriend, stripping her skull to the bone, drained her body of blood, then hid out in their West Hollywood condo with her desiccated corpse for more than a week. Only after the girlfriend's mother tricked the police into knocking down the door did they discover the grisly scene.
The girlfriend had complained to her mother that Blake smoked "huge" amounts of marijuana.
In 2017, Dean Lowe, a 32-year-old cannabis dealer in Cornwall, England, beat his girlfriend to death, chopped her body into tiny pieces and made a necklace of her teeth. Like Leibel, Lowe lived with her remains in their apartment for eight days, disposing of her body parts, bit by bit, by flushing them down the toilet and leaving the rest for the garbage collector.
The murder was discovered months later, after Lowe texted a cousin, saying, "Either I'm getting set up or I've murdered (my girlfriend). I had a blackout, hazy memory and woke up with a body on the floor. I am scared so I just got rid."
Lowe had long boasted that he was "the biggest stoner in the world."
In December 2017, William T. Jones Jr. walked up to a complete stranger, 21-year-old Jared Plesec, a Salvation Army volunteer in Cleveland, and shot him in the head. Jones then hysterically raged for a solid four minutes — captured on Facebook Live by a passerby — screaming "F*ck Trump!" and "They're going to kill us all!"
Over the next hour, he rampaged through Cleveland, shooting at people and committing several carjackings before finally being captured by the police.
Jones had never been diagnosed with any mental illness. Blood samples taken after his arrest showed the presence of only one drug: marijuana.
After reading Berenson's book, you'll suddenly start noticing pot-induced murders all over.
Just last week in Ventura County, California, a preliminary hearing was held in the case of Bryn Spejcher, an employed, well-educated 28-year-old with no criminal record or history of mental illness. She stands accused of stabbing her boyfriend to death — after smoking pot for the first time.
On May 28, 2018, police arrived at Chad O'Melia's apartment around 1 a.m. to find Bryn kneeling over his lifeless body. As soon as Bryn saw the deputies, she took the 8-inch serrated knife she was holding and stabbed herself in the neck.
The coroner testified that Chad had been stabbed 108 times, from his head to his knees, cutting his trachea, jugular vein and carotid artery and perforating his heart twice. Bryn's Siberian husky had also been stabbed.
Bryn told police she'd never smoked pot before and wanted to try it, but when she felt nothing, Chad said he'd give her something more "intense." After one puff from the bong, she said she felt like she was dying, ran to the bathroom, then back to Chad and began frantically stabbing him because voices were telling her to keep fighting to stay alive.
A forensic scientist from the crime lab confirmed that no drug other than THC was present in Bryn's blood and no drug other than THC was found in the bong.
The Los Angeles Times has yet to mention this case.
Last Sunday's New York Times magazine featured a story by Wil Hylton about how his cousin tried to murder him for absolutely no reason a few years ago. Hylton blamed toxic masculinity: "the conventions of male identity were toxic ... Masculinity is a religion."
There was a rather more obvious explanation screaming out from his story:
• Hylton's repeated mentions of his cousin's pot smoking, e.g.: "He always wanted to smoke a bowl";
• The cousin was apparently thrown out of the military for selling hashish; and
• The reason his cousin beat Hylton to a bloody pulp in the middle of a child's birthday party was that ... he was hearing voices no one else could hear.
Times readers filled the "Comments" page with indignation at toxic masculinity, but one, a Toronto psychiatrist, wrote: "The article doesn't mention that his cousin's regular marijuana use could be one possible cause of his paranoid hallucinations."
Finally, you may have seen the story about a quintuple-homicide near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, earlier this year. Around 8 a.m. on a Saturday in January, 21-year-old Dakota Theriot is accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend, his girlfriend's father and brother, then driving to his parents' house, where he killed them, too. (His father lived long enough to identify his son as the killer.)
Perhaps Theriot is just a run-of-the-mill schizophrenic. But I happened to notice that his only prior arrests were for: possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana.

Ohio Democrat spells it out: Voters aren’t interested in Trump’s tax returns

Texto completo: House Democrats’ obsession with President Trump’s tax history is a waste of their time, but because that message hasn’t fully sunk in, the New York Times has the smartest story of the day making that exact point one more time.
The story quotes David Betras, who just recently resigned as Mahoning County’s Democratic Party chairman in Youngstown, Ohio:
Mr. Betras, who recently stepped down as Democratic chairman of populous Mahoning County, said that while Democrats in Washington harp on President Trump’s unfitness for office, his taxes and possible impeachment, the president is solidifying blue-collar support through an aggressive trade war with China, even if his tariffs mean economic pain in the short term. “The Democratic Party has lost its voice to speak to people that shower after work and not before work,” he said. “All we’re saying is he won’t turn over his tax returns. He’s saying, ‘I’m fighting China to get you better jobs.’” He added: “They don’t care about his taxes — they just don’t.’’
What could have possibly led Betras to that conclusion?

Perhaps it’s the fact that Trump didn’t release any returns during the 2016 election and still won the White House.
Or perhaps it was Rachel Maddow’s blockbuster scoop two years ago, when she obtained a copy of Trump’s 2005 returns, to find that — shock! — he actually paid a pretty high tax rate!
Or perhaps it was that painfully long New York Times report from the fall finding that Trump’s father avoided paying a lot of taxes and left his kids a lot of money.
Or perhaps it was that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., not too long ago released 10 years worth of his own returns and yet he’s still languishing nearly 20 points behinds Joe Biden in polls for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The issue simply doesn’t matter. Democrats should listen to David Betras.

Texto completo: Whitney Houston fans still mourning the iconic singer's passing may get a chance to see their idol in concert once again.
In a New York Times interview Monday, Houston's estate announced plans for a hologram tour and a posthumous new album, among other potential projects, stemming from the estate's new deal with the music and marketing company Primary Wave Music Publishing.
Houston was found dead Feb. 11, 2012, in a hotel bathtub in Beverly Hills, just hours before music stars began to gather at the hotel for the annual Clive Davis pre-Grammy party.
“Before she passed, there was so much negativity around the name; it wasn’t about the music anymore,” said Pat Houston, the executor of Whitney Houston's estate and the late star's sister-in-law and former manager. “People had forgotten how great she was. They let all the personal things about her life outweigh why they fell in love with her in the first place. ”
The Whitney hologram is already in development, according to the Times story, and the tour would also feature her original band and backup singers, including Gary Houston, her brother and Pat Houston’s husband, along with songs like “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” and “The Greatest Love of All. "
“The hologram has taken precedence over everything,” Pat Houston added.

Houston's estate is also planning a new album, which would likely feature unused tracks from her 1985 self-titled debut, with other potential projects with Primary Wave including a Broadway musical and a Vegas-style showcase.
Larry Mestel, Primary Wave’s founder, said the company would be mindful not to use Houston's image in any commercials or appearances that would not be true to her.
“For Whitney Houston, who had an elegant voice and an elegant way about her, we wouldn’t do a fast-food brand relationship, for example,” he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON— While some college students take the opportunity to study abroad or work in an internship, a group of Purdue University Honors College students have headed to the nation's capital.
Through a two-week Maymester program titled "Future of Political Communication," honors students are given the opportunity to learn while based at the C-SPAN headquarters in Washington, D.C., meeting with national politicians as well as major news outlets.
Constance Doebele, managing director of the Center for C-SPAN Scholarship and Engagement, said the students spent their first week meeting each morning with Brian Lamb, founder and executive chairman of C-SPAN, analyzing the news from major outlets, teaching critical reading and viewing of each outlet's stories.
Leading the course is Robert Browning, a professor in Purdue's College of Political Science, taking the students to view the operations of all three branches of government, as well as facilitating meetings with U.S. Representative. Jim Baird and U.S. Senator Todd Young, Doebele said.
But the peak for students, Doebele said, was the brief meeting they were able to have with Vice President Mike Pence.
Sascha Nixon, a senior in the College of Liberal Arts, said for lack of a better work, it was a very cool experience.
"We were told getting to meet Vice President Pence was a small possibility, but the scheduling wasn't guaranteed, so this was really great," Nixon said.
"Earlier when he was on his way to meet us, they said he was being called to the Oval Office, but he still made the time to come greet us."
Though the brief encounter didn't allow for many questions to Pence, Nixon said they were able to hear through him what receiving the call to offer Pence his current position was like.
"He talked about his family and his kids and those ties to Purdue, which made it a little extra special," she said. "What all I have learned so far just in this past week has helped me see how communication influences politics and the general public, and I have gained that awareness of how that has an effect on me."
James Zampa, a junior in the school of electrical and computer engineering, said meeting Pence was a little jarring at first, taking a different side to politics than the vice president.
"I was a little nervous, and I tried to come up with questions that wouldn't be polarizing, but it was a really great opportunity and was something I truly appreciated," Zampa said. "Despite his political views being different than mine, this trip has made me realize that one side of politics doesn't want to hurt the other. They are just doing what they feel is going to help the country."
In the students' last week, they will visit The New York Times and the National Public Radio Washington bureaus, meet with Robert Costa of the Washington Post and take a trip to the Newseum, Doebele said.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to the New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" prepared by compliance staff members about the Trump and Kushner transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals. Former employees of Deutsche Bank, which has lent billions to the Trump and Kushner companies, told the New York Times that the decision not to report the transactions reflected the bank's indifferent approach toward money laundering laws and its focus on protecting its relationship with important clients.
Representatives for the Trump Organization told the New York Times that the company had no knowledge of any flagged transactions with Deutsche Bank. A representative for Kushner Cos. told the New York Times that any allegations regarding Deutsche Bank and Kushner Cos. that involve money laundering are made up and false.
According to the Times, U.S. and European authorities have punished Deutsche Bank in the past few years for helping clients launder funds and for moving money into countries like Iran in violation of American sanctions.

Texto completo: Los expertos contra el lavado de dinero en Deutsche Bank recomendaron en 2016 y 2017 que las múltiples transacciones de Donald Trump y su yerno, Jared Kushner , se informaran a un funcionario federal sobre delitos financieros.
Las transacciones, algunas de las cuales involucraron a la ya desaparecida Fundación Trump , activaron alertas en un sistema informático diseñado para detectar actividad ilícita, según cinco empleados actuales y antiguos del banco, reportó el The New York Times.
Según el diario neoyorquino, de todas las transacciones involucradas se haría un reporte para la unidad especializada del Departamento del Tesoro , pero dichos análisis nunca fueron enviados.
Partel del personal involucrado en el proceso afirmó que revisó las transacciones, hizo los informes de actividades sospechosas, pero los ejecutivos de Deutsche Bank, no reportaron los actos ocurridos durante los años de campaña, de transición de gobierno y el primer año de la Administración Trump.
Entre las actividades sospechosas se reportan grandes cantidades de en efectivo depositado por entidades o personas extranjeras, una práctica común entre desarrolladores inmobiliarios, como el presidente Trump y el esposo de Ivanka Trump , pero que al mismo tiempo desatan suspicacias sobre lavado de dinero.
El reporte del Times indica que las transacciones del mandatario y su yerno no necesariamente son “actos criminales”, pero la falta de reportes ante el Gobierno desatan todo tipo de dudas, sobre todo porque el presidente Trump se ha negado a dar a conocer sus informes de impuestos.

Texto completo: In school, we're taught that mistakes should be avoided at all costs.
We learn that getting something wrong somehow means that we're wrong as a human beings; that each mistake translates to a lower self-worth score.
These dreaded slip-ups can be so hurtful that we learn to recoil from the very thought of stumbling, much like we avoid the hot stove for a lifetime after burning our hand just once.
Yet hiding from mistakes can be the biggest mistake we can make in our companies and careers.
The truth is, mistakes are neither inherently good nor bad.
Instead of harsh judgment, we should look at setbacks merely as data. In the scientist's lab, mistakes are expected and a necessary step toward progress. Musicians learn to play, and ultimately discover their own voice, through countless blunders and gaffes.
The most celebrated entrepreneurs made their mark on the world not by avoiding missteps, but by embracing them as mission-critical learning moments that eventually enabled their greatness.
We should get classes in mistakes I believe there should be a mandatory class in middle school called "Making Mistakes." The course would cover the beauty of experimentation, how to recover from adversity, the difference between a reckless and a responsible risk.
It would shine a bright light on the often overlooked risk of standing still, showing the trap of mistake avoidance.
Students would learn that the biggest mistake of all is not trying, and playing it safe. They'd come to see that meaningful breakthroughs are only realized through dozens of mistakes and subsequent course-corrections. Kids would build skills around setback recovery, and pivoting obstacles into progress.
Time to change the mistake narrative With the rigidity of traditional schooling as the backdrop, we must change the mistake narrative as leaders if we want to enjoy sustainable success. We must create corporate environments where mistakes are not only tolerated, but required. The message is that if you're not messing up here and there, you're not pushing hard and fast enough.
The ones who never mess up — who never get their shoes dirty or blush from embarrassment — are the ones who reach the end of life filled with regret. On the other hand, those that push the boundaries and need the occasional Band-Aid are the ones that make history.
If you want to fully enjoy success, get comfortable making more mistakes. Mistakes, therefore, are not fatal... they're simple they pathway to discovery.

He's not the same old Howard Stern

Texto completo: Howard Stern speaks, which comes as no surprise to the millions of people who listen to him, and last weekend he was speaking to me, saying, "Twenty years ago I had so much more energy and my narcissism was so strong that I really enjoyed talking about myself. But now I realize that I don't like talking about myself so much and that there is great value in listening to other people."
The most successful and influential radio personality of his generation and arguably in the history of the medium, Stern has been talking into microphones for most of his life, which is now in its 65th year. He shows no signs of shutting up.
So there he was on the telephone from the large Long Island, New York, home he shares with his wife Beth and a large number of cats (more on this later), saying, "I now have a chance and the freedom to explore my own curiosity and allow my guests to be heard."
The next day, he would be talking with correspondent Tracy Smith on "CBS News Sunday Morning," telling her, "Donald Trump asked me to endorse him, but I couldn't."
On Monday, he said to his close friend George Stephanopoulos on "Good Morning America," "George, I never think of you as a sex fiend."
All of this talking -- on television, radio and for print -- is part of the promotional blitz for his third book. "Howard Stern Comes Again" (Simon & Schuster),
published earlier this week, is a gathering of 50-some lengthy and dozens of shorter portions of the hundreds of interviews he has conducted on his radio shows.
A lot of the media attention has focused on the president of the United States, whose interviews with Stern from 1995 to 2015 pepper the book in 11 short "And Now a Word from Our President ..." chapters.
Trump is so prominent because, as Stern says, "Donald is one of the best radio guests ever. Why? Because he says whatever pops into his head."
That's not exactly news. But vastly more interesting, entertaining, self-revelatory, shocking, honest, provocative, surprising and sometimes sad is what comes out of the mouths of the others in the book, a vast panorama of famous and talented people such as Bradley Cooper, Billy Joel, Ringo Starr, Sharon Osbourne, Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson, Barbara Walters, Tina Fey, Robert Downey Jr., Kid Rock, Lady Gaga, Rachel Maddow, Hugh Hefner, Paul McCartney, Courtney Love, Bill Murray, Madonna, Amy Schumer, Harvey Weinstein ... This list is long.
"Some people I didn't even remember interviewing, let alone remember what was said," said Stern. "But in rereading the transcripts I saw a lot of wisdom and humor that I had missed."
The book was born a couple of years ago when S&S's Jonathan Karp presented Stern with a bound copy of a finished book, saying, "We want a book of your best interviews and we took the liberty of putting it together. ... You don't have to do a thing."
Stern was flattered but soon realized that "what was collected weren't even my favorite interviews." So he gathered and edited those that were his favorites. He wrote lively introductions for each interview. He also composed an introduction that is detailed and charming, autobiographical but also self-reflectively honest.
"And that," said Stern, "is why it took two years to finish the book."
Stern and I have talked before, a long time ago.
In 1993, I spent time at his Manhattan studios and attended a wild party for his first book, "Private Parts," which was to become the fastest-selling one in Simon & Schuster's long history. It was 446 pages in which Stern wrote of his sexual habits; skewered those he considered phonies (Oprah and Johnny Carson among them); praised those he admires (Bob Hope, Richard Simmons, Sylvester Stallone and Dick Cavett); and chronicled his career, family life and world view.
At the time, he told me that writing the book was "the hardest thing I've ever done. My editor wound up moving into the house on weekends to help me pull it together. To a degree, [the book's success] might have something to do with a backlash against political correctness."
Stern's morning radio show was No. 1 in New York and syndicated to 15 other markets, reaching an estimated 3 million listeners daily. (His Chicago radio experiences were short and bitter).
He was riding high, assailed by some, adored by others and fined lavishly by the FCC for various on-air transgressions.
I next talked to him in 1995, in New York again for events surrounding the publication of his second book, "Miss America" (Simon & Schuster), which was riding atop the New York Times bestseller list with 1.4 million copies in print. It was, much like his first book, a compendium of sexual fantasies, personal stories, transcripts from the radio show, hundreds of photos and biting examinations of American celebrities, done up in varying typographic styles.
Sitting in his cozy office, he said, "I don't know why I touch base with my audience. I guess that it's because I'm honest, brutally honest. I appeal to the cynic in all of us."
Some saw his four hours on air every weekday morning as threat to the nation's morality, his radio show a dangerous feast of crude, racist, sexist and untoward comments; to others he was an often-hilarious voice. Deep thinkers deemed him a new Lenny Bruce, pushing the bounds of what some consider good taste by frankly exploring life's conventions, problems and obsessions.
I asked, "What is the one thing you have in mind when you sit behind the microphone?"
"To entertain," he said.
Since last we talked, a lot has happened to Stern.
Where to start?
Well, as his lengthy marriage to college sweetheart Alison Berns and the mother of their three now-grown daughters began to disintegrate in the late 1990s, he began seeing a psychotherapist, eventually visiting four days a week. The pair divorced amicably in 2001, and in 2008 he married longtime girlfriend Beth Ostrosky, about whom he writes in this book: "We've been together for nineteen years, and every day I thank God she wanted to be with me. ... I call her 'Sweet Love' ... Howard Stern, me -- I call my wife 'Sweet Love.' She is a saint. Mother Teresa ... well, like Mother Teresa in a bikini."
Well, in 2005 he left terrestrial radio for Sirius XM, the then-new subscription-based satellite radio service. He signed a five-year deal worth $500 million. There are now two live channels, Howard 100 and Howard 102, as well as an new app featuring his interviews. His latest contract will expire in 2020.
Well, his being a judge on NBC's "America's Got Talent" from 2012 to 2015. The job paid $15 million a season but, Stern writes, "My principal motivation for joining the show was to shift the American public's perception of me. In just one summer, I went from being America's nightmare to being Santa Claus."
Well, in 2017 he was operated on for what doctors suspected was cancer. It wasn't, but this experience gave him a hard taste of his own mortality. As he writes, "As you start to get older and your body begins to break down, it does get you thinking about your legacy, what you'll leave behind, what you're proud of."
The cumulative effects of these events has been transformative.
"The hard-ass pose I've tried to maintain just doesn't work for me anymore," he writes. "It was a safe world but a lonely one -- a kind of prison."
His first two books are not on the shelves of any of the homes he owns (yes, more than one).
"It's like looking at old photographs -- I don't like the way I looked," he said. "I don't listen to myself on old radio shows. I don't like the way my voice sounds.
"I almost don't recognize myself in the previous book. I am not proud of them, but I love this new book so much."
It is, on a number of levels, a terrific book. Only two of its interviews (one with Trump and another with Ozzy Osbourne) are from the pre-Sirius era, when his obsession with ratings combined with his self-absorption "didn't lend itself to doing serious interviews."
They are, as you will read, serious now. He deeply researches all of his guests and he is able to get honest emotions and genuine insights from most of them. Yes, his radio shows can still dip into tawdry territory and he remains wildly funny and provocative. His interviews sparkle.
There is a great freedom in being able to talk for an hour or more with no commercial interruptions, and he has come to realize that interviews are not inquisitions intended merely for a saucy soundbite or "gotcha" moment. At their best, interviews are conversations.
On the phone last weekend, Stern talked a bit about Trump; mentioned that he regrets long-ago interviews with Gilda Radner and Robin Williams; spoke of his deep affection and respect for his radio sidekick Robin Quivers who, "more than anyone is my courage on the air"; said that his interview with Conan O'Brien is the best he's ever done; and talked about cats.
His wife is an author and animal-rights activist. Over the last six years, the couple has opened their homes to nearly 1,000 foster cats and found families to adopt each.
"This has really been a passion and pleasure for my wife," he said. "We have fostered so many cats here in our house and I have gotten way, way into it."
You can often see and hear Howard talking to cats on his wife's Instagram feeds (@bethostern and@bethstern). Earlier this week she posted on the latter a photo of a cute cat named Yoda, paws resting on a photo of Howard in the New York Times magazine.
This was the caption: "Yoda Stern is so proud of his dad."

Harvard sends wrong message in removing professor

Texto completo: Last week, Harvard University sent the message to its students — and the world — that administrators at the prestigious university are either ignorant of, or care nothing about, one of the most fundamental principles in our entire criminal justice system: the constitutional right of every person accused of a crime, no matter how horrible the allegation, to be represented by a criminal defense lawyer.
The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that right, which is as basic and bedrock a principle as the presumption of innocence and due process. At least, it is supposed to be.
Ronald Sullivan is a professor at Harvard Law School and a highly sought-after criminal defense lawyer. Sullivan has helped to free prisoners who were wrongfully convicted. Sullivan was also, for a decade, the faculty dean of Winthrop House, a dormitory at Harvard. As faculty dean of Winthrop House, Sullivan was tasked with assisting students as a counselor, adviser and in a variety of other supervisory roles.
But when student activists learned that Sullivan was going to be one of the lawyers on the defense team representing Harvey Weinstein, those students immediately went after Sullivan, with the obvious goal of getting Harvard University to remove him as faculty dean.
Some student activists claimed Sullivan made them feel "unsafe" because he was representing Weinstein. Other students said Sullivan's choice to represent Weinstein was "trauma-inducing."
What crime did Sullivan commit? Well, none. Sullivan was actually fulfilling a role the Constitution enshrines for everyone — no matter whether the person is poor or rich, as in the case of Harvey Weinstein. As a former public defender, Sullivan is well aware of the importance of representing the poor.
Weinstein is, without question, one of the most hated figures of our time. Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women and, in some cases, sexual assault. He is emblematic of the #MeToo movement.
Although Weinstein is supposed to be presumed innocent — another bedrock principle of our system many people seem far too willing to forget or ignore — if Weinstein is ultimately convicted of sexual assault, then he will rightfully be scorned.
But based upon the reactions of some of our country's supposedly "best and brightest" Harvard students, one might think Sullivan had committed the crimes his client, Harvey Weinstein, is accused of committing.
Harvard student activists demonstrated against Sullivan, carrying signs that read "Remove Sullivan" and "#MeToo." Vandals spray-painted the doors of Winthrop House, with messages such as, "Down W Sullivan!," "Our rage is self-defense," "Whose side are you on?" and "Silence is violence."
According to the New York Times, a student named Danu Mudannayake who supported the removal of Sullivan, wrote, "Do you really want to one day accept your diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is O.K. to defend such a prominent figure at the center of the #MeToo movement?"
Although the student protesters at Harvard are mostly adults, they are young. Perhaps one could chalk up their ignorance of the Constitution to youthful ignorance. We can hope the students will one day learn it is just as important that the most unpopular people accused of the most heinous crimes get zealous representation as anyone else.
But what is inexcusable, and frankly, embarrassing, is the way that the Harvard University administrators caved to the pressure this week when it was announced that Sullivan would no longer serve as faculty dean.
The dean of Harvard College, in an email to students in February, said that she "take[s] seriously the concerns that have been raised from members of the College community regarding the impact of Professor Sullivan's choice to serve as counsel for Harvey Weinstein on the House Community that he is responsible for leading as faculty dean."
It would be interesting to ask the Harvard administrators how they feel about Abraham Lincoln, who was once a criminal defense lawyer and represented people accused of all kinds of crimes, including murder. What if Lincoln were a Harvard faculty member and made students feel "unsafe" because he chose to represent an accused murderer?
Or what about John Adams? Adams was our nation's second president and helped write the Declaration of Independence. But before that, Adams was a criminal defense lawyer who represented British soldiers accused of murdering Bostonians in the "Boston Massacre." At the time, the accused British soldiers were as unpopular and as reviled as any terrorist group in existence today. But Adams wrote that his vigorous defense of the British soldiers was "one of the best Pieces of Service I ever rendered my Country."
The administrators at Harvard University have done a great disservice to their students. By capitulating to the demands of the misguided student activists, Harvard has acquiesced to the ignorant and dangerous position that some people are accused of such a horrible crime that they not only do not deserve the presumption of innocence, but their lawyers should be attacked and destroyed as well.

Fessier talks on 40-year career

Texto completo: On June 3, arts and culture reporter Bruce Fessier will write his final column.
After 40 years at The Desert Sun, he will retire with a prolific legacy, leaving an indelible mark on this paper, and the way we've covered arts and entertainment. Bruce made a guest appearance on iHub Radio's "Coffee with Dan McGrath" Tuesday to chat about his career.
When McGrath asked him if he imagined he'd be at The Desert Sun for 40 years, Bruce replied, "I thought maybe months."
The pair discussed Frank Sinatra, life in the desert and Bruce's four decades at the paper, as well as the Bruce Fessier Journalism Internship Fund at College of the Desert. Contributions to this fund will enable College of the Desert students to participate in paid internships at The Desert Sun.
"It's a nice legacy to have to be able to perpetuate journalism in the Coachella Valley," Bruce said.
The public is invited to join in the celebration of Bruce's retirement at an open house May 28 at The Desert Sun.
The event will feature a live interview with Bruce by New York Times best-selling author and Coachella Valley local Tod Goldberg, as well as visual displays of Bruce's work and the celebrities and events he's covered, and a chance to meet the man who has seen and covered it all, from mobsters to Hollywood stars to events and festivals celebrating music, movies and desert culture.
An excerpt of the iHub Radio interview is below, but you can listen to the full piece on ihubradio.com.
DAN MCGRATH: Wow, what a career. Just reflect a little bit and then we'll get in to the particulars.
BRUCE FESSIER: It's just been a journey that has been rather unexpected, actually. I mean I didn't set out to work at The Desert Sun for more than a year. They bribed me with this job as entertainment editor and I thought, "Well that would be kind of fun."
I was wined and dined that first year. I had PR people who were taking me out. I had one PR person who took me out to dinner who says, "We're going to go to Don the Beachcomber," this is where Frank Sinatra hangs out, and we got there and there was Frank Sinatra.
That was my first exposure to old Palm Springs. I mean Frank Sinatra really did hang out there. There really were a lot of celebrities walking down the streets.
You've covered so many (films) and the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
I was on the original film festival committee with Sonny Bono which was really kind of the beginning of my second career as sort of a steward of the arts around here. I was really surprised. Sonny came to my editor, who was Jim Lycett at that time, and asked if I could help him on this founding committee for a film festival. My job is report on film festivals, to serve as a watchdog and my editor said "I think it would be a good idea if you did that."
In the articles that have been written about your retirement, they say that Bruce has covered everything from Sinatra, Sonny Bono and mobsters in the desert. Talk about that a little bit.
Palm Springs was like a mob vacation home. So, I would encounter these guys. When I was growing up, my hero was a Los Angeles Times sports columnist named Jim Murray. Do you remember Jim Murray?
Sure.
He was the best sportswriter in the country, he won awards every year, and he had a home out at Monterey Country Club. There was a mobster who was one of Sinatra's boys, and they used to call me the "Tennyson of the Typewriter." They put nicknames on everybody. So, he decided he was going to introduce me to Jim Murray. Jim Murray had actually written a column about him, calling him, oh what was the phrase, I can't remember the exact phrase he used, but basically a mobster type.
Jim Murray knew this guy and everybody knew mobsters out here at that time. I didn't meet him immediately but once you become engrained in the community, they're there. I would be telling stories about these guys that I met and Greg Burton, our executive editor at the time, was fascinated by that. He said you've gotta write about this, and I go "Mm not sure if I really wanna do that."
Yeah, right.
"It's still a risk out here." But he eventually gave me an offer I couldn't refuse, as they say. He gave me six months to work on this story, which, for me, no one had ever given me that much time to work on a story. So, we did this five-part series on "Gangsters in Paradise."
I remember that, yeah.
And it was a lot of fun. It was really terrific, and I gotta say that it's turned into not something that people are afraid of anymore. It's pop culture. I have people coming out of the woodwork wanting to be involved in that story. People saying, "My uncle was Meyer Lansky!"
What are you going to miss most about being there all those years?
The people that I work with, that is what I'm going to miss. Kristin Scharkey, Kate Franco. And it's not just this generation of journalists. But every cycle, we get these people who are really committed to their jobs, and they're creative people, so they're fun people. We're dedicated to doing good work and serving the community, and at the same time we're working our butts off, we have this gallows humor and it's like, "Kill me now, I can't make my deadline."
It's just so much fun, that's what I'm going to miss, is just the camaraderie.

Texto completo: Chicago native Barry Gifford began writing at age 11 – partly because his childhood (mostly spent living in hotels around the country, including the old Heidelberg in Jackson) offered up a constant cast of "characters" with their own endless stories to tell.
His long career has included more than 40 works of everything from poetry to fiction, nonfiction and screenplays – in addition to journalistic writing.
Gifford's latest pair of readers include cozy "reruns" of familiar stories that have been reformatted to make it easier for old and new fans to binge-read some of his best work at a relaxed pace.
"Southern Nights" offers up a Southern Gothic trilogy while "Sailor and Lula: Expanded Edition" places all eight installments of this couple's romance and adventures in one laid-back volume.
"My sense of narrative really came from watching late night black and white films on television and growing up in hotels, mostly among adults," Gifford said.
"I was able to listen to all of their stories, make up my own and absorb a variety of dialects. Moving around added to the mix. Being in the company of my father's friends, most of whom had dubious occupations, served to supply the intrigue."
His works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry have appeared in many publications, including The New Yorker, Esquire, La Nouvelle Revue Française, El País, La Repubblica, Rolling Stone, Film Comment, El Universal and the New York Times. He has received awards from PEN, the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Library Association, the Writers Guild of America, and the Christopher Isherwood Foundation.
His film credits include "Wild at Heart," "Perdita Durango," "Lost Highway," "City of Ghosts," "Ball Lightning" and "The Phantom Father." He has also written librettos for operas composed by Toru Takemitsu, Ichiro Nodaira and Olga Neuwirth.
Today Gifford lives in California.
Tell me about your dichotomous growing-up years and how this has influenced your writing through the decades.
I was born in Chicago and moved to Key West, Florida, with my mother before I was a year old. She had health problems and was advised to live in milder climate. My father kept an apartment in the Hotel Nacional in Havana, so we visited him there.
Later I spent time in Tampa with an uncle who lived there; then my mother, after she divorced my father, had boyfriends in New Orleans and Jackson, so we spent time there and in Chicago, where I went to high school.
We lived mostly in hotels, including the old Heidelberg Hotel in Jackson.
Your recently released "Southern Nights" trilogy is a package of your Southern Gothic novels "Night People," "Arise and Walk" and "Baby Cat-Face" – packed with humor and drama. When were each of these novels originally published, and how do their stories still apply to American culture today?
The "Southern Nights" trilogy was published as separate novels during the 1990s. They deal in an often satirical but deadly serious way with racism and fundamentalist religion. They're tough, funny, and often violent, just like America.
"Sailor and Lula: Expanded Edition" is your newest release and contains every Sailor and Lula novel in the collection, including the eighth and last one, "The Up-Down." How can you explain the enduring likability of these characters, despite their flaws, among your readers?
Sailor and Lula have been described as the Romeo and Juliet of the Deep South. I hope people keep reading about them as long as they keep reading Shakespeare.
You've had a long and incredibly successful career as a writer in several different genres and have developed a loyal following. What do you think has continued to draw readers to your work?
I write in different forms about what interests me and never talk down to the reader. I like to think that, once in a while, I come close to telling the truth.
What can readers expect to see in future works?
It's possible that Sailor and Lula may be appearing soon in a TV series, with which I may have something to do. And I've got a novel-in-progress about Cassie Angola, a young African-American woman who appears as a little girl in the last of the Sailor and Lula novels, "The Up-Down." Ask me this question again after I finish it!
I see that your current book tour includes just a handful of cities. I know you spent some of your childhood in Jackson, but you spent parts of your childhood in lots of places! How did Jackson make that limited list?
I've known (Lemuria Book store owner) John Evans for close to 30 years, and ... for me, he represents the best of Jackson. Lemuria Books is a treasure.
Signing
Barry Gifford will sign at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Lemuria Books in Jackson.

Around the world, backlash against expensive climate change policies

Texto completo: From Alberta to Australia, from Finland to France, and beyond, voters are increasingly showing their displeasure with expensive energy policies imposed by politicians in an inane effort to purportedly fight human-caused climate change.
Skepticism over whether humans are causing dangerous climate change has always been higher in America than in most industrialized countries. As a result, governments in Europe, Canada, and other developed areas are much farther along the energy rationing path, cutting carbon dioxide emissions as required. However, residents in these countries have begun to revolt against the higher energy costs they suffer under due to high taxes on fossil fuels and mandates to use expensive renewable energy.
This is what originally prompted protesters in France to don yellow vests and take to the streets in 2018. They were protesting scheduled increases in fuel taxes, electricity prices, and stricter vehicle emissions controls, which French President Emmanuel Macron had claimed were necessary to meet the country’s greenhouse gas reduction commitments under the Paris climate agreement. After the first four weeks of protest, Macron’s government canceled the climate action plan.
Also in 2018, in part as a reaction against Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s climate policies, global warming skeptic Doug Ford was elected as premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province. Ford announced he would end energy taxes imposed by Ontario’s previous premier and would join Saskatchewan’s premier in a legal fight against Trudeau’s federal carbon dioxide tax.
And in August 2018, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was forced to resign over carbon dioxide restrictions he had planned to meet the country’s Paris climate commitments. His successor announced that new goals of reducing energy prices and improving reliability, not fighting climate change, would be the government’s priority going forward. Subsequently, Australia’s deputy prime minister and environment minister announced the country would continue using coal for electricity and expand coal mining and exports.
But 2018 was just a prelude for the political climate revolt to come.
In mid-March, the Forum for Democracy (FvD), a fledgling political party just three years old, tied for the largest number of seats, 12, in the divided Dutch Senate in the 2019 elections. FvD takes a decidedly skeptical stance on climate change. On the campaign trail, Thierry Baudet, FvD’s leader, said the government should stop funding programs to meet the country’s commitments to international climate change agreements, saying such efforts are driven by “climate change hysteria.”
In Finland, climate change policies became the dominant issue in the April 14 election, as support for climate skepticism suddenly surged. While all the other parties proposed plans to raise energy prices and limit energy use, when all the votes had been counted, the Finns Party, which made the fight against expensive climate policies the central part of its platform, came out the big winner with the second-highest number of seats in Parliament. Just two months prior to the election, polls showed the Finns Party's support hovering below 10%. But after the the party made battling alarmist climate policies its main goal, its popularity soared, delivering it the second-most seats in Finland’s legislature — 39, just one seat behind the Social Democratic Party, with 40 seats. Even the New York Times noted the Finns Party’s electoral surge was based on its expressed climate skepticism.
In Alberta, where the economy declined after Prime Minister Trudeau’s climate policies were enacted, voters on April 16 threw out the reigning Premier Rachel Notley and her New Democratic Party, which supported federal climate policies. The United Conservative Party, headed by newly elected Premier Jason Kenney, took over after vowing to scrap the province’s carbon tax and every other policy in NDP’s climate action plan. As part of that effort, Kenney said he would reverse plans to accelerate the closure of the province’s coal power plants and its cap on emissions from the oil sands. In addition, Kenney says he will challenge the federal government’s climate impositions in court and streamline regulations hampering the province’s critical oil and gas industry and pipeline construction.
As daily headlines become ever more shrill, hyping climate fears based on projections made by unverified climate models, the international public is becoming increasingly wary of the Chicken Little claims of impending climate doom. Voters in developed countries are saying “enough is enough” to high energy prices that punish the most vulnerable but do nothing to control the weather.

These are the service members who could get 'war crimes' pardons from Trump

Texto completo: President Trump started the process to pardon several American military service members who have either been accused of war crimes or have been convicted of war crimes, a new report states.
The New York Times reported he requested immediate preparation of the paperwork needed to pardon Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a group of Marine snipers, and a Blackwater defense contractor.
Gallagher is accused of beheading a suspected terrorist and shooting civilians, while Golsteyn is accused of killing an armed Afghan. The group of snipers were charged after video emerged of them urinating on dead Taliban soliders.
The Blackwater defense contractor was convicted for his role in the 2007 shooting of unarmed Iraqis.
The White House asked for the information on the cases on Friday from the Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney, who in turn informed the respective military branches.
The possible upcoming pardons could come before or on Memorial Day. Trump pardoned Lt. Michael Behenna last week after he had served five years of a murder sentence for shooting an Iraqi roadside bomb suspect.
Another service member whose case is similar to Behenna's could also see a pardon. A military advocate group that helped defend Army. Sgt. Derrick Miller, who was convicted of premeditated murder in 2011 for killing an unarmed man during an Afghan battlefield interrogation in 2010, is pushing for a pardon.
Fox News host Sean Hannity has advocated for the release of Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who ordered his platoon to shoot at three men riding a motorcycle toward them while they were on patrol, killing two. Lorance was convicted of unpremeditated murder and sentenced to 19 years at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
In 2018, Trump also pardoned U.S. Navy sailor Kristian Saucier after he was convicted of taking pictures of sensitive areas within a nuclear submarine. Pardons for military personnel convicted of violent crimes have historically been rarely given.

What if Trump loses in 2020, but doesn't leave?

Texto completo: In a historic change of mind, President Donald Trump has found a reason to support reparations - for President Donald Trump.
The president retweeted this bright and, oh, yes, unconstitutional idea on Sunday after Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, proposed that Trump deserved an additional two years in office to make up for the time allegedly lost in the Russia investigation.
I have a counterproposal. I think the president should leave office two years early - as in, right now - to make up for the "executive time" that he reportedly has spent golfing, visiting his personal properties and watching "Fox & Friends" instead of keeping up with his daily intelligence briefings.
Just kidding. Falwell was just kidding, too, I am told. Trump? I'm not so sure.
"Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President," Trump tweeted Sunday, "including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back....
"The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Could this be a sign that the president doesn't expect to win four more years in office by the normal constitutional route?
As Trump's and Falwell's Jtweets went out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was warning in a weekend New York Times interview that, even if the president fails to be re-elected in 2020, he won't want to leave - especially if he loses by a narrow margin.
The party needs to "inoculate against that," she said, by not only winning but winning "big" enough to convince Trump to step aside voluntarily, as every other sitting president has.
Pelosi didn't sound like she was kidding at all. Similar fears that Trump would "poison the public mind" and "challenge each of the races," motivated her in last year's midterms, she said. In the end, Democrats picked up a net gain of 40 seats, their biggest gain in the House since the historic post-Watergate wave election of 1974.
She's not the first to speculate about a Trump who won't go away. When comedian Bill Maher floated that notion last year on his HBO program, not as a joke but as a serious concern, my personal reaction was, hey, don't give him any ideas.
Yet Trump has said more than a little to feed the notion himself. In his final 2016 presidential debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than a month before Election Day, Trump promised to "totally accept" the election results, "if I win."
Since he did win the Electoral College, Trump's threat went away. But he went on to complain anyway, tweeting blame on some sort of a ghost-voting conspiracy for allegedly robbing him of the popular vote, "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."
"In many places the same person in California votes many times," Trump said at the official White House event in West Virginia on tax cuts in April 2018. "They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory." Again, he offered no evidence to back up that claim.
Speaking at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee in April, Trump cast suspicion on the close elections that Democrats won in 2018. "There's something going on," he said, telling his audience that they needed to "be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?" Again, he offered no proof to back that up.
And, requiring no proof are the jokes Trump has casually dropped about somehow extending his constitutional term in office. "Well, this is really beautiful," he said, accepting a gift from the Wounded Warrior Project in April. "This will find a permanent place, at least for sixyears, in the Oval Office. Is that OK? I was going to joke, General, and say at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam if I said that, so we'll say six."
Right. I, too, have an award for the president. It's a copy of a fine old song by Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks: "How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?"
It's got a good beat and he can dance to it.

Texto completo: Headnote 65 YEARS: BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION
65th Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Ed.
Friday is the 65th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, but fights over school segregation, rather than decreasing, are becoming more common. Cities like New York and San Francisco are debating how to assign students to schools in ways that foster classroom diversity, and school secession movements - in which parents seek to form their own, majority-white districts - are accelerating.
A new report from UCLA and Penn State outlines the changes in school segregation since the landmark Supreme Court ruling named after Oliver Brown, a Black father who sued to enroll his daughter, Linda, in an all-white elementary school blocks from their home in Topeka, Kansas.
The court's unanimous 1954 ruling declared separate educational facilities "inherently unequal." But the case is one of several major civil rights rulings, alongside those on voting rights and housing discrimination, that have been substantially weakened by more recent decisions.
Today, the decreasing white share of the public school population across the country may lead some to believe that schools are becoming more integrated. But the reverse is true, according to the report. The percentage of intensely segregated schools, defined as those where less than 10% of the student body is white, tripled between 1988 and 2016, from 6 to 18%.
In "a heightened period of racial conflict in our public life," the report warns, deepening school segregation by race and class "are very high-stakes trends threatening the future."
Liberal states fight severe segregation
White students now account for less than half the nation's public school students, and Latinos are the most deeply segregated racial group in schools, according to the researchers.
While segregation was once most severe in the former states of the Confederacy, in 2016 it was in four liberal states - New York, California, Maryland and Illinois - that Black children were most likely to attend intensely segregated schools. Latinos were most likely to attend intensely segregated schools in California, New York, Texas and New Jersey.
Nationwide, 42% of Latino students and 40% of Black students attended schools where less than 10% of their peers were white in 2016. Those numbers have been rising since 1988.
Statistics like these are no surprise after decades of court rulings that released school districts from desegregation orders, and there is no consensus among education advocates about how to respond. Some are urging broad new public policy efforts to integrate schools, while others call that goal unrealistic and even a distraction from improving the schools that currently enroll large numbers of nonwhite and low-income children.
There were some bright spots, the researchers noted. In the Midwest, the share of Black children attending intensely segregated schools has steadily decreased since 2001.
'Not a Black and white district anymore.'
With a growing population of Latino and Asian schoolchildren, segregation looks a lot different today than it did in the 1950s. Some superintendents and policymakers may believe, "We're not a Black and white district anymore, so we need to move beyond desegregation," said Erica Frankenberg, a professor of education at Penn State and an author of the report.
Instead, she added, they should ask, "What does it mean to desegregate when we have four racial groups, and some of these racial groups also have tremendous variety within them? What does that look like?"
High-poverty, racially segregated schools typically have fewer experienced teachers, advanced courses and extracurricular opportunities. A large body of research shows that nonwhite and low-income students who attend integrated schools perform better academically, and also see long-term benefits such as higher incomes and lower rates of incarceration.
White students who attend more integrated schools are not hurt academically, and may benefit from exposure to classmates who better represent the nation's diversity. In 2016, 48% of public school students were white, 26% were Latino, 15% were Black and 6% were Asian.
According to the new report, the average white student in 2016 attended a school that was 69% white; the average Latino student attended a school that was 55% Latino; the average Black student attended a school that was 47% Black; and the average Asian student attended a school that was 24% Asian.
Persistent segregation in the suburbs
Of particular concern to the researchers were the suburbs of large cities, because demographic change there has been so rapid. Between 2006 and 2016, the proportion of white public school enrollment in those suburbs fell by 10 percentage points, to 47%. That diversity was not reflected in schools.
The typical suburban Black or Latino child attended a school in 2016 that was three-quarters non-white, while the typical suburban white child attended a school that was two-thirds white.
Because so few suburbs, especially outside the South, have a history of purposeful policymaking around school integration, "Doing nothing means accepting resegregation," the report notes.
White children who lived in large cities experienced more diversity, attending schools that were, on average, 55% nonwhite. But even there, white parents were clustering their children in a subset of schools; overall, white students made up only 20% of the students in those districts.
Is integration the best solution?
The authors of the report, Frankenberg, Jongyeon Ee, Jennifer Ayscue and Gary Orfield, suggest several policy remedies, such as using magnet programs and busing to draw students voluntarily to schools outside their neighborhoods and districts. They urge more federal and philanthropic investment in local experiments to increase integration, and they ask schools, particularly those in formerly white-majority suburbs, to diversify their staffs and add programming meant to serve students of color.
Still, given the long history of white resistance to desegregation efforts, and the sense of exclusion some students of color feel in majority-white schools, some education advocates remain skeptical of relying too heavily on integration as a strategy for improving educational outcomes.
"There are two ways to experience school integration policy in America: On paper and in real life," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of 50CAN, an organization that supports charter schools and school choice. The goal, he said, should be to "build schools that people are attracted to, regardless of who goes to them."
He continued, "I think schools are an important place to bring us together. But they are not the only place where the work of integrating society must happen, and in many respects, schools are not equipped to deal with the history of this nation which has separated us in the first place."

U.S. suspends flights to Venezuela

Texto completo: CARACAS, Venezuela - . The United States banned all air transport with Venezuela on Wednesday over security concerns, further isolating the troubled South American nation by severing one of its last links to the world's largest economy.
The Department of Homeland Security said it decided to immediately suspend all commercial and cargo flights between the United States and Venezuela because the country's political crisis threatened the safety of passengers, aircraft and crew.
The decision will be a heavy blow for millions of Venezuelans who rely on donations or remittances from relatives abroad to survive, as the country's crumbling economy has destroyed most of its industry and agriculture and slashed government imports. Many have relied on airline courier services from Miami to obtain scarce medication, spare parts and food.
"This will be a catastrophe for a lot of people," said Feliciano Reyna, head of the health nonprofit Acción Solidaria, which receives medical donations from the United States through air courier services. "This will complicate enormously the transportation of humanitarian aid to the country."
Reyna said he will have to import medicine by sea or through other countries, raising the cost and making it harder for his group to respond to medical emergencies.
The flight ban comes amid tightening economic sanctions by the Trump administration against President Nicolás Maduro, which are aimed at forcing him to cede power in favor of opposition leader Juan Guaidó.
Two opposition representatives and several government officials are in Norway for informal talks aimed at exploring, conditions for negotiations, according to senior opposition and government figures who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meetings were not public. The talks are in the early stages, they said, and may not yield any progress in resolving Venezuela's crisis.
The United States had remained Venezuela's biggest trading partner and cultural compass until the Trump administration and about 50 allied nations recognized Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader this year. Since then, the United States has banned oil trade with Venezuela, which wiped out the bulk of goods exchange between the two countries.
The biggest effect will fall on Venezuela's largest private airline, Avior Airlines, which has operated daily flights to Miami from Caracas and the eastern city of Puerto La Cruz. Mainstream U.S.-based carriers have all stopped flying to Venezuela in recent years because of falling demand, currency controls and security risks.

Texto completo: Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Donald Trump may not have much in common, but they both call the same city home.
They're also not the only 2020 presidential candidates with ties to New York.
Here are seven candidates in the race who have lived, worked or gone to school in New York City.
Bernie Sanders
Sen. Bernie Sanders is a New Yorker at heart, even if he hasn't lived in the city for decades. He was born in Brooklyn, growing up in Midwood with his parents and older brother. He went to New York City public schools, including James Madison High School. Sanders also spent two years at Brooklyn College, but then transferred to Chicago University.
Kirsten Gillibrand
Though Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is from upstate, she worked as an attorney in Manhattan for more than a decade before starting her political career, according to a bio on her website.
As senator, she has represented New York since 2009. She was an adamant proponent of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which passed in 2010 and provides health care and financial aid for first responders and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Andrew Yang
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang went to Columbia Law School in the late 1990s and began his career in New York City. He briefly worked at a corporate law firm, founded an internet startup that failed and worked for a health care startup, he said on his campaign website. He then worked for Manhattan Prep, a test-prep company, and later founded the nonprofit Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates interested in entrepreneurship.
Beto O'Rourke
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke graduated from Columbia University in 1995 and stayed in the city for three years after that. He worked as a live-in nanny on the Upper West Side and later moved to Williamsburg, according to a New York Times article. He also worked at his uncle's tech business, but ultimately decided New York wasn't for him and moved back to Texas.
Marianne Williamson
Self-help guru and author Marianne Williamson lived in New York City in the 1970s after dropping out of college, a Los Angeles Magazine profile of her says. The city is where she first came across "A Course in Miracles," which she would go on to speak about in New York and other cities.
Mike Gravel
Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel went to Columbia University after serving in the Army's Counterintelligence Corps in the 1950s. While he was at Columbia, he drove a cab to make money, according to a 2007 article on Salon.com.
John Delaney
Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney graduated from Columbia University in 1985 before going to law school at Georgetown, his campaign bio says.

Texto completo: Teenagers need melodrama. They always have. It seems its big, sweeping emotions are somehow the only things that can match the high-stakes, hormone-enhanced teenage feelings. Director Ry Russo-Young excels at rendering those emotions with a singular sense of artfulness. In "The Sun is Also a Star," Russo-Young swirls together sun-dappled selfies, luscious skin, urban grittiness and hip-hop beats, the aesthetics perfectly matched to emotion. She creates a heady, knee-buckling mood that nearly conceals the weaknesses in story and performances.
The film is the feature adaptation of Nicola Yoon's second novel. Her first, "Everything, Everything," also went on to success as a movie adaptation, starring Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson in a swoony take on a Bubble Boy story. The sick teen genre is a well of deep potential with its heightened stakes and ticking clock. And in the structural sense, "The Sun is Also a Star" is also a sick teen movie - without sickness. But the stakes are high and the clock is ticking - on a mandatory deportation from the United States.
Yara Shahidi (of "black-ish" and "grown-ish") stars as Natasha, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants but a New Yorker through and through. The day before her family is set to be deported back to Jamaica, she makes a last-ditch attempt to change their fate by pleading their case to an immigration lawyer. She's spotted in Grand Central Station by Daniel ("Riverdale" star Charles Melton), who notices she's staring at the starry ceiling, and he interprets her "Deus Ex Machina" jacket as a sign. Daniel is a poet, a dreamer and a believer in destiny, and he takes off after her. First he saves her from a speeding BMW in Chinatown, then persuades the science-driven Natasha to spend some time doing the "36 Questions" love study from the New York Times. "Give me a day," he says, "and you'll fall in love with me."
Easy for the easy-on-the-eyes Melton to say! Shahidi and Melton both possess an otherworldly kind of beauty, and combined with Russo-Young's lush, rhythmic cinematic style, you could just watch them bop around the city for hours, all shiny hair and plush lips. But then, they open their mouths and the spell is broken. The dialogue (script by Tracy Oliver) just grinds things to a halt, with speeches that are a bit too on the nose, and too-grand declarations of love. Then again, all those things seem so profound and meaningful at that age.
As pretty as Shahidi and Melton are, they just don't share a palpable chemistry. Shahidi is undoubtedly a star, and while Melton is charming and gorgeous with a goofy puppy-dog energy, the more dramatic moments demonstrate the upper limitations of his range. Shahidi's few short scenes with immigration lawyer John Leguizamo are far more riveting.
That's somewhat covered up by Russo-Young's impressive filmmaking. A New York City native, she captures the arresting energy of the city while imbuing the film with a sense of lyricism and grace, as if the streets are sprinkled with magical fairy dust. The world looks the way it feels when you're falling in love, like everything is at its best, and everything makes sense. When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse.

Texto completo: What are we going to do about all the cameras? The question keeps me up at night, in something like terror.
Cameras are the defining technological advance of our age. They are the keys to our smartphones, the eyes of tomorrow's autonomous drones and the FOMO engines that drive Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Pornhub. Cheap, ubiquitous, viral photography has fed social movements like Black Lives Matter, but cameras are already prompting more problems than we know what to do with -- revenge porn, live-streamed terrorism, YouTube reactionaries and other photographic ills.
And cameras aren't done. They keep getting cheaper and -- in ways both amazing and alarming -- they are getting smarter. Advances in computer vision are giving machines the ability to distinguish and track faces, to make guesses about people's behaviors and intentions, and to comprehend and navigate threats in the physical environment. In China, smart cameras sit at the foundation of an all-encompassing surveillance totalitarianism unprecedented in human history. In the West, intelligent cameras are now being sold as cheap solutions to nearly every private and public woe, from catching cheating spouses and package thieves to preventing school shootings and immigration violations. I suspect these and more uses will take off, because in my years of covering tech, I've gleaned one ironclad axiom about society: If you put a camera in it, it will sell.
That's why I worry that we're stumbling dumbly into a surveillance state. And it's why I think the only reasonable thing to do about smart cameras now is to put a stop to them.
[Farhad Manjoo will answer your questions about his column on Friday at 1:30 p.m. Eastern: @fmanjoo ]
This week, San Francisco's board of supervisors voted to ban the use of facial-recognition technology by the city's police and other agencies. Oakland and Berkeley are also considering bans, as is the city of Somerville, Mass. I'm hoping for a cascade. States, cities and the federal government should impose an immediate moratorium on facial recognition, especially its use by law-enforcement agencies. We might still decide, at a later time, to give ourselves over to cameras everywhere. But let's not jump into an all-seeing future without understanding the risks at hand.
What are the risks? Two new reports by Clare Garvie, a researcher who studies facial recognition at Georgetown Law, brought the dangers home for me. In one report -- written with Laura Moy, executive director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology -- Ms. Garvie uncovered municipal contracts indicating that law enforcement agencies in Chicago, Detroit and several other cities are moving quickly, and with little public notice, to install Chinese-style "real time" facial recognition systems.
In Detroit, the researchers discovered that the city signed a $ 1 million deal with DataWorks Plus, a facial recognition vendor, for software that allows for continuous screening of hundreds of private and public cameras set up around the city -- in gas stations, fast-food restaurants, churches, hotels, clinics, addiction treatment centers, affordable-housing apartments and schools. Faces caught by the cameras can be searched against Michigan's driver's license photo database. Researchers also obtained the Detroit Police Department's rules governing how officers can use the system. The rules are broad, allowing police to scan faces "on live or recorded video" for a wide variety of reasons, including to "investigate and/or corroborate tips and leads." In a letter to Ms. Garvie, James E. Craig, Detroit's police chief, disputed any "Orwellian activities," adding that he took "great umbrage" at the suggestion that the police would "violate the rights of law-abiding citizens."
[Facial recognition technology has stoked controversy over the years. Here's a look back.]
I'm less optimistic, and so is Ms. Garvie. "Face recognition gives law enforcement a unique ability that they've never had before," Ms. Garvie told me. "That's the ability to conduct biometric surveillance -- the ability to see not just what is happening on the ground but who is doing it. This has never been possible before. We've never been able to take mass fingerprint scans of a group of people in secret. We've never been able to do that with DNA. Now we can with face scans."
That ability alters how we should think about privacy in public spaces. It has chilling implications for speech and assembly protected by the First Amendment; it means that the police can watch who participates in protests against the police and keep tabs on them afterward.
In fact, this is already happening. In 2015, when protests erupted in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody, the Baltimore County Police Department used facial recognition software to find people in the crowd who had outstanding warrants -- arresting them immediately, in the name of public safety.
But there's another wrinkle in the debate over facial recognition. In a second report, Ms. Garvie found that for all their alleged power, face-scanning systems are being used by the police in a rushed, sloppy way that should call into question their results.
Here's one of the many crazy stories in Ms. Garvie's report: In the spring of 2017, a man was caught on a security camera stealing beer from a CVS store in New York. But the camera didn't get a good shot of the man, and the city's face-scanning system returned no match.
The police, however, were undeterred. A detective in the New York Police Department's facial recognition department thought the man in the pixelated CVS video looked like the actor Woody Harrelson. So the detective went to Google Images, got a picture of the actor and ran his face through the face scanner. That produced a match, and the law made its move. A man was arrested for the crime not because he looked like the guy caught on tape but because Woody Harrelson did.
Devora Kaye, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, told me that the department uses facial recognition merely as an investigative lead and that "further investigation is always needed to develop probable cause to arrest." She added that "the N.Y.P.D. constantly reassesses our existing procedures and in line with that are in the process of reviewing our existent facial recognition protocols."
This sort of sketchy search is routine in the face business. Face-scanning software sold to the police allows for easy editing of input photos. To increase the hits they get on a photo, the police are advised to replace people's mouths, eyes and other facial features with model images pulled from Google. The software also allows for "3D modeling," essentially using computer animation to rotate or otherwise change a face so that it can match a standard mug-shot photo.
In a bizarre twist, some police departments are even pushing the use of facial recognition on forensic sketches: They will search for real people's faces based on artists' renderings of an eyewitness account, a process riddled with the sort of human subjectivity that facial recognition was supposed to obviate.
The most troubling thing about all of this is that there are almost no rules governing its use. "If we were to find out that a fingerprint analyst were drawing in where he thought the missing lines of a fingerprint were, that would be grounds for a mistrial," Ms. Garvie said.
But people are being arrested, charged and convicted based on similar practices in face searches. And because there are no mandates about what defendants and their attorneys must be told about these searches, the police are allowed to act with impunity.
None of this is to say that facial recognition should be banned forever. The technology may have some legitimate uses. But it also poses profound legal and ethical quandaries. What sort of rules should we impose on law enforcement's use of facial recognition? What about on the use of smart cameras by our friends and neighbors, in their cars and doorbells? In short, who has the right to surveil others -- and under what circumstances can you object?
It will take time and careful study to answer these questions. But we have time. There's no need to rush into the unknown. Let's stop using facial recognition immediately, at least until we figure out what is going on.

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City, one of the biggest clubs in soccer and the Premier League champions for two years running, is one step away from a ban on participating in the Champions League after investigators asked for a ruling on whether the team misled European soccer's financial regulators, the sport's governing body in Europe said on Thursday.
UEFA, the governing body, confirmed that Yves Leterme, a former Belgian prime minister who now serves as the chief investigator of the unit charged with overseeing the finances of individual clubs, had referred the case to officials for a ruling.
The move indicates that Leterme believes his investigators have found sufficient evidence to punish Manchester City for misleading UEFA over the source of the club's income.
The New York Times reported on Monday that investigators believe that Manchester City should be banned from the prestigious Champions League for at least a year for their interactions with investigators and licensing authorities looking into whether the club kept within cost control regulations, a policy commonly known as financial fair play.
City responded furiously to the announcement on Thursday, criticizing what it described as "a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed and hostile process" and a decision that "contains mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a lack of due process."
The club said it had provided "a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence" to Leterme and his team, and, as it has throughout the investigation, reiterated that the "accusation of financial irregularities remains entirely false." The fact that the investigators' conclusions had been, in the club's words, "leaked" to The New York Times, was "indicative of the process overseen by Mr. Leterme."
In its statement, Manchester City said it was confident that the club would be exonerated when its case was heard by an "independent judicial body," a description that applies to the Adjudicatory Chamber of UEFA that will issue the ruling. But the comment could also suggest that Manchester City was prepared to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the ultimate arbiter of such disputes, if necessary.
A team of finance and governance experts, led by Leterme, has been examining City's case for months, after the whistle-blowing platform Football Leaks obtained a trove of emails that appeared to show that the club had overinflated elements of its sponsorship and commercial income to disguise what were, in effect, cash injections from its owner.
The club has not commented on the content of the emails, saying only that the publication of the messages in the German magazine Der Spiegel was a "clear and organized attempt" to damage the club's reputation.
The referral of the case to the Adjudicatory Chamber does not offer any insight about how the club might be punished. The chamber can dismiss the case, follow the recommendations of the investigators, or modify the proposals.
The punishments could include a fine, a ban from UEFA competitions, or the stripping of a title or award, though the latter is not relevant because City has not, under current ownership, won a European trophy. The eventual decision can be overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
There is an enormous amount at stake, not just for Manchester City but also for UEFA. The club is likely to contest any punishment, and the governing body's ability to investigate cases in the future could be seriously compromised if this one were to collapse.
Failure in the Manchester City case could be met with resignations from UEFA's investigators, who might conclude that their reputations would be damaged by the organization's inability to enforce its own legislation and the impression that, when faced with a challenge from a powerful club, the concept of financial fair play was meaningless.
For City, whose ownership is linked to the Abu Dhabi royal family, there is a risk of considerable loss of prestige. The ownership of the club is perhaps Abu Dhabi's most high-profile overseas project, and winning the Champions League has been a major goal in efforts to turn City into an international powerhouse.

Texto completo: Move over, MAGA hat. MATH may be the next big thing in political headgear.
Yes, as in mathematics. Or as 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang suggests at his rain-soaked rally in New York City Tuesday night: “Make America Think Harder.”
The catchphrase is as good as any to describe the people wearing those hats in Washington Square Park. They’re the type to say they’re sick of emotional appeals from career politicians. They cheer when their candidate – a corporate lawyer turned CEO turned philanthropist – starts a sentence with, “I looked at the numbers” or “I did the math.” The word “rational” comes up a lot in conversation.
Which seems almost ironic, considering Mr. Yang’s banner policy is to give every American adult $1,000 a month regardless of employment status or wages. It’s a version of universal basic income, and sounds like something out of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ playbook.
Yet Mr. Yang frames his “Freedom Dividend” less in terms of political ideology than actionable steps. It’s a counterbalance, he argues, to the millions of middle class jobs that have been and will be lost to automation. “I’m a capitalist,” he told The New York Times in 2018, “and I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.”
The 2,500 supporters at his Manhattan rally dig it. They say Mr. Yang’s direct approach, his attention to policy (his site lists dozens of proposals), and his effort to avoid riling people up or demonizing them are a balm in an era of hyperbole and partisanship. Sure, he’s polling between 1% and 3% and ranks near the bottom in name recognition among the 23 Democrats in the race. And they know he’s faced criticisms about attracting fans from the less-than-savory regions of Reddit and 4chan, the discussion sites where his campaign first started to gain ground.
But supporters say it’s too soon to write him off, especially since he qualified for the first televised debate in June. He may be a long shot, but anything is possible in an era where a reality TV star occupies the White House. To them, he’s speaking the language of Americans in search of bold solutions to the nation’s problems.
“He makes a really radical argument, yet all his reasoning is commonsense, straightforward, non-ideological, very practical,” says Jason Yung, a New York University graduate student in interactive technology who started the Brooklyn chapter of the Yang Gang – what Yang supporters call themselves. “It’s so fresh.”
Universal basic income Mr. Yang grew up in Schenectady, New York, to Taiwanese immigrant parents who met in grad school in California. He studied economics at Brown, went to Columbia Law, and worked at an international law firm in New York. Later, he launched an internet nonprofit that folded in 2001, then helped run a health care startup before making a small fortune in the test-prep business.
In 2011, Mr. Yang started Venture For America (VFA), an organization that recruits top graduates for companies in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis. What he saw in middle America led Mr. Yang to conclude that economic inequality and dissatisfaction in this country comes primarily from people displaced as industrial technology improves. The Freedom Dividend is the main plank of his proposed solution.
“We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa. All of the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win,” Mr. Yang tells the crowd. “Donald Trump is not the disease. He is a symptom. He’s a manifestation of this automation wave that’s now ripping through our economy.”
Mr. Yang has been running on that message since he entered the presidential race in November 2017. The idea began making the rounds online, generating memes that celebrated his plan to essentially give people money. The Yang Gang was born.
But it wasn’t until February, when Mr. Yang guested on comedian and mixed martial arts commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, that he really went viral. The episode’s version on YouTube had close to 3 million views as of this writing. At the rally in Manhattan, supporters often cited the show as the place where they either first heard about Mr. Yang or became real fans.
Mr. Yung, the NYU grad student, stumbled onto the Yang campaign for an assignment that involved designing his own political party. “All the stuff I wanted to do, he already has,” Mr. Yung says. When he heard Mr. Yang on Mr. Rogan’s show, “I really was like, ‘Oh my God. He can talk the talk,’” Mr. Yung recalls. He started the Brooklyn Yang Gang shortly after.
Tami Joy Schlichter, a Yang volunteer who spearheaded Tuesday’s rally, also credits “The Joe Rogan Experience,” and the podcast “Freakonomics,” for introducing her to Mr. Yang. Ms. Schlichter runs a digital marketing firm, but her passion is mathematical neuroscience – A.I. – and its effect on worker displacement.
“I was like, ‘Thank God someone is paying attention to this issue,’” she says, holding up a colossal cutout of a $1,000 bill with Mr. Yang’s face where Grover Cleveland’s should be.
“Everyone is tired of all of the emotional drama,” Ms. Schlichter adds. “We just want someone that’s going to pay attention to an issue, do the research, and solve it according to what the data says.”
‘It’s going to be a party’ Hours before the rally starts, a man in a printed jumpsuit, fur hat, and oversize rhinestone glasses hands out Yang 2020 flyers to passersby at Washington Square Park. “It’s going to be a party,” he says.
The man is Paperboy Prince of the Suburbs – Paperboy for short – a rapper and self-professed internet meme activist who caught the Yang bug when he heard Mr. Yang say in an interview that his ideas are more important than winning the race. “That really ignited me,” Paperboy says. So far he’s written three songs for Mr. Yang, the latest of which is called “Humanity First,” after the Yang campaign slogan.
Hamed Salimi, a software developer and Iranian immigrant who lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, was hardcore for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mr. Salimi likes the way Mr. Yang has presented universal basic income as a way to balance out the country’s increasingly uneven economic scales. And though he has no sympathy for President Trump, he appreciates Mr. Yang’s effort to reach conservatives by appearing on Fox News and right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro’s show.
“I really like that he’s not scared and he doesn’t see them as enemies,” Mr. Salimi says. 
Mr. Yang often says he’s drawn former Trump supporters into his camp (though none of those interviewed in New York fell into this category). He’s touted it as proof that with the right message, partisan divides can be overcome. But he has received criticism for the attention he’s getting from the internet’s darker corners, where the racist and sexist ideas of the alt-right tend to fester. Buzzfeed reported in March that one of his staffers had been doxxed and harassed by 4chan users who took issue when she tweeted that Mr. Yang’s universal basic income policy is feminist.
The reason appears to be that many 4chan users like the idea of getting $1,000 a month in free money, not that Mr. Yang is courting them or is in sympathy with racist or misogynistic ideology. In fact, he’s repeatedly disavowed these groups. “Anyone who spends, like, five seconds looking into me or my background or my beliefs or my platform would be like, ‘This guy is the least white nationalist dude ever,’” Mr. Yang told Vox.
Indeed, his supporters are less concerned about who else Mr. Yang is attracting than how the media is treating him. “The press is going to get caught with their pants down at the Iowa caucus,” says Benjamin Springer, a former police officer and Army veteran from Point Pleasant, New Jersey, who says he’s given about $200 to the Yang campaign. “He’s known within online communities.”
“I don’t know that he has a chance,” Mr. Yung, the NYU grad student, admits, “but I feel the energy. I’m hopeful.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The United States and allies argued about whether Iran is stepping up threats against American forces in the Middle East – or responding to threats from the Trump administration.
U. S. officials told The New York Times they escalated their warnings to Iran because of intelligence showing photographs of missiles loaded onto small boats in the Persian Gulf.
"Overhead imagery showed fully assembled missiles, stoking fears that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps would fire them at United States naval ships," The Times reported.
The Times noted that Europeans and some congressional lawmakers said "Iran’s moves might mostly be defensive against what Tehran believes are provocative acts by Washington. "
Last week, CNN reported that Iran loaded ballistic missiles on boats.
The United States warned Iran not to attack U. S. forces and sent B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged threats. Wednesday, the State Department ordered nonemergency U. S. employees out of Iraq because of the tensions.
This week, U. S. and British officials engaged in a public dispute over whether Iran is more of a threat than it has been.
British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, the No. 2 officer in the U. S. -led coalition fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in Syria and Iraq, said Tuesday that the threat from Iran is no greater than it was months ago.
Iran: Iran says Trump playing 'very dangerous game,' risking 'devastating war'
Trump's Iran plan: President fails to present unified message on Iran
The Pentagon pushed back.
Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U. S. Central Command, said Ghika was wrong and his comments "run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from U. S. and allies regarding Iranian-backed forces in the region. "
Lawmakers fear the tensions could lead to military conflict.
Democrats have been particularly critical of national security adviser John Bolton, who has made no secret of his desire to seek regime change in Iran.
“We should do everything possible to prevent an unnecessary war, beginning with immediately reopening diplomatic channels and toning down the rhetoric," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
Iraq: State Department orders nonemergency staff to leave Iraq amid escalating tensions with Iran
Trump played down the potential for military action, saying he would respond only to some kind of attack from Iran.
Asked about a Times report that Bolton and other officials discussed the deployment of 120,000 troops to the region to contain Iran, Trump said, "Hopefully, we're not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that. "

Texto completo: Come Friday, it will be 67 days since White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a "daily press briefing." That's a record dry spell.
Most Americans might not realize this, but the democratic process of having your federal government answer tough questions — live, on television — is an act of accountability fast becoming extinct.
Once upon a time, a chief spokesman for the White House or Pentagon or State Department would go before cameras every day, certainly every week, and take any and all questions about government policies impacting millions of American lives. No more.
Come Friday, it will be 67 days since White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a "daily press briefing." That's a record dry spell. And it has been nearly a year since the last, on-camera news conference by a Pentagon spokesperson. The State Department sometimes goes weeks without a "daily" briefing.
Meanwhile, news cycles keep generating vital questions: Is a New York Times report accurate that plans are being prepared to send up to 120,000 troops — a force like the one used to invade Iraq — to counter Iranian threats? Does President Donald Trump expect Americans to endure months of tumbling stocks and rising prices as his China trade war drags on? Why does he keep saying China pays billions in tariffs when American companies and consumers actually foot the bill?
To his credit, media-savvy Trump makes himself available for shouted questions as he boards the Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn or during heads-of-state meetings more than many prior presidents. And the Pentagon offers up experts on specific topics or does occasional briefings with cameras turned off.
"But access is not the same thing as transparency," says Martha Joynt Kumar, an emerita professor at Towson University who studies the history of presidential press relations as director of the White House Transition Project.
Necessary follow-up questions during Trump's blustering Q&A's are all but impossible. And the absence of regularly scheduled briefings denies reporters the chance to dig deeper into administration policy, forcing the White House to explain its plans and be openly accountable for governing decisions.
The lack of transparency is of a piece with other acts of concealment such as curtailing the release of White House visitor logs, breaking with the norm of releasing tax returns, refusing to make administration officials available for congressional oversight hearings, and denying a government watchdog the necessary metrics for judging the success or failure of the Afghanistan War.
While Trump continues to denigrate the media, journalists serve a purpose so vital the Founding Fathers forever enshrined press freedom in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
It's not possible for every American to walk into the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department to ask questions that matter to them. This is why they rely on journalists to do the asking. The least the American people can expect from the Trump administration is to do the answering.
Come Friday, it will be 67 days since White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a "daily press briefing." That's a record dry spell.

Trump's campaign was definitely spied on, but the media still stumble over the word

Texto completo: The Trump campaign was spied on during the 2016 election.
Federal investigators used wiretaps, informants, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants, the whole nine yards. Whether it was lawful is a separate question. For now, the basic truth of the matter is that federal investigators secretly surveilled and collected intelligence on the GOP nominee and his associates.
Astonishingly enough, the American press is coming to the defense of the spies, arguing that what happened in 2016 does not count as spying. Some newsrooms are even claiming that it was all perfectly normal, routine stuff.
In the world of print, newsrooms like the New York Times and the Associated Press have teetered back-and-forth between arguing that election-year spying is typical, everyday law enforcement activity and that there is not enough evidence to justify using words like “spy,” “spied,” and “spying.”
The AP, for example, published a report this week wherein it stated in reference to Attorney General William Barr saying “spying did occur” during the election that, “Barr provided no details about what ‘spying’ may have taken place but appeared to be alluding to a surveillance warrant the FBI obtained on a former Trump associate, Carter Page, and the FBI’s use of an informant while the bureau was investigating former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos.”
Well, yes. Other than all of that spying, what spying?
Also, for no reason at all, here are three AP headlines from 2005:

Then there is the Times, which published an article this week that included the line [emphasis added], “Law enforcement officials have also drawn intense criticism for using an informant — a typical investigative step — to secretly report on Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos after they left the campaign.”
Very normal and typical stuff.
But what is probably the most absurd attempt by a newsroom to whitewash what happened during the election was when the Times published an article titled, “F.B.I. Sent Cloaked Investigator To Question Trump Aide in 2016.”
This “cloaked investigator” was a “government investigator posing as a research assistant … The F.B.I. sent her to London as part of the counterintelligence inquiry opened that summer to better understand the Trump campaign’s links to Russia." That is called a "spy." The word the Times is looking for is “spy.”
For what it is worth, the paper's use of the bizarre euphemism “cloaked investigator” in place of the word “spy” is the first for any major newsroom anywhere, according to Nexis. The only other hits that appear in a historical search for the term “cloaked investigator” were from articles mocking the Times’ attempt to sanitize what happened in 2016. Also, it is worth remembering the Times did not previously struggle with the “S” word. In fact, in 2002, the paper specifically defined surveillance by the federal government as spying. Now it suggests that these are separate things.
Next, there are the reporters and pundits who flat-out dispute that the Trump campaign was spied on, including CNN’s Anderson Cooper, who was distraught in April after Barr said “spying did occur."
Cooper said the use of the word “spying” was “uncharacteristically broad,” and that Barr had “fanned the flames” for Trump. CNN's Chris Cuomo said using the word “spying” was “an insult to the men and women” who work for Barr and a “defamatory way to refer to surveillance.” CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said simply that Barr’s words were “loaded” and “false” and that the “paranoid lunacy of the right-wing” had infected the Justice Department.
These are curious sentiments, considering their network had no problem using words like “spy” and “spying” to describe surreptitious intelligence gathering activities that occurred during the Bush administration. Here is a CNN headline from 2008: “Report: U.S. spied on Americans' intimate conversations abroad.” And here’s one from 2006: “Bush defends NSA spying program.” The cable network also aired dozens of news segments with titles like, "Inside the NSA: The Secret World of Electronic Spying,” and “Spying on America.”
I will concede the word “spy” is a loaded term, and that it is used often to insinuate unlawful surveillance. But that did not stop newsrooms from using the word until very, very recently.
Barr was correct when he said in his defense earlier this month that “spying” is a “good English word.” He is right. It is a good English word, especially when applied properly, as in the case of describing what the intelligence community did to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

TRUMP'S AN OPEN BOOK HIS FLAWS ARE OUT IN PUBLIC VIEW FOR ALL TO SEE

Texto completo: The surprise about the big New York Times story on Donald Trump's tax returns is that there are no real surprises.
Mr. Trump's taxes have been an obsession of the left since he, in violation of a longstanding norm, reneged on his promise to release his returns during the 2016 campaign.
Pieces were written urging some brave whistleblower to come forward with them, and Democrats counted as one of the advantages of taking the House that they could demand Mr. Trump's returns. The dispute resulting from the administration's refusal to turn them over is now probably headed to the Supreme Court.
All the while, the expectation, or at least the suspicion, was that the returns contained some awful secret, perhaps evidence that he is a tool of the Russians. And now, The New York Times has obtained Mr. Trump's tax information spanning a decade from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, and the revelation is that he wasn't doing as well as he said in public and lost a boatload of money in a period that nearly destroyed him. In other words, exactly what anyone paying any attention would have expected.
Yes, the amount of the reported loss, $1.17 billion, is remarkable (although inflated for tax purposes), and some of the details memorable.
Mr. Trump doesn't like having all the particulars on the record to be discussed and mocked, but can anyone say that he or she is surprised?
Mr. Trump himself, the Washington Examiner notes, talked about his precarious financial state in this period on the first episode of "The Apprentice." In fact, he may have exaggerated, saying that he had been "billions of dollars" in debt.
As for Mr. Trump's use of tax loopholes, he said in a debate with Hillary Clinton that if he didn't owe any tax liability, that made him "smart."
There really are no Trump mysteries. His flaws aren't hidden away. He often attests to them himself, or demonstrates them publicly. For someone who cares so much about his image, and so assiduously crafts it, he's a relative open book.
No blockbuster report has more than a passing effect because each dispatch is, ultimately, another dot in a pointillist portrait of the president that was largely completed long ago.
This is also why the hope that we are one investigation, tax return, or subpoena away from the revelation that will finally bring Mr. Trump down - or even make a difference - is almost certainly forlorn.
Obviously, it was news that he had paid off a porn star during the presidential campaign, and highly embarrassing. This is why Mr. Trump denied it for so long. But he'd already told us about his womanizing in his own words, often on "The Howard Stern Show."
Likewise, the most blameworthy conduct regarding Russia's election interference in 2016 was out in the open - the Trump campaign was happy to derive any possible advantage from the WikiLeaks disclosures, and Mr. Trump tried to deny the obvious Russian involvement.
We didn't need a 400-page special counsel report to break this news.
Even some of Mr. Trump's alleged obstruction, which you'd expect to involve back-channel scheming (and there was certainly that), was out in the open. He pressured Jeff Sessions in public to un-recuse. He publicly called Michael Cohen a rat. He told Lester Holt on a TV news broadcast that he fired James Comey because of the Russia investigation (specifically, that it didn't have anything to do with him). And he's made no secret that he yearns for an attorney general who will protect him.
You can add lurid details to this basic picture, and Robert Mueller did, but it's hard to find a game-changer.
None of this is to defend or excuse Mr. Trump's business practices or his conduct in office. It is merely to say that he's an extravagantly known quantity, and will likely win or lose in 2020 based on what we already know rather than the fruits of further investigation and fact-finding.

THE TAWDRY TRUMP-NADLER WAR TRUMP NEVER HAS RECOGNIZED CHECKS AND BALANCES, BUT NOW THE DEMOCRATS DON'T EITHER

Texto completo: Our system of checks and balances requires that political leaders hold two opposing ideas in their heads simultaneously. If you're a political leader, the first is that your political opponents are wrong about many things and should be defeated in elections. The second is that you still need them. You need them to check your excesses, compensate for your blind spots and correct your mistakes.
This system has been decaying for decades, but it's really disintegrated over the past year. Donald Trump has never understood checks and balances. He's never understood anything that stands in the way of his spoiled-boy will. The administration's policy of blanket noncooperation with Congress is clearly a betrayal of how our system of government is supposed to work.
But Mr. Trump is far from the only villain in this showdown. If the House wants to preserve oversight power on the executive branch, it has to be willing to oversee. It has to be willing to use its power in ways that improve the governance of this country.
If Congress uses its power simply to destroy the president, then of course any president is going to clam up and refuse to cooperate. If Congress picks fights merely to gin up the political passions of the donor base, then of course the system of checks and balances is going to break down.
Republicans have crossed this line in the past, and Democrats crossed it this week, undermining the way the system of oversight is supposed to work. How do we know this? Because of what Democrats are declaring a constitutional crisis over - the redaction levels of the Mueller report. Of all the contemptible things the Trump administration has done, this is probably the least contemptible.
Sure, William Barr distorted the report in his initial summary, but he also released a report that was extremely damning about his own president. In addition, Mr. Barr has made 99.9 percent of Volume II of the Mueller report, which is focused on obstruction, available to top Democrats, as noted in a letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd.
The Democratic position is that the whole report and the underlying documents should be made available to all members of Congress - a guarantee that everything will leak. The core disagreement is this: The administration claims it needs to protect continuing investigations and grand jury information. The Democrats claim they should go to a judge and get him or her to lift those restraints.
I don't know who's right on the legalities. Walter Dellinger, a top Justice official in the Clinton administration, told The Washington Post that the administration's executive privilege claim might be justified at this stage. "It could well be that in the millions of pages being sought, there are materials for which there is a genuine claim of executive privilege," he said.
But the fact that the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, decided to go to the mat over this - to invoke the term "constitutional crisis" over this - suggests that the disagreement is just a pretext for the media battle many Democrats and Mr. Trump want to have.
Democrats rushed into this. It took the Republicans about eight months between the time they issued a subpoena to Obama Attorney General Eric Holder for information on the Fast and Furious program and when they actually voted to hold him in contempt of Congress. The Democrats went from subpoena to contempt in roughly three weeks.
And it's not as if the decision to hold Mr. Barr in contempt is going to have any positive effect. The whole thing now gets frozen and sent into the court system for months or years. Mr. Holder served for three more years as attorney general after Republicans held him in contempt, without any practical change in his status.
This constitutional crisis is just for show. Partly the Democrats want the show because it just feels good to bash the administration. "This has had a cathartic effect on the Democrats because we have finally been able to find a way to fight back at the obstructionism," Rep. Jamie Raskin told my Times colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
Partly they are trying to appease the wing of the party that is calling for impeachment right away. The party leaders generally opposed impeachment for sensible reasons. It would be impossible to win a conviction in the Senate without some Republican cooperation and overwhelming popular support - which doesn't exist. It's much better for the Democrats if they focus media attention on their presidential candidates. A Trump vs. Nadler media war is exactly what Mr. Trump wants.
The problem with any policy of appeasement is that it rarely appeases; it emboldens. And that's what's happening. You can feel the atmosphere in the Democratic Party changing, getting more passionate, getting more caught up in the back-and-forth combat with Mr. Trump, getting more whipped up into impeachment furor.
My advice to Democrats: If Robert Mueller isn't blocked from testifying, hear what he has to say and then see where we are. But advice is rarely heeded when war fever is rising and the logic of events spins out of control, when the self-disciplining mechanisms of checks and balances wash away in the fury of war. That's when the real trouble starts.

Texto completo: A California man pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges that he threatened to kill employees of The Boston Globe in retaliation for the news organization's national editorial campaign against President Trump's attacks on the press.
In approximately 14 calls to the Globe's newsroom in August, Robert D. Chain, 68, repeatedly vowed to attack journalists on behalf of Trump, who has denounced news organizations as the “enemy of the people."
The Globe's editorial board had called on publications across the country to speak out against Trump's “sustained assault on the free press."
On Wednesday, Chain kept his gaze down as Assistant US Attorney George P. Varghese read a list of Chain's violent threats.
“You are the enemy of the people and we are going to shoot you all." “You are the enemy of the people. We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs." “We're gonna shoot you [expletive] in the head, you Boston Globe [expletive]. We're gonna shoot every [expletive] one of you."
When Varghese finished, US District Judge William G. Young turned to Chain and asked “Are those things true?"
“Yes they are, your honor," Chain said.
Chain began calling the Globe on Aug. 10 and continued until the FBI's SWAT team arrested him Aug. 30 at his Encino, Calif., home, where they discovered 20 firearms, including a semiautomatic rifle he purchased in May 2018, records show. He is not facing charges related to the firearms.
Chain was indicted on seven counts of use of interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat to injure another person based on the calls to the Globe's main newsroom telephone line. Court records include partial transcripts of his comments, which often included expletives and lewd language directed at Globe employees.
In some calls, he made reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials.
“We're going to kill every [expletive] one of you. Go [expletive] yourself. Call the FBI. Go get some help from [expletive] Mueller okay you [expletive]," he allegedly said Aug. 15. “You're a dead man."
On Aug. 16, the day the Globe published the coordinated editorial response, Chain vowed to murder a Globe journalist at 4 p.m. that day, according to federal court records. In response, law enforcement officers were stationed outside the Globe's offices.
“As long as you keep attacking the president, the duly elected president of the United States, in the continuation of your treasonous and seditious acts, I will continue to threat, harass, and annoy the Boston Globe," Chain said in an Aug. 22 call, records show.
In a statement, Jane Bowman, a Globe spokeswoman, said, “We're pleased with the plea of guilt, remain appreciative of the law enforcement agencies that pursued justice, and will continue to closely watch the legal process play out in this case."
Chain has not been charged with placing calls to any other organizations, but prosecutors said in court papers that Chain allegedly made similar telephone calls to New York Times columnist Bret Stephens.
Chain is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 23. He faces between 10 and 21 months in prison.Chain and his attorney declined to speak to a reporter as they left the courtroom.
At the hearing, Young spent about 45 minutes going over the plea with Chain and explaining the legal process. He asked Chain repeatedly whether he was certain he wanted to plead guilty.
“I think it's the best way to settle this issue, your honor," Chain said.
Young pressed him again.
“What's going on when you say you think this is the best way to settle it? What do you mean by that?" Young said.
Chain spoke briefly with his lawyer, William D. Weinreb.
“Pleading guilty because I am guilty, your honor," Chain said.

Texto completo: When Nelson Pinos taught his 6-year-old son how to ride a bike, he could not do it in the park. He had to show the boy in the basement of a church.
The native of Ecuador has lived in the First and Summerfield United Methodist Church in New Haven, Conn., since late 2017, finding sanctuary from deportation there after rejecting orders from immigration authorities to board a one-way flight to South America.
Pino's attorneys will make oral arguments on Tuesday before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Paul to try to have his case reopened and give him a chance to not only leave the church, but also to be with his three American-born children. The case has drawn national attention, with Pinos telling CNN from the church in December: "I can't leave this place. I have never been in jail but this is jail."
As President Donald Trump's administration cracks down on illegal immigration, some churches have stepped up to offer people in the country illegally sanctuary from deportation. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not make arrests at "sensitive locations" such as houses of worship. About 50 churches in Minnesota have offered to be sanctuaries for immigrants or support the sanctuary movement.
Pinos migrated to New York from Ecuador in 1993. During a trip to Minnesota the following year, he was arrested and released by immigration authorities. He returned home to New York and later said he had never received a court notification and later a deportation order issued in absentia when he didn't show up.
Because they were mailed to a Minnesota address, he didn't find out about the notices until 2012.
Even after he began reporting to ICE for periodic check-ins, authorities told him he was not a priority for deportation, according to attorneys.
But in October of 2017, Nelson was ordered to leave the country when he went to visit ICE for a regular status renewal. Attorney Yazmin Rodriguez said they want the court to look at whether Pinos was informed of his rights and responsibilities when he was placed in removal proceedings.
ICE spokesman John Mohan told the Associated Press that the agency does not comment on specifics of immigration cases being heard before an immigration judge.
But in a statement, ICE said Pinos failed to depart as scheduled and then sought shelter in the church. He was then declared an immigration fugitive. Seeking sanctuary at a site categorized by ICE as a sensitive location may delay "but does not void" ICE's authority to enforce a removal order, the agency said, according to the Associated Press.
Pinos has worked as a machine setup operator at a factory for the last 15 years, paying income taxes.
"Going to Ecuador would be devastating for our family," Kelly Pinos, his teenage daughter, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times last year. "My siblings and I were born in New Haven and our entire life is here."
Kelly Pinos appeared at a news conference in Minneapolis on Monday along with her sister Arley, her father's attorneys, and various immigration advocates.
The Rev. Vicki Flippin of First and Summerfield led a prayer and called for people to remember the families and communities behind immigrants living in the country illegally.
Kelly Pinos read a letter from Nelson Pinos in which he noted he had been in the U.S. for 26 years and had no criminal record.
"I want to be able to see my kids fulfill their hopes and dreams," he wrote.

Mixed outlook for female candidates

Texto completo: Many Democratic voters are worried that a female candidate cannot win the presidency in 2020. "I don't think they're strong enough to carry it for themselves," an Iowa voter told The Washington Post. Amber Phillips reports that "female politicians are held by voters to a much higher standard than men," and points to polls showing that today's support for Elizabeth Warren (12 percent) and Kamala Harris (8 percent) drops to low single digits when voters are asked who is likely to defeat President Donald Trump.
Without denying that some people may harbor misogynistic feelings, and that many Democrats may indeed fear, as Phillips reported, that while they personally would happily vote for a woman for president, their neighbors might not, this doesn't prove that women are held to a higher standard. The evidence is mixed. It's never possible to know with certainty what motivates voters. Could Mitt Romney's religion have decided the 2012 race? It's possible.
Is there an anti-woman bias? Election analyst Karlyn Bowman has found that women are just as likely to be successful in political races as men. And most voters are past the identity politics phase of wanting to vote for a candidate (or oppose one) due to sex.
At the level of presidential politics, the data set is a bit skimpy -- one election. Many Democrats seem to believe that Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss can be chalked up to sex, or, in the words of New York Times op-ed writer Farhad Manjoo, the perception that "American society is wracked at every level by a pervasive and enduring misogyny."
Or perhaps Clinton became unpopular for reasons all her own. It isn't as if she was always unpopular. Twice in her career, Clinton was regarded favorably by a whopping 66 percent of Americans -- in December 1998, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal made her the most prominent wronged wife on the planet, and in November 2009, while she served as secretary of state. Even in the midst of the Benghazi hearings in December 2012, her approval still held steady at 65 percent.
In 2015, Clinton's approval dipped sharply, down to 49 percent. This drop tracked among all voters, including Democrats, whose support declined from 86 percent to 77 percent. What happened? Clinton didn't change her sex. She ran into the private email server scandal, and it damaged her not just because of the underlying offense, but also due to her persistent deceit, and the fact that this revived concerns about her dishonesty and "rules don't apply to me" image from earlier in her career.
The share of voters who are women has been increasing steadily since 1980. The Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers shows that in 2016, 63.3 percent of eligible women voted compared with only 59.3 percent of eligible men. It's possible that women harbor self-hating feelings toward female candidates, but that seems unlikely. The data does show clearly that women, especially the unmarried ones, tend to prefer more liberal candidates without regard to sex. And there is one study showing that when Democratic women run against Republican men, some Republican female voters defect to the woman.
What about male voters? Are they the ones who hold retrograde views, thinking female candidates are too emotional or weak to do the job? There may be some of that, but think of Republican voters in 2008. They were lukewarm toward John McCain, the last man standing at the end of the primaries, but they were over the moon for Sarah Palin. A September 2008 CNN poll found that 62 percent of men approved of Palin compared with only 53 percent of women. Asked whether Palin was qualified to be president, 57 percent of male respondents said yes, 14 points higher than among women. In fact, 55 percent of women thought she wasn't qualified.
You can mine the data in the belief that voters are not "ready" for a woman president. But the truth is probably closer to this: The right woman candidate hasn't run yet. Qualifications aside (it's so pre-2016 to fret about qualifications!), if Oprah Winfrey or Michelle Obama jumped into the race, they'd rocket to the top. Great Britain, Israel, Germany and India, for heaven's sake, have elected female leaders. Is the U.S. more misogynist than those countries?
Not everything reduces to bias. May the best person win.

Fremont High's mascot might not be what you think it is

Texto completo: PLAIN CITY, Weber County — If you thought Riverton was the home of the Silverwolves, you’re right.
But you’re also kinda wrong.
And if you thought Plain City was the home of the Silver Wolves, you’re wrong.
But you’re also kinda right.
Or at least you were.
If you’re confused, you’re not the only one.
Since Fremont High opened its doors in 1994, the school’s sports teams have been referred to as the Silver Wolves — two words, both uppercased — by Utah’s media publications. The Deseret News, the Salt Lake Tribune, the Ogden Standard-Examiner, TV stations, you name it.
And apparently for the last 25 years, all of Utah’s media publications have gotten it wrong.
They’re currently and have always been the Silverwolves — four legs but only one word — not the two-worded, four-legged Silver Wolves, the school politely insists.
Media outlets weren’t the only ones to get it wrong for a quarter of a century. Outsiders and even insiders — students and faculty — have made the same apparent mistake.
“This is making me crazy,” joked Fremont High principal Michele Parry (one L, two words).
A self-proclaimed “word nerd” and former journalism teacher, Parry is making a concerted effort to get everybody on the same page in terms of spelling her school’s mascot.
And for the record, that page includes Silverwolves written in just one word.
“To me, tradition here is really important,” Parry said. “Maybe it’s because I was one of the original teachers here, but I just thought we’ve got to get it the same — consistent — and we’ve got to get it what it was intended to be.”
Fremont has reached out to encourage local media to join the one-word party, but she’s also fighting the battle at the school.
While the front of the school has big white block letters on the red brick exterior to alert all that Fremont High is “HOME OF THE SILVERWOLVES” and that version is the most common form used in the school, there are some mixed messages.
The marquee at the entry of the school’s parking lot?
Silver Wolves.
One of the scoreboards in the gym? Two words.
The large lettering above the mirrored wall in the weight room?
There’s a space between the sixth and seventh letters.
Banners on light posts around the campus?
Silver stacked on top of Wolves.
The administration has already made changes that are fiscally sound and will continue to do that, but a new $30,000 marquee isn't in the budget right now.
Parry’s mom was the head secretary when the school opened. She worked closely with the first principal on all the technical details, including the mascot being Silverwolves, not Silver Wolves. Parry held up a copy of the school’s first yearbook, and sure enough in a fancy silver font, it proclaims, “We are the Silverwolves.”
DeAnn Thorpe has been teaching at the school for all 25 years of its existence, and she agrees with her principal.
“It’s always been one word,” said Thorpe, who teaches dance and aerobics. “I’ve always done it as one. I think all the original teachers would have always done it as one.”
Not so fast.
Parry stopped another longtime faculty member, athletic trainer Don Carter, and asked him about the Silverwolves vs. Silver Wolves debate.
“Wasn’t it, when we first started, two words?” Carter said.
“One,” Parry insisted.
“Was it one word?” he asked, laughing.
“One,” she repeated, smiling. “Don’t quote him. Goodbye, Don.”
“Yes, it is the great debate,” he added. “One word or two words?”
“One.”
“She’s right!”
Interestingly, a quick search on wolf.org — a website that sounds official enough to be considered the preeminent source of information for this investigative journalism piece — there isn’t even a species of Canis (how smart people say dogs) called silver wolves or silverwolves.
There are gray wolves (lupus) and red wolves (rufus). There are also coyotes, golden jackals, black-backed jackals, side-striped jackals, dingos, domestic dogs and Abyssinian or Ethiopian wolves, red foxes, gray foxes, kit foxes, swift foxes, arctic foxes and, yes, timber wolves and tundra wolves.
The Wolves of the World page on Cosmosmith.com lists the original 24 subspecies of wolves, but silver wolves and/or silverwolves (however you choose to spell them) are nowhere to be found. Fans of a certain popular HBO show will be happy to know there really were dire wolves in the ancient world, though.
A large study of North American wolf genomes in 2016 revealed that the gray wolf is actually the one and only species on the continent. The Eastern wolf and red wolf are mixes of gray wolf and coyote DNA, The New York Times reported.
“It’s not even a real thing,” Parry admitted with a grin. “It’s like a (Davis) Dart.”
Spell check, by the way, splits up the words silver and wolves when you type them together, if that means anything — and some grammar nazis will tell you it most certainly do. There’s also paranormal romance novel called “The Silver Wolf” (two words).
Oh, don’t get people at Fremont talking about how Riverton High copycatted the school two counties to the north when it opened in 1999. Parry would prefer if the Jordan School District institution would adopt the two-worded style to differentiate between the two even though it’s been the other way around in the public eye for so long.
“We are the one,” Parry said, good-naturedly. “We were here first.”
Nobody is quite sure how the discrepancy happened. The school's mascot first appeared in the Deseret News as Silver Wolves before the 1994 football season.
Fremont alumnus Brian Godfrey, whose basketball team has won the alumni tournament eight years in a row, said he’s noticed the media uses Silver Wolves but verifies that it’s Silverwolves.
“But we are just a bunch of rednecks,” he joked, “so I figured the media knew better than we did.”
Godfrey humorously noted that the school would have had some different nickname problems had they been named the Bayside Buccaneers as almost happened.
“The school was destined for this type of drama,” he added.
The school's actual name isn't always spelled correctly, either. Explorer John C. Frémont might prefer if his namesake school used the accent on the e. Others falsely believe there are two Es.
Parry laughs about that misspelling. She has a drawer full of 200 "Freemont" keychains in the principal's office that were accidentally made.
On the bright side, the manufacturer did get Silverwolves right.

Texto completo: The first thing microbes like fungi and bacteria must battle in order to thrive is not the humans to which they can be so deadly, but each other.
And left to their own devices, these microbes tend toward balance.
However, when humans have identified microbes as dangerous - like the bacteria that cause pneumonia in people, anthrax in livestock or leaf blight in crops - we've used chemicals and medicines to stymie those microbes.
So we've worked wonders to reduce the cost and difficulty of crop and livestock production, and to improve the health and lifespan of humans. But by depressing the population of microbial organisms humans are fighting, we also have eliminated competition for other microbes that are now on the rise, and we have pushed organisms toward mutations that make them resistant to our medicines.
A deadly fungus centered in NYC
As a result, the nation faces new outbreaks. The deadly, drug-resistant fungus Candida auris, or C. auris, is centered in New York, difficult to eradicate and deadly. Practically nothing is being done to combat it, and hospitals and health departments won't reveal where it's been found.
Drug-resistant infections claim 700,000 lives a year worldwide. The most famous is known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, which infects about 90,000 Americans each year and kills about 20,000. It is highly resistant to a wide variety of antibiotic treatments.
Because of the prevalence of MRSA - and the spread of other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can cause pneumonia, tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis and leprosy - industrialized societies like the United States and Western Europe are realizing that pumping crop fields, livestock and humans full of antibiotics can lead to devastating results. Doctors are refusing to prescribe unneeded antibiotics. Patients are learning not to ask. And farmers in the United States have slashed the use of antibiotics in meat and milk by a third since the use of antibiotics to make animals grow more quickly was banned in 2017.
But the shift away from overuse of antibiotics is coming too slowly.
Doctors and government officials have worked for years to grapple with highly infectious bacteria that resist antibiotics and are tenaciously difficult to eradicate.
Their new worry, the drug-resistant C. auris, was first reported in the United States in 2017. About 600 instances of the infection have been diagnosed nationwide. More than 300 confirmed cases were in New York. The state Department of Health won't say in which hospitals the fungal infection has been identified.
A devastating threat
The fungus first appeared in Japan in 2009. It carries a mortality rate of about 35 percent, is highly resistant to antifungal agents and nearly impossible to eradicate from a room once it arrives.
The New York Times reported that after a man died at a Brooklyn hospital in 2018, his hospital room had to be stripped down to the studs to eradicate the auris germ after everything in the room tested positive.
Drug-resistant infections are becoming one of world's most devastating dangers. The response - in how we treat crops, livestock and human illness - must change. New treatments must be invented, and policies must be created to stop the excessive use of such products, and to inform people when and where outbreaks occur.
And so far, hardly anything is being done at all.

Texto completo: FOND DU LAC – When Maureen Daly felt the pangs and excitement of first love at the age of 17, she took to her basement desk to scrawl it down. While fictionalizing the experience, she also wrote about what she knew: teenage romance blossoming in the town in which she lived. The places she and her three sisters had made their playground during the Great Depression became settings — Lakeside Park and its lighthouse; McKnight's Drug Store on Main Street.
At the time, Daly didn't know that four years later her pages of experience would be published as "Seventeenth Summer," a novel credited with honestly depicting love in adolescence, spurring the young adult genre, and immortalizing Fond du Lac locales in the minds of more than 1 million readers.
Fond du Lac County Historical Society and Historic Preservation Commission of the City of Fond du Lac will celebrate Daly, her life and its impact on Fond du Lac's history as part of National Historic Preservation Month Wednesday. Titled "Maureen Daly Day," the event will invite the public to learn more about Daly's story as they discuss the evolution in dating norms over Cherry Cokes.
Celebrating a Fond du Lac author For the past couple of years, the society and commission have come together to host an event that sheds light on the importance of preserving local history as part of National Historic Preservation Month. Last year, the event focused on changes to wedding and engagement customs over the past 150 years in Wisconsin, said Fond du Lac County Executive Director Vanessa VanderWeele.
When it came to selecting a subject for this year's event, Daly was a perfect fit, because of the number of people who grew up reading her work in the city and the ability to discuss Fond du Lac's history through it, said VanderWeele.
The selection allows for the event to not focus on "physical buildings" that serve as "architectural treasures" in the community's history, but on the city's people as well, said Community Development Director Dyann Benson, who also acts as the staff liaison to the commission.
"We also need to celebrate the people that contributed to who we are as a community," Benson said. "Maureen Daly shared Fond du Lac with the outside world through her book 'Seventeenth Summer.'"
Daly and her family left Ireland and came to the United States in the 1920s and settled in a home on Bank Street. As she grew, she attended St. Mary's Springs, where her teacher, Sister Rosita Handibode, of the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Agnes, encouraged her to write. At age 15, she took fourth place for her submission to a Scholastic Magazine national contest for her story "Fifteen," according to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
The next year, she submitted "Sixteen," a short story that involves two teens meeting at a skating rink. For the story, she won first prize, and it was selected to appear in the "O'Henry Best Short Stories," according to archives. Since it has appeared in various textbooks and anthologies.
At the age of 17, the summer brought time off from school, and Daly decided to write a novel. Over the warm months, she wrote a few chapters and an outline of the story of Angie Morrow and Jack Duluth, two Fond du Lac teens who fall in love over a summer against the backdrop of Lakeside Park, the Rathskeller and Pete Mengl's.
The places are ones that anyone from the time period would've recognized and still stand today, said VanderWeele. One is McKnight's Drug Store — now Annie's Fountain City Café. The eatery will host the first part of the Maureen Daly Day event at 6 p.m. Wednesday, and serve up a favorite drink of the time period — Cherry Coke — as well as other treats. As guests enjoy the food, they will also listen to a panel that will discuss the changes in dating from the 1940s to the social media age, said VanderWeele.
"The way we define dating has changed immensely since then," she said. "With the panel, we're seeing how dating has changed since going from meeting up at the corner store to swiping left and right on the dating app."
As Daly went on to college, the story stayed with her, and as a senior at Rosary College, she entered the novel into the Dodd, Mead's inter-collegiate fellowship contest, according to The New York Times and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
The novel was praised by critics when published in 1942, and over the years found its way to schools throughout the country. Although written for adults, the book spoke to teenagers and "anticipated the young-adult genre by decades," said The New York Times. Its resonance with people of all ages is seen in the fact the book has never gone out of print and has sold more than 1 million copies, as well as been printed in a dozen languages, according to Daly in USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
Daly said in a Fond du Lac Reporter column about writing the book: "It was a sheer outburst of creative yearning and emotional hype. I loved that town (and several of the young men in it) and wanted to express myself and my feelings at that time."
Despite this, Daly did not return to writing novels about teens until the 1980s.
"She didn't see her book as a huge success at the time," said VanderWeele.
Instead, after graduating from college, Daly turned to journalism for a sustainable career. She began writing for the Chicago Tribune, contributing a teen advice column to the paper, said VanderWeele. Her sister, Shelia, later took over the column and became a nationally syndicated columnist herself, as well as a vice president at Chanel.
As for her other sisters, Maggie became a model, and later a columnist, according to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives. Kay became an advertising executive for Revlon, creating the "Fire and Ice" campaign, which was one of the first to promote women wearing makeup for themselves and not to attract men, said VanderWeele.
Past the Chicago Tribune, Daly's career continued to blossom as she became the Ladies' Home Journal executive editor and, later, editorial adviser for The Saturday Evening Post, according to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
Post-World War II, Daly married writer William McGivern, whom she met an "Seventeenth Summer" autographing event. The two took to Europe, where they did freelance writing, raised two children, Megan and Patrick, and wrote the book "Mention My Name is Mombasa: The Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad," according to the archives and The New York Times.
In her time abroad, Daly also interviewed some of the world's major players, like President Harry Truman, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Andy Warhol, according to the Publishers Weekly.
When the children were teenagers, Daly and her family returned to the United States and built a home in Pennsylvania. Although the state would come to inspire her novels, it wouldn't do so until after a series of tragedies.
In 1983, McGivern died of cancer; in 1984, Megan did as well. Sitting down to write again, Daly wanted to write about her daughter, but couldn't do so without crying. For inspiration, she turned to her daughter's happier years, when at 16 she fell in love with a cowboy in Pennsylvania, as the state tried to build a highway through their property. The result, "Acts of Love," was her first novel in more than 40 years, according to archives.
More works followed, including an "Acts of Love" sequel, "First a Dream," prior to her own death from cancer in 2006, according to The New York Times.
An impactful life on display These aspects of her life, and more, will be showcased during the second part of the Maureen Daly Day event at 7 p.m. at the Galloway House and Village's Blakely Museum. There, an actress portraying Daly will share her story, and show visitors to the desk on which she wrote the influential book "Seventeenth Summer." Signed first-editions will also be displayed.
Benson said: "This month's event will, hopefully, bring Daly and her work to another generation as well as provide an opportunity for people to revisit their experiences, whether it was about reading the book, or living in the city at that time. It's a different type of chapter in how we typically celebrate historic preservation."

The 'Thurmond Rule': A phony excuse to play judicial politics

Texto completo: In a 1993 dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia compared one of the Supreme Court’s made-up legal doctrines to a “ghoul in a late night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad” no matter what is done to kill it. Beware: Entering the presidential election season means that ghouls will start shuffling their way through the judicial confirmation process.
One of those is the so-called “Thurmond Rule.” It is cited by those who want to restrict, or even cut off, confirmation of judicial nominees in a presidential election year.
Don’t think it’s too early to be addressing such things. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who, according to the Congressional Research Service, is the “senator who most frequently has asserted the existence of a Thurmond rule,” began talking about it 20 months before the 2012 election.
Two things are certain: The Thurmond Rule is not a rule, and it did not originate with Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
The Congressional Research Service describes the Thurmond Rule as a “past Senate practice” or an “informal Senate understanding” that confirmation of lower court nominees drops off and ends “earlier in presidential election years than in other years.” Beyond that very general description, it’s hard to get a handle on just when this practice/understanding begins and what it actually is.
With a Democrat in the White House, for example, Leahy has said that the Thurmond rule applies “at the end of presidential election years,” “within a couple months of a presidential election,” or in “the last few months of [a president’s] term in office.”
But with a Republican president, Leahy has said that June of a presidential election year is “way past time” for the Thurmond rule, that it “kicks in” around April or “after the spring.”
Similarly, under a Democrat president, Leahy says the Thurmond rule means that “we might slow things down,” while under a Republican president it means “no judges” or that “the president … except for extraordinary exceptions … does not get a nominee through.”
Whenever it applies and whatever it means, the Thurmond rule did not originate with Thurmond. The label first appeared in 1992, when Democrats anticipated that Bill Clinton would win the election and wanted a legitimate-sounding excuse for keeping judicial vacancies open. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, claimed that Thurmond “was the leader in shutting down entirely the question of judicial nominees in 1980.”
As the New York Times reported, that is exactly what Democrats did in 1992. Then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del., for example, refused to hold a hearing for more than 50 of President George H.W. Bush’s judicial nominees.
Four years later, Biden picked up the Thurmond rule mantra, claiming Thurmond had said “there will be no more judges, period … and shut down the whole process at the end of May.” Two presidential election years later, Leahy kept the story going by claiming that “Sen. Thurmond … instituted a policy to stall President Carter’s nominations.”
And so, the “Thurmond Rule” was born. The problem with this tale is that it just ain’t so.
The judicial confirmation process did not shut down in May, or at any other time, in 1980. In fact, the Senate confirmed more judges in 1980 than in all but one presidential election year in history. It confirmed a higher percentage of them after May, when Biden said the process stopped, than in all but one presidential election year since the turn of the 20th century.
Even more strikingly, President Jimmy Carter nominated Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Court of Appeals after Democrats lost both the White House and Senate in the 1980 election. At the Judiciary Committee’s business meeting on Nov. 25, 1980, it was Thurmond who moved that the nomination be approved, which the committee did without objection.
The Senate confirmed Breyer on Dec. 9, 26 days after his nomination, one of the swiftest confirmations ever. Far from engineering a confirmation shutdown (from the minority, no less), Thurmond helped make 1980 only the second election year in history in which the Senate confirmed a judicial nominee after the minority party captured both the Senate and the White House.
No, the notion that judicial confirmations shut down early in 1980, let alone that such a move was led by Sen. Thurmond, is pure fiction. This fantasy may be politically useful, but it’s a fantasy nonetheless.
The Thurmond rule isn’t a rule, and if we really follow Thurmond’s example, the Senate will press ahead and confirm judicial nominees until the very end of the 116th Congress.
Thomas Jipping is the deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

‘Do over’ proms pursue perpetual adolescence

Texto completo: Prom season is upon us. We all know what that means: More American adults are doing their proms all over again.
A New York Times headline about a growing number of adults says they are taking "A second shot to have the best night of their lives."
And carrying on like a bunch of retrograde adolescents.
The modern prom, reports Slate, "may be traced to the Ivy League and the annual tradition of a 'presentation week,' during which formal dress and dancing accompanied a promenade concert."
Not content with only the well-to-do experiencing the awkwardness and misery of the prom, high schools across America embraced it, particularly after World War II. Now the prom is a rite of passage for American teens everywhere, with many blowing thousands of dollars on their big nights.
But I certainly wouldn't want to do my prom over.
I didn't know my date very well. She was in my photography class, very pretty and, more importantly, still available.
When she agreed to go with me, she greatly disrupted the Bethel Park High School prom-date pecking order. Whereas my date greatly raised my social status -- even my friends and family were shocked she'd go with me -- I lowered hers.
She was awfully sore about it.
"I heard about you," she told me at our pre-prom date. "A regular class clown! You better not show up in a limo, wear a top hat or cane or do anything else to embarrass me!"
That set the tone for an incredibly unpleasant weekend.
We got lost on the way to the prom, lost on the way to my friend Cook's cabin in Ohio and lost on the way home. My first foray into the adult world was rough, to be sure -- a precursor, regrettably, of many more unpleasant adult experiences to come.
Similarly awkward prom experiences may motivate the growing number of adults trying to "get it right" during a second round.
But there are no "do overs" in life. Didn't novelist Thomas Wolfe make it clear that we "can't go home again"?
The prom is supposed to be a teen's first foray into the adult world, not an adult's eager return to adolescence.
That's not stopping ever more "adults" from trying. Too many are not just doing their proms over, they're doing summer camps over, too --
another hot trend.
To be sure, a growing desire for perpetual adolescence among today's "adults" is revealing itself all over the place -- from delaying moving out of their parents' homes to delaying marriage and parenthood. That same desire leads Hollywood to keep recycling favorite movies and TV shows from their adolescence.
Look, if you had an unpleasant prom experience when you were 18, as I did, those are the breaks.
I wrote an earlier, lighthearted newspaper column about my experience. It was published all over the country.
After that piece ran, I bumped into my old prom date at the grocery store. She still looked great, but, boy, she was really sore now.
It turns out her husband was so delighted by her rare rude behavior -- so delighted, for once, that she, not he, was the one deserving a lecture -- he carries the column around in his wallet, showing it enthusiastically to total strangers.
The joy I get from that story almost makes my lousy prom experience worthwhile -- but certainly not enough to make me want to do the prom all over again.

Losing income tax privacy is a real danger: Ron Paul

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.

Texto completo: PLAIN CITY, Weber County — If you thought Riverton was the home of the Silverwolves, you’re right.
But you’re also kinda wrong.
And if you thought Plain City was the home of the Silver Wolves, you’re wrong.
But you’re also kinda right.
Or at least you were.
If you’re confused, you’re not the only one.
Since Fremont High opened its doors in 1994, the school’s sports teams have been referred to as the Silver Wolves — two words, both uppercased — by Utah’s media publications. The Deseret News, the Salt Lake Tribune, the Ogden Standard-Examiner, TV stations, you name it.
And apparently for the last 25 years, all of Utah’s media publications have gotten it wrong.
They’re currently and have always been the Silverwolves — four legs but only one word — not the two-worded, four-legged Silver Wolves, the school politely insists.
Media outlets weren’t the only ones to get it wrong for a quarter of a century. Outsiders and even insiders — students and faculty — have made the same apparent mistake.
“This is making me crazy,” joked Fremont High principal Michele Parry (one L, two words).
A self-proclaimed “word nerd” and former journalism teacher, Parry is making a concerted effort to get everybody on the same page in terms of spelling her school’s mascot.
And for the record, that page includes Silverwolves written in just one word.
“To me, tradition here is really important,” Parry said. “Maybe it’s because I was one of the original teachers here, but I just thought we’ve got to get it the same — consistent — and we’ve got to get it what it was intended to be.”
Fremont has reached out to encourage local media to join the one-word party, but she’s also fighting the battle at the school.
While the front of the school has big white block letters on the red brick exterior to alert all that Fremont High is “HOME OF THE SILVERWOLVES” and that version is the most common form used in the school, there are some mixed messages.
The marquee at the entry of the school’s parking lot?
Silver Wolves.
One of the scoreboards in the gym? Two words.
The large lettering above the mirrored wall in the weight room?
There’s a space between the sixth and seventh letters.
Banners on light posts around the campus?
Silver stacked on top of Wolves.
The administration has already made changes that are fiscally sound and will continue to do that, but a new $30,000 marquee isn't in the budget right now.
Parry’s mom was the head secretary when the school opened. She worked closely with the first principal on all the technical details, including the mascot being Silverwolves, not Silver Wolves. Parry held up a copy of the school’s first yearbook, and sure enough in a fancy silver font, it proclaims, “We are the Silverwolves.”
DeAnn Thorpe has been teaching at the school for all 25 years of its existence, and she agrees with her principal.
“It’s always been one word,” said Thorpe, who teaches dance and aerobics. “I’ve always done it as one. I think all the original teachers would have always done it as one.”
Not so fast.
Parry stopped another longtime faculty member, athletic trainer Don Carter, and asked him about the Silverwolves vs. Silver Wolves debate.
“Wasn’t it, when we first started, two words?” Carter said.
“One,” Parry insisted.
“Was it one word?” he asked, laughing.
“One,” she repeated, smiling. “Don’t quote him. Goodbye, Don.”
“Yes, it is the great debate,” he added. “One word or two words?”
“One.”
“She’s right!”
Interestingly, a quick search on wolf.org — a website that sounds official enough to be considered the preeminent source of information for this investigative journalism piece — there isn’t even a species of Canis (how smart people say dogs) called silver wolves or silverwolves.
There are gray wolves (lupus) and red wolves (rufus). There are also coyotes, golden jackals, black-backed jackals, side-striped jackals, dingos, domestic dogs and Abyssinian or Ethiopian wolves, red foxes, gray foxes, kit foxes, swift foxes, arctic foxes and, yes, timber wolves and tundra wolves.
The Wolves of the World page on Cosmosmith.com lists the original 24 subspecies of wolves, but silver wolves and/or silverwolves (however you choose to spell them) are nowhere to be found. Fans of a certain popular HBO show will be happy to know there really were dire wolves in the ancient world, though.
A large study of North American wolf genomes in 2016 revealed that the gray wolf is actually the one and only species on the continent. The Eastern wolf and red wolf are mixes of gray wolf and coyote DNA, The New York Times reported.
“It’s not even a real thing,” Parry admitted with a grin. “It’s like a (Davis) Dart.”
Spell check, by the way, splits up the words silver and wolves when you type them together, if that means anything — and some grammar nazis will tell you it most certainly do. There’s also paranormal romance novel called “The Silver Wolf” (two words).
Oh, don’t get people at Fremont talking about how Riverton High copycatted the school two counties to the north when it opened in 1999. Parry would prefer if the Jordan School District institution would adopt the two-worded style to differentiate between the two even though it’s been the other way around in the public eye for so long.
“We are the one,” Parry said, good-naturedly. “We were here first.”
Nobody is quite sure how the discrepancy happened. The school's mascot first appeared in the Deseret News as Silver Wolves before the 1994 football season.
Fremont alumnus Brian Godfrey, whose basketball team has won the alumni tournament eight years in a row, said he’s noticed the media uses Silver Wolves but verifies that it’s Silverwolves.
“But we are just a bunch of rednecks,” he joked, “so I figured the media knew better than we did.”
Godfrey humorously noted that the school would have had some different nickname problems had they been named the Bayside Buccaneers as almost happened.
“The school was destined for this type of drama,” he added.
The school's actual name isn't always spelled correctly, either. Explorer John C. Frémont might prefer if his namesake school used the accent on the e. Others falsely believe there are two Es.
Parry laughs about that misspelling. She has a drawer full of 200 "Freemont" keychains in the principal's office that were accidentally made.
On the bright side, the manufacturer did get Silverwolves right.

Texto completo: VOGEL FRONT-RUNNER FOR LAKERS POSITION
LOS ANGELES -- Former Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel has emerged as the front-runner to be offered the Los Angeles Lakers' head-coaching job, ESPN reported.
Los Angeles reportedly has plans to hire Jason Kidd as an assistant coach for Vogel.
Vogel's emerging candidacy speaks to the significant influence of Lakers adviser Kurt Rambis and former coach Phil Jackson, whose opinions weigh heavily with owner Jeanie Buss. Vogel was the runner-up to Jeff Hornacek when Jackson hired a New York Knicks replacement for Derek Fisher in the summer of 2016.
The team seemed set to hire Tyronn Lue as the new coach, but a dispute during contract negotiations ended those talks, leaving Los Angeles to go further down its list of possible candidates.
COUSINS ON TRACK FOR EARLY RETURN
OAKLAND -- Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins, if he continues his recent progress, is on pace to return during the Western Conference final, Marc Stein of the New York Times reported.
Cousins has been out since April 15 when he tore a quadriceps muscle while chasing after a loose ball.
In 30 games this season, Cousins averaged 16.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.5 blocks in 25.7 minutes.
Game 1 of the Western Conference final is Tuesday.
BRIEFLY
BUCKS: Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said Saturday there are no guarantees guard Malcolm Brogdon will start Wednesday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final. Brogdon made his return May 8 in Game 5 of Milwaukee's second-round playoff series against Boston. He played 16 minutes and scored 10 points.
STAT OF THE DAY
0 - Points scored by Warriors guard Steph Curry in the first half of Friday's Game 6 victory. He finished with 33 points in what he called one of the best games of his career.

Texto completo: Ryan Reynolds is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood.
However, Reynolds said in a New York Times interview that he is not big on the vanity side of celebrity, saying his wife, Blake Lively, jokes about him only needing a drawer for his clothes rather than a closet.
Reynolds, who stars as the voice of Pikachu in the "Detective Pikachu" film opening this weekend, revealed that one of his favorite articles of clothing is a T-shirt — and it happens to be from Michigan.
"I have an old T-shirt that I've had for maybe 18 years," he told The New York Times. "It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don't even know where that is, but it's a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I've had a couple of people say, 'No way! That's from my hometown.' "
Zukey Lake Tavern is in Pinckney, a village in Livingston County. The bar sells various kinds of merchandise in different styles and colors, such as tie-dye hoodies and T-shirts, tank tops, women's V-neck shirts and hoodies with phrases such as, "Zukey Lake Tavern, it's on the way to Hell, Michigan."
Zukey Lake even has a section on its website called, "ZLT Around the World," with people from Pittsburgh to Scotland donning a tavern shirt.
"We're honored and privileged to have our name out there," said Jeff Plante, co-owner of Zukey Lake Tavern. "My partner and I are big fans of Ryan Reynolds. We even have a picture up of him wearing the shirt at the 'Smokin' Aces' premiere in 2007."
The tavern got its name from Zukey Lake, and was built after the end of Prohibition in the early 1930s by Maggie and Baldy Girard. The brothers also built several houses on the north shore of the lake, and the road where the tavern is located would be named after them, Girard Road.
In addition to its clothing, the bar is known for its roof deck tiki bar, "Lobster tail Tuesdays" and a Sunday breakfast buffet.
Plante said the tavern started selling retail in the early 1980s. Customers would get a free T-shirt when they ordered a large pizza.
Plante hopes to get in touch with Reynolds soon to offer him a new Zukey Lake Tavern T-shirt.
"I have an old T-shirt that I've had for maybe 18 years," Ryan Reynolds told The New York Times. "It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don't even know where that is, but it's a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I've had a couple of people say, 'No way! That's from my hometown.' "

Texto completo: El caso de Niels Högel, un enfermero alemán que resultó ser un asesino en serie , continúa inquietando a Alemania y a gran parte del mundo. Högel confesó haber matado a 43 pacientes pero las autoridades calculan que al menos 300 personas fueron víctimas de sus crímenes .
La pregunta que ahora se plantean los familiares de las vícitmas y la sociedad alemana en general es cómo este hombre pudo asesinar ininterrumpidamente a tantas personas en cinco años sin que nadie diera la voz de alarma . ¿No se dieron cuenta sus compañeros? ¿Y los supervisores de lo hospitales?
Niels Högel se enfrenta pronto a su tercer juicio desde 2006. En este está acusado de matar a 100 personas . 36 de ellas las mataría en la clínica principal de la pequeña ciudad de Oldenburg y otros 64 en el hospital de Delmenhorst, una zona residencial a 20 millas de Bremen.
Högel se trasladó del hospital de Oldenburg al de Delmenhorst con una carta de recomendación del primero de ellos que destacaba la capacidad del enfermero para trabajar “de manera independiente y concienzuda” y para afrontar situaciones de crisis “atenta y detenidamente” y con “habilidades técnicas correctas” .
La carta no hacía ninguna mención a las sospechas derivadas de la gran cantidad de muertes que habían ocurrido mientras Högel estaba de servicio. L a misiva de recomendación tampoco citaba que habían prohibido al enfermero estar en contacto con los pacientes .
Sin embargo, las mismas sospechas no tartaron en aparecer en el hospital de Delmenhorst, donde -según The New York Times– varios pacientes murieron bajo la supervisión de Högel en sus primeros cuatro meses como enfermero.
Högel, que ahora tiene 42 años, es considerado en Alemania uno de los asesinos en serie con más víctimas en tiempos de paz. Actualmente el hombre cumple cadena perpetua en la cárcel de Oldenburg.
Frank Lauxtermann, el primer compañero en testificar en su contra habla de la cultura alemana de hacer la vista gorda . Aunque al parecer los compañeros de Oldenburg habían hablado de él, ningunó presentó queja a los jefes. Según declaró una de las testigos, no llevaron el tema más allá por miedo o porque pensaban que no era su asunto en un país en el que mucha gente es muy celosa de su privacidad .
De hecho, Sebastian Bührmann, el juez que lleva el caso, ordenó investigar también a ocho de sus compañeros. Bührmann sospecha que los enfermeros podrían haber mentido a la corte u ocultado evidencia en el juicio actual para ocultar sus posibles negligencias . Ahora mismo dos doctores y dos jefes de enfermería del hospital Delmenhorst ya están acusados. Högel tendrá que testificar en sus juicios cuando haya un veredicto sobre su caso.
Otros antiguos compañeros del asesino en serie confeso dicen que se ganó la fama de poder manejar situaciones de vida o muerte. Por su parte, la acusación dice que esa era su estrategia ya que, en realidad, creaba situaciones en las que la vida y la muerte dependían de él.
321 de las 411 muertes que tuvieron lugar mientras Högel trabajó en el hospital de Delmenhorst ocurrieron en sus cambios de turno , según los registros. Un enfermero de este hospital sí que dio la voz de alarma pero, al parecer, los supervisores no hicieron nada al respecto.
Finalmente, en junio de 2005 una enfermera en prácticas fue más allá cuando descubrió que su compañero había desconectado la máquina que mantenía vivo a un paciente y vio en la basura los envoltorios de unos medicamentos no prescritos para él. Desde que descubrieron lo que había hecho hasta el final de su turno ese día, Högel acabó con la vida de su última víctima.
Karl-Heinz Beine, un neurólogo alemán, dijo a NYT que “Niels Högel forma parte de una minoría extrema”. El doctor, que investiga a asesinos en serie en las profesiones médicas desde 1989, dice que le sorprendió la falta de empatía de Högel incluso delante de las familias de las víctimas. Beine cree que el antiguo enfermero está motivado por el narcisismo y la falta de autoestima .

If you accept, the company can see how active you are, how much you sleep and whether you live a healthy life. How thoughtful! Then it can adjust your premiums accordingly. God forbid, you get sick and can't exercise for a while.
Meanwhile, I've heard rumors that a number of men have been known to visit the occasional porn site. Most would prefer that their particular proclivities remain private, and not passed on by hackers to their bosses, friends and relatives.
When your doctor asks you to input your medical history and medications on the office's online portal, it allows you easy access to vital information about your health. Unfortunately, it also allows hackers the same access.
When I saw those eerie photos of me on my computer, I put a Band-Aid over my laptop camera. But Band-Aid solutions don't help when we're bleeding information every moment of our lives. We need leadership that takes this threat seriously. Because it now threatens both our personal privacy and our democracy.
We have a president who doesn't seem concerned in the slightest about Russian hackers disrupting our 2020 election. Congress seems behind the curve on cyberthreats as well.
We are being overrun by cyberroaches, both foreign and domestic - and our exterminator isn't taking any calls.

Texto completo: Headnote Neighborhoods on the verge of changes as median sales prices move beyond reach for most Bostonians
At 105 Munroe Street in Rox-bury, a two-family house that sold for $715,000 in 2014 is listed for $1,195,000 five years later, a testament to the real estate industry's surging interest in the neighborhood. A few blocks over at 4 Wyoming Street, a three-bedroom condominium in a gut-rehabbed home is listed for $619,999.
As Roxbury's housing market heats up, along with that of every other neighborhood in the city, home prices have moved far beyond the reach of the average Roxbury resident. From Chinatown - a once majority-Chinese immigrant neighborhood where the average homeowner now earns $373,000 a year - to predominantly African American Mattapan, Boston's neighborhoods are undergoing changes driven by high rents and real estate prices and the vast disparities of wealth and income between whites, blacks and Latinos.
A 2015 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that the median net worth for white families is $247,500 versus just $ 8 for African American families, $3,020 for Puerto Ricans and $0 for Dominicans. With the median price for a single-family home in Boston at $580,000 as of 2017, most current Boston residents cannot afford a $3,600 monthly mortgage payment, let alone put down even a 10 percent down payment of $58,000.
Looking to buy in Roxbury? The average price for a single-family home there is $680,000, twice the cost of the average home in Brockton, according to data compiled by Boston Magazine. With a 4.05 percent interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, monthly mortgage payments, taxes and condo fees could easily cost more than $4,000 a month.
According to the real estate website Redfin's mortgage calculator, the maximum mortgage payment affordable to two people each earning Boston's median income of $66,758 is $2,615 a month.
A New York Times analysis that tracked date for predominantly African American neighborhoods found that in many urban census tracts, white buyers now outnumber black buyers. The Times reporters matched census data with 2012 data provided by banks under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to examine the income of residents, homeowners and white homebuyers in tracts across the country.
Four of the five census tracts the Times tracked in Boston's Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods did not show white buyers in the majority in 2012. One in Roxbury and one in Jamaica Plain did. But the economic disparities underscored in the data suggest that Boston's historically black and Latino neighborhoods are changing.
"It's all about the dollars and who has the most," says real estate broker Deborah Bernat. "The people who are able to close deals for the most part are people who have high incomes."
In a Roxbury census tract bounded by Westminster Avenue, Washington Street, Marcella, Highland, Cedar and Washington Streets, 51 percent of home buyers were white in 2012. While the white population in that area was 11 percent of the total, the average income of the new white homebuyers, at $118,000 a year, was more than twice that of that of area residents' $55,000.
In the formerly Latino-majority Jamaica Plain census tract bounded by Centre, Forbes, Chestnut, Boylston and Lamar-tine Streets, white buyers were 70 percent of the total. The white buyers' average income was $154,000.
In recent years, housing activists have been increasingly concerned that low- and moderate-income people are being pushed out of Boston's neighborhoods by high housing prices, in what many are referring to as a housing crisis. While there's little data available on how the housing market is affecting buyers of color, there are troubling signs.
In the predominantly Latino neighborhood of East Boston, declining school enrollment suggests an out-migration of families into neighboring towns including Revere and Chelsea.
In a Boston Foundation report released this week, researchers found that 1 in 4 home loans made to African Americans in the state were made to homebuyers in Brockton, a popular destination for black families buying homes.
Although homeownership among blacks and Latinos has increased over the last quarter-century, the number of blacks and Latinos living in Roxbury, the South End and Jamaica Plain has trended downward between 1990 and 2017, according the Boston Foundation report. In 2017, twice as many blacks bought homes in Brockton as in Boston, even though Boston is seven times larger than Brockton.
Housing crisis?
Mayor Martin Walsh has pursued a strategy focused on housing production, calling for the creation of 69,000 new units of housing in Boston by 2030 to meet the demand of the city's growing population.
Walsh's plan includes the creation of 16,000 units of housing affordable to moderate- and low-income individuals and families - 23 percent of the total.
City Councilor Lydia Edwards says the Walsh administration's market-based approach has done little to tame the city's rapidly climbing home prices. The New York Times report, showing homebuyers' incomes twice that of average nearby households underscores the limitations of market-based solutions, she says.
"The market will only support those who have the means," Edwards commented. "Building more units does not create more housing options."
Edwards, who has proposed a 6 percent real estate transfer tax on sales of more than $2 million, said the city could incentivize the creation of low-cost housing through tax relief deals that would allow developers to build large, affordable buildings.
"We come up with tax breaks to attract corporations like GE and Amazon," she said. "We have to be as aggressive in promoting housing that's affordable."
On the positive side, Edwards said the city's use of issuing bonds to preserve the affordability of reconstructed housing units at the Bunker Hill public housing development is an example of the kind of creativity needed to provide affordable housing options in Boston. She also cited the city's Acquisition Opportunity Program, which provides loans to nonprofit and private developers to acquire apartment buildings in exchange for a guarantee to keep rents affordable for at least 50 years.
Edwards says developers respond favorably to incentives when the city intervenes in the market.
"I personally think government should be a stabilizing force," she said. "For developers, it's just about numbers and profit. Just tell them how they can do it and provide the incentives and they should."

In a new set of rules, the Trump administration wants to let not just doctors but almost any health care worker or organization decline to provide, participate in or refer patients for any health service that violates their conscience or religion.
Also this week, the Trump administration is ordering prescription drugmakers to include list prices in their television ads for nearly all products.
And there’s yet another entry in the growing group of bills aimed at overhauling the nation’s health system. This one is “Medicare for America.”
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News, Joanne Kenen of Politico, Jen Haberkorn of the Los Angeles Times and Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico.
Also, Rovner interviews Joan Biskupic, author of “The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts.” Biskupic talks about the behind-the-scenes negotiations that led to the 2012 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
Robert Pear, who died this week, was the dean of health policy reporters and will be remembered not just for the many front-page stories he produced for The New York Times, but also as a generous and kind colleague who helped mentor many reporters new to the beat. The Trump administration’s announcement last week of new regulations to protect health care workers from having to do anything they believe violates their religious beliefs is a stronger policy than past Republicans have adopted. But it follows other efforts to expand past conservative policies, such as the current administration’s more stringent Title X family planning rules. The administration’s new rule requiring drugmakers to add list prices to their TV ads could confuse some consumers, since few of them actually pay that price. Their insurers often negotiate better prices, and other factors, such as geography and type of pharmacy, affect the consumer’s bottom line. President Donald Trump this week told Health and Human Services officials to work with Florida on its plan to import drugs from Canada to take advantage of lower prices there. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said he would see if it can be done without jeopardizing the safety of the drugs. That is the rub that his predecessors have used to stop importation efforts, dating to the 1990s. The increasing interest in Democratic proposals such as “Medicare for All,” which would set up a government-run health care system, and “Medicare for America,” which would offer a government-run option for consumers and businesses, suggests that a public option is not the political hot potato it was during the debate setting up the ACA. It’s also not clear whether consumers are ready to give up their current insurance. Tennessee is getting ready to ask federal officials for a major change in its Medicaid system. The state wants to switch to a block grant, in which its federal funding would be limited but would come with much more flexibility for spending. The proposal is likely to end up in court because advocates for the poor argue the change would cut off services to some people and would violate laws that have defined Medicaid.
Plus, for extra credit, the panelists recommend their favorite health policy stories of the week they think you should read too:
Julie Rovner: CNBC’s “ Insiders Describe Aggressive Growth Tactics at uBiome, the Health Start-Up Raided by the FBI Last Week,” by Christina Farr, and “ Health Tech Start-Up uBiome Suspends Clinical Operations Following FBI Raid, ” by Christina Farr and Angelica LaVito
Joanne Kenen: ProPublica and the New Yorker’s “ The Birth-Tissue Profiteers,” by Caroline Chen

'Art of the Deal' coauthor calls for Trump memoir to be pulled or 'recategorized' as fiction

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that he would leave it up to Attorney General William Barr to decide whether Robert Mueller, the special counsel, may testify before Congress on the Russia investigation.
His comments were a seeming reversal, since Trump wrote over the weekend on Twitter that Mueller should not be allowed to appear before Congress. Barr has told lawmakers that he has no objection to letting Mueller talk to them.
Trump's comments came in a surprise, 45-minute news conference in the Roosevelt Room, his first since the release of the special counsel's report.
New York Times
Coauthor says Trump memoir should be fiction
Decorated in eye-catching gold lettering, President Trump's 1987 memoir — a self-described "common sense guide to personal finance" — is touted as "a firsthand account of the rise of America's foremost deal-maker."
But following news this week that Trump reported more than $1 billion in financial losses to the IRS during a perceived high point in his business career, the ghostwriter of "The Art of the Deal," once called an "unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur," has another description for the book: fiction.
"I'd be fine if Random House simply took the book out of print," Tony Schwartz, a vocal critic of the president, tweeted on Wednesday. "Or recategorized it as fiction."
Schwartz's tweet comes after The New York Times found that Trump reported staggering losses between 1985 and 1994 — a period of time in which the president, largely due to the success of his book, had achieved widespread fame for appearing to be a self-made billionaire gifted with seemingly unrivaled business acumen. The Times report, however, painted a starkly different picture.
"In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," the Times wrote, pointing out that by the time the best-selling memoir was released, Trump was already in "deep financial distress."
On Wednesday, the book's portrayal of Trump's business prowess once again came under fierce scrutiny from Schwartz, who has openly expressed remorse for ghostwriting it.
In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Schwartz reiterated that if he were to rename the book he would call it "The Sociopath."
"He has no guilt," Schwartz said of Trump. "All he wants to do is make the case that he would like to be true. While I do think he's probably aware that more walls are closing around him than ever before, he does not experience the world in a way that an ordinary human being would."
Washington Post
Crowd at Trump rally cheers violent suggestion
A roar rose from the crowd of thousands of Trump supporters in Panama City Beach, Fla., on Wednesday night as President Trump noted yet again that Border Patrol agents can't use weapons to deter migrants. "How do you stop these people?" he asked.
"Shoot them!" someone yelled from the crowd, according to reporters on the scene and attendees.
The audience cheered. Supporters seated behind Trump and clad in white baseball caps bearing the letters "USA" laughed and applauded.
"That's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement," Trump replied, smiling and shaking his head. "Only in the Panhandle."
Though Trump didn't explicitly endorse the suggestion to shoot migrants, his joking response raised concerns that he was tacitly encouraging extrajudicial killings and brutality against asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants. The president has long been accused of endorsing acts of violence through his incendiary rhetoric and allusions to the potential for violence at his rallies, a charge that members of his administration deny.
Reached for comment by The Washington Post on Trump's reaction at the Florida rally, Matt Wolking, deputy communications director for the Trump campaign, pointed to a response he had given to many critics on Twitter. The president, he noted in his tweet, had said specifically that Border Patrol wouldn't use firearms to stop migrants from entering the country.
The incendiary remark from the crowd came as Trump, standing before roughly 7,000 people who had gathered at an outdoor amphitheater in the hurricane-damaged Gulf Coast town, railed against what he described as an "invasion" of migrants attempting to enter the United States. Often, he claimed, only "two or three" border agents will contend with the arrival of "hundreds and hundreds of people."
"And don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons," Trump said of the border agents. "We can't. Other countries do. We can't. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?"

Santa Fe Opera unveils 2020 lineup, O'Keeffe-inspired poster for 2019

Texto completo: The Santa Fe Opera 2020 season lineup opens with a pair of classics, stirs in some Wagnerian grandeur and spices the results with the tale of a French diplomat who falls for a Chinese opera star.
The company premiere of Antonín Dvorák's “Rusalka” will complete the opera's 64th year, SFO general director Robert Meya announced on Wednesday.
Perpetual favorites “The Barber of Seville” and “The Magic Flute” will helm opening weekend. The 2020 season runs from July 3 through Aug. 29, 2020.
Meya also revealed the 2019 season poster features “The Beyond,” a minimalist landscape oil by Georgia O'Keeffe. This marks the first SFO poster of O'Keeffe's work in a collaboration between the opera and the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.
Composer Huang Ruo's “M. Butterfly” will join this season's “The Thirteenth Child” and the 2021 season's “The Lord of Cries” in a trio of world premieres, Meya said.
“This was masterminded by (former SFO director) Charles MacKay,” Meya said.
Santa Fe premiered Ruo's opera “Dr. Sun Yat-Sen” in 2014. That piece opened in Hong Kong but was banned in mainland China.
“The New York Times quote was that some American company needed to do this work,” Meya said.
“M. Butterfly” was David Henry Hwang's Tony Award-winning and Pulitzer Prize finalist Broadway play. The 1993 film starred Jeremy Irons.
The libretto was inspired by the true story of a French diplomat who carried on a 20-year love affair with a star of the Peking Opera, concealing a secret at its heart. The story's many parallels with Puccini's “Madama Butterfly” echo in the new opera's music.
The 2020 season will open with “The Barber of Seville,” Rossini's most popular comedy.
“We think it's a very fun and festive way to kick off the season,” Meya said. “It's set in Seville, and there's an almost slapstick element of comedy.”
The libretto traces the efforts of the clever Figaro to win Count Almaviva his chosen bride Rosina.
The young cast includes Emily D'Angelo (Rosina) and former SFO apprentice Jack Swanson (Count Almaviva).
The Canadian mezzo-soprano D'Angelo is in her second year as a member of the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program.
“She's one of the fast-rising mezzos,” Meya said.
The SFO stage crew is busy rebuilding Santa Fe's 2010 set for “The Magic Flute.”
Former SFO apprentice Audrey Luna will sing the role of the Queen of the Night.
Luna possesses an “intergalactic voice,” Meya said. “She has the highest range I've ever heard.”
“Tristan and Isolde” marks only the second time Santa Fe has staged anything by Wagner, because of the difficulty of casting and the need for extra musicians and rehearsal time.
Tamara Wilson will sing the role in her company debut. Well-known New Zealand tenor Simon O'Neill is Tristan.
“Rusalka” is the first Dvorák opera to appear at Santa Fe. With echoes of Hans Christian Andersen's “The Little Mermaid,” the opera weaves the tale of a water nymph who pays the highest price for the chance to love a human being.

Texto completo: Ryan Reynolds is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood.
However, Reynolds said in a New York Times interview that he is not big on the vanity side of celebrity, saying his wife, Blake Lively, jokes about him only needing a drawer for his clothes rather than a closet.
Reynolds, who stars as the voice of Pikachu in the "Detective Pikachu" film opening this weekend, revealed that one of his favorite articles of clothing is a T-shirt — and it happens to be from Michigan.
"I have an old T-shirt that I've had for maybe 18 years," he told The New York Times. "It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don't even know where that is, but it's a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I've had a couple of people say, 'No way! That's from my hometown.'"
Zukey Lake Tavern is in Pinckney, a village in Livingston County. The bar sells various kinds of merchandise in different styles and colors, such as tie-dye hoodies and T-shirts, tank tops, women's V-neck shirts and hoodies with phrases such as, "Zukey Lake Tavern, it's on the way to Hell, Michigan."
Zukey Lake even has a section on its website called, "ZLT Around the World," with people from Pittsburgh to Scotland donning a tavern shirt.
"We're honored and privileged to have our name out there," said Jeff Plante, co-owner of Zukey Lake Tavern. "My partner and I are big fans of Ryan Reynolds. We even have a picture up of him wearing the shirt at the 'Smokin' Aces' premiere in 2007."
The tavern got its name from Zukey Lake, and was built after the end of Prohibition in the early 1930s by Maggie and Baldy Girard. The brothers also built several houses on the north shore of the lake, and the road where the tavern is located would be named after them, Girard Road.
In addition to its clothing, the bar is known for its roof deck tiki bar, "Lobster tail Tuesdays" and a Sunday breakfast buffet.
Plante said the tavern started selling retail in the early 1980s. Customers would get a free T-shirt when they ordered a large pizza.
Plante hopes to get in touch with Reynolds soon to offer him a new Zukey Lake Tavern T-shirt.

Lakers' Courtship of Lue Is Said to Sour

Texto completo: Talks between the Los Angeles Lakers and Tyronn Lue to install Lue as the team's head coach abruptly collapsed Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
The sides were unable to agree on contract terms, according to the people, with the Lakers willing to offer Lue only a three-year deal worth nearly $ 20 million -- matching the time remaining on LeBron James's contract with the team. Lue wanted a longer deal more in line with his status as a championship-winning coach.
Also among the factors leading to the breakdown was the insistence of Lakers management to have final say over the choice of Lue's assistant coaches, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.
The Los Angeles Times first reported Wednesday that the Lakers and Lue had walked away from each other. It was not immediately clear if there were any hope of reviving negotiations.
Lue and Monty Williams, the former New Orleans Pelicans coach, quickly emerged as the two finalists for the post, which became open when the Lakers mutually parted ways with Luke Walton on April 12. Shortly thereafter, Walton struck a deal to coach the Sacramento Kings.
Having coached James to three successive trips to the N.B.A. finals in Cleveland, and to the Cavaliers' first title in 2016, Lue was widely billed as the favorite to succeed Walton.
Lue was largely the favorite among Lakers officials as well -- yet there was some resistance. Among the Lakers' many advisers to the owner Jeanie Buss, at least two raised concerns that reuniting Lue with James would give James too much power in the organization, according to the people.
Aside from Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka, Buss is known to rely heavily on Kurt Rambis, the former Lakers player and coach, for counsel, as well as on his wife, Linda Rambis, and on Tim Harris, the team's chief operating officer.
Lue appeared to have a clear path to the job as of last Friday, when Williams and the Phoenix Suns reached terms on a reported five-year deal. Lue is the only Lakers candidate who has been offered the post.
Lue was pictured over the weekend with a Lakers-themed birthday cake while in Las Vegas to watch the Canelo Álvarez vs. Daniel Jacobs fight -- which James also attended. But negotiations have been bumpy all week, according to the people.
Lue had agreed to make Frank Vogel, the former Indiana and Orlando head coach, his top assistant with the Lakers, according to the people. The Lakers, however, wanted Lue to accept Jason Kidd, the former Nets and Milwaukee head coach, as his top assistant after Kidd also interviewed for the head post, according to a report from ESPN.
Lue, Williams, Kidd and the Miami Heat assistant coach Juwan Howard are the only candidates who have interviewed with the Lakers to date.
The Athletic reported Wednesday night that the Lakers now plan to interview Vogel; Mike Woodson, the former Knicks and Atlanta coach; and Lionel Hollins, the former Nets and Memphis coach.
The New York Times reported late in the regular season that dismay about Walton's staff was among the reasons that Lakers management had soured on him before the abrupt resignation of Magic Johnson as team president on April 9.
In June 2014, Lue was hired by the Cavaliers as an assistant coach to work under David Blatt. Lue was promoted to head coach within a season and a half when the Cavaliers, despite an Eastern Conference-leading record of 30-11, dismissed Blatt in January 2016.
Lue, 42, is a former first-round draft pick who spent his first three N.B.A. seasons as a player with the Lakers. He won two championship rings as a lightly used reserve guard in 2000 and 2001, and he is one of only two coaches, along with Miami's Erik Spoelstra, to lead James to a championship.
Lue posted a 128-77 record in two and a half seasons as James's coach with the Cavaliers. After James joined the Lakers through free agency in July, Cleveland started the 2018-19 season 0-6 and dismissed Lue.
The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Phil Jackson, the former Lakers coach (and Buss's former fiancé), and Johnson had told Buss that they endorsed the hiring of Lue.
In James's debut season with the Lakers, L.A. rose to fourth in the Western Conference after a Christmas Day rout of the Golden State Warriors on the Warriors' floor -- but a groin strain James sustained in that victory started a spiral that left the Lakers with a record of 37-45 at season's end.
James made eight consecutive trips to the N.B.A. finals, winning three of them, and 13 consecutive playoff appearances before the Lakers' fade.

Blatter Wants the 80 Watches He Left at Work

Texto completo: Sepp Blatter wants his watches back.
Blatter, the former president of FIFA whose yearslong leadership of soccer's global governing body ended in scandal, also wants some pension payments and for his former employer to clear his name. But his current focus is a strangely personal dispute over the fate of dozens of luxury watches that he said he was unable to retrieve from FIFA headquarters after he was forced out of the organization in 2015.
Blatter, 83, told The New York Times in an interview Wednesday that he had grown so frustrated with FIFA's failure to return as many as 80 watches -- from brands like Patek Philippe, IWC and Omega -- that he was including them in a lawsuit he plans to file against the organization that also will include demands for pension payments and clarification about his compensation arrangements to show that "I am not a thief."
Blatter is serving a six-year ban from soccer, a sad denouement to an association with FIFA that dated back 41 years before he was ousted in the aftermath of a sweeping corruption scandal.
The problem, Blatter said, is that since the day he was suspended by FIFA, in October 2015, he has been unable to retrieve his personal belongings, notably an extensive watch collection built over decades -- dating to the days he worked for the Swiss watchmaker Longines. Blatter said in hindsight that he should have kept the watches at his apartment in Zurich, but that as a single man, he believed they would be safer at FIFA's well-guarded headquarters.
Last year, after a back and forth with FIFA's legal department and the organization's secretary general, Fatma Samoura, Blatter was reunited with 120 timepieces, though not what he described as his "high technology collection." The fight over those watches continues. Blatter said they have high sentimental and monetary value; each watch, he estimated, is worth $ 5,000 to $ 20,000 -- figures that would value the collection at $ 400,000, but likely much more.
"This is a question of respect, and I've reached the end of my temper," said Blatter, who continues to live in an apartment that he rents from FIFA. "I think it's not too much to ask to give me back personal belongings."
FIFA's deputy secretary general, Alasdair Bell, said Blatter was provided with all the watches he had requested and had even signed a receipt, before surprising the organization months later claiming some items were missing.
"We did what was asked of us," he said. As for the pension, Bell added, Blatter receives "what he's legally entitled to."
He added, "If he files a claim, obviously we'll defend any claims on the basis we act in conformity of our legal obligations, including with Mr. Blatter."
Blatter's watches are not the only belongings of ousted officials that have remained at FIFA. A vintage Mercedes owned by Chuck Blazer, the corrupt former American official whose testimony helped the Justice Department secure prosecutions against dozens of his former associates, remains in its parking space in FIFA's subterranean garage. Blazer died in 2017, four years after secretly pleading guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering and agreeing to help investigators.
Luxury watches have had a strangely outsize role within soccer circles, bringing down officials and leading to embarrassing revelations. In 2014, for example, FIFA struggled to persuade members to return dozens of $ 26,000 wristwatches distributed to them by the organizers of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. And after he was arrested in the 2015 scandal, one former FIFA official secured his release from custody, in part, by turning over 11 watches and his wife's wedding ring.
Just last month, Reinhard Grindel, the president of Germany's soccer federation and a member of FIFA's governing council, was forced to resign after it was revealed he had accepted a designer watch from a Ukrainian colleague.
Blatter once even invoked the slogan of his former watchmaker employer to chastise the news media during a fiery 2011 news conference. Snapping back at one question, Blatter lectured the reporter who asked it with the line, "elegance is an attitude," a motto used by Longines since 1999.
Years after his ouster, Blatter continues to feel wronged by events at FIFA. He insisted the men he grew to know intimately over decades in soccer, including some he had agreements with over television contracts, must have engaged in dishonest conduct without his knowledge, and far from FIFA's headquarters. And he claimed that he never received the $ 12 million bonus he was secretly promised in his last employment contract. He wants FIFA to clear up the matter, saying the revelation that he arranged for a multimillion-dollar payday during FIFA's darkest hour represents a stain on his character.
Blatter said he would not pursue the $ 12 million, however, if FIFA returned the rest of his watches. "For me this is really personal," he said.
But he is still seeking pension payments that were forced through by members of the executive committee -- including several that ended up being charged in the United States indictments -- that allow for retired officials to continue to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars for what at the time amounted to a few days of work a year.
Blatter earned tens of millions of dollars at FIFA, and he says he continues to live comfortably. He does not need the money, he insisted, but should receive what he is entitled to. According to FIFA's statutes at the time, the president was not entitled to pension benefits established for members of the executive committee. As a permanent employee of FIFA, Blatter had separate pension arrangements.
Much of Blatter's frustration is rooted in what he perceives as disrespectful treatment from FIFA; he insisted that despite the corruption scandal, he left FIFA in a healthy state and should be recognized for that.
"I'm not going to die about it," he said of the money, "but I want to die in dignity, and I want them to say I was not a thief in FIFA."
But first, he wants his watches.

Texto completo: Then what does all this -- the yacht, the bronze tower, the casinos -- really mean to you?
Props for the show.
And what is the show?
The show is "Trump" and it is sold-out performances everywhere.
-- Donald J. Trump, interview with Playboy magazine, 1990
The show, as it turned out, had been going on for longer than people realized -- long before it ended up on NBC and Fox News. The set design was not subtle, but it was effective. And the production went far more over budget than we knew, until now.
A New York Times investigation into President Trump's taxes published Tuesday revealed that even during his 1980s "Art of the Deal" heyday -- when he was posing for glossy magazines in his Fabergé egg of a penthouse, buying a 281-foot boat from the Sultan of Brunei, going on "Donahue" and "Oprah" -- he was losing staggering sums of money: over a billon dollars, with a b, by 1995.
By early Wednesday, "Fox & Friends," the president's favorite morning show and support system, had transformed into an emergency finance tutorial on why down is actually up. Squinting at his notes, the host Brian Kilmeade argued that the president's losses -- "if you consider a billion dollars a lot of money" -- showed that "he's a bold businessman."
Meanwhile, the host Ainsley Earhardt assured us that "the voter" still looks at Trump and sees a successful, rich man because "he was campaigning on the trail with his plane behind him that's as big as a Delta jet, with his name on it."
Ms. Earhardt may just have been telling her most important viewer what he wanted to hear. But she did have a point. President Trump's career has been, foremost and for decades, a media production. And in a media production, as he well knows, what sticks with people are the images, the symbols -- the props.
The green-eyeshade origin story of Donald Trump's finances is debt and losses and money gifted from Dad. But the visual story, which he has told for decades, has been: A private helicopter. A golden tower. A palace in Florida.
Donald Trump's entire career, arguably, has been a bet that people will remember the pictures longer and better than the words.
Has he been wrong? Those early years of losses chronicled in the Times investigation came exactly as he was branding himself the braggadocious face of Reagan-era capitalism, and the media and Hollywood gladly let him.
In 1987, with an adjusted gross income of - $ 4.5 million, he released "The Art of the Deal," which mythologized him as a Manhattan money magnet. In 1989 (- $ 90.3 million), he put his face on a board game with the slogan, in gold print, "It's not whether you win or lose, but whether you win!" In 1992 (- $ 751.1 million), he welcomed Macaulay Culkin in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" to the lush lobby of the Plaza Hotel, which was about to be taken off his hands in real life.
That image, and the value it gave to the properties he'd slapped his surname on, was arguably a form of leverage. The agreement he reached with creditors in the early 1990s provided him an allowance to keep up appearances, the better to keep up the price of the assets. The show had to go on, or else someone would get stuck with the bill.
So the show went on. It was no secret by the 1990s, if you read New York newspapers, that Donald Trump had gone through financial disaster. But if you just watched the talk shows and sitcoms that he appeared on, he still had his flash, his respect and his props. Samantha eyed him up on "Sex and the City." He showed up on "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" with Marla Maples and a briefcase of cash.
[Video: Donald Trump cameo on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1994) Watch on YouTube.]
Donald Trump made himself, like a B-roll shot of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the media's go-to visual symbol for "wealth." So he was a natural choice for Mark Burnett to cast as the host of "The Apprentice." Reality TV is the art of big, unsubtle symbols, and he had been producing his life as a reality TV show before reality TV existed. What matters there is what's in the camera frame, not what's in the accounting office.
Big business success, real business success, is boring and untelegenic and has to be explained. No one has to explain a jumbo jet and a ton of marble and brass. "What if ... you could have it all?" asked the opening credits of "The Apprentice," and the show could only do that because Donald Trump had been amassing, like a semiotician, a trove of visual signifiers of "it all."
"The Apprentice," of course, made sure that for over a decade, NBC's viewers would see the future president surrounded by stage-managed images of luxury and power. But it also relied heavily on the props he brought with him. He flies in his Trump-branded helicopter in the show's introduction. The show gushes over his gilt apartment and his plane. He was shot, again and again, coming down a gleaming escalator, an image he cribbed for his campaign kickoff.
All of this, we're seeing, was a production financed at the outset by heavy losses, each rolled over into a new project, with new partners invested in maintaining the brand's value regardless of the facts. He parlayed his 1980s flash into pop-culture ubiquity; he parlayed that into reality-TV stardom; he parlayed that into a weekly commentary gig on "Fox & Friends"; he parlayed that into conservative base adulation; and he parlayed that into real estate on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Donald Trump's business career, it seems, does not hold up robustly to scrutiny. But his media career -- his principal career -- has been a largely successful bet that it is far more important to seem like a thing than to actually be that thing.
The cost of creating that image, it's turning out, was substantial. But the payoff? Priceless.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: During Donald Trump's two-plus years as president, this column has pointed out the many ways this poor excuse for a leader is not making America great again despite the unimaginative slogan and those silly red baseball caps.
Instead, he has spent his time in office chipping away at America's greatness. Whether it's the environment, the desperate fight against climate change, the enforcement of anti-trust laws, relations with our allies or just simply trust in our justice system, Trump and his gang of incompetents have turned back the clock on decades of progress.
One of the prime examples I've frequently pointed out is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an outgrowth of the reforms put in place by the Obama administration following the Wall Street-induced Great Recession.
Just how bad this dismantling of a government agency aimed at protecting consumers from financial fraud and unfair business practices has been was documented in a recent New York Times Magazine piece entitled no, not Make America Great Again but "Make America Pay Again."
The report by investigative reporter Nicholas Confessore exposes how the sarcastic and cocky Mick Mulvaney got Trump's blessing to be the interim director of the new agency after its first director, former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray, a Barack Obama appointee, decided to retire.
To put Mulvaney who also was Trump's budget director in charge was ludicrous on its face. As a bomb-throwing Tea Party congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney, now Trump's chief of staff, fought hard to kill the CFPB's formation. The bureau was the brainchild of then-consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren before she became a U.S. senator.
After years of research, Warren concluded that consumers often got in over their heads not because they were greedy or lacked self-discipline, but because sophisticated predatory lenders could easily outmatch them. She convinced Congress and Obama that financial institutions needed an independent watchdog to push back on exorbitant banking fees, usurious interest rates and other unfair practices, that in many cases, were illegal in the first place.
During the fight to create the CFPB, then-South Carolina congressman Mulvaney called the CFPB a "joke" in a "sick, sad kind of way" and described it as a "rogue agency." He didn't mention, of course, that financial interests and especially the notorious payday loan industry were his big campaign contributors.
Putting a person like Mulvaney in charge of an agency that he despises is apparently Trump's idea of making America great again. He's done so with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, Department of Energy and countless other smaller agencies since becoming president.
The American people may not be fully aware of it yet, but Trump's dissembling of rules and regulations on everything from creating a level playing field between financiers and consumers to protecting clean water and air will come back to haunt them in the not too distant future.
Mulvaney's first and major contribution to Trump's "MAGA" hoax was to free the payday lenders from rules that Cordray had scheduled to go into effect capping interest rates and fees that the payday cabal could charge their borrowers, most of them the most financially vulnerable.
Research by the Pew Charitable Trusts, for example, showed that the average payday customer paid $55 in fees to borrow $375 for two weeks when the customer's next paycheck arrived. Most of the loans went to pay for things like rent or the utility bill.
Most, of course, couldn't come up with the $375 next payday and were forced to roll over the loan for two more weeks, and then again and again. This became particularly acute during the Great Recession of '07 and '08. Interests rates typically averaged 600 percent on an annual basis. In short, as Confessore pointed out, the payday loan outfits earned a fortune from the working poor.
Mulvaney and, by extension, Trump, obviously don't see a problem with that, in effect proclaiming it's OK for the big guys to fleece the poor. The poor don't write big campaign checks, after all.
And that, folks, is just one way how Trump and his gang of pliant followers are making America great again. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Tony-winning writer, young star usher ‘Flamingo Kid’ to stage in Hartford

Texto completo: There are folks dreaming of bookend hits for Darko Tresnjak’s tenure as artistic director of Hartford Stage.
Tresnjak’s first musical for Hartford Stage, “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder” in 2012, transferred to Broadway the following year and earned four Tony Awards, including Best Musical. His last show before leaves the venue, a musical inspired by the 1984 Garry Marshall film “The Flamingo Kid,” opens Thursday, May 9, and runs through June 9.
The new musical features the same Tony-winning book writer, Robert L. Freedman, and a promising lead actor in Jimmy Brewer, who landed the part of Long Island cabana boy Jeffrey Winnick while he was still attending Carnegie Mellon in 2018.
“I was so grateful just to get a chance to audition for this,” said Brewer in a phone chat during rehearsals recently, recalling his overnight bus from Pittsburgh for the audition that was three hours late due to a snowstorm.
Brewer took a year off after high school for acting and did land a few regional gigs along with a guest role on TV’s “Blue Bloods.” But he’s glad he went to college “because I’m actually using a lot of the techniques my teachers have taught me in the rehearsal room, to be as professional and mature and bring as much of myself to the role as I can.”
The plot: In the summer of ’63, against the wishes of his father, Brooklyn teen Jeffrey leaves behind his blue-collar roots for an exciting job at the El Flamingo — a posh private club. He meets Carla, a forward-thinking young woman from California. The music, romance and beach are great — until tensions grow between father and son after a slick club member takes Jeffrey under his wing.
“I feel like so much of what he (Jeffrey) wants at that point in his life is exactly what I want,” said Brewer, who is from Bay Shore, Long Island. “He’s got this need to get out of Brooklyn and even though he’s 18, I’m 23, I’m not so far (off). I’ve got this need, and I feel like a lot of my generation is struggling to separate themselves from their parents in a lot of ways.”
Brewer said his character makes some decisions that lead him to a bad place.
“What I want the audience to leave with is a sense of knowing what Jeffrey has learned, and that we all can just be a little kinder to each other — knowing how to decide right from wrong not just for yourself but how it affects those around you.”
Composer Scott Frankel’s music is “so perfect,” said Brewer. “And I kind of think musical theater is so incredible because it has all the elements of a play where you can follow a story on stage. But the music really takes care of the emotional journey of it, and the way Scott writes a complete, huge range of things from uptempo to Latin dance numbers to incredible, melt-like-butter ballads, it’s really cool.”
Lyricist Freedman excels, too, said Brewer, and “the arc takes you on a journey that not every storyteller can do.”
Freedman, in a phone interview, said he was looking for a new collaborator after “Gentleman’s Guide” and he admired Frankel’s work on shows like “War Paint” and “Grey Gardens.” They met and Frankel pitched an idea for a “Flamingo Kid” musical.
“Dirty Dancing” comes to mind, with its coming-of-age story. But that had more jukebox tunes; these are original.
“They’re all new songs,” said Freedman. “Some of them are deliberately written to put you in mind of the music of that era, which Scott is a huge fan of and is very steeped in. And some of them are ... more musical-theater songs, if you will. But they’re all used to tell the story.”
As for writing the book and the lyrics, said Freedman, “I like it when I have both of those jobs because it’s a totally integrated way of writing for me. So I don’t stop telling the story when the song starts.”
Funny moments come in and out of songs, but there is more to it than comedy.
“One of the things I love about this story is that it’s also at times quite moving because it’s about families,” said Freedman. “And, specifically, it’s about fathers and sons, and that’s actually what attracted me to the story almost more than the period. ...
“The story about fathers and sons, the coming-of-age story, we all can relate to that. I think it’s natural to rebel and to think that your parents are old-fashioned and they don’t get it the way you do,” Freedman said. “... It’s no less relevant today.”
There is comedy in Freedman’s writing, agreed Brewer, especially portraying the culture clash of polite Jeffrey and upper-class “bratty kids who don’t really respect their parents the way that Jeffrey has been taught to respect his.”
Set in the summer of 1963, said Freedman, “it’s sort of the last gasp before everything really changed in our country — between the Kennedy assassination and civil rights and Vietnam and the women’s movement.”
Asked how the show is transferring to the stage, Freedman said, “I’m actually thrilled by everything that is happening here. We have such a talented cast, enormously talented, and some of them are Broadway veterans (Adam Heller, Liz Larsen and Samantha Massell, who shined in Goodspeed’s “Rags”) and some are newcomers. ... It’s very inspiring.” He also cited direction by Tresnjak (who scored another musical hit with “Anastasia” in 2016-17) and other creative types at Hartford Stage, which he called “a wonderful, nurturing environment.”
The 1984 telling begged for some changes, Freedman said, in the female roles that were “slim and marginal. ... And we have given all the female characters much more depth and larger roles.”
“It’s less about having to be politically correct about the MeToo Movement per se and more about using this as an opportunity to show where men and women were in 1963, knowing what we know in 2019.”
There are smaller tweaks every day as the show finds its feet, Freedman said.
“I am somebody who actually enjoys the editing process,” Freedman said, “because I like seeing how a cut here and cut there, or an addition here or there, makes a piece better. And you can’t know that when you’re just in your own room writing. You have to see it on its feet.
“And then of course, the audience starts coming May 9, and they are another part of the picture; they are a collaborator because they’re going to tell us, more than anybody, what’s really working and what’s not. ... You can feel sort of a collective heartbeat with an audience.”
Freedman called Brewer not only talented and a hard worker but “incredibly genuine. I think that one of the reasons he stood out for us is he lacked a kind of slick showbiz aura. That he really felt like the real guy, you know?”
Also, said Freedman, quoting a word in the script about this Jewish family, “he’s a mensch; he’s a really good human being.”
Brewer’s father taught him trumpet when he was growing up, which Jimmy said is maybe the most important skill he has carried with him to musical theater. “I’ve always had minimal trouble picking up music; it’s extremely valuable to a creative team to have someone who can just go on the fly with the material.”
Like his character ultimately, Brewer is tight with his father, James, who is seen smiling with him in social media photos. “He’s like my personal publicist,” Jimmy laughs.
Freedman said with the very different “Gentleman’s Guide,” its creators and others hoped it would go to New York “but we were just hoping to have a production. ... And we kind of got discovered here by the New York Times and that sent us on a road to Broadway. And now, having had that experience, here we are again. We’re not unknown anymore. but you start off fresh every time.”

Texto completo: President Donald Trump reportedly lost more than $1 billion over a ten-year period -- and he avoided paying taxes for eight years during that time due to the losses.
The revelation comes amid a brewing battle between Democrats in Congress and the Trump administration about lawmakers' access to the president's tax returns for 2013-2018.
In 1985, Trump reported losses of $46. 1 million from his businesses, which included his casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings, according to a report from the New York Times. The majority of his losses came between 1990 and 1991, when he lost more than $250 million each year, the Times reported.
In all, between 1985 to 1994, Trump lost $1. 17 billion, according to the Times.
As a result of his losses, the New York businessman did not have to pay taxes for eight of the 10 years, the Times also reported. The newspaper did not analyze Trump's official tax returns, but transcripts of those documents.
The White House did not respond to request for comment.
Representatives for Trump repeatedly pushed back on the bombshell report.
A senior official in a statement initially told the Times that Trump "got massive depreciation and tax shelter because of large-scale construction and subsidized developments" and claimed that is why Trump has called for changes to the tax laws.

However, Trump's lawyer, Charles Harder, in a statement issued to the Times Saturday criticized the paper's characterization of Trump's tax information, saying it was "demonstrably false" and the paper's reporting was "highly inaccurate. "
On Tuesday, Harder issued another statement claiming that IRS transcripts "particularly before the days of electronic filing are notoriously inaccurate. " The president's lawyer, however, did not provide any specific errors in the information reported by Times.
A former director of research, analysis and statistics at the IRS, Mark Mazur, told the Times that the transcripts are "handy" summaries of tax returns that have been used to analyze economic trends and set national policy and had gone through quality control for decades.
In addition, the Times reported that its source provided transcripts of the tax returns of Fred Trump, the president's father, which the newspaper was able to verify against the father's actual tax returns because of its previous investigation and reporting.
The report comes amid a fight between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers in the House who are seeking to obtain the president's 2013-2018 tax returns.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday rejected a request from House Democrats to obtain Trump's tax returns from the IRS, which is part of the Treasury Department.

Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. , who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, last month requested the president's tax returns since 2013.
Mnuchin called the request "unprecedented" and claimed it "presents serious constitutional questions. " He denied the request per guidance from the Department of Justice, and contended that "the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. "

FACEBOOK'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IT'S RUN BY PEOPLE WHO LACK THE WISDOM AND HUMILITY TO USE THEIR POWER RESPONSIBLY

Texto completo: Over the past several years we've learned a lot about the unintended consequences of social media. Platforms intended to bring us closer together make us angrier and more isolated. Platforms aimed at democratizing speech empower demagogues. Platforms celebrating community violate our privacy in ways we scarcely realize and serve as conduits for deceptions hiding in plain sight. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="68">
Now Facebook has announced that it has permanently banned Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos and a few other despicable people from its social platforms. What could possibly go wrong?
The issue isn't whether the people in question deserve censure. They do. Or that the forms of speech in which they traffic have redeeming qualities. They don't.
Nor is the issue that Facebook has a moral duty to protect the free-speech rights of Messrs. Farrakhan, Jones and their cohorts. It doesn't. With respect to freedom of speech, the First Amendment says nothing more than that Congress shall make no law abridging it. A public company such as Facebook - like a private university or a family-owned newspaper - has broad latitude to feature or censor, platform or de-platform, whatever and whoever it wants. Facebook's house, Facebook's rules.
The issue is much simpler: Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg and the other young lords of Silicon Valley to be good stewards of the world's digital speech?
I don't, but not because conservatives believe (sometimes with good reason) that the Valley is culturally, politically and possibly algorithmically biased against them. As with liberalism in academia, the left-wing tilt in tech may be smug and self-serving, but it doesn't stop conservatives from getting their messages across. It certainly doesn't keep Republicans from winning elections.
The deeper problem is the overwhelming concentration of technical, financial and moral power in the hands of people who lack the training, experience, wisdom, trustworthiness, humility and incentives to exercise that power responsibly.
That much should have been clear by the way in which Facebook's leaders attempted to handle their serial scandals over the past two years. Ordering opposition research on their more prominent critics. Consistently downplaying the extent of Russian meddling on their platform. Berating company employees who tried to do something about that meddling. Selling the personal information of millions of its users to an unscrupulous broker so that the data could be used for political purposes.
Now Facebook wants to refurbish its damaged reputation by promising its users much more privacy via encrypted services as well as more aggressively policing hate speech on the site. Come again? This is what Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer, called "the judo move: In a world where everything is encrypted and doesn't last long, entire classes of scandal are invisible to the media."
In other words, it's a cynical exercise in abdication dressed as an act of responsibility. Knock a few high-profile bigots down. Throw a thick carpet over much of the rest. Then figure out how to extract a profit from your new model.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="78">
Assuming that's Facebook's deeper calculation - it's hard to think of another - then it may wind up solving the company's short-term problems. But it might also produce two equally dismal results.
On the one hand, Facebook will be hosting the worst kinds of online behavior. In a public note in March, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that encryption will help facilitate "truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism and extortion." (For that, he promised to "work with law enforcement." Great.)
On the other hand, Facebook is completing its transition from being a simple platform, broadly indifferent to the content it hosts, to being a publisher that curates and is responsible for content. Getting rid of Mr. Farrakhan, Mr. Jones and the others are the easy calls for now, because they are such manifestly odious figures and they have no real political power.
But what happens with the harder calls, the ones who want to be seen publicly and can't be swept under: alleged Islamophobes, militant anti-immigration types, the people who call for the elimination of Israel? Facebook has training documents governing hate speech and is now set to deploy the latest generation of artificial intelligence to detect it.
But the decision to absolutely ban certain individuals will always be a human one. It will inevitably be subjective. And as these things generally go, it will wind up leading to bans on people whose views are hateful mainly in the eyes of those doing the banning. Recall how the Southern Poverty Law Center, until recently an arbiter of moral hygiene in matters of hate speech, wound up smearing Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Maajid Nawaz, both champions of political moderation, as "anti-Muslim extremists."
Facebook probably can't imagine that its elaborate systems and processes would lead to perverse results. And not everything needs to be a slippery slope.
Then again, a company that once wanted to make the world more open and connected now wants to make it more private. In time it might also become a place where only nice thoughts are allowed. The laws of unintended consequence can't rule it out.

Removing trade war threat with China is not enough

Texto completo: The Trump administration and China appear to be in the final stages of negotiations on what could be a major trade agreement between the two countries. High-level talks move back to Washington on Wednesday, with a tentative deal foreseeable soon thereafter, to be followed by a wrap-up visit to the United States by President Xi Jinping. It's not too soon to start defining the minimum conditions of an acceptable deal from the U.S. point of view.

"Structural" is the key concept here, as President Donald Trump has acknowledged. We had our doubts about Trump's imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports, in part because it provoked China's own tariffs on U.S. goods and in part because the president's invocation of "national security" as a legal rationale threatened to undermine the reciprocity-based trading system more broadly. Aggressive as they were, his tactics could be redeemed if they force China to change not only such transitory factors as how many soybeans it buys from the United States but also more deeply embedded trade-distorting practices such as systematic subsidies for state-owned exporters and forced technology transfers imposed on U.S. and other foreign investors.

On this point, there is cause for concern in recent indications that the administration has all but abandoned the goal of greater digital openness in China's economy. The New York Times reports that the administration is prepared to accept China's tight regulations that prevent foreign firms from transferring data they gather on Chinese customers for storage outside the country. Instead, it would continue to be stored on servers inside China. This would disadvantage American and other non-Chinese firms in the global competition to create advanced technologies and business methods, including, potentially, those related to artificial intelligence. Perhaps more disturbing, it could help China's communist rulers maintain their tight grip on political and artistic dissent, contrary to basic individual rights but consistent with Chinese leaders' claim that they need control over the data for "national security" reasons.

Any trade negotiation requires give and take. So far, Trump seems to be gaining some ground in areas such as agricultural and energy sales and intellectual property protection; the Chinese seem ready to concede greater latitude for U.S. companies to operate without Chinese joint venture partners. They expect to be rewarded with an end to some or all of the tariffs Trump imposed.

Yet China may not be bargaining from a position of as much strength, economically, as it would have had a few years ago. Growth is slowing, and debt is rising -- creating an opportunity for the Trump administration to achieve goals that have eluded previous administrations. Unfortunately, the president's fixation on short-term trade deficits, and his inclination to retain tariffs rather than cash them in for deeper Chinese concessions, may lead to an outcome that leaves China unchanged, except cosmetically.

On Sunday, Trump threatened to further raise tariffs Friday if no deal is reached. Undoubtedly, the American people, and the world, will cheer any deal that removes the threat of a trade war, if only because it removes a source of uncertainty hanging over a generally benign economic situation. But that should not be the standard of success.

Rubio was aware of Fla. hacking by Russians

Texto completo: When U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson was castigated by his Republican challenger, Gov. Rick Scott, last year for saying Russian hackers had broken into Florida voting systems, Nelson's colleague Marco Rubio was aware of the breach.
But Rubio couldn't defend Nelson because he wasn't allowed to divulge classified information, a spokesman for the senator said.
Rubio, R-Miami, declined to be interviewed for this story.
Nelson, D-Orlando, warned last year about successful hacking attempts in 2016 but said he could not identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified.
No other senator backed him up, and Scott and fellow Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his "alarming claims" and "extremely reckless behavior."
Scott went on to defeat Nelson in the November election by just 10,033 votes in one of the closest and most expensive statewide races in Florida history.
The Mueller report released last month stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials "sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election."The FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was successfully infiltrated, the report said.
The emails contained an attached document with malicious "Trojan" software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer, the report stated.
Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee initially denied that any county was infiltrated, adding that the FBI had not told the state what county or counties it believed were hacked.
But Rubio on April 26 confirmed to The New York Times that such an intrusion occurred. Last week, Rubio said the hacking reached beyond the Sunshine State, telling news station NY1 that "the federal government has information not specific to Florida ... and is unable or unwilling to personally tell the individual counties that are affected what's happened to them for fear of losing access to that information, intelligence information in the future."
He added that while hackers couldn't directly change "the outcome of the election," they were in a position "to change voter databases."
Rubio's office said he was made aware of the 2016 attempts as early as May 2018.
While he couldn't reveal any classified information, he has been active in pushing measures to combat hacking. He backed the Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes, or DETER Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, which would have barred foreign citizens from the country who have sought to interfere in a U.S. election.
Rubio also introduced an amendment to provide security clearances to state and local elections officials, which did not become law but did spur Homeland Security to begin providing such clearances.
Nelson also said he was constrained as to what he could say about classified information. But he said in a statement to the Orlando Sentinel that Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Virginia, asked him and Rubio in June 2018 "to send a letter to the 67 county Supervisors of Election to warn them of Russian intrusion in Florida."
Nelson's statement added, "The Mueller report makes clear why we had to take that important step as well as my verbal warnings thereafter."
"It's clear that the election security concerns raised by Senator Nelson were legitimate," Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss said, blaming Republicans for "car[ing] more about playing partisan political games and mudslinging for their own gain than protecting the integrity of Florida's elections against foreign interference."
Scott's office has said he and Gov. Ron DeSantis have set up a meeting with the FBI in the next few weeks to discuss the hacking, and U.S. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Michael Waltz have also requested a briefing for the state's 27 members of Congress. Scott would not be interviewed for this story.
The identity of the county or counties infected has not been revealed. More than 50 counties used software from VR Systems.

DeVos offers new definition of 'public education'

Texto completo: "Having the ability to direct where resources go on the child or family level helps families become wise consumers."
Betsy DeVos
U.S. Education Secretary
DeVos said she had been to Detroit schools before she was education secretary. She also said she doesn't think Michigan has true education "freedom." She added she hoped that would change.
BALTIMORE – While the media may focus on U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, she told the nation's education reporters Monday that the focus should be on students and families.
"As much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it's not," she said. "Education is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual."
Defining herself as a conservative with a distrust of government, DeVos used her appearance at the Education Writers Association annual conference to promote her Education Freedom Scholarships and to continue her call for a redefinition of public schooling.
"It should surprise no one that I am a commonsense conservative with a healthy distrust of centralized government," she said. "Instead, I trust the American people to live their own lives and to decide their own destinies. That's a freedom philosophy."
For DeVos, a wealthy former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman whose Cabinet term has been marked with controversy, that means giving students and families the choice to move between schools. She says this will force traditional public schools to innovate and get better.
It's a familiar mantra for DeVos, who pushed the establishment of charter schools in Michigan and helped to push an unsuccessful school vouchers ballot question in Michigan.
She has proposed an Education Freedom Scholarship, which would use private scholarships to allow students who couldn't normally afford it to go to private schools.
It ties in with DeVos' broader philosophy.
"Let's stop and rethink the definition of public education," she said. "Today, it's often defined as one type of school, funded by taxpayers, controlled by government. But if every student is part of 'the public,' then every way and every place a student learns is ultimately of benefit to 'the public.' That should be the new definition of public education."
DeVos furthered her push for school choice under questioning from New York Times reporter Erica Greene.
"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean" better schools overall, even a neighborhood traditional public schools," DeVos said. "Having the ability to direct where resources go on the child or family level helps families become wise consumers."
During the question-and-answer period with the reporters, a Michigan-based reporter asked DeVos about Detroit schools and the charter schools in the city, which have a generally poor record, as does the Detroit traditional school system and why DeVos hadn't visited the city to talk to families.
DeVos was instrumental in pushing Michigan's charter school law, including through political action groups and donations to Michigan legislators.
DeVos said she had been to Detroit schools before she was education secretary. She also said she doesn't think Michigan has true education "freedom." She added she hoped that would change.
DeVos was also asked about private, for-profit companies that run charter schools and make profits off doing so, sometimes by skirting laws.
DeVos said all public schools — charter and traditional — must follow laws, but said the bigger thing to focus on is why there are waiting lists in many places for charter schools and why more of those schools aren't available.
In other news, DeVos said:
She hasn't met recently with any sexual assault survivors. Her department has proposed a major overhaul of how colleges and universities handle sexual assault complaints, with many sexual assault survivors complaining she is protecting those who are accused of sexual assault.
She said the recent scandal of parents paying bribes to get their children into elite universities showcases the belief among many that the college system is unfair to most average people.
When asked whether she would serve another four years in her role if Donald Trump was re-elected and wanted her to stay, DeVos didn't directly answer, instead quipping that her husband probably wouldn't like her to.

Texto completo: Expectant comedian Amy Schumer on Sunday casually revealed that she and husband Chris Fischer are having a boy.
"Hey! We love @chancetherapper," Schumer, 37, began an Instagram post, alluding to Chance the Rapper's tweet Saturday expressing hope for the return of a particular Wendy's dish, "and hate to be the ones to tell him that Wendys is the only fast food chain refusing to protect farmworker women from sexual assault and rape in the fields. This is true. Please read that sentence again. Message for the people in charge: Instead of spicy nuggets, we want food that is harvested with dignity NOT violence. Please join the @fairfoodprogram and #BoycottWendys link in my bio of how you can help. Also we are having a boy."
Schumer, who was raised in Rockville Centre, was referring to the Fair Food Program signed onto by McDonald's; Burger King; Subway; and Yum Brands, owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut; agreeing to increased wages for produce pickers and to help ensure humane working conditions.
Attempts to reach a Wendy's representative Sunday were unsuccessful and the chain has not commented on social media. A spokeswoman told The New York Times in March that its tomato suppliers must submit to third-party reviews of their labor practices.
Schumer announced in October that she was pregnant. She and celebrity chef and cookbook author Fischer married on Feb. 13, 2018

The pricewe pay forthe Trumpdiversion

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Amid this train wreck of a presidency, an administration marked by cronyism and incompetence, where compulsive lying has been normalized, it's easy to miss the damage being done by Donald Trump's minions beyond the White House.
What may be a strategy of diversion – daily outrages emanating from the Oval Office to deflect attention from the chicanery of Cabinet-level officials – has allowed surrogates to gut environmental protections, for example, and to undercut foreign alliances with impunity.
Although I doubt that this diversion is intentional, if it is, it's brilliant: Focus the public's attention on the shenanigans in the White House while political appointees systematically dismantle policies, protections and alliances that have been in place for years, even decades.
Two examples, education and the environment, illustrate the effectiveness and the destructiveness of this diversion.
Shortly after Trump's inauguration, environmental safeguards began to fall, beginning with regulations on oil pipelines and then dropping restrictions on the dumping of mining waste into surrounding waterways. On his first day as interior secretary, Ryan Zinke rescinded prohibitions on the use of lead ammunition, which is harmful to wildlife, on federal lands and waters.
The Trump administration has sought to expand offshore drilling, to roll back automobile emissions standards, to nullify restrictions on coal power plants, to loosen regulations on toxic air pollution and to rescind protections for endangered whales and sea turtles. And on and on.
The Trump administration dropped climate change from the list of national security threats and, most important, withdrew from the Paris accords, the international agreement aimed at reducing the rate of climate change.
Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, might provide an even better example of the Trump administration's success in undermining longstanding values and principles.
Just as Zinke and Scott Pruitt (Trump's initial choice as head of the EPA) were avowedly hostile to environmental protections, so too DeVos is hostile to public education. The difference is that both Pruitt and Zinke were chased from office because of ethical violations (whereupon they landed cushy jobs with the industries they were supposed to be regulating; their replacements also have deep ties to energy and extraction industries).
DeVos, on the other hand, continues in office, where she has done, and continues to do, untold damage.
For decades, DeVos, who married into the Amway fortune, has been fixated on what she calls “school choice.” On the face of it, school choice is an appealing concept; we citizens in a nation of consumers like at least the illusion of choice, even in schools for our children.
While no one denies the right of parents to educate their children as they wish, DeVos and others in the so-called school choice movement want taxpayers to foot the bill, even when children attend private, parochial or other religious schools.
DeVos's own education apparently did not include a unit on the First Amendment. If it had, she would recognize that religion has flourished throughout American history precisely because we have (for the most part, at least) observed Roger Williams's and Thomas Jefferson's “wall of separation” between church and state.
She would also know, as legal scholar Philip Hamburger has argued, that emphasis on separation was animated by 19th-century fears that taxpayer money would go to support parochial (Catholic) schools.
During the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, repeatedly stipulated that public money should not support parochial schools.
The education secretary could also use a bit of history about public education. Common schools (as they were known early in the 19th century) provided a way for the children of those less fortunate to secure an education and thereby climb the ladder toward the middle class.
As such, public education enjoyed the support of various religious groups, including evangelicals, and many of the early leaders in the common school movement were clergy.
Throughout American history, moreover, public education has also served as a tool of integration, a way to inculcate the values of citizenship in a nation of immigrants.
As an 1880 editorial in the New York Times explained: “The reason for the existence of common schools is that they are, or are supposed to be, good for the common wealth. It is asserted, and has hitherto been widely believed, that they make good citizens; that without them the mass of the community would be less virtuous, less happy, less thrifty; and that in a country where suffrage is, to all intents and purposes, universal, public schools are the sweeteners and the salt of morals and the light of legislation and of government.”
I suspect we could use a bit more virtue and morals in American society and government these days.
That's not to say, of course, that public education has always lived up to these aspirations. Not at all. No one can deny that public education is in trouble; disengaged students, neglected infrastructure, crowded classrooms and poorly paid teachers bedevil too many school districts. Too many frazzled teachers “teach for the test,” a strategy inimical to learning.
But the solution is not, as DeVos would have it, starving public education and funding the exodus of middle and upper-class students, thereby exacerbating the socioeconomic divide. Providing taxpayer money to students for private and religious education betrays the mission of public education.
Public schools have played an invaluable role in American history and culture by providing a common ground for children of different ethnic groups and religious persuasions, regardless of social class – a place where, in the midst of a pluralistic society, differences could be explored and friendships formed.
At school – in the classroom or on the playground – children interacted with one another and, in the best of all worlds, learned to understand one another and to tolerate one another.
Whatever common culture we have attained in this country has come about largely through the agency of public schools. At the risk of sounding mawkish, I truly believe that public schools served to make America what it is by helping us to forge a mutual understanding of one another as Americans.
That's an idealized vision, I acknowledge, but it still represents our best hope for reclaiming at least some measure of comity in our fractured society. Donald Trump has no interest in that, of course. His political fortunes rely on discord.
If we care about the future of democracy, however, we must attend to public education.
Betsy DeVos's dystopian vision for education in America must not succeed, nor should the cynical, industry-friendly environmental policies of this administration. We cannot allow Trump's tomfoolery to distract us from the real damage perpetrated by his surrogates.

Texto completo: The Bear Creek High School newspaper has profiled notable students -- athletes, budding entrepreneurs, academic whizzes -- without incident for decades.
But an article that appeared Friday in The Bruin Voice caused an uproar over free speech, feminism and student journalism, all before it was even published.
The 18-year-old subject is a senior at the school in Stockton, Calif., one of more than 2,100 students.
She also makes her own pornographic videos.
The story about the story follows a pattern similar to other clashes between student journalists and school boards. The Lodi Unified School District, after learning about the planned profile, demanded last month that it be turned over for review before appearing online and in print. The attempted oversight drew far more attention than the article probably would have.
The district said the piece might violate a state rule that it said prevented publications at public schools from featuring "obscenity, defamation and incitement," and it threatened to fire Katherine Duffel, the paper's longtime faculty adviser.
In articles, columns, television programs and social media posts, the standoff over an unpublished story became either a symbol of censorship and women's rights, or the loss of traditional values and a school district's responsibility to protect young students from harmful content.
People from all over the country weighed in. Someone sent the paper a $ 250 donation. One woman sent $ 100 and asked for a sneak peek of the article. Hilde Lysiak, who publishes a local paper in Pennsylvania and is, at age 12, the youngest member of the Society of Professional Journalists, offered to flood the Bear Creek campus with copies of the story if the district blocked The Voice from publishing it.
"It's been pretty hectic -- we weren't expecting so much feedback," said Bailey Kirkeby, 17, the article's author. "I'm a little scared that it's hyped up too much and that when people read it, it's going to be anticlimactic."
In the end, the district decided not to block publication. But its lawyers did send a letter to an attorney representing both Ms. Duffel and Ms. Kirkeby, asking that The Voice publish a disclaimer stating that the district did not endorse the article. The Voice refused to do that, according to the lawyer, Matthew Cate.
In the letter, the district told Mr. Cate that it still had the right to review all material scheduled to appear in the newspaper and that it had the right to block an article. It also accused Ms. Duffel of insubordination.
"Students and journalism advisers face a lot of pressure from districts and others in positions of authority, and there's a serious imbalance of power that can be easy to give in to," said Mr. Cate, who shared the letter with The New York Times.
The letter also raised concerns that underage journalists may have been exposed to pornography while pursuing the story, and that the student, Caitlin Fink, may have "been exploited before reaching legal age" in "an industry that is at best notoriously poorly regulated, if not abusive and exploitative."
On Friday, the district said it was "very pleased" that the exchanges with the paper had "resulted in an article that meets legal requirements."
"We know that these experiences regarding controversies and debates help prepare our students to be successful as they pursue future efforts of higher education and career," the district said in a statement.
The nearly 1,100-word article explores Ms. Fink's path to the adult entertainment industry. In it, she explained that she sold erotic photographs of herself on messaging and dating apps like Kik and Tinder, initially for the money but later because she enjoyed the attention.
She left home and now lives with a friend's family, paying some $ 300 a month for food, utilities and rent, according to the profile.
"The only hard thing so far is making sure I have enough money," she told the paper.
The piece also mentioned that she had fallen victim to scams, that her body acne had once disrupted a planned shoot and that she had faced threats. Here's an excerpt from the piece:
Although Fink makes a livable income through her adult entertainment career, as well as her second job as a dish washer, she admits the industry is not always glamorous; workers are constantly at risk of being taken advantage of due to their occupation.
"People assume that just because you're in the industry, you would do sexual things with anyone, and that isn't true," Fink said. "Adult entertainment is a job just like any other job. There's always that risk of getting kidnapped or possibly not even knowing what to do after your career is over and trying to find work after that."
Ms. Fink told The Times that she had been making her own online pornographic videos since turning 18 in September. She also began working as a stripper recently. She said she was enthusiastic about being profiled in The Voice, seeing the article as a way to address rumors and meanspirited gossip about her work in pornography.
"I don't see the story as too taboo -- I want to inform people about this topic, that it's not just all fun and games the entire time," Ms. Fink said. "I know for a fact that I'm not the only person at school that's thought about porn."
The story of the paper's standoff with the school district has been reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, The Associated Press and The Washington Post. Ms. Fink said she hoped that the publicity would have "a positive effect" on her career: maybe some scenes in movies, "possibly new friends in the industry."
The school district's involvement with the article "shocked" the group of teenagers behind The Bruin Voice, an eight-page paper produced through an elective class, said Ms. Kirkeby, the managing editor and news editor. The last time The Voice was so at odds with officials, the principal at the time confiscated 1,700 copies after it criticized the school's safety policy. The principal later released them on the district's orders.
"It was the same as the profiles we do for every issue, like a star athlete; just a student sharing her story," Ms. Kirkeby said of Ms. Fink's profile.
Friday's issue is the fifth of the year. After receiving copies from the printer, students stuff them with an advertisement -- such as a coupon for a $ 10 discount on a driver's education class -- and then distribute them to classrooms.
Ms. Duffel, an English teacher with a journalism degree and a love of Hemingway, has overseen the paper since the school was founded in 1991.
Each year, she said, students pitch stories about teenagers and sex. The feature about Ms. Fink is part of a special section about sex, including pieces about blood-donation rules for gay and bisexual men and a film focused on the founder of Planned Parenthood.
"It's just the word 'pornography' and where people's minds go," Ms. Duffel said of the tussle over Ms. Fink's profile. "I think they lose their minds, quite frankly, when they hear that word."

If you scroll through the last few weeks of "The Daily," a pattern emerges. A revolution in Sudan. A terror attack in Sri Lanka. An election in Israel.
We're going global. Or more global.
That was always the plan. We started off focused on the biggest domestic stories of our time, perhaps inevitably. We launched in the opening days of a polarizing new presidency that seemed to produce earthquake-sized news every day, sometimes every hour. We told powerful international stories (this episode, about assisted suicide in Canada, comes to mind), but our overall emphasis felt decidedly stateside.
As we enter our third year, we're deeply invested in telling stories of the wider world, exploring places and personalities we may have overlooked and checking back in on what are now familiar lines of coverage: the state of Brexit, the political crisis in Venezuela, the creeping authoritarianism of China.
In the past, we've sent producer Andy Mills to Iraq to tell the story of the final days of the Islamic State in Mosul. Annie Brown reported from the U.S.-Mexico border. Just this week, two producers left the U.S. for -- well, we won't say exactly where yet.
And producer Lynsea Garrison will spend the next year crisscrossing the world, where she will have no shortage of ideas and partners: The Times has 31 international bureaus and more than 200 journalists reporting from abroad.
President Trump will remain a major, ever-present story for us, and domestic reporting of all kinds will be a permanent fixture of our programming. But more and more, we'll bring you in-depth stories from the rest of the globe.
P.S. Speaking of international, we're holding a live event in London on June 6th. I'll speak with two of our correspondents -- Berlin bureau chief Katrin Bennhold and London-based international correspondent Ellen Barry -- about the rise of populism across the globe and the fallout from Brexit. And we'll be joined by "Daily" producers to talk about how we make the show. More information and tickets are available here.
Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb .

A question about the citizenship question
In Monday's episode, Adam Liptak outlined three ways in which adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census could work in favor of the Republican agenda. It made us wonder if there were ways that adding the question could backfire for Republicans. Here's what Adam had to say:
"I don't see any scenarios in which adding a question on citizenship turns out to be bad for Republicans. At the most basic level, as President Trump put it in a tweet, it could help the administration identify unauthorized immigrants. 'The American people,' he wrote, 'deserve to know who is in this Country.'
"More sophisticated rationales also help Republicans. If adding the question drives down participation in states with big immigrant populations, as government experts say it will, those states will lose seats in Congress. And the states with big immigrant populations are mostly blue.
"The information generated by the question could also help states draw voting districts that count only eligible voters instead of the current practice of counting everyone. That would move voting power from blue urban centers with many immigrants to red rural areas with few immigrants.
"Even the administration's stated reason for adding the question -- to help enforce part of the Voting Rights Act to protect minority voters -- tends to help Republicans. Packing minority voters into voting districts in which they can elect the candidates of their choice does almost always lead to the election of Democrats in those districts. But it tends to dilute Democrats' voting power across all districts."
______
The census is a'coming
While making Monday's episode, producer Annie Brown went down the rabbit hole of Census Bureau promotional videos and became our resident expert:
"During our interview, I was struck when Adam Liptak said that the census is the largest peacetime mobilization that the U.S. does. I wanted to find some audio that would convey that sense of communal patriotism. It turns out the Census Bureau produces a promo video every decennial year. The 1930 promo was a silent film, complete with title cards and an orchestral score. The makers of the 1970 promo were clearly impressed by the computer and its futuristic new sounds. But it was the 1980 promo and its multiracial choir in the shape of the fifty states that stole my heart. (Note that as the camera zooms out, you can see Alaska and Hawaii holding their own.) All week I've been humming, 'In 80 million mailboxes 'cross the U.S.A., the census is a'coming ..."'
______
On "The Daily" this week
■ Can the Trump administration ask about citizenship on the 2020 census? Adam Liptak explains why this question is at the center of the Supreme Court's biggest case this session.
■ "I don't think the N.R.A. is necessarily as invincible as it might have been in the past." Danny Hakim on how the threat of an investigation plunged the gun rights group into crisis.
■ A 30-year dictatorship has been toppled in Sudan. Declan Walsh reports from Khartoum on what comes next.
■ At a contentious hearing, Attorney General William Barr defended his rollout of the Mueller report. We spoke to Nick Fandos about Barr's testimony.
■ Secret intelligence documents leaked to reporter Nick Casey suggest that some of President Nicolás Maduro's people are starting to turn on him in Venezuela.

Texto completo: For Children
BORDERS & BELONGING at Public School 10 (May 4, 2-4 p.m.). Books can build bridges even when politicians want to erect walls. This Brooklyn presentation, recommended for ages 9 to 12, features the children's author Matt de la Peña, who is the American son of a Mexican father, and New York State Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, who was born in Colombia and now represents a district in Queens. De la Peña, whose works include the young-adult novel "Mexican WhiteBoy" and the Newbery Medal-winning picture book "Last Stop on Market Street," will talk about his heritage and writing, while Cruz will relate her experiences under the Obama administration's policy Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Then Jennifer Szalai, a book critic for The New York Times, will moderate a discussion on immigration, inclusiveness and the unifying power of storytelling.

HOLI HOORAY! at the Brooklyn Children's Museum (May 4, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.). If you feel that your life needs a little brightening, this event is for you. Celebrating Holi, the Hindu festival of color, the day will begin with Jai Jai Hooray's "Holi on the Block!," performed by Ajna Dance Company and Raga Kids. This piece portrays the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna as Brooklyn schoolchildren who combat bullying with a creative use of color. The schedule will also include Bollywood dance classes, vibrant art projects, a South Asian rooftop bazaar and Indian foods. The fun all culminates with a Holi tradition: tossing fistfuls of pigmented powder. This will happen outdoors at 3 p.m., rain or shine, after a happy procession to Brower Park. Parents can rejoice, too: The museum sells only nontoxic, washable powder.
718-735-4400, brooklynkids.org
INVENTGENUITY FESTIVAL 2019: FLIPNYC at Dock Street School (May 5, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.). They might be the tallest tales ever told. The Inventgenuity Festival, dedicated annually to engineering, art and creativity, will focus this year on producing two gigantic flip books: early forms of animation whose illustrations appear to move, in cartoonlike fashion, when the pages are rapidly turned. Presented by Beam Center, a Brooklyn-based educational nonprofit, Inventgenuity invites children 8 and older to trace and color 200 images for the enormous volumes, which will be operated with solar-powered cranks. Working with teenage Beam Center Fellows, who have already started the wiring and welding, those attending the festival (it's free but registration is required) will complete the books in collaboration with the architect Chee-Kit Lai and the artist Ebony Bolt. Young visitors can also participate in workshops to make night lights, shadow puppet theaters, sound-emitting greeting cards, miniature flipbooks and other projects. In June, the huge finished books will animate a whole neighborhood: They go on display in Dumbo, Brooklyn.
347-470-6747, beamcenter.org
LINCOLN CENTER'S 60TH-ANNIVERSARY BLOCK PARTY at the Lincoln Center Campus (May 4, 10 a.m.-2:30 p.m.). Not all events at Lincoln Center are appropriate for children -- Wagner's "Ring," anyone? -- but those in this celebration should suit almost any age. Kicking off a series of programs that commemorate the complex's 1959 groundbreaking, this free festival will involve all 11 of the center's organizations and take place both outdoors and in. (Tickets for indoor events will be distributed, first come first served, starting at 10 a.m. at Josie Robertson Plaza.) Performances with particular child appeal include the opening ceremony, featuring Native American dancers; a concert by Falu Shah and her band, who will offer South Asian music from her young people's album, "Falu's Bazaar"; high-energy dance from Step It Up NYC, whose members are ages 10 to 20; and "American Journeys," an interactive concert about immigration by the New York Philharmonic's teaching artists. (A full schedule is on the website.)

PARTY ON WHEELS at the New York Transit Museum (May 5, 9-11 a.m.). Once a year, the tracks of this decommissioned Brooklyn subway station come roaring back to life. That will happen at this Sunday morning benefit, when the museum will offer shuttle rides between its platform and the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station on R-1/9 cars, 1930s models with rattan seats and ceiling fans. In addition to traveling in their great-grandparents' style, children can play with model trains, get their faces painted, pose for family portraits inside the conductor's cab of a stationary vintage car and work on their own subway projects: glass-tile mosaics and a large collaborative map. And where else can you expect breakfast to include cake?
718-694-1600, nytransitmuseum.org
SPRING INSECT DAY at Wave Hill (May 4, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.). Don't they rule the season, anyway? Seriously, though, this Bronx public garden has good reason to honor insects, which play important roles in the Hudson Valley ecosystem. During its first three hours, this bug celebration will include a drop-in family art project (also offered on Sunday), in which children can learn about moth caterpillars and make their own model cocoons, enclosing within each a message about change. Throughout the day, an insect command post, organized by the entomologists and educators Lawrence Forcella and Lindsay Velazco, will display various species (both live and preserved), along with cocoons and chrysalides. At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Forcella will also lead insect expeditions in which young investigators (the recommended ages are 8 and older) can search the grounds for residents like spiders, butterflies, centipedes and woodlice.
718-549-3200, wavehill.org
'SILENT VOICES: LOVESTATE' at the New Victory Theater (May 2, 7 p.m.; May 4, 2 and 7 p.m.; May 5, noon and 4 p.m.). Don't be misled by the adjective in the title. In this 70-minute program, the members of the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, ages 12 to 18, will be singing their hearts out about the issues that matter to them most: sexism, racism, economic inequality, climate change. They do, however, see their mission as communicating the concerns of groups that may feel silenced, like minorities and migrants. This third installment of the series Silent Voices incorporates the choristers' own spoken-word texts as well as music commissioned from prominent composers like Nico Muhly, Paola Prestini, Toshi Reagon and the Pulitzer Prize winners Caroline Shaw and David Lang. The young people's most important message? Listen.
646-223-3010, newvictory.org
URBAN WILDLIFE FESTIVAL in Highbridge Park (May 4, 1-4 p.m.). Although New York City's most visible population is two-legged, plenty of four-footed friends share its streets and parks. The Urban Park Rangers, who are celebrating 40 years of public service, will serve as animal ambassadors at this free event, where they will show tortoises, a skunk, a porcupine and an opossum, as well as various birds of prey. Children can observe the creatures close up and learn the best places to spot them, as well as how to coexist with them safely. Young attendees can also enjoy music and games.

Texto completo: LA ROCHELLE, France -- At dawn on a recent Saturday, the crew of the fishing trawler L'Arlequin II pulled their cone-shaped net up from the Bay of Biscay, and found the usual catch crammed into the bottom: hundreds of bass.
And the bodies of two dead dolphins.
Such scenes have become far too common: A record 1,200 dolphins have washed up on France's Atlantic coast since January, most of them with wounds suggesting that the mammals had died after being trapped in fishing nets.
For every carcass that ends up on a beach, several more decay at sea, wildlife biologists say, which suggests that as many as 6,000 of the 200,000 common dolphins living in the bay may have perished in less than four months because of fishing.
So a disturbing question hangs over the port cities that dot the coastline from Brittany to the Basque Country, and their hundreds of fishing vessels, with no clear answer.
Why are so many dolphins dying now?
Most people agree that fishing is responsible, but the consensus stops there. Fishermen claim that the unintentional captures, also known as bycatch, remain unusual, if not exceptional, while scientists warn that fishing vessels now represent a major threat to dolphins.
Activists from an environmental group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, have just completed a two-month effort to document the deaths and which vessels cause them.
"It's an undocumented reality that has been unfolding far out to sea, and far from the public eye," Justin Barbati, a 27-year-old volunteer with the group, said as he drove an inflatable boat closer to L'Arlequin II, where fishermen were dragging the dolphins' bodies aboard.
That new presence leaves local fishermen feeling unfairly targeted.
"That Sea Shepherd fights against whale hunters in Japan, fine, but that they follow us while we are working and harass us, the small and decent fishermen, because some of us sometimes catch some dolphins? It's out of proportion," said Jean Lagarde, 75, known as La Rochelle's oldest fisherman, as he cleaned black cuttlefish ink from his vessel on a recent afternoon.
The Bay of Biscay, the vast gulf west of France and north of Spain, has long been a haven for dolphins, brimming with shoals of sardines, herring and other fish that they eat.
Fishermen have historically cohabited with dolphins. Lately, they say, they have seen so many more that most of them don't have to go back far in the photo libraries in their smartphone to play videos of dolphins swirling around their vessels.
Biologists at the government-funded Pelagis Observatory in La Rochelle first noticed a spike in dolphins washing up on beaches in 2017, when 1,200 of them were found dead on the French coast, followed by 900 more in 2018.
In the first four months of this year, the number already exceeds annual totals that were among the highest in 40 years, said Olivier Van Canneyt, who runs the observatory.
Autopsies carried out by Mr. Van Canneyt's team have attributed 90 percent of dolphins' deaths to fishing activities. They found that most had died of asphyxia, often with their stomachs full, indicating that they were feeding when they became trapped under water.
Many had abrasions or cuts inflicted by fishing nets, said Willy Dabin, who monitors dolphin strandings for the observatory.
"Some fishermen also damage the bodies quite badly so as to avoid damaging their nets," he said in the institute's cold storage room, showing a dead dolphin whose tail flukes had been cut off.
Because the common dolphin is a protected species, fishermen cannot bring the bodies ashore, so they throw the carcasses into the sea and most bycatch remains unseen, Mr. Dabin added.
Fishermen's representatives argue that the number of vessels in the Bay, up to 600 in the winter and spring, hasn't changed in recent years. The vessels are the same, too, and so are the amounts of fish they catch, according to Julien Lamothe, the head of a fishermen's organization in La Rochelle.
"Every fisherman has had to deal with a bycatch, one day or another," Mr. Lamothe said. "Those are shocking events that they are trying to avoid. Catching dolphins isn't their job."
But as a result of recent restrictions on catching sole, a bottom-dwelling fish, some fishing boats have been using higher nets to catch other species, which might have resulted in more dolphin bycatch, scientists say. Some have nets tens of kilometers long.
From porpoises in Mexico to dolphins in China's Yangtze River, bycatch is "the greatest threat to marine mammals around the world," according to the Marine Mammal Commission, a United States government agency. Most are long-lived species that breed slowly: The common dolphins of the Bay of Biscay become sexually mature at age 8 and can live up to 25 years, and females give birth every three years on average.
"The day our studies show that the dolphin population has dwindled in the bay, it will be too late," Mr. Van Canneyt said.
Sea Shepherd's activists, most of them volunteers, patrol the bay aboard the group's own vessel, the MV Sam Simon, looking for fishing trawlers and dead dolphins. A New York Times reporter and a photographer joined them for a day.
"This campaign is about long-term observation; we are doing what the French government should be doing," said Mr. Barbati, a biologist who assesses salmon stocks for the Canadian government.
Lamya Essemlali, head of the French branch of Sea Shepherd, has advocated for more independent observers and cameras aboard fishing vessels to prevent bycatch.
"Bycatch is the first threat to marine mammals, and fishermen cast their nets right in the middle of their natural habitat," Ms. Essemlali said aboard the MV Sam Simon. "How can we call those accidental catch?"
The only long-term solution, she said, would be a ban in the area on fishing methods that indiscriminately scoop up whatever creatures are present. But that would threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of fishermen, and economies of their towns.
The French government has raised a possible short-term compromise.
The ecology minister, François de Rugy, said he would support research on acoustic devices that attach to fishing nets and make sounds that drive dolphins away. One study found that on vessels using the devices, bycatch has decreased by 65 percent.
But scientists and Ms. Essemlali object that the acoustic repellents, known as "pingers," threaten to deny dolphins an important and usually safe habitat.
And they don't always work; the trawler L'Arlequin II uses pingers. Two days before the vessel trapped the dolphins in its net, its captain, Charles Le Moyec, said that since he had started using the devices, he no longer caught dolphins.
"We don't like it either when we kill dolphins, but so far the pingers have worked well," he said in his cabin, as his crew unloaded dozens of cases of frozen hake on the dock at La Rochelle.
Two days later, two dead dolphins lay in his net, close to the acoustic repellents. Afterward, Mr. Le Moyec, 35, insisted that it was the first time he had caught a dolphin this year -- adding that he felt harried by Sea Shepherd, whose volunteers had followed him around the bay for hours at a time.
Along the dozens of blue, yellow and red fishing cabins and garages in the port of La Rochelle, many fishermen echoed Mr. Le Moyec's frustration, saying that Sea Shepherd wanted to treat fishing as a crime.
"We've never seen so many dolphins in the waters, and Sea Shepherd accuses us of being murderers," said Mr. Lagarde. "What about the massive vessels from the Netherlands or Spain that empty our ocean far away in the bay?"
Those, too, have been on Sea Shepherd's radar. As the group ended its campaign last month, Ms. Essemlali said it would be back in the bay next winter.
"In the Bay of Biscay, dolphins are predators and the fishing industry is turning them into prey," she said. "We can discuss what needs to be done, but that must stop, period."

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama was unhappy with Hillary Clinton and her failed “soulless campaign” in 2016, saying he saw her loss as a “personal insult.”
The new details come from a recently released update to New York Times Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker’s book Obama: The Call of History.
The new edition, which includes Obama’s reaction to the 2016 election, said Obama compared himself to Michael Corleone, the titular character of "The Godfather." Obama thought he “almost got out” of office untouched, like a mob boss avoiding a hit job.
Obama found himself shocked by the election results, thinking before Nov. 8 there was “no way Americans would turn on him” and “[h]is legacy, he felt, was in safe hands.”
The book details that Obama could not believe Americans had “decided to replace him with a buffoonish showman whose calling cards had been repeated bankruptcies, serial marriages and racist dog whistles.”
Obama allegedly told his speechwriter Ben Rhodes after meeting Donald Trump that the future president “peddles in bullshit.”
Rhodes responded, saying he thought Trump was a character right out of the book "Huckleberry Finn."
“Maybe that’s the best we can hope for,” Obama said.

Amid good news, can Democrats talk down the economy?

Texto completo: "The recession talk in late 2018 got way, way out of hand," New York Times economic reporter Neil Irwin tweeted a few days ago. Indeed it did.
Irwin’s tweet came shortly after the government released figures showing the economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of this year. The number was good by anyone’s measure, significantly outpacing predictions. And it raised a question: What about all that recession talk of the last few months? What was going on?
Certainly, there were some economists who looked at various indicators — housing, energy, the international economy — and feared an economic slowdown was on the way. But in the popular conversation — the world of columnists and cable TV talkers — much of the economic chatter was really about President Donald Trump. A worsening economy, some said, would show how wrong the president’s policies have been and would be the worst possible news for his 2020 re-election bid.
"A recession is coming. Trump will make it so much worse," announced The Washington Post on Dec. 23. A slowdown is "overdue," columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, "and the eventual collapse may bear Trump’s fingerprints."
"Trump and the slowing economy: A wounded tiger is a dangerous tiger," read the headline of a column, also in the Post, by former Obama economic adviser Jared Bernstein on Nov. 21.
"Wall Street economists and, in fact, economists across the board are calling for a recession," financial reporter Linette Lopez said on CNN on Dec. 30. "They see that a recession is coming in 2019 and 2020 ... It’s sad that we can’t trust the president to be able to control himself in the face of a slowing economy."
Now, though, the case is a bit harder to make, with 3.2% growth, plus low unemployment, plus — perhaps most important — wage increases that have not been seen in years.
Still, the presidential campaign is under way, and Democrats will try to portray — actually, they’ll have to portray — the president’s policies as an economic mess. The question is whether it will work.
Republican strategists are of two minds. On one hand, some still bear the scars of the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton managed to convince voters that the economy, which was in the early stages of a recovery, was in desperate shape. The lesson: Creating a perception of the economy was more important than the economy itself.
"It’s not facts and stock market statistics," said GOP strategist David Carney in an email exchange. "Clinton did a good job against us in 1992. All the economists said everything was on track to solid improvement, and they were right. Still, the economy was key — based on the recent past, not current or future."
On the other hand, some Republicans believe it will be difficult for any Democrat — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, anyone — to talk down a healthy economy.
"We, of course, have no idea what the economy will be like in a year and a half," said strategist Curt Anderson in another email exchange. "But if it stays similar to how it is now, the Democrats will not be successful in talking it down. We’ve done a fair amount of polling so far in 2019, and the voters are happy with the current economy, and are even somewhat bullish on their personal economic future. Arguing with the voters is a dumb strategy that has been tried and failed many times. I don’t recommend it."
While an economic downturn would obviously hurt Trump, Anderson sees the possibility of another dynamic entirely.
"When the economy is good, voters don’t say that the economy is their No. 1 issue," he explained. "We have several polls this year where the voters list the economy as their third- or fourth-most important issue, and that is because the voters feel like the economy is somewhere between good and really good. Often voters will migrate to other issues when the economy is good."
In that rather ironic scenario, a good Trump economy could give voters the freedom to focus on things they don’t like about the president.
In any event, Trump’s job will be to convince voters not only that his economic policies are working, but that Democratic proposals — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, tuition-free college and more — would destroy the economy that has gone well during the early Trump years.
So far, despite all the pessimistic talk, that’s not a hard argument to make. And if the indicators hold up, the president will hold a strong hand, whatever his real or perceived liabilities, in November 2020.

Texto completo: Anyone who doubts that race, poverty and policing drive the city's criminal justice system might examine the case of Karina Vetrano.
Vetrano, a 30-year-old white woman from Queens, was beaten to death in May 2016 in Spring Creek Park in Howard Beach.
Six months later, police charged Chanel Lewis, a black man from Brooklyn, with her murder. Police say his DNA matched that found on Vetrano and on her cellphone at the crime scene and that he confessed to killing her. A prosecutorial slam dunk, you might say.
Except that at his first trial four months ago, the jury deadlocked. At issue were the circumstances surrounding Lewis' arrest, his confession and questions about the DNA's accuracy.
Law enforcement sources say police determined the DNA found on Vetrano matched that of an African-American and took voluntary samples of some 350 black men. Police also took DNA from Vetrano's family, friends and co-workers. All proved negative.
Police settled on Lewis, based on a "hunch," as The New York Times put it, by Det. John Russo. Detectives interviewed Lewis, who voluntarily offered his DNA, which matched DNA found at the murder scene.
Defense attorneys questioned the circumstances of Lewis' confession. He had been held by police for hours without an attorney before he confessed. He later recanted. They also raised questions about the DNA evidence. Earlier this year, the Times reported that Marina Stajic, an official at the office of the chief medical examiner, was fired after she claimed a DNA testing technique could lead to wrongful convictions. The city subsequently paid her $1 million after she sued.
We also must recognize some NYPD history. Newspaper accounts last month cited 14 overturned convictions of young black males in the 1980s and '90s due to false confessions obtained by then-NYPD Det. Louis Scarcella. And last month, Det. Joseph Franco was charged with perjury after his investigations led to three people being sent to prison for crimes they did not commit.
In a second trial, testimony revealed that while in custody, Lewis was videotaped, read his rights, refused to talk and declined a lawyer. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Case closed, you might think.
On the day of his sentencing, supporters claimed he had been framed. Assemb. Charles Barron said Lewis' DNA could have been fraudulently linked to Vetrano, though he offered no credible evidence.
Case closed? We'll see.

Texto completo: “And thus my suicide began," John L'Heureux wrote, almost as an aside, partway into a final essay published online this week by The New Yorker magazine.
In his lifetime, he wrote more than 20 books — novels, short stories, poetry. Some of his writing drew poignantly on his years in Massachusetts, when he had been a Jesuit priest, and one early short story drew painful inspiration from his father's Parkinson's disease diagnosis — struggles that presaged Mr. L'Heureux's own final illness.
When Mr. L'Heureux died April 22 at age 84, his family announced that the cause was complications of Parkinson's. But in his New Yorker essay “On Death and Dignity," he wrote of discussing with his wife, Joan, and his physicians a decision to end his life April 22 under the death with dignity law in California, where he had been a longtime Stanford University humanities professor.
In the essay, Mr. L'Heureux wrote about the legalities, emotions, and odd details of the process, such as what he would drink to bring on his death: “The concoction would be prepared by a pharmacy licensed to do so, called — can you believe it? — Feel Good Compounders."
He also, perhaps inevitably, wrote about God.
“He is the God of charity and justice," Mr. L'Heureux wrote. “He is the God of compassion and mercy. If I find in myself the need for compassion, to allay suffering and to comfort the living, I feel sure that God has at least as much compassion as I do."
Mr. L'Heureux established his reputation with novels including “A Woman Run Mad" (1988), “The Shrine at Altamira" (1992), and “The Medici Boy" (2014), along with short story collections such as “Comedians" (1990), in which appears the story “Father."
The narrator began by describing his father setting up an easel in the basement to paint. “At the beginning of the end he painted things nobody except himself had ever seen before," Mr. L'Heureux wrote, adding: “But long before we understood what he was doing, our father had begun to escape from us. He was in the process of disappearing."
When Parkinson's disease weakened the title character, his family decided to place him in specialized care, but when they went to tell him, they found a “door stood open to a silver light. He had disappeared. He had escaped, leaving us with all our business incomplete, our goodness, understanding. In the end our father painted clear untroubled air and, quicker than our love, he entered it."
The writer Tobias Wolff, who had studied with Mr. L'Heureux at Stanford, wrote in a tribute posted online by America Magazine, The Jesuit Review, that “in reading his work, one can see, feel, the demands he makes on himself for exactitude, essence, emotional honesty, aesthetic freshness, digging deep for the truths of our thoughts and desires and presenting his findings without flinching, even — no, especially — when they challenge our self-conceptions and certainties, and trouble the heart."
In his 2002 novel “The Miracle," partly set in South Boston, Mr. L'Heureux reminds readers that “people are imperfect, lacking in willpower, infirm in their beliefs, their lives cluttered and unfocused, their character traits largely impervious to change," Bruce Bawerwrote in a New York Times review.
On the opening page, Mr. L'Heureux's protagonist, a parish priest named Father Paul LeBlanc, takes readers on a tour of Southie:
“This is a neighborhood of spruced-up three-deckers — gray and white and tan — with some wood and brick two-deckers, and a few single-family houses with driveways. No matter the color of the houses, they all seem gray when you stand at the corner and look down the street. It is a gray parish. There are a lot of Irish bars — McGillicuddy's, Ahern's, Matt Doherty's — and even the 7-Eleven is run by a guy they call Mahoney. Actually he is Italian, and his name is Meloni, but it sounds Irish when you say it."
John Clarke L'Heureux was born in South Hadley in 1934, a son of Wilfred L'Heureux, an engineer, and Mildred Clarke, a secretary. His father would later die of Parkinson's, his mother of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — ALS.
Mr. L'Heureux would later write for a publisher's website that he also had “an older brother, a civil engineer employed as a lumberjack."
After high school, Mr. L'Heureux attended the College of the Holy Cross and considered becoming an actor. In his essay, Wolff wrote that he gained insight into his teacher's life through the 2010 book “Conversations with John L'Heureux."
In those interviews, Mr. L'Heureux recalled that he was “derailed by Jesus" during his second year at college: “I remember talking with one of my roommates about being an actor, and out of nowhere he said, 'Why don't you become a priest. You're smart enough.' . . . I dismissed what he said as ridiculous, but at the moment he said it, I knew it was going to change my life."
Mr. L'Heureux entered the Jesuit novitiate at Shadowbrook, in the Berkshires. He subsequently graduated with a bachelor's degree from Weston College,according to Stanford, and received master's degrees in philosophy and English from Boston College.
In 1971, after 17 years as a Jesuit, he left the order. “Being a priest was too hard for me," he later said. “I didn't leave because I was disappointed in the Jesuits or in the Church or because I had doctrinal issues. I left because it was too hard to be the kind of priest I wanted to be and it was too important to do any other way."
After leaving the priesthood, he married Joan Polston, a teacher and writer who is his only immediate survivor.
A memorial Mass will be said at 10 a.m. May 25 in St. Albert the Great Church in Palo Alto, Calif.
Before joining Stanford's faculty in 1973, Mr. L'Heureux taught at Georgetown, Tufts, and Harvard universities. He also formerly was editor of the Boston Review.
While still a Jesuit, he began publishing poetry, including one The Atlantic published after the assassination of President John F. Kennedythat ends:
… for the world, darkness.
God sees, allows, and loves
in ways we do not ripely understand.
Let mankind hobble home now on its knees.
Mr. L'Heureux once said of his writing: “I try to explore the shape of mystery that lies behind the few things I know."
The narrator of his story “Three Short Moments in a Long Life," which The New Yorker published in 2016, is in his 80s and has Parkinson's. Near the end, he speaks to his wife:
“I say, 'I'll miss you when I'm dead.' And in a while there comes the final moment: the earth stops turning and a luminous silence descends. And then, as we draw one last breath together, I snatch your hand. And hold it. Holding it, and holding it, and still holding it, I breathe out."
In his essay “Death and Dignity," Mr. L'Heureux called that story “a kind of love letter" to his wife, Joan. Given what he faced with his illness, he said, “death sooner was better than death delayed."
“In the service for the dead, the Catholic Church asks God to grant us all eternal rest," he wrote, and added that “after all the words squandered on right and wrong, failure and desire, love and the tragic failure to love, I am ready for eternal rest. Eternal rest. Even the sound is soothing."

Texto completo: Allen E. Richter
Allen ("Al") Eugene Richter, 82, died April 28, 2019, in Maitland, Florida, of complications of Parkinson's Disease. Born May 3, 1936, in Lorain, Ohio, to Emery and Mary Richter, Al was a graduate of Elyria High School and the University of Cincinnati, where he belonged to the Delta Sigma Pi fraternity. After working briefly as a schoolteacher, Al joined Polsky's Department Store in Akron, Ohio. He soon left Polsky's to work as a buyer for the flagship Strouss Department Store in Youngstown, Ohio. In articles appearing in 1969 and 1970, the New York Times reported his arrival, together with that of dozens of other buyers representing department stores across America. As the newspaper noted, Al was in New York to purchase "wigs, gloves, neckwear, handbags, handkerchiefs, [and] small leather goods" for the Strouss-Hirshberg Co. His children will always use the word "handbag" for the accessory used by ladies to carry more than just money. In 1973, when the biggest shopping mall developer in America, Edward DeBartolo Sr., built the Fashion Square and Altamonte Malls in Central Florida, Al moved, with his family, to Maitland to help open and manage Robinson's stores. He later sold insurance for Acacia Mutual Life Insurance Company and furniture at the Jordan Marsh Department Stores in Altamonte and Colonial Plaza and at Ethan Allen. For decades, he served the First United Methodist Church of Winter Park (FUMCWP) as a lay leader, Stephen Minister, Disciple Bible Study leader, usher, and UMYF chaperone. With FUMCWP, he assisted the needy, including on missions to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Belize, as well as on many trips to volunteer at the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) Supply Depot in Louisiana. He was active in Aldersgate Emmaus and served on its Board as a lay director. In the early 1980s, he was President of the Kiwanis Club of East Winter Park. For ten years, he volunteered at the Orlando Veterans Affairs Lake Baldwin Outpatient Clinic. He loved entertaining and travel, especially to sites related to former U.S. Presidents. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Nancy Greene Richter; son Randy (Dan) of St. Petersburg, Florida; son Jeff (Melvis) of Washington, DC; and daughter Holly of Casselberry, Florida. Viewing calling hours are Thursday, May 2, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Baldwin Fairchild Funeral Home at East Altamonte Springs. A Celebration of Life service will take place at the First United Methodist Church of Winter Park on Saturday, May 4, at 2:00 p.m. All are welcome. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Parkinson's Association of Central Florida or to UMCOR.
This is a paid death notice.

Impeaching the president will only bolster his support

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia -- evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work.
The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation.
The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection.
First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating.
Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Talking Tony Surprises and Snubs

Texto completo: Shortly after Bebe Neuwirth and Brandon Victor Dixon announced the nominees for the 2019 Tony Awards on Tuesday morning, Ben Brantley and Jesse Green, chief theater critics for The New York Times, took a first look at the results. Were they mad as hell, à la Howard Beale of "Network"? Or were they singing "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin"' in honor of "Oklahoma!"?
BEN BRANTLEY Good morning, Jesse. Having watched the nominations, I'm reeling from one startling omission: "To Kill a Mockingbird" is not in the running for best play. And I had my (virtual) money on it to win. (Psst -- Peter, who's doing the office pool -- is it too late to rejuggle my choices?) What do you think happened?
JESSE GREEN This was an odd year, with many different kinds of shows in different styles and with different provenances. Some chaotic crosswinds are inevitable when 34 one-of-a-kind productions are considered by 42 nominators. And "Mockingbird" may have been penalized for some of the legal fights it got mired in: with the Harper Lee estate and with the licensers of a different adaptation. But I think the main reason it wasn't recognized in the best play category is that even though it has been totally rewritten, by Aaron Sorkin, it is not fundamentally a new work. (That's part of why it's a hit.) Likewise "Network." Their spot seems to have been taken by "Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus," despite its being highly divisive and surely the oddest bird on Broadway. I wasn't displeased by that.
["Hadestown" and "The Ferryman" get Tonys love | Here's a complete list of nominees.]
BRANTLEY Maybe this will be the year of the rara avis. The nominators seemed to favor something new over something borrowed, for once. "Gary," "What the Constitution Means to Me" and, in musicals, the love shown to the radically reconceived "Oklahoma!" and the myth-inspired "Hadestown" -- this suggests a willingness to embrace departures from the norm. Very healthy, I'd say.
GREEN Aside from "Hadestown," the nominations for new musicals were more conventional. "Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations," "The Prom" and "Tootsie" cleaned up. Were you surprised not to see more love for "Be More Chill" and "The Cher Show"?
BRANTLEY "Be More Chill" would have required a body of much younger nominators to score big this year. The other shock for me was the near shutout of "King Lear." (Ruth Wilson was acknowledged for her doubling as the Fool and Cordelia.) Glenda Jackson seemed like a guaranteed nominee, if only for memorizing all those lines at the age of 82. And it was an admirable performance. Maybe it's because she won last year (for "Three Tall Women"), or maybe people just didn't like Sam Gold's obstructive staging of Shakespeare.
GREEN I rarely think in terms of snubs, but that did seem like one. Back in musicals, I was surprised that Rebecca Naomi Jones was not nominated for her troubled Laurey in "Oklahoma!" But it was a crowded category and the fifth spot seems to have gone to Caitlin Kinnunen, the feel-good lesbian of "The Prom."
BRANTLEY I know some theatergoers missed the soaring soprano of more traditional Laureys. But I agree, it was a deeply felt and original interpretation of a classic character by Ms. Jones. I was glad, though, to see "The Prom" strutting so proudly through the lists. It's the most conventional of the nominees for best musical (even more than "Tootsie," which had David Yazbek's urban-neurotic score), but it did the old steps so very well -- and in a new, socially conscious context.
GREEN Also notable were Jeremy Pope's two performing nominations, one for a play ("Choir Boy") and one for a musical ("Ain't Too Proud"). But in terms of direction and writing, this was an extremely nondiverse year on Broadway; something like 85 percent of the artists eligible in those categories were white men. It was nice to see the nominators reaching out to recognize Camille A. Brown's fantastic choreography for "Choir Boy" -- a play; the category is usually stocked with musicals only.
BRANTLEY I, too, was struck by the homogeneity of the nominations. All the more reason to celebrate Rachel Chavkin (the director of "Hadestown") and Heidi Schreck (the writer and star of "What the Constitution Means to Me"). I was also pleased to find the name of the excellent playwright Dominique Morisseau, who did very well within the confines of the jukebox format, for her book for "Ain't Too Proud." And it was good to see that Tarell Alvin McCraney's "Choir Boy" was remembered.
GREEN That said, I think the best play contest is going to come down to "What the Constitution Means to Me" and "The Ferryman" (with maybe a bit of "Ink" spilled too). Which sets us up for our own big contest. I found "Constitution" to be the best and most important new play of the season. (Heidi Schreck was nominated as both its author and leading actress.) I'm pretty sure you disagree, though you liked it -- as I liked "The Ferryman."
BRANTLEY Well, that's an argument for another day. (Plug: See our dialogue in the upcoming Arts & Leisure Tonys issue on May 19.) I can certainly understand how you might feel "Constitution" is the most important, in terms of creating an immediate conversation with the audience about an extremely topical issue. Speaking of topical, no best play nomination for "Hillary and Clinton," I see.
GREEN Nor for its director, Joe Mantello. My sense is that people see the play (by Lucas Hnath) and the production as some kind of found object, not the result of artists working.
BRANTLEY It's more than that, although I did feel Hnath's script, though very clever, didn't take me anywhere I hadn't expected to go. On the other hand, Mantello's supremely inventive staging did. So did the performances by perennial nominee Laurie Metcalf (as Hillary) and non-nominee John Lithgow, whose Bill Clinton was a disarmingly fresh take on a very, very famous person, without the pandering ickiness of impersonation.
GREEN Which I suppose brings us to the hairy ape in the room: "King Kong." For all that money it garnered just three nominations (all for design) and a special noncompetitive Tony for the puppet.
BRANTLEY That was some puppet, you have to admit. Do you think the Tonys should initiate some new categories?
GREEN Projection design, when it's honored, is bundled with one of the other design categories, but it's going to need its own slot soon. This season, "Network," "Ink," "King Kong," "Beetlejuice" and "Be More Chill" might all have been nominated.
BRANTLEY And what about a special acting category for best performance by an actor or actress as a living person? We had a lot of those this year: Bertie Carvel as Rupert Murdoch, the various Chers, the Clintons.
GREEN And Otis Williams, the last Temptation, played by the best actor nominee Derrick Baskin.
BRANTLEY The Last Temptation. Sounds like a title that mighta been a contender -- and a lovely musical phrase to go out on.

Texto completo: America's heroes, from George Washington on down, have reflected the greatness and flaws of their times.

This is true also of Kate Smith, who gave voice to America's World War II efforts and buoyed the nation's spirit during uncertain days. She should be honored for who she was and what she gave the nation despite her flaws.

When she died at 79 in 1986, Ms. Smith was one of the nation's best-known singers. According to a story recounted in the singer's New York Times obituary, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced her to England's King George VI by saying, This is Kate Smith. Miss Smith is America.

She cemented her place in history during WWII, when her performances of Irving Berlin's God Bless America helped to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in war bonds.

The Philadelphia Flyers and New York Yankees, played her recordings for decades after her death. Until now. The Flyers and Yankees have silenced her contralto, and the Flyers covered up her statue outside their stadium, then removed it. Why? Because a fan alerted the Yankees to racist titles and lyrics in a couple of Ms. Smith's most ancient songs.

Never mind that there's some question as to whether one of the songs was meant as satire or that her statue was, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, one of the few in that city honoring women. Never mind, as the Inquirer also reported, that she called for racial tolerance on a 1945 radio show. She was known as the first lady of radio because of her thousands of appearances. What she said mattered.

It must not have occurred to the Flyers or Yankees that she was a product of her times or that history is best remembered, confronted, and addressed, not obliterated when its subjects fall from favor, Soviet style.

Ernie Troiano, Jr., the mayor of Wildwood, N.J., has offered to take Ms. Smith's statue and pledged to play her recording of God Bless America on the city's boardwalk every day. Is he condoning racism? No, just giving Ms. Smith and her place in history the thoughtful treatment they deserve. Good for him.

Power of wife's 'Marry My Husband' essay lives on

Texto completo: The Tallahassee area has a rare opportunity to connect with a powerful love story that has touched the world.
Amy Krouse Rosenthal was a remarkable daughter, wife, mother, and children's book author whose positive spirit and encouragement of others endeared her to all she met. When she was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she found a way to continue encouraging others and to prepare her beloved family for the day she would no longer be physically present with them.
She was intentional about an Instagram project she started after her diagnosis to post at 1:23 each day an encouraging thought. When she realized this was taking too much of her energy she turned to writing a book with her daughter, Paris, setting her on a path in life that she finds meaningful. In her grief, Paris picked up that Instagram project her mother started and completed it with her own particular flair. It was a way for Paris to work through her grief.
A most notable way in which Amy prepared her family was in the permission she granted to her husband to find happiness in his life going forward. Between micro-naps on the couch she wrote an article that was published in the New York Times Modern Love Section on Valentine's Day 2017, three days before her death.
She didn't know that her words were so powerful they struck a chord with thousands around the world. Titled, "You May Want to Marry My Husband" it was filled with, as her husband describes, "unbearable sadness, ironic humor and total honesty."
Jason Rosenthal comes to Tallahassee to share what this generous gift by his wife of encouraging him to live his life has meant to him. He says that her edict to fill his own empty space with a new story has given him permission to make the most out of his remaining time on this planet. And he is doing just that.
He started the Amy Krouse Rosenthal Foundation with two primary goals related to important matters in Amy's life – literacy and ovarian cancer research. He is speaking in communities like ours about the importance of "talking with your mate, your children, and other loved ones about what you want for them when you are gone. Doing this gives them liberty to live a full life and eventually find meaning again," says Rosenthal.
Amy Krouse Rosenthal wrote over 30 books in her 51 years. We have 29 of them in our public library so she must have a following here. One of them is titled – "I Wish You More."
According to Amy, "more" was her first word spoken. And she used it in her essay that went viral. She wanted more. But when she realized more was not in her future, she prescribed that those she love follow plan "Be" which was about being present in life because time is precious.
Jason will be speaking at the Goodwood Carriage House on Tuesday, April 30, from 6-7:30 p.m. at an event we are calling, We Wish You More. Big Bend Hospice and the Community Advance Care Planning Encouragement Task Force are offering this event for free to honor National Healthcare Decisions Day.
Midtown Reader, accepting cash, checks and cards, will be selling Jason's recently released book, "Dear Boy," which he will autograph, along with some of Amy's popular titles. 1.5 CEUs are offered along with light refreshments. The Five Wishes living will document will be available to all.

US consumer spending surges 0.9% in March

Texto completo: STARTUPS
Newton company that makes technology to prevent online exam cheating to expand
Examity, a Newton startup that makes technology to help prevent cheating on exams conducted online, said Monday that it is planning a major expansion. The company said it raised $90 million in venture capital, an infusion that puts it in position to grow at a time when online education is exploding, and amid growing concern about cheating. The company said the investment, by the Boston private equity firm Great Hill Partners, is unrelated to the recent college admissions scandal that has rocked academia. But chief executive Michael London said the headlines over the case, which includes allegations of corrupt SAT exam proctors, will help the company explain the value of its product. Examity's services include identification verification, using facial recognition and other tools, along with several software-enhanced services that detect suspicious behavior from online test-takers — behavior that could indicate there is someone in the room who shouldn't be there, for example. The company said its clients now include organizations such as the College Board, along with many organizations that use online testing in job training. Examity has raised a total of about $120 million. The private company is expecting to have revenues of about $25 million this year, and London said it is profitable. It has 500 employees globally, including about 100 at its Newton headquarters. — ANDY ROSEN
CONSUMER SPENDING
Spending rose in March, biggest gain in nearly a decade
US consumer spending surged 0.9% in March, the biggest gain in nearly a decade, as inflation pressures remain nonexistent. The March gain was the biggest monthly increase since August 2009, the Commerce Department reported Monday. That's a marked improvement after three months of lackluster readings in this key segment of the economy. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
CO-WORKING
WeWork to go public
WeWork, the co-working company, has filed confidentially to go public, its employees were told Monday, becoming the latest privately held giant to consider heading to the stock markets. The company initially filed paperwork to go public with regulators in December, according to the memo, which is signed by Adam Neumann, a cofounder, and was reviewed by The New York Times. The company made changes to that filing last week, he wrote. The co-working giant has expanded rapidly in Boston in recent years, growing to 11 locations in some of the region's most desirable office markets. In February, the company signed a deal to lease 11 stories of State Street Financial's longtime home on Lincoln Street, giving it room for about 4,000 desks in the office tower. Like many of the other richly valued startups that have planned their stock-market debuts, WeWork posts steep losses — and shows no sign of turning a profit anytime soon. — NEW YORK TIMES
E-COMMERCE
Chewy plans to raise $100m in public offering
Chewy, the online pet store owned by PetSmart, is going public. The company said it plans to raise about $100 million, but that is likely to change based on investor demand. It said Monday it expects its ticker symbol to be "CHWY." Chewy, which was founded in 2011 and bought by PetSmart in 2017, has never been profitable. It reported a loss of $267.9 million last year on revenue of $3.53 billion. The company said it wants to grow its in-house brands, increase its pet pharmacy offerings, and expand outside the United States. Chewy has headquarters in Boston and Dania Beach, Fla., and has seven warehouses around the country where orders are packed and shipped to shoppers. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Apple says it removed parental control apps because of security, privacy issues
Apple said it removed several parental control apps from its store because of security and privacy concerns, issuing a rare public response to a media report that the iPhone maker was eliminating competition with its own tools. The New York Times reported on Saturday Apple had removed 11 of the 17 most popular programs that help users restrict features or the amount of time kids spend on devices. It said Apple started cracking down on such software after launching its own Screen Time feature last year, which also lets people set limits on certain iPhone and iPad functions and keep track of children's usage. Apple said the applications it barred relied on a technology called Mobile Device Management or MDM, meant for enterprises that manage groups of devices for employees. "MDM gives a third party control and access over a device and its most sensitive information including user location, app use, e-mail accounts, camera permissions, and browsing history," it said. That's a "clear violation of App Store policies." The company said it gave the relevant developers 30 days to modify their apps, then removed those that weren't adjusted. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
HOME-SHARING
Marriott to start taking reservations for home stays
Marriott is pushing more heavily into home-sharing, confident that its combination of luxury properties and loyalty points can lure travelers away from rivals like Airbnb. The world's biggest hotel company will start taking reservations this week for 2,000 homes in 100 markets in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. It plans to expand its Homes and Villas program to other locations. For its part, Airbnb is encroaching further into hotels. On Monday, the San Francisco-based company said it's working with a New York real estate developer to establish a 10-story hotel with 200 suites in Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan. The suites will only be available through Airbnb's website. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
INDUSTRY
GE loses Iraqi power station deal to Siemens
Iraq approved a plan to develop power stations in the country with help from Siemens AG, which has been vying with General Electric Co. to win a deal worth as much as $15 billion. The cabinet picked Munich-based Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering company, as a partner to develop electricity projects in the country, according to a government statement that gave no further details. The Iraqi order is crucial to both Siemens and GE as it would prop up either company's ailing power-generation businesses. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
CREDIT CARDS
MasterCard, Visa to cut fees for foreigners shopping in Europe
Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. ended nearly two decades of European Union antitrust scrutiny with a pact that requires them to reduce fees for foreigners shopping in the region. The EU dropped its final investigations months after fining MasterCard 570.6 million euros ($636 million) in another probe over payment rules. Monday's settlement, which rubber-stamps a draft accord from December, sees the duo reduce levies for non-European cardholders charged on purchases in the 28-nation bloc. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
MUSIC STREAMING
Spotify reaches 100 million subscribers for the first time
Music streaming service Spotify said its paying subscribers have reached 100 million for the first time, up 32 percent on the year and almost twice the latest figures for Apple Music. The Stockholm-based company called the figure, which was reached during the first three months of 2019, "an important milestone." The growth was driven, among other things, by "a better-than-planned promotion in the United States and Canada." By comparison, archrival Apple Music had about 50 million paying subscribers at the end of 2018, the latest available figures. Apple is expected to release new figures with its earnings report on Tuesday. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

White House Reviews Moore's Opinion Pieces As Senate Support Falls

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House is reviewing past writings by Stephen Moore, the conservative commentator whom President Trump plans to nominate to the Federal Reserve Board, amid criticism that many of his opinion columns denigrated women, and enthusiasm for his candidacy appeared to be waning among Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday morning that the writings of Mr. Moore, who has not yet been nominated, were under review by the White House. "When we have an update on that front, we'll let you know," Ms. Sanders said.
Mr. Moore apologized on Sunday for some, but not all, of his past writings in an appearance on ABC's "This Week," saying that he did not remember everything he had written over his career. "Frankly, I didn't even remember writing some of these they were so long ago," he said, adding that he was embarrassed by some of the pieces.
Mr. Moore has written that it may be dangerous for women to earn more than men and has criticized women's athletic abilities. On Sunday, he tried to shift the focus from his writings to his critics, saying, "I think most fair-minded people think this has been kind of a sleaze campaign against me."
[Read excerpts from Mr. Moore's columns.]
But as they returned to the Capitol from a two-week recess, few Senate Republicans expressed outright support for Mr. Moore, who has suggested that he would bow out if a fight over his nomination posed a political problem for incumbents seeking re-election.
"I'm not enthused about supporting him," said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who is one of those seeking re-election in 2020. "Look at his writings! I'm not enthused. I'm a woman."
Others were a bit more cautious, but the message was clear. Senator John Cornyn of Texas said simply that he had "an open mind" about Mr. Moore, while Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama said that the "drip by drip" of complaints against Mr. Moore involving a tax lien and child support payments to his ex-wife "doesn't help any."
And Senator Mitt Romney of Utah hinted at concerns that Mr. Moore, a conservative writer, think-tank economist and founder of the anti-tax group Club for Growth, may be too partisan for the job.
"I hope the people that go in the Fed are economists and not partisan," Mr. Romney said. "I'm reviewing his record, his columns and so forth, and will have something for you when I'm ready."
The White House review comes as Mr. Moore is dealing with a nearly daily barrage of newly unearthed comments from his extensive paper and video trail as a conservative provocateur. Many of the statements, including Mr. Moore's comments about women's pay, were not presented as jokes or couched in humor.
During a 2016 debate on the minimum wage, for example, Mr. Moore talked about how to get more Americans into the labor force. In a serious tone, Mr. Moore said he would like to see more preteens working.
"I'm a radical on this," he said. "I'd get rid of a lot of these child labor laws. I want people starting to work at 11, 12."
The writings and statements under scrutiny span nearly two decades of Mr. Moore's career. They include one, which Mr. Moore has called an attempt at humor, that called for women to be barred from officiating or serving beer at N.C.A.A. men's basketball games.
In 2014, Mr. Moore wrote a column for National Review, in which he said women earning more than men "could be disruptive to family stability." Asked about that column on Sunday, Mr. Moore did not apologize, but said that strong economic growth under Mr. Trump was helping women and was the best way to reduce the gender pay gap.
Mr. Moore has expressed strong reservations about women working in the past. In December 2000, he fielded questions from C-Span viewers for an hour. A caller asked Mr. Moore about statistics that showed black women earning more than black men in America.
"It's not a good thing that black women are making more than black men today," Mr. Moore replied. "In fact, you know, the male needs to be the breadwinner of the family. One of the reasons you've seen the decline of the family, not just in the black community, but also it's happening now in the white community as well, is because women are more economically self-sufficient."
He has also made jokes with racial overtones. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected president, Mr. Moore broke from a talk about health care to tell his audience a joke about the departing first family. "By the way, did you see, there's that great cartoon going along?" he said. "A New York Times headline: 'First Thing Donald Trump Does as President Is Kick a Black Family Out of Public Housing,' and it has Obama leaving the White House. I mean, I just love that one. Just a great one."
In many cases, Mr. Moore's provocative statements have mirrored Mr. Trump's. He accused the Obama administration of "lying" about official unemployment statistics, claiming the actual rate was double the 5 percent rate reported by the Labor Department, accusations Mr. Trump also made. In August 2017, appearing on CNN, Mr. Moore argued with the host John Berman about whether slavery caused the Civil War and defended Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general whom Mr. Trump praised last week.
"Robert E. Lee hated slavery," Mr. Moore said. "He abhorred slavery, but he fought for his section of the country. That's a totally different subject."
"I can't let it slide," Mr. Berman said. "Robert E. Lee held slaves. He ordered the beating of slaves. He ordered the return of fugitive slaves and he fought for the dissolution of the union to maintain slavery. So, his personal attitude towards slavery ----"
"No," Mr. Moore said. "It was not ----"
He continued: "The Civil War was about the South having its own rights."
After the white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Va., that killed a woman in August 2017, he wrote a column warning of the rise of left-wing violence in America, reminiscent of Mr. Trump's "both sides" remarks.
"The shame of all this is that if liberals had simply ignored the wacko white supremacists who gathered in Charlottesville, and who represent perhaps 0.01 percent of the conservative movement, their flame of hatred would have burned out quickly and quietly," Mr. Moore wrote. "That's the last thing the left wanted. They gave the wackos on the right a media platform, so that militants on the left would have their own soap box and TV camera spotlight. So just who is spreading a message of hate in America?"

FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS DEFIES GOP ORTHODOXY WITH DRUG IMPORTATION PLAN: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is challenging traditional Republican doctrine with a plan to import prescription drugs from Canada to lower costs for seniors, the first major legislative initiative of his young tenure.

DeSantis' plan, devised to appeal to the gray vote and first unveiled at the retirement community The Villages, calls for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to choose Canadian wholesalers and license them to export specific, high-cost drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to Florida. The cheaper medications will then be dispensed by local pharmacies to any Floridian with a prescription.

Following in the footsteps of progressive Vermont: In 2018, the Vermont state legislature unanimously passed its own importation plan to allow high-cost FDA-approved drugs to be purchased through licensed Canadian wholesalers, but it has yet to get the necessary approval from the federal Department of Health and Human Services.

DeSantis, a vocal supporter of President Trump , is projecting confidence that the Trump administration will sign off on his bill if it's enacted.

"President Trump encouraged Governor DeSantis to proceed with this initiative and with the President’s support, we feel confident that this can get done safely and effectively," a spokesman for the governor said.

Aside from Trump, the Republican Party generally opposes drug importation. Even Trump's top health officials have criticized the idea. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called it a “gimmick” last year.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin , president of the conservative think tank the American Action Forum and an adviser to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, says DeSantis’ plan is a “false hope."

“Importation won’t work,” Holtz-Eakin said. “The notion that Canada will send back all of the drugs it authorized for themselves — they’re not going to let them get away. It makes no sense.”

The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page also criticized DeSantis this month for the plan, saying that he is aligning himself with progressive legislators in Vermont.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR APPEALS RULING ON ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS: The Department of Labor on Friday filed notice that it will appeal a ruling by a federal judge that struck down a Trump administration rule letting individuals and small businesses pool together to buy health insurance.

The decision on March 28 by U.S. District Judge John Bates , an appointee of former President George W. Bush , threatens coverage for people who are enrolled in association health plans.

The administration will be appealing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but the notice filed by the Department of Labor did not say whether the Trump administration is asking for a stay on the decision.

KANSAS SUPREME COURT RULES STATE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS ABORTION RIGHTS: The Kansas Supreme Court ruled Friday that the state constitution protects abortion rights, blocking the legislature's 2015 ban on second-trimester abortions. Because the protection of abortion rights is enshrined in the state constitution, abortion will remain legal in Kansas even if the U.S. Supreme Court reverses or narrows the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In 2015, the Kansas state legislature banned dilation and evacuation abortions, procedures most common in the second trimester. The exceptions are for if the safety of the mother is threatened or if the fetus is already dead.

WASHINGTON LEGISLATURE SENDS PUBLIC OPTION HEALTHCARE BILL TO GOV: The Washington State legislature has passed legislation, SB 5526, which would create a public option for healthcare coverage Saturday, and sent it to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee ’s desk for approval.The plan would be known as Cascade Care, available through Washington’s Health Benefit Exchange, and would be the first public health insurance option in the nation. Inslee worked with lawmakers throughout the process. The bill passed with a 56-41 vote in the House, and a 27-21 vote in the Senate.

FDA APPROVES TREATMENT FOR LUPUS IN KIDS AND TEENS: The FDA approved intravenous lupus treatment for kids as young as five Friday, called Benlysta. The treatment has been approved for adult use since 2011, but now children and young adults can safely use the only biologic therapy approved for lupus treatment. Lupus is sometimes more aggressive in kids and the symptoms are more intense. “While there is no cure for lupus, treatment can help our youngest patients control their disease with the hope of improving their quality of life and lowering their risk of long-term organ damage and disability,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

BETO O’ROURKE CALLS FOR ETHICAL FARM-TO-TABLE RESTAURANTS IN EVERY COMMUNITY: Democratic Presidential Candidate Beto O'Rourke called for the establishment of farm-to-table restaurants in every community to combat poor nutrition at a Friday event hosted at a brewery by the Nevada State Democratic Party in a Las Vegas suburb.

TRUMP HITS JOE BIDEN ON AGE: ‘I AM A YOUNG, VIBRANT MAN’: Trump, 73, described himself as "so young" Friday, saying that compared to former Vice President Joe Biden , 76: "I am a young, vibrant man." Trump said, “I look at Joe, I don't know about him ... I would never say anyone is too old. But they are all making me look very young both in terms of age and in terms of energy." Biden, who will be 77 in November, is leading most polls of Democratic contenders.

BOTOX, HAIR PLUGS, AND VENEERS: BIDEN COULD ESCAPE THE COSMETIC SURGERY SCRUTINY HILLARY CLINTON ENDURED: Cosmetic doctors are certain that Biden’s full head of hair, smooth forehead, and Cheshire Cat grin are the result of plastic surgery and other procedures. Around the time of the 2008 campaign, alterations in Biden’s appearance became noticeable. His hairline changed, wrinkles disappeared, his smile was brighter. 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton faced scrutiny for cosmetic surgery during the 2016 campaign, but thus far, there are no signs that Biden, 76, will get the same treatment as he launches his 2020 presidential bid.

BOLTON: US STIFFED NORTH KOREA ON AGREEMENT TO PAY $2M FOR OTTO WARMBIER’S MEDICAL BILLS: National security adviser John Bolton admitted Sunday State Department envoy Joseph Yun signed a document agreeing to pay North Korea $2 million for Otto Warmbier’s medical costs, but said that the agreement was “absolutely not” kept. Warmbier was detained by North Korean authorities in 2016 and was tortured in custody until his return to the U.S. in 2017. He arrived in a comatose state and died soon after.

Taylor Swift featuring Brendon Urie, 'Me!'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Remembering and facing the challenges of the past is a bold, potent choice, but nevertheless, so many people prefer to forget. Taylor Swift has rarely been one to put up blinders, instead making her problems her gasoline, her kindling, her spark. The anguish is the art. But "Me!" -- her new single, and presumably the first from her forthcoming seventh album -- is, quite relentlessly, the sound of moving forward, eyes averted.
At the beginning of the song's video, a pink-and-white snake slithers toward the camera; the reptile was part of the symbolic language surrounding the sharp-tongued "Reputation," Swift's 2017 album. Swift was the snake -- painted as such by Kim Kardashian West, in a public feud that reshaped Swift's image from belle of the ball into something darker and more textured. But in the video, the snake explodes and becomes a thousand butterflies: Her conflagrations are in the past, and Swift is renewed.
A shame, really. "Reputation" was Swift's most forward-looking, contemporary-pop-aware album. Even if large parts of it were animated by agita, it was well-written and well-executed (if occasionally awkward) with a persistent hum of tension.
"Me!" -- which is mechanistic fun, but dull at the edges -- skips all that in favor of a kind of uncritical exuberance that's almost piercingly saccharine. The song's lyrics are in a familiar Swift mode (if on the whole, a little less punchy than usual): "I know that I went psycho on the phone/I never leave well enough alone." It's her singing that alters the calibration. Swift isn't an especially powerful vocalist, but she's long had an unerring sense of how to deliver tsunami-grade melody, knowing when to lean in to a buildup. But here, when she gets to the hook, her singing thins out, gets childlike, almost gleeful. The restraint is, at times, agonizing.
"Me!" is a duet with Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, a potent vocalist with far lower star wattage who seems to be under-singing here so as not to trample the boss. (That Swift chose a duet for her return is also baffling -- the collaboration is a distraction, not an additive.) And on Thursday night, Swift appeared for a brief interview during the N.F.L. Draft; "Me!" will be the soundtrack of its second round. It is difficult to think of a less apt partnership than Swift, who has recently found her political voice, and the scandal-plagued N.F.L.
All of which is surprising, because Swift is as aggressive and effective a chess player as pop has seen in years. These choices suggest that the urgency of the bigger goal -- to shake free of the last few years of distractions -- was far more crucial than the minor details of songwriting (by Swift, Urie and Joel Little) and production (by Swift and Little). Rather than opt to wear the patina of surviving a rough stretch, Swift has chosen a to-the-studs restoration and a fresh coat of paint. It gleams so bright, it just might obscure the fact that anything was ever out of place. Too bad. JON CARAMANICA
Bruce Springsteen, 'Hello Sunshine'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
For some time Bruce Springsteen has been mentioning an album that harks back to the 1970s of Southern California -- Laurel Canyon pop, a genre exploration that has nothing to do with the 21st century. "Hello Sunshine" is the first sample of that album, "Western Stars." It's a well-cushioned, smoothly melodic testimonial to despairing resignation. Springsteen sustains a croon, backed by a pedal steel guitar, a cottony bass line and a string section; there's a meditative instrumental outro. But when he sings "Hello sunshine, won't you stay?" it's a request without much hope; he's been singing about lonely, endless empty roads ahead: "no place to be and miles to go." As plush as the music is, that's his vista. PARELES
FKA twigs, 'Cellophane'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
On its own, "Cellophane" would be striking enough: a slow, desperate plea to hold on to a love that's disappearing: "Why don't I do it for you/why won't you do it for me?" At first FKA twigs is accompanied only by a few piano notes, but other sounds waft in, acoustic and distorted and electronic, among them a forebodingly calm whispered beatbox beat. The video clip multiplies the strangeness: It's a pole dance turned into a cosmic abduction and muddy ritual. PARELES
Rico Nasty & Kenny Beats, 'Sell Out'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Anger Management," the new mini album from Rico Nasty and the producer Kenny beats, is wild, boisterous fun. Rico Nasty is an enthusiastically aggrieved rapper, and on "Cold," the album opener, with its greasy and chaotic production, she's brawl-ready. But there's an appealing calm -- relatively speaking -- on "Sell Out," about finding peace somewhere on the other side of the storm (or maybe within). "Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out/Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out," she raps, adding the therapeutic realization, "The expression of anger is a form of rejuvenation." CARAMANICA
Diplo presents Thomas Wesley featuring Cam, 'So Long'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"So Long" is the first single from a forthcoming country music project by Diplo, who in the last decade has taken his talents to just about anywhere that might have them. Nashville can be a cloistered place, but this alliance isn't as unlikely as it seems. Avicii pioneered the blending of dance music and roots music many years ago, and, for a time in the early 2010s, Nashville had a brief flirtation with EDM, with aftereffects that still linger. Which is to say that this up-tempo thumper, with firm singing by Cam, doesn't sound like a rude intrusion, but rather a logical, uncontroversial continuation. CARAMANICA
Ezra Collective, 'Why You Mad?'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"You Can't Steal My Joy" is the debut album from Ezra Collective, one of the burgeoning South London jazz scene's leading ensemble. The record channels the group's live performances, which can feel at once like a concert and a communion, and flow easily from fathomless, woozy grooves to thrashing, high-energy bouts of brass and percussion. In just two-and-a-half minutes, the track "Why You Mad?" exemplifies that nimble versatility; in concerts, this piece can often feel like it's taken over the crowd, turning it into a single body and causing it to move in a collective heave. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Petrol Girls, 'Big Mouth'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard," the voice of Poly Styrene intones on the British punk band Petrol Girls' new single, "Big Mouth." (As we well know, Ms. Styrene had a differing opinion.) "Big Mouth," a preview of the band's May album "Cut & Stitch," is a paean to speaking up and breaking out. "Know your place/Bite your tongue," the singer Ren Aldridge taunts in the snotty voice of an oppressor. On the chorus, she explodes: "I'm raising my voice louder/It carries me beyond their walls." CARYN GANZ
Rajna Swaminathan, 'Peregrination'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Joined by a cast of standout young jazz musicians, the percussionist Rajna Swaminathan -- who plays the mridangam, a barrel-shaped drum native to south India -- has just released "Of Agency and Abstraction," a debut album with its own fresh, interpretive take on the Carnatic music tradition. Much in the way of the Tirtha trio (featuring Swaminathan's mentor, the pianist Vijay Iyer) and the Indo-Pak Coalition before her, Swaminathan lets jazz and Indian classical merge organically, through her writing and the skill sets of her improvising partners. On "Peregrination," prominently featuring Swaminathan's sister, the violinist Anjna Swaminathan, that means mixing passages of slithering mystery with sections of bristling, complex rhythm.

Where is the next Osmo V¤nsk¤?
The question went buzzing through Orchestra Hall in December when the Minnesota Orchestra music director announced that he would depart his position in 2022, after 19 years on the podium.
"There's a little bit of chatter that starts backstage," said principal trombone Douglas Wright. "You just start imagining the possibilities."
Not that the players have forgotten the successes of the V¤nsk¤ era. There were groundbreaking tours to Cuba and South Africa. There were triumphant Carnegie Hall appearances and 2014 Grammy Award for one of the orchestra's numerous recordings with V¤nsk¤. "The orchestra is playing better than it ever has in my experience here," said Wright, who joined the orchestra 24 years ago and worked on the search committee that brought V¤nsk¤ to Minneapolis in 2003. "Whoever comes in here and drives this incredible Maserati will hopefully push us to the next level."
One possible driver is Spanish conductor Juanjo Mena -- already touted as a potential V¤nsk¤ replacement -- who takes the podium next weekend for a program featuring Haydn, Bernstein and Mozart. Another candidate is English conductor Edward Gardner, returning to Minneapolis next month to lead the choral blockbuster that is Verdi's Requiem. The recently announced 2019-20 season is studded with possibilities, with several more prospects appearing as guest conductors.
A panel of Minnesota Orchestra board members, administrators and musicians is charged with selecting the next music director. How might concertgoers assess the chances of each individual candidate when he or she appears at Orchestra Hall? Flute and piccolo player Roma Duncan offered one clue.
Dramatic lunges, striking poses and emotional facial expressions might whip up enthusiasm among audiences, she said. But that doesn't always impress orchestra musicians. "As an audience member, you can kind of look around the orchestra and get an idea of how we're feeling by reading our body language. That perhaps tells you more about how we feel toward the conductor than how well you personally felt the concert went."
Evolving expectations
What are the players looking for, exactly? How will they know when the next Minnesota Orchestra music director is standing before them?
Yes, it's important he or she have the technical ability to make everyone play together crisply. But the players also need to be stretched, the orchestra pushed toward setting and achieving new goals. Wright said, "It's easy to get bored real fast with somebody who comes in and says, 'You know, you guys sound great.' And it's like, 'OK, now what?' They have to have a real opinion about a piece of music, and a depth of understanding beyond what we as players do."
As an example, Wright cited V¤nsk¤'s very first appearances in Minnesota. "He made the orchestra better right away," Wright said of the Finnish conductor, originally an outlier to the music director job. "He had a musical drive and intensity that really captured the orchestra's imagination."
What's more, Wright said, V¤nsk¤ was quick to admit his mistakes. "Before that, I'd never heard a conductor apologize for anything."
Over the past three of four years, there's been an even bigger shift when it comes to music directors. For more a century, classical music was dominated by the image of the unapologetic, autocratic maestro ruling his players from the bully pulpit of the podium. Arturo Toscanini, George Szell, Fritz Reiner, Georg Solti -- these conductors presided over their American orchestras with an iron rod, with famously combustible temperaments that unexpectedly erupted in rehearsals.
But the age of unquestioning maestro worship is fading. When Yannick Nzet-Sguin became music director of New York City's Metropolitan Opera last year, the Canadian conductor said he would consciously break with "this culture of 'You can't say anything to the maestro.' " Lithuanian conductor Mirga Gražinyt-Tyla adopts a similarly collaborative approach at England's City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. "All the questions, and all the answers, are in the music itself," she has said.
Duncan summarized the democratization of orchestral workplaces: "There's been a lot more acknowledgment and understanding that you can be a fantastic artist and a great leader without being a despot or really unpleasant."
Navigating the unknown
What's the finishing touch for a great 21st-century music director?
For Wright, it's a delicate balance between people skills and elite musical talent: "to be demanding in a very respectful way," is how he put it.
For Duncan, it's important to leave space for the contributions of individual players. "The magic is the person who can find the balance, who can express their overall idea to us without telling us how to play every single note."
Of course, the next music director must be versatile enough to navigate and even lead in a changing industry. "The biggest difference that I would see between now and 2003 … is that orchestras have really diversified what they do," Duncan said. "We go out into the community in different ways. We're actively seeking diversity in more ways and more places. That calls for a new music director to be even more flexible."
Then there's that "intangible spark" as Duncan called it -- the X-factor that enables a conductor to inspire musicians as well as donors, audiences and funders.
It will be a few more years before Minnesota fans know who has it. Until then, music director candidates will bring plenty of bumps, curveballs and surprises to the Orchestra Hall faithful. For regular concertgoers, it's certain to be exciting.

Texto completo: "How much is a little girl worth?" asked former gymnast Rachael Denhollander during the victim impact statements at Larry Nassar's sentencing hearing — seven days of raw, devastating, ultimately empowering testimony from more than 150 women who faced their abuser for the world to see.
That moment captures the message of "At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal," airing on HBO at 8 p.m. Friday. The documentary delves into a system that failed to protect young athletes from sexual abuse by a predator who used his medical credentials as a cover for his crimes.
Filmmaker Erin Lee Carr started working on the movie in July 2017, about six months before Nassar, a former Michigan State University doctor and USA Gymnastics team physician, was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison. She was still poring over the finishing touches days before its Thursday debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.
As the Tribeca guide describes, " 'At the Heart of Gold' follows the money and it leads to the abuse of the bodies of young girls deemed disposable. But the films also highlights their efforts to fight back and earn the most important title of their lives: survivor."
Carr's first goal for her documentary is to give a voice to those survivors. Beyond that, her sharp eye keeps the spotlight on what allowed accusations against Nassar to go unheeded for so long and how to safeguard against future abusers.
"My hope is for this film to add to the incredible reporting that has been done about this subject matter, and then to really serve as a flint, to emit more fire. I think there's a lot of accountability that needs to happen," says Carr. "This doesn't have to happen again."
"At The Heart of Gold" tells its story through interviews with a dozen survivors, along with lawyers, coaches, commentators, sportswriters and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who presided over the Nassar trial.
The film doesn't flinch from showing the horrifying extent of Nassar's sexual abuse — which took place over decades — and his grooming techniques of pretending to be an empathetic ally to his targets. But the documentary also illuminates the dark side of U.S. women's gymnastics, a place where tweens and teens were pushed so hard to see who could succeed, it became what one interviewee calls "athletic Darwinism."
From the time they are small girls, these elite athletes are required to have incredible physical skill, withstand pain and injury without complaining and to tolerate the constant, often bullying commands of adults.
"It's almost like being a wounded animal. You don't show your weakness," says Kathy Johnson, a pioneering U.S. gymnast and sports commentator, early in the film.
Carr, a former producer at Vice and a 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree, has made a name for herself with several high-profile documentaries for HBO, including 2017's "Mommy Dead and Dearest," which explored Munchhausen syndrome by proxy and murder in the mother-and-daughter saga of Dee Dee and Gypsy Blanchard.
Her upcoming film, "I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth vs. Michelle Carter," which will air sometime this summer and was screened in March at the SXSW festival, involves the trial of a teenager who via text urged her friend to kill himself.
Carr also is the author of "All That You Leave Behind," a just-released memoir about her life with her late father, acclaimed New York Times media reporter David Carr.
As she was wrapping up an episode for "Dirty Money," a Netflix series on financial misdeeds, Carr was approached about making a documentary on the Nassar scandal. That started the painstaking process of researching the subject and trying to to gain the trust of survivors.
"It was, I would say, very difficult. At the start, nobody said yes to us," she admits. "People were very careful. There was some trepidation."
Eventually, Michigan attorney Mick Grewel, who is in the movie and represents several survivors, helped open the door to initial conversations with his clients. The 12 interviews from women who endured Nassar's appalling physical violations give the movie an emotional resonance that, three years after the Indianapolis Star's landmark investigation, feels as powerful as ever.
The pain that remains with the survivors provoked Carr to briefly speak up during an interview with Trinea Gonczar and offer her words of comfort from off-screen. Carr considered cutting out her comments.
"There was part of me that has been trained as a journalist by my dad David Carr, who worked at the Times, that it's about getting information and not putting yourself in the story. But I felt like that was an impossibility given the subject matter, and so I allowed myself to participate in what I think is sort of radical empathy," she says.
"In that moment, I'm showing the audience that I am listening, I am attentive, but I also understand. And it's not something she needs to be embarrassed about or ashamed about. That to me was a really important part."
Later, at the sentencing hearing, Gonczar is shown telling Nassar to his face, "You hurt me, as I've had to realize I was abused for many years of my life. ...I will do everything for the rest of my life to make sure that the 'yous' of this world don't get to hurt another one of us."
Carr was determined not to "give the movie over to Larry Nassar," as she puts it, even though he appears in videos and photos from before and during his trial. "He had taken so much power away from so many people that it was really like, 'OK how do I tell this story without handing the movie over to the perpetrator, because that would cause more harm, and I'm not in the business of causing more harm."
In fact, she carefully weighed the decision to include clips from what appears to be an instructional tape with Nassar and a young girl whose face is blurred out. Educational on the surface but chilling in retrospect, it shows Nassar putting his hands on her body over and over as he demonstrates certain movements and injuries.
"What I saw as a filmmaker was the general ease in which he touched women's bodies. He never asked," says Carr. "It was potentially a risky choice to include those videos, but it really went to the heart of his behavior. ... He saw these women as just objects. It really deeply disturbed me."
Carr wasn't able to be in court for the January 2018 statements from survivors. Hospitalized with a rare form of pneumonia, she relied on executive producer Sarah Gibson to be there for the bulk of the time. When Gibson returned with the footage, Carr recalls, "I think I said, 'We have a documentary now.' "
The tentacles of the USA Gymnastics scandal had an enormous reach, as "At the Heart of Gold" chronicles in detail. Nassar, currently in prison, was sentenced to up to 175 years behind bars. Not long after, the entire board of USA Gymnastics resigned and the organization lost its certification. The chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee stepped down from his post. Michigan State University agreed to a $500 million settlement for those he had abused.
Now it's time for the ripple effects of efforts like Carr's film to shift attention to preventing sexual abuse and helping move women's gymnastics — and all sports that draw children, tweens and teens into rigorous training regimens — in a better direction.
"I want the survivors to feel represented, and I want young people, young men and women, to feel like they can speak up if something happens to them," says Carr. "If those things happen, even on a small scale, I will be deeply thrilled that I did a small act of service in this really beautiful and devastating world."

Rubio confirms Russian intrusion

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed Friday there was an intrusion into Florida's elections systems by hackers in 2016, according to the New York Times.
Rubio would not say who was behind the hacking, saying he was constrained by his position on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the redacted version of the Mueller Report released April 18 stated the FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was infiltrated with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents.
Rubio's statement contradicts the Florida Secretary of State's office, which maintained last week that its elections systems weren't hacked. Secretary Laurel Lee also said at the time that the FBI hadn't told the state which county they believe was compromised.
Rubio said the information was discovered through an intelligence operation, not a criminal investigation,
"Everybody has been told what it is they need to do to protect themselves from the intrusion," Rubio told the Times. "I don't believe the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified. The concern was that in a number of counties across the country, there are a couple of people with the attitude of: 'We've got this; we don't need your help. We don't think we need to do what you are telling us we need to do.'"
The hackers, were "in a position" to change voter roll information, he told the Times, but it didn't appear they did.
Gov. Ron DeSantis had said at a press conference in Orlando last week that he didn't believe any breach would have affected vote totals.
But in Miami on Thursday, according to Politico, he was critical of the FBI, telling reporters, "They won't tell us which county it was, are you kidding me? Why would you have not said something immediately?"
DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott will meet with the FBI in coming weeks to discuss the Russian hacking attempts on Florida counties in 2016.
Scott's office said the FBI has reached out to him and is working on scheduling a briefing in the next few weeks. DeSantis' office said no date has yet been set.
The report stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials "sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election."
The emails contained an attached Word document with malicious "Trojan" software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer. But none of the 52 Florida counties that had contracts with VR Systems, the Tallahassee company who was allegedly impersonated, has admitted to opening that document.
Volusia County elections supervisor Lisa Lewis said Thursday the office opened one of the infected emails in 2016, but not the infected attachment. Broward County supervisor Peter Antonacci said this week the county received the email, but it was quarantined by anti-virus software and officials wouldn't have had the opportunity to open the attachment.
Last year, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned Russians had gained access to Florida voter data but declined to identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified. No other officials backed up Nelson's claim, including Rubio, and Scott and national Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his "alarming claims" and "extremely reckless behavior."
Rubio did warn repeatedly in 2016 that "state election systems are potentially vulnerable to Russian cyber attacks."

Hearing on Weinstein Witnesses Will Be Private

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
One of the primary questions hovering over the coming sexual assault trial of Harvey Weinstein is whether the court will let women aside from the two mentioned in the indictment testify about their experiences with the movie producer.
But a state court judge in Manhattan ruled on Friday that hearings to determine what evidence of uncharged crimes might be allowed at trial would take place in a sealed courtroom with the public and the press excluded.
The ruling by Justice James Burke in State Supreme Court meant the list of other witnesses prosecutors want to call to testify against Mr. Weinstein -- and what they might say -- will remain secret a little longer, perhaps until his trial starts on September 9.
Both the prosecution and the defense had asked for the hearing to be held behind closed doors, arguing that allowing it to be public could make it harder to find an impartial jury. Justice Burke agreed with them, ruling this month that closing the courtroom was "the only means available to avoid tainting the jury pool."
Still, before the hearing started on Friday, a lawyer for several news organizations, including The New York Times, argued that access to judicial proceedings and records is protected by the First Amendment. The lawyer, Robert D. Balin, urged Judge Burke to unseal all court filings in the case and allow the press and the public to attend.
Justice Burke quickly turned down the request. He noted what he called Mr. Weinstein's "celebrity status" and said a continued high level of attention from reporters could jeopardize Mr. Weinstein's right to a fair trial.
"The publication of the information at this time would serve no purpose other than to arouse public sentiment against the defendant," he said, before ordering the courtroom cleared.
Mr. Balin said that he would immediately turn to an appeals court to ask for a stay.
The indictment against Mr. Weinstein, 67, charges him with raping one woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and forcing another to let him perform oral sex on her at his townhouse in 2006.
Mr. Weinstein, who pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 1 million bail, has denied the charges, saying the encounters were consensual.
Dozens of other women have said publicly that they, too, experienced highly inappropriate behavior at his hands, ranging from sexual harassment to rape.
The Manhattan district attorney's has sought permission to put some of those other accusers on the witness stand, perhaps to establish a pattern of behavior. Prosecutors in Pennsylvania employed the same tactic in convicting Bill Cosby last year on three counts of sexual assault.
Mr. Weinstein, who became a powerful figures in Hollywood while running Miramax, has been the subject of intensive reporting since 2017, when stories in The New Yorker and The New York Times detailed allegations of his sexual misconduct against multiple women, and reported that he had paid off several accusers.
The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, argued in a letter to the court that the hearings should be secret not just to avoid publicizing more allegations that might prejudice potential jurors, but to protect the privacy of witnesses who have been victims of sexual assault.
"Not every person we have listed that we are asking to call has been made public," she told the judge on Friday.
Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, wrote in a court filing that a "sensationalized media environment" justified excluding the press and public from the hearing.
In court on Friday, another lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, Marianne Bertuna, said that news coverage of the case had already harmed her client. "Let's limit the damage that has been done here in the midst of an insatiable media frenzy," she said
But Mr. Balin countered that there was a significant and legitimate public interest in the hearings and that the prosecution and defense had not met the high legal burden to justify sweeping restrictions.
"What I've heard is that somehow it is improper for the press and public to sit here and report news in real time," he told Judge Burke. "That is what our constitution envisions."
Mr. Balin argued in an earlier court filing that most of the information that was to be discussed during the hearing had was already public, thanks to thorough reporting. He also questioned the assertion that news reports about the hearings would harm Mr. Weinstein. The jury pool had already been exposed to highly-publicized allegations in the press and on social media from more than 80 women, he noted.
Mr. Weinstein was indicted in 2018 on six criminal charges including two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Judge Burke dismissed one of those charges last fall after prosecutors acknowledged that the lead detective in the case had failed to tell them about a witness who cast doubt on one of Mr. Weinstein's accusers.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Slack, the workplace messaging start-up, disclosed the details of its business in an offering prospectus on Friday as it joined the parade of tech companies that plan to publicly list their shares this year.
Sharing its financial results widely for the first time, Slack said it had collected $ 400.6 million in revenue in its latest fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31. That was nearly double what it had generated in the previous fiscal year. It lost $ 140.7 million in the latest fiscal year, narrowing its losses from $ 180.9 million the year before.
The company had 88,000 paying customers at the end of the most recent fiscal year, up almost 50 percent from the previous year. Of those customers, 575 paid more than $ 100,000 for their subscriptions, contributing about 40 percent of the company's revenue.
Friday's filing shed more light on Slack, which has grown out of a video game company into an increasingly common way for workers to communicate. Its software is meant to be a replacement for email -- but it also lets colleagues chat and share files, among other tasks.
Slack's filing followed the initial public offerings of two other high-profile start-ups, Lyft and Pinterest. The biggest tech public offering of recent years -- that of the ride-hailing giant Uber -- is also on deck, with Uber pricing its shares on Friday in a stock sale that is expected to value it at as much as $ 91 billion.
The I.P.O. boom has had mixed results. Lyft's shares sank below their I.P.O. price after an initial spike last month. Pinterest's stock has stayed above its offering price since its debut on the market this month.
But less-prominent start-ups that sell software to other businesses have performed better. Shares of Zoom, a video conferencing company, rose 80 percent on its first day of trading as a public company this month, and PagerDuty, which sells software to help companies respond to complaints and other incidents, experienced a first-day pop of 60 percent.
Investors typically like the predictable revenue of tech companies that sell software to businesses and are betting that companies will continue to increase their spending on these wares. Slack, which is pitching itself as doing "nearly anything that people do together at work," will seek to benefit from that trend.

Yet unlike most other Silicon Valley darlings going public this year, Slack is not holding an initial public offering, where it sells shares to the public. Instead it will carry out a "direct listing," where it simply lets its shares start trading on a stock market. It plans to do so on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "SK."
The price of its stock would then be set solely by demand from public-market investors. The process has none of the safeguards of a traditional I.P.O., since the company will not sell shares that could help guarantee trading liquidity. That poses the risk of Slack's market capitalization falling below the $ 7.2 billion that it was valued at by private investors last year.
The last major company to take this route was Spotify, which listed its shares last year. Like that music-streaming giant, Slack can do this kind of transaction because it does not need the money. The messaging service has taken advantage of the plentiful capital in private markets, amassing $ 1.2 billion in venture funding, half of it in the last two years.
Slack disclosed on Friday that it has $ 841 million in cash on its balance sheet, according to its prospectus.
(That does not mean Slack is shedding all the trappings of an I.P.O.: It has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Company as advisers for its direct listing.)
Slack's chief executive, Stewart Butterfield, has reveled in the easy money available to his company. "It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians," he told The New York Times in 2015.
The company's biggest shareholders include the investment firms Accel, Andreessen Horowitz and Social Capital and the Japanese technology titan SoftBank.
Slack grew out of TinySpeck, a gaming company that Mr. Butterfield created in 2010. TinySpeck's game, Glitch, was a flop, but the team continued work on an internal communication tool it had built. That became Slack, which quickly spread among tech start-ups and now counts more than 10 million daily active users.
Its evolution mirrors that of Mr. Butterfield's previous company, the photo-sharing site Flickr. That company also started out in online gaming but switched to a more promising tool its developers had built that allowed people to post their photos online. Yahoo bought Flickr in 2005.
Slack has resisted acquisition interest from Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft now has a competing product, Microsoft Teams, which more than 420,000 organizations are using. Facebook and Google have similar services.
Earlier this week, Slack held its annual Frontiers conference for customers and partners on a pier in San Francisco. Mr. Butterfield kicked off the event by saying Slack's mission is to make people's working lives "simpler, more pleasant and more productive."
Slack's customers have a common interest in figuring out how to do their best work, he said. "It's a desire to create a better experience for your team," he said.

Texto completo: Some kids play soccer. Other kids make slime. Guess who has more money for college?
Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

Texto completo: URBANA -- "I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?"
That's what one Broadway great, Cole Porter, composed about the Gershwin brothers.
Tony Award-winning "Crazy for You" opens tonight at Krannert Center. George and Ira Gershwin's reconfigured comedy includes classics such as "Shall We Dance," "I Got Rhythm" and "Nice Work If You Can Get It."
Sarah Wigley is the director, Michael Tilley the music director and Charlie Maybee the choreographer in one of the funniest and most hummable musicals of that great musical decade, the 1930s.
To maximize the hits, "Crazy For You" follows much of the 1930 musical "Girl Crazy," but adds songs from other Gershwin productions.
Wigley grew up with Gershwin playing in her house.
"I've been giving these songs to students for individual voice study for a decade now," she said. "My favorite Gershwin tunes are 'But Not for Me' and 'They Can't Take That Away From Me,' which appear back-to-back in our show."
"Crazy for You" is the story of Bobby Child, sent from New York to Deadrock, Nev., to foreclose on a broken-down theatre. He meets Polly Baker, who, in the Gershwin tradition, is spunky -- the daughter of the theater owner. So you can expect romance in the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers tradition.
"I definitely wanted to stage this musical in a traditional way. I feel particularly purist about Gershwin, and the fact that there is so much tap-dancing feels indicative of the time period and style of the 1930s," Wigley said.
In 1992, the New York Times' Frank Rich wrote '''Crazy for You' scrapes away decades of cabaret and jazz and variety-show interpretations to reclaim the Gershwins' standards, in all their glorious youth, for the dynamism of the stage."
The glorious youth include 25 students majoring in lyric theatre, acting, dance, voice and other classes. Most have not had tap-dancing experience. Only a few of them had ever taken a tap-dancing class.
They've worked hard, Wigley said, and know their material.
"Many of these Gershwin standards were familiar to the students ... our artistic team are all Gershwin fans," she said.

Texto completo: Jean-Marc Fournier, the chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, had been at the Arc de Triomphe for its annual Holy Monday ceremony honoring military chaplains of the past, but the day quickly turned dark when he saw a plume of black smoke rising from the city. He checked his phone, which was filled with dozens of messages telling him Notre Dame was burning, and he immediately rushed to the cathedral to help.

Speaking with the French Catholic magazine Famille Chrétienne, Fournier said when he rushed to Notre Dame and saw the fire raging, “We quickly focused on the priority: the Relics of the Passion and the Blessed Sacrament.” The Crown of Thorns is said to have been worn by Jesus on the cross, and the Blessed Sacrament is the central part of every Catholic Mass. Catholics believe that when the bread is consecrated it becomes what is known as the "real presence" — the actual "body of Christ."

While other firefighters broke open the case holding the Crown of Thorns and rescued it from the blaze, Fournier made his way to the Altar of St. George to rescue the sacrament from the fire, moving it to a sacristy that was not threatened by the flames. Standing with the rescued sacrament in hand as the fire raged, Fournier said, “I asked Jesus — who I really believe is in these hosts — to fight the flames and preserve the building dedicated to his mother.”

Speaking to the New York Times, the priest joked, “I thought Jesus could help us a little bit and work, too. I invited him to worry about his own house if he didn’t want to finish the night under a tent by the Canal Saint-Martin.”

Fournier said that when he entered the cathedral, the spire had already collapsed and he feared the nave might be about to cave in as well, describing in vivid detail “a rain of fire that was falling without pause from the roof.”

A coordinated effort was also launched to save as many other treasures as possible. Firefighters rushed throughout the cathedral and up hundreds of stairs to its bell towers. And a human chain was formed to quickly move statutes and other works of art away from the blaze. Many of the rescued works have been sent to the Louvre for storage and restoration. Fournier said he led the way through Notre Dame’s chapels and corridors, helping rescuers save as much as they could until they were told the fire was too dangerous to continue.

This isn’t the first time that Fournier has had a brush with danger.

The November 2015 Islamic State terrorist attacks in and around Paris killed 130 people. The deadliest part of the assault happened at the Bataclan music venue during an Eagles of Death Metal concert, where 90 people were killed. Fournier was among the first to rush into the theater, helping evacuate victims, comforting the wounded, and performing last rites for the dying. “I gave collective absolution, as the Catholic Church authorizes me,” the priest said following the attack.

Before that, Fournier served as a military chaplain for years as part of the Diocese of the French Armed Forces, where he deployed to Afghanistan.

In his Easter homily, French Archbishop Michel Aupetit honored Fournier’s heroism and praised the priest for saving the Blessed Sacrament. Crux, a Catholic magazine, quoted the bishop as rhetorically asking worshippers: “What is more precious? The cathedral, the treasure, or the bread crumb?”

“It is for this Body, veiled under the appearance of a crumb of bread, that this cathedral was built,” the archbishop said.

JUDGE TO BLOCK TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S RULES TARGETING PLANNED PARENTHOOD: A federal judge on Tuesday said that he would block the Trump administration from setting new rules that would have cut off millions of dollars in government funding from Planned Parenthood.

U.S. District Judge Michael McShane , a nominee of former President Barack Obama , said he would grant a preliminary injunction, calling the rule a "ham-fisted approach to public health policy.'' The case landed in court after Oregon's and 20 other states' attorneys general, as well as the American Medical Association and Planned Parenthood, filed lawsuits.

The rule, which was set to go into effect May 3, concerns a $286 million-a-year grant, known as Title X, that pays for birth control, testing of sexually transmitted diseases, and cancer screenings for 4 million low-income people. The rule requires the "physical and financial" separation of family planning services and abortion, and does not allow doctors to directly refer patients for abortions.

“At the heart of this rule is an arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women’s healthcare than their providers,” McShane said during the hearing, according to the Courthouse News Service. “The final rule would create such a financial strain on medical providers that, ironically, it would create a vacuum that would create substantially more abortions.”

Organizations have said that in order to keep the Title X grants under the new rules they would need to build separate entrances and exits, construct new health centers, and hire a second staff of doctors, nurses, and administrative staff. The rule allows them a year to make the changes.

McShane did not say whether he would rule to block the rule only in the states that had sued or apply it nationwide, but did say he will detail his plans when he publishes his written opinion.

Other related lawsuits are receiving a hearing this week, and California's lawsuit received a hearing last week. The Maine Family Planning Association will argue its case Wednesday before District Court Judge Lance Walker, who was appointed by President Trump . Another hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Washington state before U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Bastian , another Obama appointee.

DEMOCRATS SET FIRST-EVER HEARING ON MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT: The House Rules Committee will hold a hearing on the Medicare for All Act on April 30, according to an announcement posted Tuesday.

The bill is also expected to be heard in the House Budget Committee, though that hearing hasn't yet been scheduled. Supporters of the legislation don't have commitments for consideration from the House Energy and Commerce Committee or the House Ways and Means Committee, the committees that primarily oversee healthcare.

HOSPITALS SET TO GET HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT FOR CANCER TREATMENT: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a proposal Tuesday that would allow hospitals to collect more Medicare reimbursement for a type of breakthrough therapy known as CAR-T, which uses patients’ own cells to fight cancer and is typically used among patients who have run out of options. Under the current reimbursement, hospitals are reimbursed about half of what it costs, and the administration has proposed boosting the reimbursement to 65 percent. If made into a final rule, the proposal would go into effect in 2020.

COLORADO LAWMAKERS SEND PUBLIC OPTION BILL TO THE GOVERNOR: The Colorado House on Tuesday approved a bill to introduce a public health insurance option, sending the bill to the governor’s desk. The bill directs state agencies to recommend plans to compete with Colorado’s healthcare exchanges and private insurance plans. The Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and the Department of Regulatory Agencies has until November to develop a plan.

ALASKA HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS STATE WILL NOT MOVE TO BLOCK GRANTS: Alaska Health Commissioner Adam Crum was forced to walk back Gov. Mike Dunleavy ’s message to Trump that Alaska was “eager” to be the first state to receive Medicaid block grants after state lawmakers expressed anger at the potential health policy overhaul. Crum tried to calm legislators, saying that the governor only wanted Alaska “to be first on something,” but that block grants are “not our plan.” Crum then denied to Democratic Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky that he had any part in the governor’s suggestion to the president that Alaska would be interested in receiving funding in block grants .

CVS HOPES TO PREVENT PHARMACY ROBBERIES IN ALABAMA WITH TIME-DELAY SAFES: CVS announced Tuesday that it will bring time-delay safes into all 186 Alabama pharmacy locations to prevent robberies and unauthorized access to narcotics, including oxycodone and OxyContin. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall applauded the company’s measures to ensure that narcotics are kept out of the wrong hands “and these safes will make it harder for criminals to steal them.” CVS Pharmacy first implemented time-delay safes in Indianapolis in 2015. The company saw a 70 percent decline in pharmacy robberies among the Indianapolis stores where the time delay safes had been installed.

RITE AID RAISES MINIMUM PURCHASING AGE FOR TOBACCO: Rite Aid announced Tuesday that the chain would raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products, including vaping products, to 21 within the next three months. Walgreens announced it would also raise the minimum age, effective Sept. 1. Both Walgreens and Rite Aid have been under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration for frequent tobacco sales to minors.

PHARMACEUTICAL EXECS CHARGED FOR ROLE IN OPIOID CRISIS: A major opiate distributor, Rochester Drug Co-operative Inc., and two executives, were charged Tuesday with unlawfully distributing oxycodone and fentanyl and conspiracy to defraud the Drug Enforcement Agency by U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman . Under the leadership of the two executives charged, RDC filled over 1.5 million orders for opioids and distributed them to over 1,300 pharmacies between May 2012 and November 2016. RDC continued to send large orders despite “red flags” that the pharmacies sold the drugs illegally.

AT LEAST THREE STATE NATIONAL GUARDS TO REFUSE ENFORCING TRUMP’S TRANSGENDER TROOP BAN: Officials in at least three states have come out against Trump's military transgender ban and will not enforce it in their National Guards. The Daily Beast reported Tuesday that Nevada will join California and New Mexico in its rebuke of the president’s policy. Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers , deputy adjutant general for the California National Guard, said the only prerequisite for serving is a willingness to serve, and that someone’s gender identity “should be the absolute least of our worries.”

Texto completo: Kudos to Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, for having the courage and integrity to once again speak truth to power.
While most of his GOP colleagues are predictably falling in line when it comes to their interpretation of the newly released Mueller report, and some are even parroting the embarrassingly fallacious refrain, “No collusion - No obstruction!,” Romney is boldly proclaiming that the picture the report paints is deeply troubling.
In a statement released on Friday, Romney said that he was “sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President.”
He also called the report “a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.”
Truer words were never spoken.
What’s astonishing is that so few of our leaders from the party that claims family values and high moral and ethical standards as its core principles are acknowledging this obvious truth. Instead, the vast majority are completely ignoring the parts of the report that even Fox News anchor, Chris Wallace, called “damaging” and “politically embarrassing,” and are instead endlessly repeating that it’s just time to move on.
So, are party leaders also saying it is time to move on from the 2016 Republican Platform? Because here are a few statements from that Platform:
• “Our most urgent task as a Party is to restore the American people’s faith in their government by electing a president who will enforce duly enacted laws, honor constitutional limits on executive authority, and return credibility to the Oval Office.”
• “Honest elections are the foundation of representative government. We pledge to protect the voting rights of every citizen” and “to guard against foreign involvement in our elections.”
As the Mueller report made abundantly clear, President Trump has not honored constitutional limits on executive authority or in any way returned credibility to the Oval Office. Nor did he attempt to protect honest elections, but instead chose not to report Russian meddling in our elections. While it is true that the special counsel did not find evidence sufficient to establish criminal conspiracy, the actual wording of the report in relation to the question of obstruction of justice is significant:
“At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. ” (emphasis added)
Among the most troubling revelations in the report are these:
1. Russia interfered “in a sweeping and systematic fashion” in the 2016 election (something that Trump has repeatedly denied).
2. Trump and his associates had “at least 140 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition,” according to analysis of the report by The New York Times .
3. When Trump was informed that Mueller had been hired to conduct an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia, he responded with intense anger and graphic language, and said: “This is the end of my presidency.”
4. Trump tried repeatedly to shut down or undermine the special counsel's investigation, but time after time, his staff refused to follow his orders.
Clearly, if there was no obstruction, it was not for lack of trying.
Despite the President’s insistence otherwise, he was not exonerated. And saying it over and over will not somehow make it true. Though, frighteningly, in the minds of many of his supporters, that is exactly what will happen.
This is why we so desperately need leaders like Romney, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine; and others who have the moral courage to stand firm in the principles the Republican party was founded upon and in all cases to boldly acknowledge that truth matters.

Border closure could have adverse effects on Putnam's automotive industry

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump continues to consider closing the United States' border with Mexico, West Virginia business owners and industry advocates worry about the effect it could have on the state's automotive sector.
Trump tweeted in late March he was considering a closure. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump had urged Kevin McAleenan, his choice as acting secretary of Homeland Security, to close the country's southwestern border.
Mexico is West Virginia's 11th-largest trading partner based on dollar value, according to 2018 Census data. Trade with Mexico supports 23,000 jobs, according a 2017 report from the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research institute. West Virginia's exports to Mexico have increased by 378 percent since 1993, according to the report.
"There is serious and widespread concern that closing the border with Mexico would be crippling for the United States automotive industry, which could mean similar consequences for West Virginia automotive manufacturers, said Rebecca McPhail, president of the West Virginia Manufacturers Association.
Right now, West Virginia's automotive industry is growing, McPhail said.
In 2013, Allevard Sogefi promised a $20 million investment and more than 250 jobs at its Wayne County plant. Last month, Toyota officials announced the company's plant in Putnam County would double its production line, creating 123 jobs.
"Virtually every automaker in the United States depends on parts imported from Mexico, McPhail said.
There is an intricate supply chain between the U.S. and Mexico. Parts can cross the border as many seven times before the final good is produced, McPhail said.
For Allevard Sogefi, a global manufacturer, a border closure could mean losing about a third of its business, plant manager Troy Thomas said. The Prichard plant does business with four plants in Mexico, which largely depends on transporting goods via truck.
"There's no other way. You can't ship them by sea without going through the Panama Canal, and shipping by air would be enormously expensive. It's truck or nothing, Thomas said.
Sogefi also receives three to five truckloads of raw materials from Mexican suppliers every week. Those supplies are not only for products it ships to Mexico, but products Sogefi sells in the U.S. as well.
Officials with the Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia plant in Buffalo said in a statement that a border closure would cause disruption across the industry.
"Automakers rely heavily on cross-border trade throughout the North American region. In many instances, auto parts can cross the border multiple times before being integrated into the final assembly of a vehicle, the statement said.
Toyota officials said, "We urge all parties to work together to avert a border closing that would result in significant disruptions to the North American auto industry, because ultimately the costs of all this fall upon our customers and make it more difficult for them to afford a new vehicle that is cleaner, safer and more energy-efficient.
If trucks transporting supplies and goods would still be allowed to cross the border, the industry would be somewhat protected, Thomas said. Otherwise, it would have a significant effect.
In the event of a complete border closure, Sogefi's customers would have to shift engine production elsewhere, Thomas said. This could mean going to U.S. engine plants, but Sogefi also provides products to plants outside the U.S., such as Europe and South America.
"It would cause U.S. automakers to move production back to their U.S. plants, Thomas said. "We understand the strategic interest for the U.S. economy for doing that.
But in the short term, it would have a significant impact, Thomas said.
"They can't flip a switch and make those other plants increase their capacity, Thomas said. "The U.S. plants can't increase their capacity suddenly like that.
It would probably take a minimum of six months to a year for the industry to adjust to this change, Thomas estimated.
In most cases, suppliers from Mexico are "directed sources, Thomas said. This means companies like General Motors tell manufacturers, like Sogefi, who to buy from.
Thomas said to him it's obvious why companies choose Mexico.
"The labor cost is less, he said. "The whole world knows that.

Texto completo: Roughly four thousand, two hundred and twenty-seven Trump-era news cycles ago, there was a rather famous book called "Fire and Fury." The author, Michael Wolff, used an interesting tactic to gain access to the Trump White House: He allowed his subjects, the president included, to believe that he was going to write a positive account of the Trump administration, and then used that access to produce an account of an administration in constant chaos, and a president who was understood by everyone around him to be unfit for the job.
One way to approach special counsel Robert Mueller's report, if your sense of civic duty requires you to approach it, is to see it as a more rigorous, capacious version of "Fire and Fury." Mueller's exposé was backed by subpoena power rather than just sweet talk, but ultimately it delivers the same general portrait: President Donald Trump as an amoral incompetent surrounded by grifters, misfits and his own overpromoted children, who is saved from self-destruction by advisers who sometimes decline to follow orders, and saved from high crimes in part by incompetence and weakness.
Steve Bannon, Wolff's most voluble source, came across as the smartest character in "Fire and Fury." In the Mueller report a similar role is played by former White House counsel Don McGahn, who spoke at great length with investigators and ended up portrayed as the most effective of those save-him-from-himself advisers, using masterful inaction to frustrate Trump's desire to sack the special counsel. And just as Trump railed against Bannon after Wolff's book came out, he is now railing against McGahn, though in both cases it was his own decision (to allow Wolff White House access, to waive executive privilege and to allow aides to cooperate with Mueller) that made the revelations possible.
More broadly, just as Wolff's unusual access ultimately produced a more dramatic version of a story that had already been told in piecemeal (and perhaps less fancifully) by White House reporters at the major newspapers, in the Mueller report we get a lot of confirmation of stories about White House dysfunction and dangerous presidential impulses that were published in, for instance, The New York Times.
But at the same time, the Mueller report also reaches roughly the same conclusion about the Russia-collusion story that "Fire and Fury" offered. Wolff wrote that while there might have been "side deals and freelance operations" by campaign hangers-on, "the idea of formal collusion and artful conspiracy ... seemed unlikely to everybody in the White House ... Bannon's comment that the Trump campaign was not organized enough to collude with its own state organizations became everybody's favorite talking point - not least because it was true."
The disorganization point is key, because it is clear enough from events like the Trump Tower meeting that people around Trump were, shall we say, unencumbered by qualms about collusion. But the report makes the idea of an active, directed conspiracy - of the sort popularized by the Steele dossier, various faulty news reports and deep-state "experts," and the Resistance industry - seem as implausible as Wolff's White House sources insisted.
Just to read the Mueller report's paragraphs on the change to the GOP convention platform on Ukraine, long a minor locus of quid pro quo conspiracy theorizing between Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, is sufficient to recognize how much freelancing and chaos dominated the Trump campaign, and how little direction was offered from above. Meanwhile, many of the larger loci of conspiracy - the alleged Michael Cohen Prague trip, the alleged Paul Manafort visit to Julian Assange, the bank server supposedly communicating between Trump Tower and Moscow - simply evanesce under the report's scrutiny.
What remains offers useful detail about the Trump administration in the same way that "Fire and Fury" offered useful detail: It tells us more about what we already knew to be the case. The Mueller report is further proof that Trump has been as dishonest and ridiculous in the White House as he was on the campaign trail; further proof that his administration is filled with leakers, liars and people trying to protect their country from their boss and their boss from himself; further proof that our president postures as a strongman, yet is unable to master his own White House; further proof that left to his own devices, Trump would constantly blunder into impeachable offenses.
But because it adds to a well-understood reality, the report will probably have the same modest political impact, the same limited media half-life as prior, less-extensive exposés, and we will be back to talking about whether former Vice President Joe Biden can beat Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and whether Sanders can beat Trump.
And that shift will be sensible. Thanks to Mueller, we know that Trump is about as bad as he appeared to be while running for the presidency - but not secretly omnicompetent, not secretly treasonous. He won in 2016 despite the manifold vices chronicled by Mueller's team. The challenge for his opposition is to make him lose in 2020 because of them.

NYPD on alert for Ramadan

Texto completo: The NYPD will be on high alert during the month of Ramadan after religious-based attacks killed hundreds in New Zealand and Sri Lanka.
Police Commissioner James O'Neill and other police officials delivered their annual briefing Tuesday ahead of the Islamic holy month, which begins May 5 and ends June 4. They said there are no credible threats against New York City's Muslim community or mosques.
But the briefing followed an attack last month in which 50 people were killed in two mosques in New Zealand, and several coordinated attacks on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka last weekend that killed more than 300 people. Government officials have said that two Islamist extremist groups may have been involved in the Sri Lanka attacks and that they may have been retaliation for the New Zealand killings, according to The New York Times,. 
"It's a time of spiritual reflection, renewal of faith and commitment to charity. It all hinges on every person's right to worship freely and without fear," O'Neill said, addressing the crowd at police headquarters. He said that while there are no specific threats to the Muslim community, the NYPD will be "increasing patrols and placing high-visibility posts around our many houses of worship."
O'Neill added that it was important for the community to communicate with police during Ramadan and beyond.
According to NYPD statistics, there were 361 total hate crimes in 2018, an increase from 2017, when there were 338 recorded hate crimes. But contrary to overall statistics, police said anti-Muslim attacks saw a decrease last year from the year before: 18 in 2018, compared with 34 in 2017. So far this year, there have been three anti-Muslim hate crimes.
"This level of personal connection is critical," he said. "What we found is that when we work together toward a common purpose, we get public safety that truly looks and feels different. We want everyone to have input about those issues in their neighborhood." 
John Gordon, an intelligence research specialist for the NYPD, said awareness of racist symbols and images can "raise our collective vigilance" and urged members of the community to contact police if they see any such warni

Texto completo: March 5 was a special day for the students attending Winton Woods Primary South.
The wee warriors enjoyed a complimentary visit with New York Times best-selling author Sherri Duskey Rinker, courtesy of Joseph-Beth Booksellers and the outstanding effort of district media specialist Michelle Sisk.
The author shared her love of books, how she became an author and the process of turning her story into a published book.
She also left the students with an important message based on her experiences as an author: "practice, practice, practice makes perfect or at least better."
Following the presentation, Mrs. Rinker autographed copies of her books for students and teachers who purchased copies of her incredible story.

Djidjeu selected as Kiwanis Student of the Month Winton Woods High School Counselor Brad Tash says Franck Djidjeu is in tenth grade but is ahead of his time. "If you were to speak to Mr. Djidjeu and observe his actions, you would think he is already a college student," said Tash. "Franck's maturity and good nature are apparent to everyone he meets. Teachers have commented on how nice it is to have such a positive influence in their classes. I challenge you to find a harder working young person. During his time at Winton Woods, Franck has distinguished himself as a top scholar. He has a demanding all honors schedule and has never earned a grade less than an A."
"Franck is not just impressive in the classroom. While earning perfect grades, he is also a two-sport athlete and works part-time in his mother's daycare. Franck is from Cameroon and speaks two languages. He has been very valuable in assisting us with French-speaking students who are learning English. Currently, Franck's mother is in Cameroon for an extended stay, leaving Franck at home to care for his two younger siblings while his father works two jobs."
"As you can see, Franck is impressive on a variety of levels. His goal is to one day attend medical school, and he is well on his way. I cannot think of a more deserving recipient for the Student of the Month Award."

Texto completo: Author Kay Warren, whose son, Matthew, died by suicide five years ago, is returning to Colorado Springs Friday for a public presentation called “Conversation with Kay: Finding Life after Loss.”
Warren, who wrote “Choose Joy Because Happiness Isn’t Enough,” is married to California evangelical Christian pastor Rick Warren, author of the New York Times bestseller, “The Purpose-Driven Life.”
The event will be held 6-7:30 p.m. Friday in the Summit Ballroom of Hotel Elegante, 2886 S. Circle Drive. It is free and open to the public, and reservations are not necessary.
The presentation is for anyone who has experienced the loss of a loved one, said organizer Lynda Shelhamer, founder of the sponsoring Heavenly Hope and Healing nonprofit organization.
The Warrens spoke last year on mental illness to a crowd of more than 800 attendees at New Life Church.
With El Paso County having one of the highest teen suicide rates in the state, Shelhamer said her organization, which assists bereaved mothers and fathers who have lost a child, thought it was important to bring Kay Warren back to Colorado Springs to speak about navigating the difficult journey of grief.
“She has a message of hope for moms who have lost their children and others who’ve had a significant loss,” Shelhamer said.

Texto completo: Se conocen más detalles sobre Larry Hopkins , el líder de los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos, la milicia pro Trump que detuvo con armas de fuego a un grupo de 300 inmigrantes en la frontera sur.
El líder de la milicia de extrema derecha, capturado por el FBI dos días después de que el grupo publicó el video de la captura de los inmigrantes, presumió hace dos años que los miembros de su grupo habían recibido capacitación para asesinar a figuras como el ex presidente Obama.
Los documentos judiciales conocidos por Reuters dijeron que si bien se había estado investigando las denuncias de “actividad de la milicia extremista” en 2017, los testigos acusaron a Hopkins de decir que su grupo planeaba asesinar no solo a Obama, sino al candidato presidencial demócrata de 2016, Hillary Clinton y George Soros, un rico partidario de los liberales.
Hopkins ahora enfrenta cargos criminales por posesión de armas de fuego.
Reuters informó que el agente especial del FBI, David Gabriel, había descubierto una charla sobre dichos asesinatos en octubre de 2017, cuando estaba investigando informes de que una milicia operaba desde la casa de Hopkins en Nuevo México.
“Hopkins supuestamente también hizo la declaración de que los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos se estaban entrenando para asesinar a George Soros, Hillary Clinton y Barack Obama “, según el reporte de Reuters.
El informe señala que el grupo ha afirmado haber ayudado a los funcionarios de La Migra a detener a 5,600 migrantes en el desierto de Nuevo México en los últimos 60 días.
Por su parte Carlos A. Díaz, un portavoz de la Patrulla Fronteriza, le dijo a The New York Times que la agencia federal “no respalda a los grupos privados u organizaciones que toman los asuntos de aplicación en sus propias manos”.

Costa Rica stands out in Central America

Texto completo: LIBERIA, Costa Rica — In the ongoing U.S.debate about immigration, the Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala are mainly in the news because many of those crossing our border from Mexico are from these nations. Why isn't Costa Rica experiencing a similar mass exodus?
I put the question to President Carlos Alvarado Quesada. In an email response he writes in part, "8 percent of our GDP is dedicated to education and our main resource is the human talent and well-being of the people who live in our country. Next Monday, for example, we will celebrate 150 years of primary education for free for all kids in the country."
Many of those fleeing other Central American countries claim to feel threatened by gangs and crime. Costa Rica has had a lower crime rate than others in the region, but that may be about to change.
According to the Costa Rica Star newspaper, the government and tourism industry started paying more attention to crime when "two female foreign tourists were killed in two days last year, and a third was raped a week later, all near Tortuguero National Park." The Costa Rican homicide rate has been rising steadily. There were 603 murders in 2017, although figures are lower than in other Central American countries.
Costa Rica is experiencing its own immigration challenge. The New York Times reported last September, "Since mid-April, when Nicaragua erupted in a violent political crisis that has left hundreds dead and crippled the economy, Nicaraguans have been leaving their country en masse — some fleeing a crackdown by President Daniel Ortega against his opponents, others — newly unemployed — desperately looking for work. Many thousands have headed to Costa Rica..."
Tourism is the main economic driver here. The government is concerned any perception it is unsafe to visit might cause serious financial harm.
The Heritage Foundation's 2018 economic freedom rankings place Costa Rica 61st under the category "moderately free," although President Alvarado references The Economist, which ranks his country "among the strongest 20 democracies in the world."
Not many people are leaving Costa Rica. It has the lowest emigration rate in Central America and one of the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean. And though the unemployment rate is 9.30 percent and about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty, Costa Ricans stay put.
Part of the reason may be a new anti-poverty program introduced by the previous president, Luis Guillermo Solis. Its goal is to pull at least 54,600 targeted families out of poverty. The plan combines previous welfare benefits that have been, reports the Tico Times, "distributed through 30 separate programs, administered by 20 different agencies." Families are to be assessed according to their needs and not a-one-size-fits-all formula. Job training and education scholarships are part of the plan so that poverty doesn't become a life sentence.
President Alvarado, 39, and a center-leftist, has different priorities. The major issue in the last election was same-sex marriage. The former president opposed it, while Mr. Alvarado supports it.
Mr. Alvarado is also a disciple of the climate-change movement. His goal is to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2020.
How a small country like Costa Rica — or even a larger one like the United States — can affect the globe's naturally changing temperatures — especially when major polluters like China, India and, yes, the United States aren't doing much to reduce carbon emissions — is never addressed. For the left, intentions count, not results.
Crime control and maintaining a vibrant tourist industry seem to be better and more attainable goals than changing the climate and promoting same-sex marriage.

Texto completo: Dear Earthtalk: Do all the Democratic contenders for President in 2020 agree on the need to battle climate change? Which ones have demonstrated the most leadership on environmental issues?
- Joe Bradley, Minneapolis, MN
With 18 Democrats already declared as running for president in 2020 (Pete Buttigieg, Eric Swalwell, Tim Ryan, Kristen Gillibrand, Beto O'Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney, Wayne Messam, Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang), and several more likely to officially join the fray, there is no shortage of ideas on ways to beat Donald Trump. Besides their common desire to unseat Trump, all of these White House hopefuls agree on the need to address climate change before it's too late.
A recent New York Times survey of the field found that each candidate favors bringing back Obama-era regulations designed to curb power plant and automotive emissions and curtail coal leasing on federal lands. Likewise, all 18 say the U.S. should recommit to the Paris climate agreement despite Trump's efforts to pull out. But less than half (Castro, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Hickenlooper, Inslee, O'Rourke, Sanders, Warren and Williamson) are for even stronger new regulations to push us further faster on transitioning to a green economy.
Meanwhile, the non-profit 350 Action recently published the results of its 2020 Climate Test, a scorecard rating each candidate's climate cred based on whether they support the Green New Deal or similar legislation, have taken actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and have pledged to refuse campaign financing from petrochemical interests. Gillibrand, Inslee, Sanders, Swalwell, Warren and Williamson scored 3/3 on the test, while Booker, Buttigieg, Gabbard and Yang each scored 2/3. (Delaney and Hickenlooper failed all three tests, despite acknowledging that climate change is a serious issue.)
Perhaps the candidate with the most climate skin in the game is Washington governor Jay Inslee, who has declared solving the climate crisis the primary focus of his White House bid. His 2007 book Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy laid out a plan for solving the climate crisis via a rapid transition to renewable energy sources with massive investments in clean energy jobs that would benefit Americans from all walks of life - much like the Green New Deal proposal released earlier this year by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Harris, Booker, Gillibrand, Sanders and Warren each served as co-sponsors for the Green New Deal's introduction in the Senate.
Warren, a longtime sympathizer with environmental causes, recently released her plan to boost renewable energy production and protect public lands if she becomes president. The crux of her proposal calls for banning the extraction of fossil fuels on public lands (and off-shore in domestic waters) and replacing it with renewable energy production so as to meet 10 percent of the nation's overall electricity supply.
If any of the Democrats can take control of the White House in 2020, environmental advocates will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.

Illinois Dems in charge, but not in accord

Resumen: National Democratic Party leaders, including 17th District Rep. Bustos, are concerned that these attempted party purges will sow discord and voter alienation that could cost them their current majority in the U.S. House. "House Democratic Campaign Arm Nears War With Liberals Over Primary Fights," headlined a recent New York Times story that said the combatants are approaching "open warfare" over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's efforts to "shut down party challenges." Naperville state Rep. Anna Stava-Murray, who narrowly won an Illinois House seat in a Republican-leaning district, says she'll challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin for her party's nomination.

Texto completo: While Illinois Democrats are solidly united under the leadership of new Gov. J.B. Pritzker and state party Chairman Michael Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House, they haven't been able to avoid the schisms that have rival factions of Democrats in Congress sorely at odds.
Indeed, three of them -- U.S. Reps. Daniel Lipinski and Cheri Bustos and, to a lesser extent, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin -- are embroiled in political challenges to their leadership led by new party firebrands.
How these fights are resolved will determine what kind of congressional Democrat represents Illinois and the nation -- traditional, up-from-the-ranks liberals or more ideologically-driven purists determined to drag the party farther to the left.
The recent mayoral election in Chicago is instructive about the party's direction, but not just because outsider lawyer and Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot came out of nowhere to conquer the city's political establishment.
Also elected -- to the city council -- were a handful of avowed socialists who can be expected to spend as much time addressing social issues as they will more traditional concerns like garbage pickup and street maintenance.
That was followed by the recent news that at least one challenger will continue to try to make inroads among the Democrats in Illinois' congressional delegation.
Last year, leftist challenger Marie Newman opposed party regular and longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Daniel Lipinski, whom she branded too conservative and excoriated for his opposition to abortion.
Backed by kindred spirts in the party, including U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, Newman came very close to defeating Lipinski in the Democratic Party primary election.
After that near-political-death experience, Lipinski easily won the general election.
Newman recently announced that she intends to take on Lipinski in the March 2020 primary.
One political observer speculated that she'll have a good chance to win then because "the 2020 congressional primary will be held on the same day as the presidential primary, which means the supporters of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg -- candidates whose philosophies are inimical to Lipinski's -- are going to show up at the polls."
It's not at all clear that Lipinski's political philosophy is "inimical" to those presidential candidates.
He's a traditional liberal Democrat and former college professor who's in touch with the attitudes of his diverse 3rd District located in southwest Chicago and suburbs.
But he's definitely not the hardcore leftist that Newman portrays herself to be. That will matter in a primary election where each party's base voters turn out in droves.
National Democratic Party leaders, including 17th District Rep. Bustos, are concerned that these attempted party purges will sow discord and voter alienation that could cost them their current majority in the U.S. House.
But the fight is on, the result being that Bustos, whose district includes Peoria and Rockford, is feuding with fellow Democrat U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the issue.
As chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Bustos is adamantly opposed to the New Yorker's plans to lead a purge of Democratic incumbents in next year's primary elections.
Bustos recently infuriated Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters by announcing a new rule that breaks the DCCC's business ties with any political consultants and pollsters who work for primary challengers. Anger generated by Bustos' action then overflowed into the public square.
"House Democratic Campaign Arm Nears War With Liberals Over Primary Fights," headlined a recent New York Times story that said the combatants are approaching "open warfare" over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's efforts to "shut down party challenges."
How that will affect Newman's opposition to Lipinski remains to be seen. Newman reports she's already devoting considerable energy to campaigning, particularly in city wards she neglected last year.
But traditional Chicago pols have ways of dealing with the Newmans of the world.
One is to put a third candidate's name on the ballot, theoretically dividing the anti-Lipinski vote. That's what Chicago ward heelers did to former President Barack Obama in 2000, a member of the Illinois Senate when he challenged and lost badly to incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush in the Democratic primary.
So it's convenient for Lipinski that another Democrat besides Newman also has announced a challenge to Lipinski -- political unknown Abe Matthew, a 32-year-old personal injury lawyer.
While Newman is leading a high-profile intraparty fight that will draw the concern of party leaders, there's another squabble.
Naperville state Rep. Anna Stava-Murray, who narrowly won an Illinois House seat in a Republican-leaning district, says she'll challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin for her party's nomination.
Durbin, a longtime incumbent, is likely to remain an overwhelming favorite to be renominated and re-elected.

Texto completo: SUNDAY BUSINESS
An article last Sunday about a dispute between the bankruptcy adviser Jay Alix and McKinsey & Company described incompletely a hearing before the bankruptcy court Judge David R. Jones. In addition to saying that allegations Mr. Alix made against McKinsey, if true, could constitute a crime, the judge told Mr. Alix that it could be a crime if he had lied to the court about McKinsey's conduct. The article also misstated when the hearing took place. It was in January, not December.
The Economic View column last week misstated Senator Richard C. Shelby's role on the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, was his party's ranking member on the committee in 2011; he is not the committee's current chairman.
REAL ESTATE
An article last Sunday about the increasing appeal of the Catskills for people buying second homes omitted a credit for the picture of the house in Kerhonkson, N.Y. The picture was taken by Deborah DeGraffenreid for The New York Times.
The Right at Home article last Sunday, about open-concept design, misstated the name of an interior design firm in Athens, Ga. It is Metal & Petal, not Petal & Metal.

Texto completo: Personal sanction against CEO would be a rare rebuke from regulators
Federal regulators investigating Facebook for mishandling its users' personal information have set their sights on the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, exploring his past statements on privacy and weighing whether to seek new, heightened oversight of his leadership.
The discussions about how to hold Zuckerberg accountable for Facebook's data lapses have come in the context of wide-ranging talks between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook that could settle the government's probe of more than a year, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because the FTC's inquiry is confidential under law.
Such a move could create new legal, political and public-relations headaches for one of Silicon Valley's best-known - and most image-conscious - corporate leaders. Zuckerberg is Facebook's co-founder, chief executive, board chairman and most powerful stock owner, and a sanction from the federal government would be seen as a rare rebuke to him and the tech giant's "move fast and break things" ethos.
In recent weeks, Zuckerberg has promised to reorient Facebook into a "privacy-focused communications platform" as the company looks to change its "reputation" and focus instead on secure, intimate communications between users along with content that "won't stick around forever."
But on Thursday, Facebook revealed another privacy mishap, admitting it mishandled millions of users' passwords for Instagram, the company's photo-sharing app. Facebook tucked news of the development into an old blog post as Washington scrambled over the release of the U.S. government's findings from its probe of Russia and the 2016 election. To privacy advocates and congressional critics, Facebook's move amounted to the latest sign that the company and its leaders have failed to learn from past mistakes - and should face heightened oversight.
"The days of pretending this is an innocent platform are over, and citing Mark in a large-scale enforcement action would drive that home in spades," said Roger McNamee, an early investor in the company and one of Zuckerberg's foremost critics.
In past investigations of Facebook, the U.S. government opted to spare Zuckerberg from the most onerous scrutiny. Documents obtained from the FTC under federal open-records laws reflect that the agency considered, then backed down from putting Zuckerberg directly under order during its last settlement with Facebook in 2011. Had it done so, Zuckerberg could have faced fines for future privacy violations.
Asked about the negotiations, Facebook said in a statement it "hope[s] to reach an appropriate and fair resolution." The FTC declined to comment.
The FTC began investigating Facebook in March 2018 following reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, improperly accessed data on roughly 87 million of the social networking site's users. The federal probe has focused on whether Facebook violated an agreement, brokered with the FTC in 2011, that required the company to improve its privacy practices. Since then, Facebook has acknowledged a series of additional privacy lapses, including its Instagram admission Thursday.
Appearing before Congress last year, Zuckerberg sought to take personal responsibility for a range of his company's recent missteps, such as Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica. "I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here," he told lawmakers. But the Facebook chief still maintained that the company did not commit a "violation of the consent decree" it had struck with the FTC.
Settling that federal inquiry could force Facebook to make significant concessions, including paying a fine ranging into the billions of dollars, The Washington Post previously has reported. It could result in new obligations targeting Zuckerberg, too. One idea that has been raised could require him or other executives to certify the company's privacy practices periodically to the board of directors, two people familiar with the matter said, along with heightened oversight by the FTC.
It is unclear if the FTC and Facebook are still contemplating such a requirement, or if they've struck an agreement on these or other outstanding matters. But Facebook has fought fiercely to shield Zuckerberg as part of the negotiations, one of the sources familiar with the probe said. Either Facebook or the FTC could choose to walk away from talks, resulting in the matter heading to court.
The idea of holding Zuckerberg accountable - and even subjecting him to penalties for Facebook's alleged mishandling of users' data - has gained political traction in Washington. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement that the top executive "wasn't just aware of Facebook's invasion of consumer privacy, he signed off on it and publicly downplayed legitimate concerns."
"Holding Mark Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives personally at fault and liable for further wrongdoing would send a powerful message to business leaders across the country: You will pay a hefty price for skirting the law and deceiving consumers," Blumenthal added.
Some of the FTC's own decision-makers also have aired their support for penalties against executives when their companies are under investigation. In a May 2018 memo, Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the agency "should hold individual executives accountable for order violations in which they participated, even if these individuals were not named in the original orders." He didn't mention Facebook by name, and he did not respond to requests for comment.
Zuckerberg still could escape largely unaffected as a result of negotiations with the FTC. If he does, it would not be the first time. More than eight years ago, when the FTC cobbled together its initial settlement with Facebook, agency staff weighed whether to target Zuckerberg personally. An unreleased and undated early draft of the FTC's consent order against Facebook, obtained by The Post through a Freedom of Information Act request, explicitly named Zuckerberg as a respondent - meaning he would have faced heightened federal oversight and the risk of fines and other penalties in the event of future privacy missteps.
In the end, however, the FTC dropped mention of him from a version of the order shared around April 2011, according to email records obtained from the agency under open-records laws. The agency also considered, then removed, a provision from its early settlement that would have required Facebook to pay an unspecified sum to the government, the records show. The form of punishment, called disgorgement, requires a company to return ill-gotten monetary gains. The draft consent decree included only "xxx" instead of an exact amount, and the language was ultimately removed by the time the FTC announced its agreement with Facebook in November 2011.
This time, FTC veterans have encouraged the agency to take direct aim at Zuckerberg, even putting him personally under order and subjecting him to further federal oversight. David Vladeck, who served as the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC in 2011, criticized the company this week because it "did not take that first consent decree seriously."
"I would hope any future order names Zuckerberg," he said, adding that doing so "ratchets pressure up on the company to make the CEO responsible."
The FTC's 2011 consent decree with Facebook requires the company to be more upfront with consumers about the data it collects and obtain their permission before it overrides their existing privacy settings. Facebook also is barred from misrepresenting what it does with users' data, while submitting to 20 years of privacy checkups.
Talks between Facebook and the FTC have intensified in recent weeks, as the agency's investigation passed its first anniversary. Top Facebook officials, including general counsel Colin Stretch, met with individual Democratic and Republican commissioners in March, according to two additional people familiar with the agency's work who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a private probe.
While the FTC probes Facebook, a number of states' attorneys general have embarked on their own investigation. Karl A. Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, has filed a privacy lawsuit against the company.
Other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, have investigated Facebook's relationship with Cambridge Analytica. And a federal grand jury in March sent subpoenas to two tech companies with which Facebook struck data-sharing agreements, the New York Times reported, noting that the target of such a criminal probe remains unclear.

Texto completo: BY KRISTIN M. HALL
The Associated Press
NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Brené Brown's books on shame, vulnerability and courage have given her A-list fans like Oprah and Melinda Gates and made her a go-to leadership consultant for both Pixar and the Seattle Seahawks.
But Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston's Graduate College of Social Work, thought she'd spend her career writing for other academics, not making the New York Times' best-seller list.
"My goal was to put it in peer-reviewed articles that no one would read but like five people and they would just read it to check to make sure they were quoted," Brown said.
Five best-selling books later, Brown debuted her first Netflix special on Friday, "Brené Brown: The Call to Courage ," based off her two decades of research. The special is a bit of an experiment for the streaming service, whose categories Brown doesn't neatly fit into.
"Am I comedy? Documentary? True crime?" Brown joked.
Brown's skill as a writer and speaker is that she doesn't sound like a typical self-help or leadership expert who is shouting motivational speaker mantras. She has a researcher's mind for patterns and a storyteller's gift of language. She peppers her talks with plenty of Texas colloquialisms, like "There's nothing in the middle of the road but white stripes and dead armadillos." She tells personal anecdotes about her kids and her husband to illustrate her broader ideas about parenting, compassion, leadership and more.
"People will come up to me and say, 'I already knew everything you said. I just didn't have the language to say it. I didn't know we were allowed to talk about it,'" said Brown. "And so I think I just put language around feelings and experiences and thoughts that we all have."
She can also curse like a Southern lady. "Not like Andrew Dice Clay," she said. "An appropriate amount of cursing."
The Netflix special is good timing for Brown, who has spent years traveling all over the country giving speeches to corporations, entrepreneurs, women's conferences and leadership training events.
Her youngest child is in middle school and she's moving into a period of her career where she's doing less of those speaking opportunities in order to be at home. But with Netflix, she has a chance to continue building on the conversations she started with her books.
"This opportunity from Netflix just felt like such a deeply important gift," Brown said. "This thing is going to drop in 190 countries."

Actriz en silla de ruedas hace historia al protagonizar un musical en Broadway

Texto completo: Dos triángulos de amor, uno trágico y otro relajado, han hecho de “¡Oklahoma!” uno de los musicales más resistentes al tiempo , desde su estreno en marzo de 1943, hace exactamente 76 años, como la primera colaboración entre el compositor Richard Rodgers y el libretista Oscar Hammerstein.
Ahora está de vuelta en Broadway, igualmente ambientado en 1906, pero con giros muy contemporáneos a la sociopolítica y el mercadeo el siglo XXI: mujeres liberales, una pareja protagónica es biracial -ella negra, él blanco-; y en el elenco hay una actriz en silla de ruedas (Ali Stroker), algo inédito en el teatro musical de Nueva York, y que la coloca en ruta a las nominaciones a los premios.
Stroker es una actriz rumbo a los 32 años, nativa de Ridgewood, Nueva Jersey . A los 2 años un accidente de tránsito la dejó paralizada de la cintura para abajo, debido a una lesión de la médula espinal. Pero ello no detuvo la meta profesional que se fijó desde que, a los 7 años, vio un primer musical de Broadway.
Estudió y en 2009 se convirtió en la primera actriz en silla de ruedas en obtener un título del Departamento de Teatro de Tisch de la Universidad de Nueva York , con un título en Bellas Artes. Que se sepa, es la primera intérprete en silla de ruedas en un musical de Broadway, donde como todos debe cantar, bailar y actuar.
Su rol (Ado Annie) no es nada sumiso, al contrario, es el personaje femenino más liberal, infiel y pícaro en la trama. Las críticas han sido muy favorables a todo el equipo, e incluso con ironía Ben Brantley escribió en The New York Times, “¿Cómo es posible que el nuevo show más genial de Broadway en 2019 sea un musical de 1943?”
Además se está presentando en una sala muy peculiar, Circle in the Square , que coloca al público cerca de los actores, planteando un reto adicional para el director, Daniel Fish, apoyado en una interesante iluminación de Scott Zielinski.
Aquí la audiencia no está al frente, sino alrededor del escenario, que es más largo que ancho. Para lograr más interacción aún, los presentes son invitados a probar, en el intermedio, la comida que los personajes “cocinan” durante el primer acto.
Este musical “country” o rural está basado en la obra “Green Grow the Lilacs” (1931) de Lynn Riggs, autor de sangre indígena cherokee. Se centra en la vida sencilla de unos granjeros y vaqueros , mayormente ingenuos, celosos y conservadores, amantes de la caza, los caballos, el baile y el alcohol, y para quienes el honor siempre está a un balazo de distancia.
No son en esencia violentos, sino simples en su manera de ver el mundo y resolver los problemas en la mentalidad de 1906, vigente hoy en muchas zonas rurales en EEUU. En ese entonces, Oklahoma aún no era un estado, sino un “territorio de reserva indígena”.
Las coreografías originales se mantienen simples, mayormente integradas a la trama, cuando los personajes celebran en algún establo dentro de su rutina de “pueblo pequeño, infierno grande”, donde la amistad se debate entre camaradería, celos, amor, venganza y envidia. Así, una boda puede mutar a un funeral y luego a un juicio penal, pues también son rápidos a la hora de imponer justicia, al estilo “Fuenteovejuna” (1619) de Lope de Vega.
En su largo periplo, “¡Oklahoma!” fue adaptada al cine y ganó dos premios Óscars en rubros técnicos en 1955, entre cuatro nominaciones. También se ha producido para TV y teatro en varias ocasiones y lugares. En Broadway estuvo por última vez en 2002 y el estreno actual es la 6ta producción en Nueva York.
La más exitosa fue la primera, que sumó 2.212 presentaciones en poco más de cinco años, aliviando los horrores de la 2da Guerra Mundial. Esta vez el calendario es limitado, sólo de abril al 1 de septiembre.

Heisler: Lakers sticking with family, but Kobe Bryant won’t be riding to the rescue

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

Texto completo: ProPublica reporter Hannah Dreier is the winner of the 2019 John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism for her series “Trapped in Gangland” on MS-13. The series was co-published with New York magazine, Newsday and the New York Times. Sponsored by Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, the award recognizes work that illuminates the causes, consequences and remedies of problems in American society.
Dreier’s powerful narratives showed how the government’s bungled crackdown on MS-13 has torn apart the lives of Latino immigrants on Long Island — deporting innocent teenagers, burning law enforcement sources and failing to prevent further violence. Dreier spent months gaining the trust of a teenage informant who helped the FBI catch fellow MS-13 members, believing authorities would offer him a new life. Instead, they betrayed him by turning him over to ICE. Dreier’s next story depicted a mother searching for her missing son, whom police had dismissed as a runaway until his macheted body was found in the gang’s “killing fields.” The series’ final article featured an asylum-seeker accused of gang membership and deported for drawing a devil, his school mascot but also an MS-13 symbol. A school-based police officer reported the doodle, circumventing privacy protections.
Read the Series
Trapped In Gangland
How the MS-13 Crackdown Shattered Immigrant Lives
In response to the series, Long Island police began investigating the mishandling of MS-13 murders and the officers who belittled the distraught mother. Homeland Security opened a civil rights investigation, and ICE changed a practice that jeopardizes informants. Several Long Island school districts have sought a formal agreement with the police liming officers’ roles in schools.
“This year’s competition generated an amazing array of stories from sexual harassment to immigration to prison abuse and more,” contest chair Patti Wolter said. “Dreier’s investigation delivers searing portraits of the real people caught in the horrific crosshairs of policy, police and gang culture.”
Judges also awarded honorable mention to “Trashed,” a collaboration with the Investigative Fund by reporter Kiera Feldman. The series exposed dangerous practices and conditions in the world of private commercial garbage collection in New York City, including fatal accidents, mob unions, checkered oversight and wholesale impunity.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — The moment both Democrats and Republicans had been waiting for finally arrived on Thursday. Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on his nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election was released to the public.
With the 448-page redacted report released, people couldn't wait to share their thoughts on the report.
President Trump was more than happy with the report to say the least. Thursday morning he tweeted a video showing various media organizations saying that there was no collusion or obstruction of justice accompanied by the words, "As I have been saying all along, NO COLLUSION - NO OBSTRUCTION!"


We’ve collected a number of opinions and reactions to Mueller report.
CNN legal analyst Elie Honig criticises Attorney General William Barr for his take on the Mueller report.

- "With the redacted version of the Mueller report and the press conference he gave to help spin it, William Barr has cemented his status as a crafty partisan whose primary tricks are to cloak his political moves to shape public opinion and to protect President Trump under a thin sheen of law and process."

National press secretary for Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign, Kayleigh McEnany, wrote on Fox that the Mueller report was nothing but a politically motivated investigation against an innocent president.

- "Thursday marked the end of a corrupt investigation into an innocent president, driven entirely by political motivations and resulting in the complete and total exoneration of President Trump. ... To put it simply, there was no collusion. And there was no obstruction. Only a partisan investigation that began in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign."

Alexandra Petri, columnist for The Washington Post, compares the Mueller report to a book, similar to F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby."

- "'The Mueller Report' is about a man who wanted to find information, but really, I think, what he found was the American Dream. It is exactly like 'The Great Gatsby,' a book about a man who pretends to have more money than he actually has and turns out to owe everything he has to sinister forces but for whom you ultimately feel pity because he is lonely even though he has a big house, in that both that book and this one are about a narrator who is trying to find out information about one thing and ultimately discovers something else."

Christopher Buskirk wrote for The New York Times that Barr was right and the president deserves an apology.

- "To the public figures who promoted the collusion story, I say: Own it. Just admit you were wrong. It won’t feel good at first. But when the initial sting passes you will find it liberating. And people will respect you for it. The media and political elites have a lot of work to do if they want to regain the trust of the American people. Confessing a major error that needlessly turned Americans against one another is a good place to start."

The Washington Post editorial board wrote that the Mueller report complied a large list of Trump and his associates' lies and wrongdoings.

- "Mr. Mueller compiled a damning account of Mr. Trump’s lies, behind-the-scenes manipulations and attempts at coercion while Justice Department officials were properly investigating Russia’s election-year activities and Mr. Trump’s own possible obstruction. Mr. Mueller made clear that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential race in “sweeping and systematic fashion,” which Mr. Trump has denied; that the interference was designed to help Mr. Trump; and that the Trump campaign was happy to accept the help, which is morally repulsive."


CNN political commentator Alice Stewart called on Republicans and Democrats to move on and think of the future.

- "Fast-forward to today, I suggest everybody should just move on. Democrats need to stop endless congressional probes and threats of impeachment proceedings. Republicans need to drop 'Spygate,' an unfounded claim that the Obama administration improperly spied on Trump's campaign. Instead, let's all acknowledge that Russia may already be looking ahead to 2020. As they say: those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Congress needs to take steps now to prevent future Russian interference in our elections."

Ryan Cooper pointed out for The Week that Trump was not able to obstruct justice because people didn't follow his orders.

- "The only reason Trump's efforts to obstruct the investigation did not work is because his subordinates refused to carry out his instructions. As Mueller writes, 'The president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.'"

How the Print Paper Comes Together

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It is around 3 p.m., and the next day's print edition of The New York Times is beginning to take shape.
The print hub, a group of 56 journalists at The Times whose job is to shepherd the day's news articles from their original, digital presentations to the next day's physical paper, is at work. (An additional 16 work on feature sections, like Travel and Real Estate.) Planners have been tracking the news all day. Editors have determined which articles will run in the newspaper. Now it's time for news designers to create the recognizable framework of the print paper.
The Times established the print hub in 2017. Shoulder-to-shoulder in long rows of desks, the designers are back together, alongside editors, photo editors and news assistants.
The 17 full-time news designers in the print hub, assigned to daily news and advance projects, are builders and keepers of structure. But they are also wardrobe professionals. They dress each story, and its shape, with headline fonts that fit the tone of news. Dark, squat lettering for hard news. A more delicate iteration for features. And a straighter block type for news somewhere in between. A balance and variety of sizes and fonts are important to the presentation.
On Thursday, the full 448-page report on the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation was released to the public shortly after 11 a.m. The print hub decided almost immediately to run a special section in Friday's paper. There was little time to waver -- the printing plants across the country must know what to expect.
It is a moment when every gear in the news operation is turning.
Amy Kelsey, the deputy director of news design, keeps track of small details, like the point size of headlines, but also stays mindful of larger concerns, like the messaging that the locations of articles convey.
"The way we pay attention to packaging and presentation gives a good feel for hierarchy," Ms. Kelsey said.
The print hub is the latest chapter in the evolution of news design at The Times.
Before Tom Bodkin became the design director of The Times in 1987, journalists who put the pages together weren't even called designers. They were makeup editors; each got a list of articles and some photographs, and tried to make it all fit and look good. The makeup editors sat together.
"Up until then, the inside news pages were not really looked at seriously from a design standpoint," Mr. Bodkin said.
So Mr. Bodkin, who is now the creative director of The Times, embedded designers with reporters and editors. Developing more news judgment in design could "maximize the effectiveness of a story," Mr. Bodkin said.
"Good designers want to reflect what editors have in their heads," he said.
So sports designers sat with sports editors. National designers sat with national editors. The model held for 30 years.
Today, three million subscribers read The Times only online. As this audience grew and developed different habits, it became clear that the digital platform would require a different production track. To provide a digital report with minute-by-minute updates, and one with a thoughtful print curation for readers who expect it, the processes had to be separated.
On Thursday, digital readers could follow Times journalists as they combed through the special counsel's redacted report and provided a live play-by-play of their observations and analysis online. Today, print readers have a 16-page section that a group of enterprise designers spent an entire day creating, including 13 pages of executive summaries reprinted in the 8.5-by-11-inch size released by the Justice Department.
"We're not manipulating it," said Andrew Sondern, an art director. "There's an obligation to present some of it unfettered by our analysis."
The special section comes in addition to extensive front-page coverage of the report. Mr. Bodkin drew the blueprint, which has four articles beneath a banner headline, all driven by the Mueller report. It's an unusual modern Times front page in that there is no feature photography.
"Today we relied on typography for visual relief," Mr. Bodkin said, "reflecting the importance of the words of the Mueller report."
Looking at old New York Times pages, some marks of the print product remain. The one-column A-head, with its lines of tall, condensed type, has appeared on front-page stories for at least 100 years.
But it is also clear that the design approach to the news sections has changed considerably. The reader's progression, the flow of the pages, is something closer to a magazine experience than it used to be. International, National and New York sections are clearly delineated.
Articles are packaged more purposefully. News is organized more deliberately. Designers are empowered to think like the journalists they are. It is, Mr. Bodkin said, "a coherent experience."

How long until we're all happy?

Texto completo: To: David Brooks
Columnist, The New York Times
Dear David,
We have met a few times over the years while covering the same events. I'm a big fan. You write beautifully and, more often than not, have insights about our politics, lifestyles and beliefs that others have missed. But as time passes, you have grown increasingly somber about our national condition. Your most recent column, based on your new book "The Second Mountain," is downright depressing.
Here's a brief summary: "The whole country is going through some sort of spiritual and emotional crisis. ... We've created a culture based on lies." One is that "(c)areer success is fulfilling." Not so, you say. "Everybody who has actually tasted success can tell you that's not true." Another related lie is that "I can make myself happy" through "individual accomplishment. ... The message of the meritocracy is that you are what you accomplish. ... You are not a soul to be saved but a set of skills to be maximized."
As a rule, I rarely respond directly to other columnists. Many columnists do the same. It's a good rule because, if abandoned, it would make commentary even more personal and shrill. But sometimes rules need to be broken. This is, I think, one of those times.
So, David, let me respectfully suggest: Lighten up.
To be sure, most of your insights are true. But they're also utopian. You argue that we've lost our moral compass and have surrendered to delusional beliefs that rationalize a cultural emptiness. You seem disappointed that we haven't arrived in some Garden-of-Eden paradise where almost everyone is happy, fulfilled, responsible and respected. I yearn for this as well, but I have reconciled myself to the inevitability of imperfection.
Our job as journalists is not simply to point out untruths, injustices and societal problems. It is also to illuminate the inconsistencies, contradictions and confusions of our national condition. It is, in short, to be realistic, especially when being realistic is politically and intellectually unpopular -- as it is now.
We have a culture of complaint, where nothing works, selfishness is rampant, disillusion is widespread and hatred -- practiced across the political spectrum -- is common. There is no virtue in feeding this frenzy of pessimism, just because it fits the temper of the times. We need to recognize the limits of our condition. Many legitimate problems can't be solved, and some problems aren't worth solving.
It is also worth acknowledging that things could be worse. Most Americans who want jobs have them; we are not engaged in a major war; millions of households are doing the difficult work of balancing the duties of child-rearing with the rigors of their job schedules. The Trump presidency has turned up the heat on public and private discourse without (yet) leading to a breakdown of debate. Crudely, the nation's institutions seem to be working.
David, here are a few comments on the "lies" that you describe as polluting today's American dream:
• Ambition is America's blessing and curse. It is a blessing because it encourages people to try new things, to stretch their abilities and to see how much more they can achieve. It fosters a vibrant economy, even if the most ambitious people are often unattractive as human beings. That's the curse. Great ambition often causes great character flaws. Obsessed with their projects and themselves, people mistreat co-workers and family. They're creatures of their ambitions, which can be both frustrating and fulfilling.
• Happiness is not a practical goal of public policy, even if governments sometimes reduce or eliminate some conditions that make people unhappy or miserable. But if some sources disappear, others may arise. There are too many factors (personality, religion, schools, luck, parents -- or lack thereof -- and much more) that determine outcomes. Pursuing happiness should remain, mostly, a personal responsibility. Making it a public responsibility would ensure failure.
• The meritocracy -- frequently criticized -- is not nearly so sinister as it's portrayed. Of course, it creates stress among its members. They're constantly being measured and prodded to do better, or to lose out to the students, workers and athletes next door. But the meritocracy's principles, even if sometimes violated, are the right ones to govern our institutions. We want people who know what they're doing; competition is not a bad way to make the selections. What are the alternatives? Would we be better off if social connections, race or political affiliation assumed a larger role?
Finally, there's the matter of work. Everyone complains about it, but without it, most of us would die of boredom. Learning new stuff, the essence of journalism, is inherently rewarding, and, David, you and I are paid to do it. The virtues outweigh the vices.
So, let's keep perspective. We don't live in an ideal world and never will. But things could be worse, maybe quite a bit worse. Let's try to avoid that.

Texto completo: Two New Haven classical music concerts offer intriguing compositions in the days ahead.
At Yale, Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian will lead the Yale Philharmonia in a concert of Brahms’ “First Symphony,” Reinecke’s “Flute Concerto in D major, Op. 283” and Joan Tower’s “Made in America” from 2005. The season-ending program will take place Friday, April, 26, in Woolsey Hall.
“Made in America” is “a celebration of America, as the title suggests, with fragments of ‘America the Beautiful’ as a leitmotif,” wrote New York Times writer Allan Kozinn.
Reinecke’s “Flute Concerto” will be performed by Woolsey Hall Concerto Competition winner Jungah Yoon, who will graduate soon from the Yale School of Music with a master of music degree.
The season wraps with a performance of Brahms’ “Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68,” a work that took many years to complete and has musical similarities to Beethoven’s fifth and ninth symphonies.
Orchestra New England
Solos are intriguing and usually fun in a classical music concert, and Orchestra New England has many in its latest event, called “Harps & Rags!” at the Unitarian Society of New Haven Saturday, April 27.
For the Ned Rorem composition from 1959 called “Eleven Studies for Eleven Players,” the 11 musicians will perform virtuoso solos. The piece was written on a commission from Cameron Baird, then head of the music department at Buffalo University, and is dedicated to his memory.
Featured musicians include Keith Underwood, flute; Steven Wade, English horn; Ronald Krentzman, clarinet; Charles Bumcroft, trumpet; Patrick Smith, percussion; and Thomas Hudson, cello.
The second part of the James Sinclair-led concert features harpist Wendy Kerner in Sima Wolf’s “En Prévision” for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet, and Ravel’s “Introduction and Allegro” for the same configuration of instruments.
A crowd-pleasing trio of tunes will conclude the concert with three popular American rags: Scott Joplin’s “The Cascades” and “The Ragtime Dance” and Eubie Blake’s “Charleston Rag.”

Texto completo: Seeing the iconic church on fire was stunning. After firefighters extinguished the inferno, the heartbreaking scenes of the charred church, which had been a beloved home for generations of her family, were almost too much for Monica Harris.
"Seeing the church in the condition it is now," the 57-year-old Christian said for a story in The New York Times, "it’s almost like losing a family member."
That loss, and the beauty destroyed by that blaze, hadn’t even had time to register before a man of the cloth added some perspective.
"They burned down a building. They didn’t burn down our spirit," he said.
The gofundme rebuilding fund for three overwhelmingly black churches burned in Louisiana in the past month had topped out under $100,000 until Monday’s fire at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris reignited the cause. None of those structures was on par with the world-famous, centuries-old, magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame, but black churches matter. As of Wednesday, online donations for the three black churches were nearing the $1.8 million goal. Donations for Notre Dame are expected to top $1 billion.
"As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana," Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday. Journalist Yashar Ali and CNN anchor Jake Tapper posted similar tweets asking people to remember those black churches, too.
As the world watched the flames consuming the iconic spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame, people used words such as heartbreaking and tragic to describe the damage to the centuries-old architectural wonder, which is a monument to Christianity. But one of the first online comments I read came from a suburban Catholic priest, who noted, "This is really, tragically sad. But God is NOT confined to even beautiful and ancient structures." He went on to explain how asylum-seekers and other people suffering hardships deserve that same outpouring of empathy and assistance.
Easter celebrates the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead, the keystone of the Christian faith. But it also offers a more universal message that bad things can get better. Easter signals hope and a new start.
On the same day Notre Dame was burning, every Major League Baseball player, coach and umpire wore a No. 42 jersey to honor Jackie Robinson, the first black player allowed to play in the majors. It is heartbreaking and tragically sad that there was a time when black players were banned from the National Pastime, but in honoring Robinson, we celebrate how the world can change for the better.
At the same time, we can continue to find it heartbreaking and tragically sad that MLB now is investigating racist messages sent to Carl Edwards Jr., a relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who got off to a bad start this season and happens to be black.
Clearly, today’s world gives us plenty of opportunities to right wrongs and make bad things better. Louisiana officials on Monday charged a 21-year-old white man with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires set at the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, as well as the St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre.
Every cowardly and hateful act can inspire a commitment to decency and good in others. Not only can we take some comfort in the fact nobody died in any of these tragic church fires, we can also find something good in the response of ordinary people.

Texto completo: Lenora Katherine Kelliher Bergeron of Newtown, CT, passed away on April 12, 2019. Born May 2, 1934 in Pittsfield, MA, Lenora was the daughter of Thomas M. Kelliher and Katherine Coughlin. After graduating from Pittsfield High School, Lenora worked for a number of years as an executive secretary at the Berkshire Life Insurance Company. She married James Arthur Bergeron on January 5, 1957, embarking on a 62-year journey of love and commitment. After a successful working life outside the home, Lenora chose to devote herself to caring for home and nurturing her family. She was a witty, wise, and wonderful woman who could make any day brighter just by her presence and mischievous sense of humor. She taught us to respect all people and to value each person's experience. Every person's story interested her. Lenora loved the written word, volunteering for the Great Books Program at Middle Gate Elementary School and at the school libraries for both of her daughters. She read the New York Times daily, and loved to solve the Times' crossword puzzles, as well as to play Scrabble as often as possible. And the Boston Red Sox never had a more devoted fan.
In addition to her husband, Lenora leaves behind her daughter Brenda (Mike Demicco), daughter Laura (Leigh Haeger), granddaughter Emily Demicco (Kevin Yessian), granddaughter Katie Demicco, sister and brother-in-law Judy and Gordy Weldon, sister Sandra Harvey, and numerous nieces and nephews. She was pre-deceased by her sister Ann Castagna.
The family will be planning a celebration of her life at a future date. We would like to thank the staff at both Danbury Hospital Orthopedic Surgery Unit and especially the River Glen Rehabilitation Center in Southbury for their exceptional consideration and caring during Lenora's last days. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Salvation Army, 855 Asylum Avenue, Hartford, Connecticut 06105, Attn: Donations.
This is a paid death notice.

'Listening Well (For Writers)' 10 a.m. April 27: Denison University's Center for Narrative Journalism presents "Listening Well (For Writers)" workshop led by Jeff Gill at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 27, at the NEWORK Space in downtown Newark, 14 N. Park Place. This workshop is part of a series titled "Tell Better Stories" that is supported by a Mellon grant. The event is free and open to the public. For more information, contact Beth Lossing at 740-587-5352 or visit Denison.edu.
In order to tell someone else's story, you have to listen. Listening is often described as if it's an entirely passive process, but to truly listen to another person requires the active engagement of the listener. Even to tell one's own story, you have to teach yourself how to still the clamor of many other competing sounds and voices and hear what you are trying to say. Writing itself can also be a form of listening. During the workshop, attendees will work on the physical, non-verbal, and mental processes around listening well. Using insights gained from the practice of mediation, they will work on hearing each other a little better, listening to themselves, and working on some beginning steps to write what they've heard.
Gill is a pastor, mediator, and freelance writer based in Granville. He writes two weekly columns, "Faith Works" for the Newark Advocate and "Notes From My Knapsack" for the Granville Sentinel.
Registration is required.
To register, email Beth Lossing at lossingb@denison.edu.

DEMS GEAR UP; Could demand uncensored Mueller report

Resumen: House Democrats distrustful of Attorney General William Barr are prepared to subpoena Robert Mueller's full Russia probe report immediately after the Justice Department releases a redacted version Thursday morning, the Daily News has learned. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss internal talks, told The News that Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is ready to lob subpoenas for the complete special counsel report and all underlying evidence as soon as Barr drops the scrubbed document. Democrats have been openly skeptical of Barr's interpretation of Mueller's findings and were outraged after he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said he believed the Obama Justice Department was "spying" on Trump's campaign - a claim that echoes debunked right-wing conspiracy theories.

Texto completo: House Democrats distrustful of Attorney General William Barr are prepared to subpoena Robert Mueller's full Russia probe report immediately after the Justice Department releases a redacted version Thursday morning, the Daily News has learned.
A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss internal talks, told The News that Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is ready to lob subpoenas for the complete special counsel report and all underlying evidence as soon as Barr drops the scrubbed document.
The report will be turned over to members of Congress on CDs at some point between 11 a.m. and noon Thursday - after Barr's planned 9:30 a.m. press conference at Justice Department headquarters.
Democrats were outraged at Barr's pre-release conference, accusing him of trying to protect President Trump.
"It now appears the attorney general intends to once again put his own spin on the investigative work completed by the special counsel and his team," Nadler said at a press conference of his own in Manhattan Wednesday evening.
Nadler's late night appearance was called after The New York Times reported that the Justice Department has been briefing the White House on Mueller's complete findings over the past few days, allowing Trump's legal team to get a heads up while leaving Congress in the dark.
"The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump - the very subject of the investigation at the heart of the Mueller report," Nadler said.
Nadler, who has refrained from issuing subpoenas while waiting to see what Barr will release, said last week he was ready to "very quickly" fire off the powerful document demands. The judiciary committee voted on party lines earlier this month to approve subpoenas for the Mueller report, leaving the timing up to Nadler.
Democrats say they won't accept anything short of the full report and suspect Barr is trying to protect Trump by redacting Mueller's findings.
Barr has given mixed messages on whether he's ready to ever share Mueller's unvarnished report with Congress.
He told lawmakers he's willing discuss how to make more material accessible to certain congressional committees after the redacted version comes out but has not made any commitments.
The attorney general has rejected multiple bipartisan requests for the full report over the past few weeks, arguing redactions are necessary to comply with national security and privacy protocols.
If Barr refuses to comply with Democratic subpoenas, the fate of the full Mueller report is expected to be decided by federal courts.
The report out Thursday will be scrubbed of any information pertaining to classified national security matters, grand jury proceedings, ongoing criminal investigations and derogatory details about people who weren't charged in the investigation.
Barr has said Mueller's report exonerates Trump and his campaign of conspiring in Russia's illegal attempt to sway the 2016 election in his favor. Even though Mueller explicitly declined to do so, Barr also concluded the special counsel's evidence did not warrant obstruction charges against the president.
Democrats have been openly skeptical of Barr's interpretation of Mueller's findings and were outraged after he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said he believed the Obama Justice Department was "spying" on Trump's campaign - a claim that echoes debunked right-wing conspiracy theories. Barr did not share any evidence to back up the explosive statement.

Funeral for Dayton-native, Doolittle Raider Richard Cole set for Thursday

Información de publicación: Springfield News - Sun ; Springfield, Ohio [Springfield, Ohio]. 17 Apr 2019.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/funeral-dayton-native-doolittle-raider-richard/docview/2210815120/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: On the 75th anniversary of Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, the Air Force Museum hosts the last surviving member of the famous WWII bombing raid. For weeks, Cole practiced flying maneuvers on the B-25 Mitchell, a U.S. Army Air Corps twin-engine propeller-driven bomber with a crew of five that could take off from an aircraft carrier at sea, in what some would call the first joint action that tested the Army and Navy’s ability to operate together. In this April 18, 2015, file photo, two members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Richard "Dick" Cole, seated front, and retired Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, seated left, pose for photos after the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal honoring the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

Texto completo: Dayton native Richard Cole, the last surviving member of the Doolittle Raiders, will be honored Thursday during a memorial service at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph Air Force Base, Texas.
We will have live video from the service starting at 4 p.m. Dayton time.
Lt. Col. Richard “Dick” Cole was born Sept. 7, 1915, in Dayton.
In 1938, he graduated from Steele High School in Dayton and attended two years of college at Ohio University before enlisting as an aviation cadet on Nov. 22, 1940.
Soon after he enlisted, Cole received orders to report to Parks Air College in East St. Louis, Illinois, for training before arriving at Randolph Field, Texas and later, Kelly Field, Texas. He completed pilot training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in July 1941.

On the 75th anniversary of Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, the Air Force Museum hosts the last surviving member of the famous WWII bombing raid.
Cole retired from the Air Force on Dec. 31, 1966, as a command pilot with more than 5,000 flight hours in 30 different aircraft, more than 250 combat missions and more than 500 combat hours.
His decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf clusters; Air Medal with oak leaf cluster; Bronze Star Medal; Air Force Commendation Medal; and Chinese Army, Navy, Air Corps Medal, Class A, First Grade. All Doolittle Raiders were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in May 2014.
A photo provided by the U.S. Air Force of the carrier Hornet carrying the bombers used in the Doolittle raid on Japan in April 1942. Richard Cole, who was Jimmy Doolittle’s co-pilot in the lead plane for the bombing raid on Japan in retaliation for its attack on Pearl Harbor months earlier, died on April 9, 2019, in San Antonio. He was 103 and the last survivor of the 80 Doolittle raiders.

Lt. Col. Dick Cole role in the Doolittle Raid
While Cole was on a training mission with the 17th Bombardment Group at Pendleton, Oregon, word came that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor.
The 17th BG flew anti-submarine patrols until February 1942, when Cole was told he would be transferred to Columbia, South Carolina. While there, he and his group volunteered for a mission with no known details. Cole would later say that he thought his unit was heading to North Africa.
For weeks, Cole practiced flying maneuvers on the B-25 Mitchell, a U.S. Army Air Corps twin-engine propeller-driven bomber with a crew of five that could take off from an aircraft carrier at sea, in what some would call the first joint action that tested the Army and Navy’s ability to operate together. When the carrier finally went to sea to bring 16 bombers closer to maximize their reach, it wasn’t until two days into the voyage that the Airmen and Sailors on the mission were told that their carrier, the U.S.S. Hornet, and all of its bombers, were heading in the direction of Tokyo.
In this April 18, 2015, file photo, two members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Richard "Dick" Cole, seated front, and retired Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, seated left, pose for photos after the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal honoring the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Retired Lt. Col. Richard "Dick" Cole, the last of the 80 Doolittle Tokyo Raiders who carried out the daring U.S. attack on Japan during World War II, died Tuesday at a military hospital in Texas.

In an age-before mid-air refueling and GPS, the U.S.S. Hornet weighed less than a quarter of today’s fortress-like aircraft carriers. With Cole as the copilot to then-Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, the B-25 Mitchell bomber #40-2344, would take off with only 467 feet of takeoff distance.
What made the mission all the more challenging was a sighting by a Japanese patrol boat that spurred the task force commander, U.S. Navy Adm. William F. “Bull” Halsey, to launch the mission more than 650 nautical miles from Japan – 10 hours early and 170 nautical miles farther than originally planned. Originally, the Mitchells were supposed to land, refuel and proceed on to western China, thereby giving the Army Air Corps a squadron of B-25s and a commander. But now the aircrews faced increasing odds against them, in their attempt to reach the airfields of non-occupied China. Still, Cole and his peers continued with their mission.
Flying at wave-top level around 200 feet and with their radios turned off, Cole and the Raiders avoided detection for as much of the distance as possible. In groups of two to four aircraft, the bombers targeted dry docks, armories, oil refineries and aircraft factories in Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe as well as Tokyo itself. The Japanese air defense was so caught off guard by the Raiders that little anti-aircraft fire was volleyed and only one Japanese Zero followed in pursuit. With their bombs delivered, the Raiders flew towards safety in China.
Many Airmen had to parachute out into the night, Cole himself jumping out at around 9,000 feet. All aircraft were considered lost with Cole’s own aircraft landing in a rice paddy full of night soil. Of the 80 Airmen committed to the raid, eight were captured by Japanese forces with five executed and three sent to prison (where one died of malnutrition). All of the 72 other Airmen found their way to safety with the help of Chinese farmers and guerrillas and continued to serve for the remainder of World War II.
The attack was a psychological blow for the Japanese, who moved four fighter groups and recalled top officers from the front lines of the Pacific to protect the cities in the event American bomber forces returned.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.

Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador's interior minister.

Assange's behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.

If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he's a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans -- including many in the U.S. media -- long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.

No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange's publishing activities.

Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.

While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you're a journalist doesn't make you one. (Granted, some are better than the "real" ones.)

The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone's personal emails and under what circumstances?

One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn't accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.

In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government's decades-long campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.

In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham's bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts -- all while risking great personal and financial loss -- was epic.

Assange's process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.

It isn't hyperbolic to say we're at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.

On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole -- and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal -- and he published. The difference may be mostly political.

The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg's charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.

Wikileaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.

One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that's just me.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
With a Ph.D. in psychology, Brent Staples of The New York Times, who won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing on Monday, writes about race with the knowledge that most whites don't live near African-Americans, seldom socialize with them and haven't been taught an in-depth course on the adverse effects of race in our country's history.
Probably because of Mr. Staples's scholarly training, his editorials on race are at once disturbing, informative and captivating, but also digestible and influential to the masses who've never given serious thought to race or racial history.
As an African-American who grew up in the rural South, I especially appreciate his bridging that "social racial distance" to the uninformed millions with erudite and compelling editorials on race. It is direly needed in our volatile atmosphere. He is most deserving of a Pulitzer Prize.

Tax returns show candidates gave to charity, but not a ton

Texto completo: Former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) released 10 years of tax returns Monday night. He and his wife reported $1,166 of charitable giving from a total income of $370,412 in 2017, the most recent year for which they released a return. That is one-third of 1 percent.
How much someone gives to charity is a meaningful metric of their values and priorities, though far from the only one. The flurry of returns from 2020 contenders in recent days offers a lot to chew over.
Candidates who release their tax returns deserve credit for transparency, especially because President Trump refuses to disclose his. Trump is the first president since Richard Nixon to conceal his tax returns from the American people. One reason many politicians do not like to share their returns for everyone to see is because they don't want people to scrutinize things such as their effective tax rate, their deductions and their charitable giving.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his wife gave $19,000 to charity out of an income of $566,000 last year, or 3.4 percent. They provided $36,300 to charity in 2017, according to returns released this week. "The Sanders campaign said those rates do not reflect charitable proceeds given from one of his books, which he did not deduct from his taxes," The Post's Michael Kranish and Sean Sullivan report. "The campaign did not say how much was given in that case."
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) released 15 years of tax returns on Sunday, showing that she and her husband earned $1.9 million last year and gave $27,000 to charity - or 1.4 percent. Harris reported no charitable giving at all during her first three years as California's attorney general. But then she married Doug Emhoff in 2014. The first year they filed jointly, Harris and Emhoff - a partner at the law firm DLA Piper - reported giving $60,000 to charity. Their giving dropped off to between $18,000 to $37,000 in the years that followed.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and her husband donated $6,600 of their $338,500 income, or just under 2 percent, to charity last year, according to a return her campaign published on its website yesterday.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and her husband made $215,000 last year and gave $3,750 to charity, also just under 2 percent.
The most generous of the top-tier presidential candidates appears to be Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She and her husband donated $50,000 last year of their $906,000 income. That's 5.5 percent.
Gov. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) and his wife, who recently released 12 years of returns, earned an income of $203,000 in 2018. They gave $8,295 to charity, about 4 percent.
Trump's past claims of generous charitable giving have been widely debunked. My colleague David Fahrenthold won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for his investigation into the president's personal charity. Trump donates his government salary as president, but that's a small fraction of his total income. It's impossible to know how much Trump has given to charity without seeing his tax returns.
When Mitt Romney finally relented under pressure and released his tax returns in 2012, they showed that he and his wife had given away $4 million out of the $13.7 million they took in during the previous year, or 29.4 percent. Romney didn't even deduct $1.8 million of donations that year so that he could live up to his statement that he had always paid an effective tax rate of at least 13 percent.
Barack and Michelle Obama had given away 22 percent of their incomes to charity in 2011, donating $172,000 out of $790,000 of income. But Joe and Jill Biden gave just 1.5 percent of their income to charity, $5,500 out of $379,000.
Biden took heat during the 2008 campaign when his tax returns showed that he and his wife had donated only $3,690 to charity in total over the previous 10 years - an average of $369 a year. The most recent year for which Biden has released his tax returns is 2015. The then-vice president and second lady gave $6,900 of the $392,000 they earned to charity, about 1.8 percent. It will be interesting to see whether the rate of giving went up after Biden started giving high-priced paid speeches in 2017 and 2018.
In addition to Biden, we are still waiting to see tax returns from other top-tier contenders - including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.
Booker said Monday that he will release his returns "soon." He didn't say how soon, but he did unveil a plan to cut taxes for about half the country. Booker called for expanding the earned income tax credit to cover couples with a maximum income as large as $90,000. He would pay for it by taxing income from investments at the same rate as other income, rather than the lower capital gains rate.
The Wall Street Journal notes that the O'Rourkes appear to have underpaid their 2013 and 2014 taxes by more than $4,000 total because of an error in the way they reported their medical expenses. "They took deductions for those costs without regard to the limit that only allowed that break for medical and dental expenses above 10% of income for people their age," Richard Rubin reports. "Had they not taken the nearly $16,000 in medical deductions, their taxable income would have been higher. In those years it would likely have been subject to the rates they were paying under the alternative minimum tax."
Meanwhile, Trump and his legal team are actively combating efforts by House Democrats to review his tax returns and other financial records.
First, the president's attorneys are pressing an accounting firm not to comply with a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) announced his intention last week to subpoena Mazars USA after the company refused a March request to hand over Trump's financial documents, citing laws and rules that require a subpoena for such documents. "On Monday, lawyers for the president and the Trump Organization wrote in a letter to the accounting firm's counsel that a committee subpoena 'would not be valid or enforceable,' " The Post's Tom Hamburger reports. "In a statement, Mazars USA said that the firm 'believes strongly in the ethical and professional rules and regulations that govern our industry, our work and our client interactions.' "
Second, the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees issued a separate subpoena to Deutsche Bank, Trump's longtime lender, for Trump's personal and business records. "The two committees . . . also demanded documents from numerous other financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe," the New York Times's Emily Flitter and David Enrich report. " 'This subpoena is an unprecedented abuse of power and simply the latest attempt by House Democrats to attack the president and our family for political gain,' Eric Trump said in a statement. . . . Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's lawyer, said the company was weighing its options for potentially blocking Deutsche Bank from complying with the subpoena."
Third, Trump's lawyer, William Consovoy, publicly urged the Treasury Department not to comply with a formal request by the House Ways and Means Committee to hand over the president's tax returns. In an open letter, he said the intent of the law is more important than the letter of the law. "Congress's motives do matter under the Constitution," he wrote, arguing that seeing Trump's taxes does not serve any legislative purpose.
Now that Tax Day has come and gone, The Post's Heather Long assesses whether the 2017 overhaul of the tax code has lived up to its promises: Taxes didn't fit in a postcard, though the main form most tax filers fill out did shrink. The vast majority of Americans did get a tax cut, though. But the bill has not paid for itself. Early results indicate that the $1.5 trillion price tag of the tax cuts will be funded mostly by a larger national debt. Trump said about $4 trillion to $5 trillion would "come flooding back from abroad" from companies that stashed their earnings overseas because of taxes. According to government data, only $665 million has come back. It remains to be seen whether businesses will use that extra cash to invest inside the United States. Trump said Americans would love the tax bill, but polls show more people give it a thumbs down than a thumbs up. Trump made no promises on refunds, but fewer people are receiving them this year.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - The South Florida Sun Sentinel and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won Pulitzer Prizes on Monday and were recognized along with the Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Maryland, for their coverage of three horrifying mass shootings in 2018 at a high school, a synagogue and a newsroom itself.
The Associated Press won in the international reporting category for documenting the humanitarian horrors of Yemen's civil war, while The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal received Pulitzers for delving into President Donald Trump's finances and breaking open the hush-money scandals involving two women who said they had affairs with him.
The South Florida Sun Sentinel won the Pulitzer in public service for its coverage of the massacre that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and for detailing the shortcomings in school discipline and security that contributed to the carnage.
The Post-Gazette received the prize in the breaking news category for its reporting on the synagogue shooting rampage that left 11 people dead. The man awaiting trial in the attack railed against Jews before, during and after the massacre, authorities said.
After the Pulitzer announcement, the newsroom observed a moment of silence for the victims.
"We are not so much celebrating as affirming ... the job we were put on this earth to do, David Schribman, the now-retired executive editor who led the coverage, told the newsroom.
The Capital Gazette was given a special citation for its coverage and courage in the face of a massacre in its own newsroom. The newspaper published on schedule the day after the shooting claimed five staffers' lives, in one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history.
The man charged in the shooting had a longstanding grudge against the paper. The Pulitzer board awarded Capital Gazette an extraordinary $100,000 grant to further its journalism.
The Pulitzers, U.S. journalism's highest honor, reflected a year when journalism increasingly came under attack in other ways.
Reuters won an international reporting award for work that cost two of its staffers their liberty: shedding light on a brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims by security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are serving a seven-year sentence after being convicted of violating the country's Official Secrets Act. Their supporters say the two were framed in retaliation for their reporting.
The AP's international reporting prize went to a team of journalists who spent a year documenting atrocities and suffering in Yemen, illuminating the human toll of its four-year-old civil war.
As a result of the work by reporter Maggie Michael, photographer Nariman El-Mofty and video journalist Maad al-Zikry, at least 80 prisoners were released from secret detention sites, and the United Nations rushed food and medicine to areas where the AP revealed that people were starving while corrupt officials diverted international food aid.
Staffers broke out into applause at the AP's headquarters in New York, as Michael and al-Zikry watched via video screens from various locales.
"This is a story that everybody was not really paying good attention, and we're very happy to be able to draw some attention to it, Michael said.
In the U.S., journalists have been contending with attacks on the media's integrity from the president on down. Trump has branded coverage of his administration "fake news and assailed the media as the "enemy of the people.
Monday's wins by the Times and The Wall Street Journal may provoke further ire from the president, who recently suggested the Times and The Washington Post should be stripped of the Pulitzers they won last year for coverage of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Attorney General William Barr announced last month that special counsel Robert Mueller's nearly two-year investigation found no evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Moscow to sway the vote.
This year, the Times was recognized for laying out how a president who has portrayed himself as a largely self-made man has, in fact, received over $400 million in family money and helped his family avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
Trump, who has broken with presidential precedent by refusing to release his income tax returns, has called the Times expose a false "hit piece.
The Journal revealed last year that then-candidate Trump's personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen had paid $130,000 in the run-up to his 2016 election to silence porn star Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Trump.
Federal prosecutors have said Trump directed Cohen to make the payments to quash a potential campaign-season sex scandal. Trump has said the payments were a private matter unrelated to his presidential bid.
Earlier, the Journal disclosed that the National Enquirer's parent company reached a $150,000 deal to pay former Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal for her story of an affair with Trump. Trump has denied having affairs with either woman.
The Los Angeles Times took the investigative reporting prize for stories that revealed hundreds of sexual abuse accusations against a recently retired University of Southern California gynecologist.
The university recently agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by paying $215 million to potentially thousands of female students and alumni examined by Dr. George Tyndall, who has denied the allegations and has not been charged with any crime.
The local reporting prize went to The Advocate of Louisiana for work that led to a state constitutional amendment abolishing Louisiana's unusual practice of allowing non-unanimous jury verdicts in felony trials.
The split-verdict rule was blamed for contributing to racial disparities in a state where black people make up about one-third of the population but two-thirds of prisoners.
ProPublica won the feature reporting award for what the judges described as "powerful, intimate narratives about Salvadoran immigrants affected by a federal crackdown on the MS-13 gang.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump recently traveled to the Mexican border and delivered one of the most foolish and fallacious statements of his entire presidency. Speaking to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum here, he said, "We can’t take you anymore. Our country is full."
No, it is not full. It is not close to being full. In fact, the opposite is true. As aging baby boomers leave the workforce and depend more heavily on costly government services, more immigrants are desperately needed to fill jobs, pay taxes, have babies and revitalize areas that are losing population. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric serves only one purpose: to energize his supporters by inflaming the nativist fears that have periodically engulfed the country throughout our history. He firmly believes those fears helped elect him once, and will again.
From a political standpoint, that calculation is questionable. Trump’s denunciation of brown-skinned rapists and gangsters pouring across the southern border certainly helped his campaign in 2016, but last year, when he tried the same cynical scare tactics, his party lost 40 seats in the House. Clear majorities in national polls have consistently opposed his immigration policies.
From an economic standpoint, however, his war on immigrants is a disaster that would suffocate the sustained growth he loves to brag about. Under great pressure from business interests, Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security doubled the number of visas available for temporary guest workers this summer. Indeed, Trump’s own resorts and golf courses have long employed foreigners — a graphic rebuttal to his own inane comments.
There are short- and long-term implications here. Since June, for the first time since 1970, there have been more jobs available than workers seeking them. Many industries, from agriculture and food service to construction and health care, are frantically seeking immigrants to hire.
Dallas homebuilders tell the New York Times that a lack of workers is adding $6,000 to the cost of every new home and delaying completion by two months. Larry Cox, who farms in California’s Imperial Valley, said the labor shortage is driving "a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico." The problem is aggravated in areas like New England that are losing population. Older cities from Philadelphia to St. Louis are actively recruiting foreigners to restock urban neighborhoods as earlier settlers depart for the suburbs. "One of the key solutions" to urban blight is "to welcome immigrants into these communities," said Brooks Rainwater of the National League of Cities to the Times.
If anything, immigrants are even more important to the nation’s future economic health. U.S. birthrates are plummeting, and last year, population growth sank to its lowest level in 80 years. Newcomers accounted for nearly half of that increase. And by 2030, foreigners will be "the primary contributor to national population growth," estimates demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. These demographic trends, says Frey, require "a more serious discussion of U.S. immigration policy because of the future contributions that immigrants will make to growing America’s society and economy."
True, that serious discussion is imperative. But Trump’s tirade about a "full" America is totally wrong, and typical of his damaging determination to believe half-baked fantasies instead of proven facts.

Texto completo: With her first book, Erin Lee Carr chose a tough task: telling the story of her father.
What made it even tougher is that her dad was David Carr -- one of the best-known journalists in the country; a self-described wild man, who was gifted with a facile mind, a big reputation and a bigger personality.
In her raw and earnest memoir, "All That You Leave Behind," Erin brings us into her struggle to come to grips with who her father was and how to harness the weight and promise of his enduring legacy to shape who she's becoming.
Her story is not told in chronological order. Instead, it begins with David's sudden, shocking death in February 2015 and closes on his funeral, wake and the vacuum in which his survivors find themselves while trying to rebuild their shattered lives.
Throughout this visceral book, Erin is frank about her father's struggles with addiction, as well as her own. She reveals how she's buoyed and burdened by the miraculous story of her life: the product of a short-lived relationship between two addicts, raised by a single dad who continued to use until he was faced with losing his young twin daughters. Growing up during her father's drugs-to-fame story is no fairy tale, and it's clear she feels pressure to continue the ascent.
Erin does an excellent job of bringing her famed father to warts-and-all life. Her telling rings true to the many Minnesotans who knew David, who was born and raised in the Twin Cities and worked at the now defunct Twin Cities Reader before editing the Washington City Paper and then landing a job at the New York Times.
She tells riveting stories -- some warm, some jarring -- of her childhood and teen years. She also uses her father's writing to help conjure the man.
According to the book's publisher, Erin sifted through the voluminous correspondence between father and daughter. Those e-mails, Gchats and notes written on scraps of paper help reveal their complicated relationship. When the excerpts of David's writing extend for pages, however, it becomes unclear whether this is Erin's story or her father's. In addition, they often seem to hammer home something Erin makes clear from the first pages
of this compelling book: that she and her sisters were loved fiercely by an admittedly imperfect man.
Now 30 and an accomplished director, producer and writer, Erin also recounts the early years of her career, how her dad tried to help her get established and how hard he pushed her to be excellent. Always.
"All That You Leave Behind" isn't a bleak book. It's filled with love, hope and ambition -- just as David was, just as his daughter is. And there are plenty of moments of levity, including her addendum: A "Things I Learned From David Carr" list. ("Listen when you enter a room." "Be defiant." "Alcohol is not a necessary component to life." "Always love.")
It's clear from reading her memoir that Erin sees herself as a work in progress. It's also clear that she will continue to try to navigate the world as her father advised: by doing the next right thing.

Texto completo: PUBLIC SERVICE
The South Florida Sun Sentinel
The Sun Sentinel's sweeping coverage of the causes and consequences of the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., shaped the national gun safety debate and prompted changes in local policies. The paper addressed a culture of leniency at Broward County schools, blunders by the sheriff's office in responding to the attack and attempts by officials to mask their failures.
Finalists ProPublica, The Washington Post
BREAKING NEWS REPORTING
Staff of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
"I don't think there's a single person on the staff who didn't contribute" to covering the shooting deaths of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue, said Keith Burris, the paper's executive editor. A visceral account of the attack began with the first words of the Mourners' Kaddish, a Jewish prayer for the dead, rendered in Hebrew. Other articles examined the victims' lives, the harrowing experiences of survivors and the quick reactions of 911 center workers.
Finalists The Chico Enterprise-Record; South Florida Sun Sentinel
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
Matt Hamilton, Harriet Ryan and Paul Pringle
of The Los Angeles Times
The Los Angeles Times was honored for a series of articles that exposed a pattern of abuse by a University of Southern California gynecologist, Dr. George Tyndall, who was accused of sexually abusing hundreds of students at a campus clinic over the course of three decades The allegations led to the resignation of the university's president and prompted local, state and federal investigations.
Finalists David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner of The New York Times; Kathleen McGrory and Neil Bedi of The Tampa Bay Times
EXPLANATORY REPORTING
David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner
of The New York Times
The 18-month investigation of President Trump's finances debunked his claims of self-made wealth and revealed a business empire "riddled with tax dodges," the Pulitzer committee said. The series led city and state officials in New York to open investigations into whether Mr. Trump and his family had underpaid taxes on his father's real estate empire and participated in fraudulent tax schemes. This is the fourth Pulitzer for Mr. Barstow; Ms. Craig, 51, and Mr. Buettner, 57, have been finalists.
Finalists Kyra Gurney, Nicholas Nehamas, Jay Weaver and Jim Wyss of The Miami Herald; Aaron Glanz and Emmanuel Martinez of Reveal/The Center for Investigative Reporting; Staff of The Washington Post
LOCAL REPORTING
Staff of The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La.
The Advocate was honored for its investigation of a Louisiana law that allowed juries to convict defendants without unanimous verdicts. In the series' first installation, the reporters revealed how the framers of the state's Constitution noted explicitly that the law would perpetuate "the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race in Louisiana." After the series appeared, Louisiana voters amended their Constitution to require unanimous verdicts. "It seemed to help turn the tide," said Gordon Russell, one of the reporters on the series.
Finalists Barbara Laker, Wendy Ruderman, Dylan Purcell and Jessica Griffin of The Philadelphia Inquirer; Brandon Stahl, Jennifer Bjorhus, MaryJo Webster and Renée Jones Schneider of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, Minn.
NATIONAL REPORTING
Staff of The Wall Street Journal
The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting prize for its articles on hush money payments made to two women who claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that they had sexual encounters with Donald J. Trump. "To see the story unfold the way it did and reach the president was just incredible," said Michael Rothfeld, one of The Journal reporters who contributed to the coverage. "For me, it's just the story of a lifetime."
Finalists Staff of Associated Press; Staff of The New York Times with contributions from Carole Cadwalladr of The Guardian/The Observer
INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
Maggie Michael, Maad al-Zikry and Nariman El-Mofty
of Associated Press; Staff of Reuters, with notable contributions from Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo
The Reuters staff and two reporters specifically were honored for "expertly exposing the military units and Buddhist villagers responsible for the systematic expulsion and murder of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar." The reporters, Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, were arrested in December 2017 and later sentenced to seven years in prison for reporting on the atrocities. Stephen J. Adler, Reuters' top editor, said he was "thrilled" for the recognition, but "deeply distressed" that they reporters were still imprisoned.
Ms. Michael, Mr. al-Zikry and Ms. El-Mofty won for their series "detailing the atrocities of the war in Yemen, including theft of food aid, deployment of child soldiers and torture of prisoners." The journalists documented, in text, video and photography, the civilian deaths caused by United States drones and interviewed torture victims in Yemen's civil war. Ms. Michael told The Associated Press that she and her colleagues were "very happy to be able to draw some attention" to the story.
Finalist Rukmini Callimachi of The New York Times
FEATURE WRITING
Hannah Dreier of ProPublica
Ms. Dreier's detailed portraits of Salvadoran immigrants were cited for exposing how their lives had been destroyed "by a botched federal crackdown on the international criminal gang MS-13." After Ms. Dreier, 32, heard President Trump tie immigration to gang violence, her reporting revealed that immigrants were often victims of the crime groups. "What was so cruel was that this population was being preyed upon," she said. The series was published jointly with The New York Times Magazine, Newsday and New York magazine.
Finalists Deanna Pan and Jennifer Berry Hawes of The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., and Elizabeth Bruenig of The Washington Post
COMMENTARY
Tony Messenger of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
Mr. Messenger, The Post-Dispatch's metro columnist, was cited for a series of pieces that exposed how poor people convicted of misdemeanor crimes were charged fees for their time in jail, sometimes leading to years of debt and further imprisonment. The columns resulted in a ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court that the practice was illegal, although Mr. Messenger, 52, said it persists. In an interview, he called it "a story of human tragedy."
Finalists Caitlin Flanagan of The Atlantic; Melinda Henneberger of The Kansas City Star
CRITICISM
Carlos Lozada of The Washington Post
Mr. Lozada, 47, The Post's nonfiction book critic, won for reviews and essays on politics, truth, immigration and American identity in the Trump era. In an interview, he called it "an irony of the time" that a president with seemingly few literary interests had fueled such a publishing explosion of topical work. "It's a really rich time to dig in to books as means to understand what is going on right now," he said.
Finalists Manohla Dargis of The New York Times; Jill Lepore of The New Yorker
EDITORIAL WRITING
Brent Staples of The New York Times
Mr. Staples, a member of The Times's editorial board, was cited for his writing on racial justice and culture, including pieces about how the suffrage movement betrayed black women, Southern newspapers' role in lynchings and the Afrofuturism behind the movie "Black Panther."
In a collection of his work published on Monday, The Times wrote that Mr. Staples, 67, "has sought to correct the parts of the national narrative on race that have been sanitized and distorted."
Finalists The editorial board of The Advocate in Baton Rouge, La., and the editorial board of The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.
EDITORIAL CARTOONING
Darrin Bell, freelancer
Mr. Bell, whose work is syndicated by King Features, won for cartoons that addressed racial injustice and political turmoil surrounding the Trump administration. He was cited for "calling out lies, hypocrisy and fraud." He is the first African-American winner in the category, a Pulitzer spokeswoman confirmed. "All the nights I called home and told my wife and kids I had to stay at the office to cover something that just happened were not for nothing," he said in an email.
Finalists Ken Fisher, freelancer, Rob Rogers, freelancer
BREAKING NEWS PHOTOGRAPHY
Photography Staff of Reuters
The photography staff of Reuters won the prize for breaking news photography for its series of photos titled "On the Migrant Trail to America." Taken by 11 photographers, the winning images, inventive and heart-wrenching in equal measure, conveyed the violent conditions that Central American migrants were leaving behind in their homelands, and the harsh response they received from the authorities when they got to the United States.
Finalists Noah Berger, John Locher and Ringo H.W. Chiu of Associated Press; Staff of Associated Press
FEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY
Lorenzo Tugnoli of The Washington Post
Some of the pictures Lorenzo Tugnoli, 39, has taken in Yemen could be from anywhere: a young girl having her height measured, veiled women in a classroom. That these images alternate with photos of starving infants and armed men in camouflage only heightens their impact. In an interview, Mr. Tugnoli said he had tried to balance depictions of the extent and immediacy of the tragedy with pictures that displayed deep respect for their subjects' everyday lives.
Finalists Craig F. Walker of The Boston Globe; Maggie Steber and Lynn Johnson of National Geographic
FICTION
The Overstory by Richard Powers (W.W. Norton)
Mr. Powers, 61, is known as a brainy novelist, but "The Overstory" tested even his intellectual capacity: Its central characters are trees. The environmental plot involves humans, but also communication occurring in nature. Mr. Powers called the Pulitzer Prize "an astonishing recognition," and he said the reception to the novel proved to him that readers were "hungry for a story that takes the nonhuman seriously, and tries to reconnect the human to a world we're so alienated from."
Finalists "The Great Believers," by Rebecca Makkai (Viking Books); "There There," by Tommy Orange (Alfred A. Knopf)
DRAMA
Fairview by Jackie Sibblies Drury
Ms. Drury's dazzling play appears at first to be a family comedy, but subverts expectations with a head-spinning shift in content and form that forces theatergoers to think in new ways about race and the white gaze. Ms. Drury, 37, said she was trying "to communicate to white people what it's like walking around in a body of color and having people judge you." The play, which debuted last year at Soho Rep, will return in June at Theater for a New Audience.
Finalists "Dance Nation," by Claire Barron; "What the Constitution Means to Me," by Heidi Schreck.
HISTORY
Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom by David W. Blight (Simon & Schuster)
Mr. Blight, a professor at Yale University, was cited for "a breathtaking history" that traced Douglass's transformation from runaway slave to one of the most profound thinkers on race, equality and American identity. Mr. Blight, 70, began the book 12 years ago after encountering a private collection of Douglass manuscripts assembled by a retired African-American surgeon in Savannah, Ga. "What does it mean to be an American?" Professor Blight said. "Nobody has had more to say about that than Douglass."
Finalists "Civilizing Torture: An American Tradition," by W. Fitzhugh Brundage (Harvard University Press); "American Eden: David Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic," by Victoria Johnson (Liveright/W.W. Norton).
BIOGRAPHY
The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke by Jeffrey C. Stewart (Oxford University Press)
Mr. Stewart, a professor of black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was honored for offering "a panoramic view of the personal trials and artistic triumphs of the father of the Harlem Renaissance and the movement he inspired." Locke, whose protégés included Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, believed artistic expression was crucial to racial progress. "We don't often celebrate people who create room and space for others," Mr. Stewart, 69, said. "That's one thing I really love about Locke."
Finalists "The Road Not Taken: Edward Lansdale and the American Tragedy in Vietnam," by Max Boot (Liveright/W.W. Norton), and "Proust's Duchess: How Three Celebrated Women Captured the Imagination of Fin-de-Siècle Paris," by Caroline Weber (Alfred A. Knopf).
POETRY
Be With by Forrest Gander (New Directions)
The poems in Forrest Gander's latest collection deal with, among other things, grief. His wife, the acclaimed poet C. D. Wright, died suddenly in 2016 at 67. "I didn't write for almost two years," Gander, 63, said of the period after her death. "We were always great readers of each other's work." When he started writing again, the poems "just came out," requiring less revising than usual. He was glad readers felt, as he did, that "writing about the darkness might be transformative."
Finalists "feeld," by jos charles (Milkweed); "Like," by A. E. Stallings (Farrar, Straus and Giroux).
GENERAL NONFICTION
Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America by Eliza Griswold (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)
Ms. Griswold, 46, observed one family in Amity, Penn., over seven years for this book about how hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, affected the town. "What Griswold depicts is a community, like the earth, cracked open," our reviewer wrote. "Every book takes a village, that's the nature of books, but this one took two," said Ms. Griswold, adding that she felt "deeply grateful" to the people of Amity.
Finalists "Rising: Dispatches From the New American Shore," by Elizabeth Rush (Milkweed); "In a Day's Work," by Bernice Yeung (The New Press).
MUSIC
"prism" by Ellen Reid, premiered by the Los Angeles Opera on Nov. 29, 2018
In this haunting opera, a mother and daughter grapple with trauma and guilt after a sexual assault. The Pulitzer board praised the way Ms. Reid, 36, uses "sophisticated vocal writing and striking instrumental timbres to confront difficult subject matter: the effects of sexual and emotional abuse." Ms. Reid said in an interview that she had worked on the piece for five years. "There were times when I didn't want to finish the piece," she said. Roxie Perkins wrote the elliptical, poetic libretto.
Finalists "Sustain," by Andrew Norman, premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic (Schott Music), and "Still," by James Romig, released by New World Records.
SPECIAL CITATION
The Capital Gazette, Annapolis, Md.
Employees of the Capital Gazette were recognized for reporting and publishing news even as they dealt with a shooting in their newsroom that left five colleagues dead. After the attack, the deadliest against journalists in United States history, some journalists gathered in a garage across the street to file articles and photographs. "We are putting out a damn paper," one said on Twitter that day. The Pulitzer board awarded the paper a $100,000 grant to support its work.
Special citation
Aretha Franklin
When the "Queen of Soul" died last year at 76, she had won 18 Grammy Awards and placed more than 100 singles on the Billboard charts ("Respect" and "Think" among them). The Pulitzer board recognized Franklin, who bridged gospel traditions with secular music, "for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades." In receiving the posthumous honor, she joins such other popular music titans as Hank Williams (2010) and Duke Ellington (1999).

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Ga. - Tiger Woods faced this question: Should Jack Nicklaus be worried about his record 18 majors?
"Well, I don't know if he's worried or not," Woods replied, later adding: "I'm just enjoying 15."
Perhaps he'd also enjoy these 15 takeaways from one of the most memorable Masters in history:
1. This place always delivers. Sunday drama at the Masters is a given. The risk-reward holes on the back nine lend themselves to "ooohs" and "aaahs" every year. Dustin Johnson picked up four shots on the back nine Sunday. Francesco Molinari crumbled, putting two balls in the water.
Masters officials lengthened the fifth hole and got what they wanted, we suppose. Woods bogeyed the hole all four days. But they'd be wise to think twice before moving the tee box back at No. 13, which yielded 17 crowd-pleasing eagles this week.
2. Woods' dissection of his thought process on the 155-yard 12th was epic. "I had 147 over the first tongue in the bunker, so my number was 150. I saw Brooks (Koepka) ended up short. (Ian Poulter) ended up short as well. I was up there on the tee box and I could feel that wind puff up a little bit. Brooksy is stronger than I am, and he flights it better than I do, so I'm sure he hit 9-iron but didn't make it. So I knew my 9-iron couldn't cover the flag. I said: Just be committed. Hit it over that tongue. Let get out of here (with par) and let's go handle the par 5s, and I did."
3. Masters officials had a spectacular week (Part 1). The women's amateur event was well attended and shined a light on the progress the club has made since former Chairman Hootie Johnson's "point of a bayonet" clash with Martha Burk. Champion Jennifer Kupcho won in epic fashion, with an eagle on 13 and birdies on three of her final four holes.
4. Masters officials had a spectacular week (Part 2). Because of the threat of severe weather, they moved up Sunday's start time and had players go off both the first and 10th tees. By the time the weather horn sounded at 2:52 p.m., calling for the evacuation of the course, Woods had received his green jacket from Patrick Reed.
5. Woods has won green jacketsin 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2019, joining Nicklaus as the only men to win the Masters in three decades.
6. Asked to describe his impact on golf, Woods said he has brought more youth to the game. And encouraged players to improve their conditioning.
"A lot of the guys on the tour now are training," he said. "They are getting bigger, stronger, faster, more athletic. They are hitting the ball prodigious distances, and a little bit of that's probably attributed to what I did. When I first turned pro, I was the only one in the gym, except Vijay (Singh)."
7. And now for the ribbing. "Now everyone trains," he said. "Even Phil (Mickelson) is working out. Things have come a long way."
8. Chew on this. Mickelson told the New York Times last month that he likes to chew gum while playing to boost cognitive functioning.
Woods chewed much of the week but for a different reason: "I'm chomping on this gum because I usually get hungry, I keep eating so much. And it curbs my appetite a little bit, which is nice. The issue I have at tournaments is I lose so much weight."
9. Viktor Hovland of Norway was low amateur, finishing at 3 under.
10. Rickie Fowler remains the best player never to have won a major. He got close again Sunday, finishing T-9.
"I love this place," he said. "I've got a jacket coming soon, just not this year. I know I can get it done here."
11. Woods received $2,070,000 for his victory. A Woods fan did almost as well. The William Hill sportsbook had an $85,000 wager on Woods at 14-1, resulting in a $1.19 million payout.
"It's a painful day for William Hill - our biggest golf loss ever - but a great day for golf," company official Nick Bogdanovich told VSiN.com.
12. Woods' kids (daughter Sam, 11, and son Charlie, 10) might have a love/hate relationship with golf. "Prior to the comeback," Woods said, "they only knew that golf caused me a lot of pain. If I tried to swing a club, I would be on the ground. I struggled for years.
"Now I think they're starting to understand how much the game means to me."
13. Woods was steaming as he came off the fourth green after back-to-back bogeys. Asked about his conversation with caddie Joe LaCava, Woods said: "The talk that we had ... I just listened. He said some things that I can't really repeat here. Then I went into the restroom and proceeded to say the same things over and over to myself and then came out and I felt a lot better."
14. Several non-winners can take pride in their results. Patrick Cantlay (T-9) and Tony Finau (T-5) threatened. And Jordan Spieth finally showed a pulse, shooting 75-68-69-71. "Progress," said Spieth, who is in the midst of his worst season. "If it weren't for those first nine holes (Thursday), I probably would have a chance to win."
15. Tiger will not reach 18 majors.That's my prediction. Why? While it's true he contended at the final two majors last year, Augusta National is the one course that's perfect for him. The 43-year-old Woods doesn't pay much of a price for errant tee shots such as Sunday misses on Nos. 2 and 11, and he puts his 20-plus years of course knowledge to use.
That said, he does know Bethpage Black well. The course on Long Island, N.Y., will host the PGA Championship next month as part of the reconfigured schedule.
Woods won the 2002 U.S. Open there and tied for sixth in the 2009 Open.

In Third Part of 'Ring,' Superb Voices Overcome Subpar Staging

Texto completo: Pity the opera directors who decide to stage Wagner's "Ring" -- for in doing so they have to figure out what to do with "Siegfried."
The third installment of Wagner's epic, which returned to the Metropolitan Opera in Robert Lepage's tech-happy production on Saturday, has tripped up even the smartest of "Ring" directors. Blame the source material: a title role both tedious and impractically difficult; a repetitive libretto sitting somewhere between coming-of-age adventure and dark comedy; a singing dragon.
Mr. Lepage's staging doesn't do much to help the problems baked into "Siegfried," a weak spot of the "Ring" that lacks the breakneck pace of "Das Rheingold," the heart-rending humanity of "Die Walküre" or the textbook-perfect tragedy of "Götterdämmerung." What it does help, however, is the problem of the 45-ton machine so central to his production as its primary set piece.
Instead of relying on the unreliable behemoth to be as kinetic as in the earlier "Ring" operas, Mr. Lepage here treats the machine as more of a canvas for Pedro Pires's impressive projections. Three-dimensional, interactive videos create the illusion of leaves rustling beneath Siegfried's feet, of a pond's surface being truly reflective.
Is the novelty of video enough to carry more than four hours of music? It does add clarity -- if a bit unimaginatively -- to Wagner's score, not unlike, as the art critic Roberta Smith once wrote in The New York Times, seat-back titles, "enriching meaning and making it more accessible." But it is still, in the end, one superficial form of stage magic superimposed on another.
Block out the projections for a moment, and you'll see just how little Mr. Lepage actually engages the opera and its ideas. Where some directors might aim to comment on the material, he seems content to merely illustrate. When characters aren't forging swords or fighting dragons, they are bafflingly static. Not for the first time in his "Ring," stage exits are made with an awkwardly quiet walk to the wings.
But good singers can lift a subpar staging. In this "Siegfried," they transcend it.
[Video: Siegfried: Forging Song Watch on YouTube.]
Stefan Vinke is making his Met debut in the titular heldentenor role, armed with insouciant high notes and a bright smile. His heroism occasionally veers into howling, and the strain in his voice doesn't always befit a boyish naïf who knows no fear. (He shares the run with Andreas Schager, who is capable of breezing through the role's most challenging passages with the shocking ease of Siegfried wrangling a bear.) But Mr. Vinke is a pleasure to watch; he leans into the opera's comedy -- and his character's ignorance, which often comes off as idiocy.
As the scheming Mime, who takes in the orphaned Siegfried in the hope of using the boy's strength to gain the ring, Gerhard Siegel infused his tenor with venom. Mime's brother, Alberich, who in "Das Rheingold" commits the original sin of the "Ring," only returns in "Siegfried" for brief moments in Act II. But those scenes were among the most memorable on Saturday.
[Video: Siegfried: "Zur Neidhöhle fuhr ich bei Nacht" Watch on YouTube.]
That's because Alberich is sung by Tomasz Konieczny, who is also making his Met debut and continues to stand out even among extraordinary colleagues. His resonant bass ricochets off the planks of the machine as he imbues Alberich with dignified authority.
His confrontation with Wotan -- presented in "Siegfried" as the Wanderer, dressed like a Gandalf of the Wild West and performed by Michael Volle -- is a high point of the opera. Or, rather, low: They are both booming basses, equally mighty in a way that illustrates, with only music, how alike these antipodal characters may be.
[Video: Siegfried: "Wache, Wala! Wala! Erwach!" Watch on YouTube.]
If women seem absent, it's because there are so few: the whistle-high Erin Morley as the Woodbird; the solemn Karen Cargill as Erda; and, of course, the fiery soprano Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde.
It's remarkable that anyone in this cast was singing so well in a matinee that began at 11:30 a.m. But Ms. Goerke also had to feign sleep onstage for nearly 20 minutes before letting out a resounding "Heil dir, Sonne!" that penetrated through swelling fortes in the orchestra, crisp and controlled under the baton of Philippe Jordan.
[Video: Siegfried: Excerpt from Act III Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Goerke's vigor only grew in a crescendo toward all-out majesty in the final scene, a courtship with Mr. Vinke that ended with their leaping into love and matching high C's. For this climax of old-fashioned operatic thrills, they weren't even standing on the machine -- as if they existed outside Mr. Lepage's production entirely.

Texto completo: Six months ago, the newly formed Past Tense team began sifting through the treasure chest that is the New York Times archives, where some six million photographs are filed away. Photographs of dance quickly emerged as one of the most enduring themes, with photos that date back more than 100 years. Most of those photos are of ordinary people, and that's what we've highlighted here: from slow dances to the Twist, from the mambo to the mosh pit. Choreographers and professional dancers, like our guest editor, Misty Copeland, are scattered throughout, in part because it's in them that we find not just the highest elevation of the form, but a metaphor for possibility that extends far beyond the realm of dance. In her essay here, the novelist Zadie Smith remembers a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater from her childhood as nothing less than "a ravishment." Oprah Winfrey, talking to The Times about Ailey's company in 1996, said much the same: "It makes us feel better about ourselves, that you can live better, that you can fly." This section is devoted to the world of dancers, both off and onstage, who help keep alive that dream of flight.

Texto completo: [Video: A preview of "Crazy Rich Asians." Watch on YouTube.]
"Crazy Rich Asians" makes its television debut on HBO. And BTS bring K-pop to "Saturday Night Live."
What's on TV
CRAZY RICH ASIANS (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. This ultraglamorous romantic comedy barely needs an introduction. Based on the novel of the same name by Kevin Kwan, the movie made waves last year for being the first Hollywood production with a majority Asian cast since 1993's "The Joy Luck Club." (In an interview with The New York Times, the director Jon M. Chu said he wanted the film to be "the 'Avengers' of Asian actors.") Constance Wu stars as Rachel, a middle-class economics professor at New York University who joins her boyfriend, Nick (Henry Golding), on a trip to Singapore, whereupon she learns that his family is among the richest in the country. The differences between her upbringing and his become hard to ignore -- Nick's judgmental mother (Michelle Yeoh) flat-out tells Rachel she isn't right for her son -- but our heroine refuses to go down without a fight. For those craving more crazy, rich fun, a sequel based on Kwan's second book in the series is already in the works.
CHASING LIFE WITH DR. SANJAY GUPTA 9 p.m. on CNN. In this new documentary series, the journalist and neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta flies to six countries in search of elixirs, traditions and modern practices that might have the potential to extend our life spans. In the first of two back-to-back episodes, Gupta explores how people in Tokyo manage work-induced stress; in the second, he tries to find a connection between age-old methods in India and his own Western medical training.
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Emma Stone returns to host for the fourth time, while the musical guest BTS comes to "S.N.L." for the first. The South Korean boy band will perform songs off their new album, "Map of the Soul: Persona," and are likely to make a splash: Their third album, 2018's "Love Yourself: Tear," was the first K-pop release to debut atop the Billboard album chart. In the teaser to the episode, Stone and a few women from the "S.N.L." cast camp out on stage in BTS shirts eagerly waiting the performance -- not unlike the group's superfans who call themselves the Army.
What's Streaming
WHITE MATERIAL (2010) Stream on Mubi; Rent on Google Play, iTunes or YouTube. With Clair Denis's new sci-fi movie "High Life" currently playing on big screens, the streaming service Mubi is revisiting some of the director's earlier work. This political drama centers on a white French family that runs a coffee plantation in an unnamed African country in the throes of a civil war. The most steadfast of the bunch, Maria (Isabelle Huppert), wants to finish harvesting her crops, but her former husband Andre (Christopher Lambert) and his father, the patriarch of the plantation, are desperate to flee before the violence inches closer. As Maria clings to her plot of land with all her might, she is drawn into the violence around her and is forced to confront the color of her skin.

Texto completo: embraces policy for moving migrants
Once-discounted plan given 'strong considerations' President Trump moved aggressively Friday to take ownership of an internal White House plan to release immigrant detainees into "sanctuary cities" that his aides had sought to minimize a day earlier by saying it was shelved months ago after only informal consideration.
Directly contradicting his staff, Trump declared in a tweet that he was giving the plan "strong considerations," and, at an event later in the day, sarcastically challenged Democrats in liberal jurisdictions to accept the immigrants with "open arms."
The president said that if Congress refuses to change immigration laws to allow his administration to more quickly deport a surge of asylum-seeking Central American families, "we'll bring - I call them the 'illegals' because they enter the country illegally - to sanctuary cities and areas and let those particular areas take care of it."
Specifically referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Trump added: "California is always saying, 'We want more people.' We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. Let's see if they're so happy."
Since 1989, San Francisco has had policies aimed at limiting municipal cooperation with federal immigration authorities in certain cases, and California in 2017 adopted a "sanctuary state" law that implemented similar restrictions.
Trump's comments capped a frenzied two-week period during which the president threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico, only to pull back amid warnings that such a move would deeply harm the economy. He then embarked on an overhaul of the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security that included the removal of Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary and a promise to staff the agency with people who would take a "tougher" approach on immigration.
The president's embrace of the sanctuary cities policy is another sign of his mounting frustration over his inability to stem the flow of migrants at the border after making a promise to crack down on illegal immigration the central theme of his 2016 campaign.
The Washington Post reported Thursday that the administration had been eyeing districts of political adversaries, including that of Pelosi, to release detainees. The disclosure of the plan - which was explicitly rejected in November and February by Homeland Security officials who feared it would create additional burdens for agents and potentially run afoul of legal provisions - drew widespread recriminations.
A White House official said Thursday that the proposal "was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion."
But on Friday, White House aides, according to people familiar with the discussions, began a new, preliminary review of whether there could be a way to move detainees to sanctuary cities should Trump decide to actually go through with the plan. A DHS official said the agency had not been instructed to move forward.
One senior aide described Trump's position as an effort to exploit the political "upside" of the controversy and draw a sharp contrast with Democrats on border enforcement. Trump's eagerness to do so reflected his confidence that coaxing his rivals into a deeper fight over immigration will help him in his 2020 reelection campaign.
Several aides said that there was a desire among some West Wing officials to move away from immigration after a week in which the president fired several senior DHS leaders in a sign of growing alarm over the spiking border crossings.
But Trump "wants to talk about it and will always take whatever position he thinks makes him look strongest," said a senior administration official, who like other aides spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
Administration officials said that even Stephen Miller, the president's hawkish immigration aide, was concerned Thursday about the plan getting out and had tried to downplay it in the building. Communications officials sought to convince reporters that it was not under consideration anymore to keep the story from picking up traction.
But after seeing media coverage of the plan Friday morning, the president decided it was a good idea and tweeted out his support, according to aides.
One person outside the White House who frequently talks with the president said that while Miller is widely viewed as the most forceful advocate for hard-line border policies that have, in numerous instances, been halted by federal courts, it is Trump who is most willing to "push the limits."
During a trip to the border town of Calexico, Calif., last week, Trump reportedly told then-Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan that he should close the border, despite the president having said earlier in the week he would keep it open, according to CNN and the New York Times. He then told McAleenan, who is now the acting Homeland Security secretary, that he would pardon him if he ran into any legal problems resulting from the closure, although it was unclear how serious he was, according to the reports.
"At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal," a DHS spokesman said in a statement, in response to a question about the conversation between Trump and McAleenan. "Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law."
A senior administration official said Trump has periodically mused about closing the border, even after saying he wouldn't, but added that they don't think he is seriously considering the move. "He's just frustrated as hell," the official said.
In his remarks at the White House on Friday, Trump vowed to send more military troops to the border, after having dispatched several thousand to support Border Patrol operations last fall ahead of the midterm election. Troops are not allowed under U.S. law to make arrests inside the United States, and they were confined to a support role, including such duties as erecting barbed wire.
"There are a lot of people with criminal records trying to get through," Trump said of the migrants, even though a majority are families with children.
DHS said 103,000 migrants, including nearly 60,000 family members, were taken into custody in March at the southern border with Mexico, a sharp increase from the total of 58,000 migrants detained in January.
House Democrats have begun internal discussions about launching an investigation into Miller's role in the White House's immigration policies, including potentially calling him to testify on Capitol Hill. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), who chairs the border subcommittee on the House Homeland Security panel, said Miller needs to "make his case for these terrible policies to the American people instead of being this shadow puppeteer."
"If he's going to continue advocating for these policies and personnel change then he needs to come before the American people and explain himself," Rice said.
She added that the committee's leadership might soon request emails and documents from the White House and federal agencies that could shed light on Miller's role. Although his name was not on messages sent from the White House to pressure DHS to release immigrants into sanctuary cities, some agency officials said they believed he was among those who had initiated the request.
"Using human beings - including children - for perceived political gain, is reprehensible," Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote on Twitter.
The White House proposal had been opposed by federal immigration enforcement officials who viewed it as unworkable, having no legal justification and likely to create strain on an agency already dealing with a crisis.
DHS generally releases immigrants in two ways: directly from one of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's immigration jails or, more recently, from Customs and Border Protection after they are apprehended and pass an initial security check.
ICE is required to release immigrants, including some with serious criminal records, if they cannot deport them. The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that immigrants cannot be jailed indefinitely after they have a final deportation order and must be released after six months if their native country will not take them back.
Sometimes, ICE officers or immigration judges release immigrants on bond. Under current practice, once detainees are released, they are generally free to settle wherever they choose, and they are required to inform the government of their address.
Most of the roughly 50,000 immigrants in federal custody have been apprehended at the southern border.
On Friday, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said the president was engaged in "a politically motivated stunt."
"The fact that such a proposal is being peddled by the leader of the free world is an all-time low for American discourse," he said. "And it's the clearest sign yet that the president fully intends to chart a path to reelection on the back of racist rhetoric and policies intended to divide us."

Texto completo: Ballet eminences across the country hailed the news this week that Suzanne Farrell, the celebrated ballerina and choreographic inspiration to George Balanchine, had returned to the New York City Ballet to coach dancers after being fired in 1993 by former director Peter Martins.
Farrell's return to the company's studios could be further evidence that its new leaders - Director Jonathan Stafford and Associate Director Wendy Whelan - are continuing to make changes for the good. It also seems like a healing act.
And for New York City Ballet followers, there is not a more highly charged issue than the care of the Balanchine repertoire. Farrell, the greatest living Balanchine star, has a sterling reputation for sensitive, compassionate and wise teaching of Balanchine ballets. For nearly 20 years, she taught them to her Washington-based company, Suzanne Farrell Ballet, which became a distinguished showcase of the famous choreographer's work.
The New York City Ballet tweeted Wednesday that Farrell is coaching dancers in the expansive pas de deux from "Diamonds," the grand finale of "Jewels," which Balanchine created in 1967 as a tribute to Russian classicism and a showcase for Farrell's gifts. Sections of Tchaikovsky's majestic Symphony No. 3 in D accompany the turns and soaring lifts of this elegant duet. The piece displays the power and brilliance of the ballerina as if she were a gem rotating to catch the light.
Also on Wednesday, Whelan posted a photo of Farrell and ballerina Sara Mearns on Instagram.
The post drew virtual applause from thousands of dancers, fans and ballet stars including American Ballet Theatre principals Isabella Boylston and James Whiteside, former New York City Ballet dancer Benjamin Millepied and Washington Ballet Artistic Director Julie Kent.
The move to bring back Farrell is pragmatically, artistically and morally right. The home that she helped build is finally opening its doors. The New York City Ballet's rehearsal studios are the natural place for her, where she can groom dancers in the roles she knew best as the company's prima ballerina and Balanchine's muse. Yet, for more than a quarter century, she hasn't been welcome there.
After retiring from the stage in 1989, Farrell taught and informally coached the company's dancers. She had no official title and was working infrequently when Martins ended the arrangement four years later.
"I never dreamed I would live to see the day when I didn't work for New York City Ballet," Farrell told the New York Times after being let go.
That dismissal, following pointed comments she made in the New Yorker about her Balanchine expertise and her frustrations at not being able to do more for the company, fit a pattern. Few of the principal dancers who knew Balanchine best continued on as coaches or teachers under Martins, who, after Balanchine's death in 1983, directed the company with Jerome Robbins and took over sole leadership in 1990.
But Washington benefited from New York City Ballet's loss. Farrell began teaching weekend ballet classes at the Kennedy Center in the mid-1990s, which grew into a summer training program and then yearly outings for a small group of dancers that became the Suzanne Farrell Ballet in 2001. The Kennedy Center funded the troupe on a modest scale, just enough for a few weeks of rehearsals and performances a year, but it pulled the plug in 2017.
In an interview in 2004, as Farrell was running her company in Washington and the New York City Ballet was preparing to perform at the Kennedy Center for the first time in 17 years, I asked Martins why he wouldn't welcome Farrell's vast knowledge and assistance in staging Balanchine's works at the company.
"Life goes on," Martins told me. "People go on to create their own lives. They are busy doing them. I am happy she is busy, so that answers the question. We do our thing. They do their thing. It's not just Suzanne. There are millions of them out there. Imagine if some ballet company out there asked me to coach 'Violin Concerto' because I was in the original," he continued. "How preposterous."
Why is that preposterous? I asked. "What, I'm going to go to Russia and spend three weeks coaching 'Violin Concerto' just because I was one of the originals?" he said. "There are people who can do that just as well as I. And I'm busy . . . I'm busy like these [other] people are busy. I'm running a place here. Balanchine is now spread out all over the world. There can't just be one person. There are many people who can do this."
That is true, in a way. But in a work such as "Diamonds," no one has the direct link to Balanchine's artistic intentions that Farrell does because Balanchine drew the movements out of her body.
When you're talking about the work of a man who was notorious for changing steps to suit various casts of dancers, it's difficult to settle on a standard version. That's where the dancer who inspired the creation comes in, the one who stood in front of Balanchine as he spoke and demonstrated and decided what move comes next.
When it comes to passing on a dance, there's no time to waste. Even in our visually rich digital age, a dance is difficult to preserve. Dancing comes to life through strength, energy and physical labor, but the choreography itself is an unstable, delicate creation. Steps can be easily forgotten, changed or lost because choreography is not an object. It is a thought process.
The best way to pass on a dance is through the human touch. Teaching a dance is a memory exercise, an attempt to recapture the past, to move the way one has moved before. The best person to carry out this instruction is someone who knows every step, every tilt of the head and angle of the leg, because he or she has embodied them and can connect all the body shapes to the proper rhythmic emphasis and the ballet's atmosphere. The best person is the choreographer or a dancer who understands the work inside and out, as Farrell does "Diamonds" and numerous other ballets.
It remains difficult to characterize this news about Farrell. Will she join the staff long term? How much should we read into her visit?
For all the tumultuous developments at the New York City Ballet, it is in rehearsal that the real difference will be made. Bringing Farrell into the studio is clearly a step in the right direction.

Texto completo: SYDNEY - Australian actor Geoffrey Rush won his defamation case on Thursday against the parent company of a newspaper that published articles accusing him of sexual harassment.
The two front-page articles were published in late 2017 by The Daily Telegraph, a tabloid newspaper in Sydney owned by Rupert Murdoch's Nationwide News. They said that during a Sydney Theater Company production of "King Lear" from November 2015 to January 2016, Rush acted inappropriately toward an unnamed female co-star later identified as Eryn Jean Norvill.
Speaking to a packed room in Sydney, Justice Michael Wigney of the Federal Court of Australia said The Telegraph had not proved that the articles were substantially true, as required by Australian defamation law. He awarded 850,000 Australian dollars, or $608,000, in initial damages to Rush, with damages for the actor's economic losses to be determined later.
"This is a sad and unfortunate case," Wigney said at the beginning of the verdict, adding that the accusations should have been "dealt with in a different way and in a different place to the harsh, adversarial world of a defamation proceeding."
He also criticized Norvill's testimony as "at times prone to exaggeration and embellishment."
The case had served as a moment of reckoning in Australia for both the entertainment industry and the #MeToo movement there, and activists and lawyers said Thursday that the verdict could discourage others from speaking out about harassment.
"If you were a victim, you would see this and wonder whether subjecting yourself to this process would make it worse rather than better," said Matt Collins, a defamation lawyer based in Victoria.
Rush said after the verdict: "There are no winners in this case. It's been extremely distressing for everyone involved."
Rush, 67, argued during the trial that the articles wrongly portrayed him as a "sexual predator" and a "pervert." One of them was illustrated by a photograph of a haunted-looking Rush in character as King Lear, accompanied by the headline "King Leer."
The case rested largely on his word against that of Norvill.
Norvill, who is in her mid-30s, was not interviewed for the Telegraph articles but testified last year that Rush had sexually harassed her during rehearsals for "King Lear," in which she played his daughter Cordelia. Among the allegations, she said that Rush had made "groping" and "cupping" gestures toward her breasts.
During one scene in a preview performance, Norvill said, Rush "deliberately" stroked her breast in front of the audience. At another point, she said, he traced her lower back along the waistline of her jeans with his fingertips.

The debate used to be about whether spying on Trump campaign officials was justified, not whether it occurred

Texto completo: Outrage by liberals and Democrats over Attorney General William Barr noting that "spying did occur" on the 2016 Trump campaign is a sorry example of moving the goal posts. Last year, the active debate was not over whether spying occurred -- which it did by a reasonable use of the word -- but whether it was justified . Barr was careful not to weigh in on that debate. Yet Democrats, spurred on by their liberal base and supported by the media, have been out to portray Barr's statement as some sort of shocking betrayal of his role as the nation's top law enforcement officer.

"Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of the Attorney General," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer fumed in calling for Barr to retract his statement. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Barr's statement, "strikes another destructive blow to our democratic institutions."

Yet last year, it wasn't being disputed that among other things, that the FBI conducted surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign official, that included wiretapping after obtaining a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant. In a 2018 memo by none other Schiff, minority Democrats on the intelligence committee argued, "DOJ and FBI would have been remiss in their duty to protect the country had they not sought a FISA warrant and repeated renewals to conduct temporary surveillance of Carter Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian government."

At the time, Republicans had been arguing that the FBI launched the investigation into Russian interference on the basis of a dossier that was based on research funded by the DNC and Clinton campaign. Democrats were arguing that "Christopher Steele's raw intelligence reporting did not inform the FBI's decision to initiate its counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016." Instead, they argued that it began with information FBI received that Russians were wooing a different Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos.

Outside Congress, the debate also focused on whether there was "probable cause" for the FISA warrant, which those pushing back against Trump and Republicans argued that there was.

"Commentators like National Review’s Andrew McCarthy try to discredit the Mueller investigation by sliming the process to spy on a former Trump advisor," argued an op-ed from the liberal Brennan Center for Justice. "Here’s why they’re wrong."

So, the issue they were taking with conservative McCarthy was that he was attacking "the process" that was used "to spy on a former Trump advisor" -- rather than arguing about whether the spying occurred.

Indeed, the article itself is a case that the FISA warrant was totally justified.

"Now that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application for an order to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page has been released in heavily redacted form, the attacks on the FBI’s application have been predictably loud yet incorrect," the op-ed read. "They miss the critical question related to such an application: Was there probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power?"

So, the "critical question" concerned not whether there was surveillance, but whether there was probable cause, to which the Brennan Center argued, "the unredacted portions easily meet this probable cause standard and support the FISA court’s multiple orders."

The surveillance and wiretapping was thus indisputable, as was the fact that it allowed investigators to go back to when Page did work on the Trump campaign. It also doesn't even get into the fact that, according to the New York Times, "Agents involved in the Russia investigation asked [Stefan] Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain, to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another Trump campaign foreign policy adviser."

This is all perfectly consistent with what Barr said.

"I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated — adequately predicated," Barr testified before Congress. "I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane."

The only part he's stating unequivocally is that there was spying. He is not making a claim that the FISA warrant was illegally obtained on the basis of a Cinton-funded discredited dossier. He just said it was worthy of looking into to make sure the process was proper.

So then the only real argument is if Barr was wrong to use the word "spying" rather than saying "surveillance did occur" or "wiretapping did occur."

But, even if people want to litigate this issue, it should be seen as a reasonable use of the word. My colleague Byron York noted several examples of the New York Times describing wiretapping as spying.

After the House voted to reauthorize FISA last year, the Brennan Center issued a press release headlined, "U.S. House Votes to Authorize Warrantless Domestic Spying on Americans." The bill, it warned, would "endorse warrantless searches of millions of Americans’ online and phone communications." The release quoted co-director of the Brennan Center, Elizabeth Goitein, as saying, “The House just voted to turn the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act into a tool for domestic spying on Americans."

This isn't to say it's hypocritical, as in this case, the discussion was about allowing warrantless access, whereas in the previous case, the argument was that there was probable cause for a warrant. But again, a debate over whether a warrant is justified on the basis of probable cause is different than whether the underlying government activity can be described as spying. It's reasonable to argue that yes it can.

Texto completo: American Media Inc. is looking to unload the struggling National Enquirer as well as other tabloid publications, and among the potential buyers is billionaire Ron Burkle.
New York-based AMI, which also owns the Globe and National Examiner, said its board had concluded a strategic operational review of its tabloid business, which began in August, leading to the decision to explore strategic options for the brands.
The move will "likely result in their sale in the near future," the company said in a release.

Burkle, who controls Los Angeles-based Yucaipa Cos. and is a longtime Democratic donor, has been in talks to buy the Enquirer, the New York Times reported.
The tabloid has drawn the scrutiny of federal prosecutors for its ties to President Trump during the 2016 campaign.
Burkle made his fortune in the grocery store industry, where the Enquirer generates much of its revenue.
A spokesman for Burkle denied he was buying the Enquirer.
One former AMI associate said Burkle and AMI Chairman David Pecker are longtime friends.
"The million-dollar question is, what does Burkle get out of it?" said Stu Zakim, a spokesman for AMI from 2004 to 2006. "He's either bailing out his friend or will shut it down and license the hell out of the assets."
Burkle is known for scooping up struggling businesses, such as the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team, which he acquired out of bankruptcy in 1999.
He has made several attempts over the years to buy media companies. In 2006, Burkle's Yucaipa failed to buy 12 Knight Ridder papers, including the San Jose Mercury News, the Monterey County Herald and the Contra Costa Times.
A year later, Burkle teamed with fellow billionaire Eli Broad to bid on Tribune Co., the owner of the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers. The Tribune board eventually sold the company to Chicago real estate investor Sam Zell.
Also in 2007, Burkle paid $1.2 billion for 76 specialty magazines and their websites from Primedia Inc., including Motor Trend and Surfer.
More recently, Yucaipa and Lantern Capital joined forces in 2018 to buy Weinstein Co. for $500 million, but the deal fell apart when it was blocked by the New York attorney general's office.
AMI's decision to sell comes on the heels of the Jeff Bezos scandal in which the Amazon founder accused the Enquirer of extortion using leaked text messages and naked photos that the publication had obtained. Bezos claimed that the Enquirer was threatening him after he attempted to investigate the publication over its earlier articles about his extramarital affair with TV host Lauren Sanchez.
Though the Enquirer has long had a reputation for using questionable tactics to score celebrity scoops, the Bezos scandal put a new spotlight on Pecker, a former accountant who took over the company in 1999. The salacious scandal was instantly politicized.
Pecker has been a longtime friend of Trump and has admitted employing catch-and-kill techniques to protect Trump from unfavorable stories. American Media paid $150,000 to buy a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump.
Since taking office, Trump has become a frequent antagonist of Bezos, mostly for his ownership of the Washington Post, which has aggressively pursued negative stories about the Trump administration.
Pecker now faces scrutiny from an internal AMI investigation into the Bezos leaks as well as from a federal probe into whether the company breached an immunity deal it had struck with federal investigators who were investigating Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer.
Cohen said Trump ordered him to arrange hush money payments to two women who had affairs with him years ago. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, among other crimes, because the payments were intended to influence the campaign and were not properly disclosed. AMI has denied wrongdoing.
On Wednesday, Pecker said that AMI is looking to refocus its energies on different brands.
"We have been keenly focused on leveraging the popularity of our celebrity glossy, teen and active lifestyle brands while developing new and robust platforms including broadcast and audio programming, and a live events business, that now deliver significant revenue streams," Pecker said in the company release. "Because of this focus, we feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership."
AMI owns the celebrity gossip magazines Us Weekly, Star, OK!, In Touch and Life & Style.
It also owns men's health properties including Men's Journal and Muscle & Fitness. AMI acquired full ownership of the Mr. Olympia competition in 2017.
Like many print publications, the Enquirer has been struggling with declining circulation and has experienced staff cuts.
AMI is believed to be carrying substantial debt, which some reports peg as high as $1 billion. Private equity firm Chatham Asset Management acquired a majority stake in AMI in 2014, when the publisher was struggling to emerge from a 2010 bankruptcy.
Its investors have included California's public pension fund, CalPERS.
The decision to unload the Enquirer hasn't come as a surprise to some people familiar with the company.
"This is not a shock," Zakim said. "They weren't making money and there was this embarrassment. That's a tough combo to beat."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed ­David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil and agribusiness industries, as secretary of the interior. The confirmation of Bernhardt coincided with calls from more than a dozen Democrats and government watchdogs for formal investigations into his past conduct.
Senators voted, 56-41, largely along party lines, in favor of Bernhardt's confirmation. Three Democrats — Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee; Krysten Sinema of Arizona; and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico — supported Bernhardt, as did one independent, Angus King of Maine.
Bernhardt was the deputy to Trump's first interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who resigned this year amid allegations of ethical misconduct.
At least eight senators, all Democrats, and four government ethics watchdog groups have requested the Interior Department's inspector general open formal investigations into various aspects of Bernhardt's conduct. Separately, government watchdog groups have requested the US attorney's office investigate whether Bernhardt may have committed civil or criminal violations before he joined the Trump administration.
The National Ocean Industries Association, a lobbying organization for offshore drilling companies, including many of Bernhardt's former clients, cheered his confirmation.
NEW YORK TIMES
Markey introduces bill on airline safety
Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced legislation Thursday that would bar aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing from charging additional fees for safety equipment carriers may want, but that the companies consider optional.
"For Boeing, safety features that could have saved 346 lives on two of their 737 Max 8s were yet another profit center, deemed optional like premium seats, extra bathrooms, or fancy lighting," Markey said. "Aviation safety cannot be a luxury that is bought and sold for an extra fee, but a standard part of our fleets, ingrained in every bolt, sensor, and line of code on an aircraft. The 'Safety is Not for Sale Act' will ensure that all safety-enhancing equipment is never sold as a la carte add-ons."
The legislation would require air carriers to adopt additional safety features and ensure all non-required safety enhancing equipment is offered or provided to carriers without an additional charge.
Preliminary investigations into the crash of a Lion Air jet in October and an Ethiopian Airlines crash last month, indicated that an automated anti-stall system, known as MCAS, may have been triggered by faulty data from an angle-of-attack sensor.
Once engaged, the automated system pushed the planes' noses downward, as pilots fought to gain altitude and control of the planes.
Boeing offered two instruments designed to alert pilots to possible malfunctions of those sensors, an angle-of-attack indicator and a warning light, but charged an extra fee to carriers who wanted them. Neither the Lion Air jet, that crashed into the Java Sea in Indonesia on Oct. 29, killing all 189 on board, or the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed March 10, killing all 157 people aboard, were equipped with the instruments. The Federal Aviation Administration also did not require the instruments on the 737 Max jets.
But in the wake of the two crashes in the span of five months, Boeing said it would offer both options free.

Obama administation lawyer indicted in Ukraine probe
WASHINGTON — Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel during the administration of Barack Obama, was charged Thursday with lying to the Justice Department and concealing information about work he did in 2012 for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.
The indictment of Craig, 74, stemmed from an investigationthat was initiated by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller.
An Ivy League-educated lawyer who held prominent positions in the administrations of President Clinton and President Obama, Craig becomes the first person associated with the Democratic Party to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel's investigation.
Before the indictment, Craig's lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mueller's team referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to foreign lobbying laws, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was moved in January to Washington.
While the charges stem from the Justice Department's decision to crack down on illegal foreign lobbying, the government did not accuse Craig of violating foreign lobbying laws.
NEW YORK TIMES
Trump's sister retires from federal judgeship
NEW YORK — President Trump's sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes.
The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.
The April 1 order said Barry's voluntary Feb. 11 retirement ends the review stemming from claims.
The order said the complaint process was meant to correct conditions interfering with the "effective and expeditious" administration of court business. It said the resignation meant that Barry, 82, can no longer perform any judicial duties and thus can no longer be investigated.

Texto completo: Brown President Nixes Israel Divestment Referendum That Students Approved
ALTHOUGH 69 PERCENT of Brown University students voting in campus elections March 22 supported an undergraduate student referendum asking the institution to divest from companies conducting business with Israel, President Christina Paxson said she won't act on it, JTA reported.
"Brown's endowment is not a political instrument to be used to express views on complex social and political issues, especially those over which thoughtful and intelligent people vehemently disagree," Paxson said in a statement. "As a university, Brown's mission is to advance knowledge and understanding through research, analysis and debate. Its role is not to take sides on contested geopolitical issues.
"I have been steadfast in my view that Brown should not embrace any of the planks of the BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) movement," she added.
Bill Banning Yarmulkes, Religious Symbols at Work Introduced in Quebec
Some public employees wouldn't be able to wear religious symbols - including yarmulkes - at work under a bill introduced in Quebec, JTA reported.
The bill, which was introduced by the coalition government of Premier Francois Legault, is designed to enforce the separation of church and state, although critics say Muslim women who wear hijabs may be its main target.
Yarmulkes, hijabs, Sikh turbans and crucifixes would be prohibited under the bill.
Jewish organizations have expressed worries about the legislation.
"We are very concerned with the new Quebec government's statements regarding a ban on religious symbols displayed by government officials and displayed in public institutions," said Harvey Levine, the Quebec regional director of B'nai B'rith. "We call on the [Quebec government] to avoid the slippery slope of diminishing fundamental rights and work instead to secure religious liberties for all Quebecers."
Billboard Accuses New York Times of Being Anti-Israel in Its Coverage
The New York Times is accused in a billboard outside its offices of stirring anti-Israel sentiment with its reporting, JNS.org reported.
The billboard was posted by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA).
The billboard includes an image of a Molotov cocktail. Its wick is lit with a burning Times article entitled "Israel Bulldozes Democracy." Around the image are the words "While Hamas firebombs Israel ... The New York Times inflames with biased coverage."
"One meaning is, obviously, to remind Times staff that Hamas is violent," CAMERA Executive Director Andrea Levin said. "The Times absolutely needs this reminder because far too often their reporters ignore Hamas' violent theocracy in the Gaza Strip."
Song on New Vampire Weekend Album Refers to Founding of Israel
Vampire Weekend's new album on May 3 will feature a song called "Jerusalem, New York, Berlin" that refers to the Balfour Declaration that led to Israel's founding, The Sunday Times reported.
Singer Ezra Koenig spoke about his Jewish identity in the article.
"[Ajnyone with a brain can see people, both Jewish and non-Jewish, cynically using the charge of anti-Semitism in both England and the States," he said. "And that doesn't mean there isn't anti-Semitism - it just means Jewish identity is increasingly fraught."
The band's previous album included a Koenigwritten song about an Orthodox Jewish girl falling in love with an Arab falafel shop worker.

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Texto completo: Three sexual assault victims are accusing Uber of failing to warn them that predators posing as drivers were targeting young women leaving Los Angeles nightclubs, casting a growing cloud over the ride-sharing firm as it prepares to follow rival Lyft into publicly-traded stock markets.

The San Francisco-based company's inaction left them "vulnerable sitting ducks," the women said in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court that argued the firm was made aware of the risk of fake drivers as early as 2016.

The allegations follow the killing of a University of South Carolina student, Samantha Josephson, who police believe called an Uber for a ride home, then got into the wrong vehicle. Its driver has been charged with murder, prompting a nationwide safety campaign for ride-share users to take precautions.

Last year, eight members of Congress inquired about Uber's safety standards and those of four other ride-sharing firms following a CNN report that 103 Uber and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexually abusing or assaulting passengers over a four-year period.

The assault victims suing Uber now said Los Angeles police contacted the company numerous times, warning that sexual predators were posing as ride-share drivers to lure women into their vehicles, then sexually assaulting them.

Uber, the women said, had “specialized and superior knowledge” of the tactic, “yet intentionally withheld this information from plaintiffs and did nothing to warn” them.

Two of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they were were abducted and raped by Walter Velasquez in separate incidents in 2017 and 2018 after using Uber's app to call rides when they left nightclubs in West Hollywood. Velasquez was sentenced to eight years in prison in October after a plea deal on allegations he posed as an Uber driver to lure victims.

The third woman alleges she was abducted and raped in December 2017 after she hailed an Uber following a social gathering in Los Angeles, according to court documents. The suspect in that case, Nicolas Morales of Santa Clarita, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial, according to court records.

The woman said her driver looked similar to the picture displayed in the Uber app but noted the vehicle's license plate did not match. The driver then told the woman he crashed his car and hadn’t updated the app, according to court documents. After the woman got in, her real Uber driver called, became irritated that she entered the wrong car and hung up on her, the woman said.

The lawsuit accuses the ride-sharing company of placing “profits over safety by deliberately failing to implement any warning system regarding this sexual assault scheme so as to rapidly expand its profits and not deter any potential users.”

“This is a calculated decision by senior executives to allow Uber defendants to attempt to dominate the rideshare market at the expense of public safety,” the women said.

Uber, which has 75 million riders worldwide and 3 million drivers, estimates a $100 billion valuation in its initial stock offering, according to the New York Times. Details were expected in a filing on Thursday.

In a statement, the company highlighted a national campaign begun in 2017 that reminded riders to check the information displayed in its app — which includes the driver's name as well as the vehicle's model, make, and license number — to ensure they get into the right vehicle. The reminders, the company said, "have been part of our safety tips, and our law enforcement team regularly discusses this issue with agencies across the country.”

"We have been working with local law enforcement, including the LAPD, to educate the public about how to avoid fake ride-share drivers for several years," the company said.

Uber and similar ride-sharing services such as Lyft have faced heightened scrutiny of their safety standards following the killing of Josephson in late March.

One of Josephson's former classmates started a Change.org petition, urging the companies to add QR codes such as those used on digital movie and concert tickets to the apps so that drivers and riders could match them, that garnered support from 208,000 people by April 11.

The effort joins safety programs such as the #WhatsMyName initiative, backed by the University of South Carolina, which urges riders to verify they're getting into the correct car by asking drivers to identify them first.

Texto completo: LONDON -- The Polish author Olga Tokarczuk could win a second consecutive Man Booker International Prize, arguably the world's most significant award for literature translated into English, after she was shortlisted for the honor on Tuesday. Five of this year's six nominated authors are women.
If Ms. Tokarczuk wins for "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead," an unconventional detective novel that also discusses topics like animal rights and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, it would be an unusual back-to-back victory for a major literary award. She won last year's prize for "Flights," a series of literary vignettes about modern-day travel.
"Flights" was translated by Jennifer Croft, but her new novel was translated from the Polish by Antonia Lloyd-Jones.
The Man Booker International Prize is awarded each year to the best book translated into English and published in Britain or Ireland. It is distinct from the more well-known Booker Prize, for fiction originally published in English, but both carry the same prize money of 50,000 pounds, or about $65,000.
The prize is split equally between author and translator.
"Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead" is about an eccentric woman in her 60s in rural Poland who decides to investigate the murders of members of her local hunting club. Despite being a whodunit, the book caused some controversy among Polish conservatives for its wider discussion of issues like the Catholic Church and environmentalism.
"It will make you want to read everything Tokarczuk has written," Nilanjana Roy wrote in the Financial Times. In The Guardian, the author Sarah Perry said the book "provides an extraordinary display of the qualities that have made Tokarczuk so notable a presence in contemporary literature."
The other shortlisted books, all of which were translated by women, are:
Annie Ernaux's "The Years," an experimental autobiography from the French author, which was also a history of French consumerism. "This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read," Edmund White said in a review for The New York Times. It was translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer.
Marion Poschmann's "The Pine Islands." Originally written in German and translated by Jen Calleja, it is about a lecturer who specializes in the unusual subject of male facial hair in cinema, who flees to Japan and ends up tracing the footsteps of the poet Basho.
"The Shape of the Ruins," by the Colombian author Juan Gabriel Vásquez -- the only man on the shortlist. It focuses on conspiracy theories that surround two political murders in Colombia, with Mr. Vásquez making himself the book's central character. It was translated from the Spanish by Anne McLean.
Alia Trabucco Zerán's debut novel "The Remainder," about three friends in Santiago who take a road trip and end up confronting generations of family pain and the legacy of Chile's dictatorship. Sophie Hughes did the translation from Spanish
"Celestial Bodies" by Jokha Alharthi of Oman. Translated from the Arabic by Marilyn Booth, the novel tells the story of her country's evolution from slavery to skyscrapers through the prism of one family.
The chairwoman of this year's judging panel, the historian and author Bettany Hughes, said in a statement that the shortlist contained "wisdom in all its forms."
"Unexpected and unpredictable narratives compelled us to choose this vigorous shortlist," she added. "Subversive and intellectually ambitious with welcome flashes of wit, each book nourishes creative conversation."
The winner is to be announced on May 21 at a ceremony in London.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: HARTFORD, Conn. -- Charles Van Doren, the dashing young academic whose meteoric rise and fall as a corrupt game show contestant in the 1950s inspired the movie "Quiz Show" and served as a cautionary tale about the staged competitions of early television, has died. He was 93.
He died of natural causes Tuesday at a care center for the elderly in Canaan, Conn., said his son, John Van Doren. Funeral services will be private.
The handsome scion of a prominent literary family, Van Doren was the central figure in the TV game show scandals of the late 1950s and eventually pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to a grand jury that investigated them. He spent the following decades largely out of the public eye.
"It's been hard to get away, partly because the man who cheated on 'Twenty-One' is still part of me," he wrote in a 2008 New Yorker essay, his first public comment in years.
Before his downfall, he was a ratings sensation. He made 14 electrifying appearances on "Twenty-One" in late 1956 and early '57, vanquishing 13 competitors and winning a then-record $129,000. NBC hired him as a commentator.
HR
In a February 1957 cover story on Van Doren, Time magazine marveled at the "fascinating, suspense-taut spectacle of his highly trained mind at work."
"Just by being himself," Time wrote, "he has enabled a giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol -- of all things, an egghead."
Today
Later, as the triumph unraveled into scandal, he initially denied he had been given advance answers, but he finally admitted that the show was rigged.
He retreated to his family's home in rural West Cornwall, Connecticut, after telling a congressional committee in 1959 that he was coached before each segment of the show.
After spending much of the 1960s and '70s in Chicago, Van Doren and his wife, Geraldine, returned to Connecticut, residing for years in a small brown bungalow on the family compound. They did some teaching but largely lived in semi-seclusion, refusing to grant interviews and even leaving the country for several weeks when Robert Redford's film "Quiz Show" was released in the fall of 1994.
Van Doren refused to cooperate in the movie's making and declined to meet with actor Ralph Fiennes, who portrayed him in the film. Fiennes later told People magazine that after Van Doren brushed him off, he knocked on his door pretending to be lost so he could observe Van Doren's movements and speech patterns.
Van Doren broke his silence in 2008, writing an account of his downfall in The New Yorker and how he finally had publicly admitted a half-century earlier that he was "foolish, naive, prideful and avaricious."
"People who knew the entertainment business didn't have much doubt about what was going on, although they didn't speak out," he wrote.
In light of the large profits the rigged game shows were making, he added, "why would they?"
He also disclosed that he eventually did watch "Quiz Show" and laughed at an insulting reference that a character made about him. He said he had been tempted to take a consulting fee from the producers, but his wife talked him out of it.
Shaw
Van Doren's family had a proud literary standing at the time of the scandal. His father, Mark Van Doren, was a critic, biographer and poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940. His uncle, Carl Van Doren, received a Pulitzer in 1939 for a biography of Benjamin Franklin.
Charles Van Doren was himself a rising young academic at Columbia when he became famous on the quiz show. He went on to win $129,000 on the show after defeating Herbert Stempel, a New Yorker portrayed by John Turturro in the movie.
Stempel later went public and said contestants were fed the answers to the questions prior to the show. He said he was told to lose because the show's producers thought Van Doren had star potential.
In 1962, Van Doren and nine other winners from three NBC shows -- "Twenty-One," "Tic-Tac-Dough" and "Hi-Lo" -- pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury that had investigated the scandal. They were spared jail terms by a judge who said the nation's scorn was punishment enough.
Once the scandal broke, Van Doren lost the $50,000-a-year job NBC gave him when he defeated Stempel. He also was dropped from the faculty at Columbia, where his father had been a professor for decades.
Friends said Van Doren's family was shocked by his eventual revelation that he had been given the answers in advance.
Bucky Whitney, a longtime friend, recalled the family's shame.
"His father took it real hard. The old man was never the same after that," Whitney told a reporter who visited Cornwall when "Quiz Show" came out.
Van Doren later joined the Institute for Philosophical Research, a nonprofit Chicago think tank, and worked at Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years. Among his books were "The Idea of Progress," a philosophical work, and "A History of Knowledge; Past, Present, and Future."
Van Doren and his wife had two children, Elizabeth and John.
Maxthegirl
"He was a loving husband and a terrific father, and he's going to be deeply missed," John Van Doren said.
In West Cornwall, neighbors were protective of "Charley," as Van Doren was affectionately known.
Walter DeTheir, the proprietor of a store in Cornwall, said Van Doren was a quiet, shy man who came in regularly to pick up the Sunday New York Times.
"It's not that he isn't friendly, he just doesn't have much to say," DeTheir said.
In his New Yorker piece, Van Doren said he liked to avoid "people who say, 'Aren't you Charles Van Doren?' Well, that's my name, I say to myself, but I'm not who you think I am -- or, at least, I don't want to be."

Paying a high political price McMorris Rodgers walks line with Trump

Texto completo: On Monday, Dec. 12, 2016, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers arrived at Trump Tower in New York City for an interview with the president-elect.
It's not clear whether the congresswoman believed she was about to be named Interior Secretary, but everyone else sure thought so. The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, CNN, the Hill - the Washington, D.C., media had been reporting her likely selection to the Cabinet as a "done deal," in the words of a new book about the Trump transition.
All the reports were based on anonymous sources, presumably affiliated with the transition team.
Environmental groups had already ramped up their opposition.
"Donald Trump just posted a massive 'for sale' sign on our public lands," the League of Conservation voters said in a statement about the presumed nomination two days before McMorris Rodgers' meeting with the president-elect.
But it wasn't a Cabinet post awaiting McMorris Rodgers that day in Trump Tower, as we now know. What she arrived to find - according to "The Hill to Die On" by a pair of Politico journalists - was "a folder of media clippings at the ready, detailing various times McMorris Rodgers had spoken out against him."
In other words, McMorris Rodgers - who has been criticized often, including in this column, as being far too deferential and accepting of the various appalling and alarming aspects of Trumpism - actually paid a high political price for what negative remarks she has made as she walks the tightrope between criticizing and supporting Trump.
She has sometimes challenged the president, but always in a way that tries to eat the cake and have it, too: the bottom line of which was always support, even after Trump mocked a disabled man and bragged about grabbing women.
That did not appear to mollify the famously thin-skinned president. And while the nature of that Trump Tower meeting isn't known in detail, it seems at least possible that she was on the receiving end of a savage, orchestrated comeuppance for her critical comments - something straight out of the score-settling, hardball world of "Veep."
The Trump Tower meeting isn't exactly breaking news. That account does come from a new book, but it was also reported in the Washington Post in December 2016, deep in a long piece about various interactions between Trump and members of Congress. The Spokesman-Review published a story that included a mention of the meeting and an assertion from the Wall Street Journal that McMorris Rodgers would not "walk back" any of her remarks when asked about them by the president.
McMorris Rodgers' office did not want to comment on this column, but it did not take issue with the facts about the visit that were reported.
Still, the anecdote - for all the detail and specificity that it lacks - shines a light on one of the key continuing dynamics for McMorris Rodgers in the Trump presidency. How much can she speak out in defense of decency and still expect to be on the team? It's a question that has continued relevance as she casts votes to oppose the president's attempt to declare a border emergency, for example, while she continues to work with him - productively, she would say - on policy matters for a district that voted for him.
McMorris Rodgers was challenged often on the campaign trail over the perception that she was acquiescent in the face of Trump's manifold offenses against decency. As the mother of a child with Down syndrome, she spoke up when Trump crudely mocked a disabled reporter - while still trying to stay on the Trump train. When the Access Hollywood tape emerged, she did much the same. On issue after issue, before and after the election - from ag tariffs to family separations - she has tried to walk that line, starting with her public statement about why she had decided to vote for Trump.
"I vehemently disagree with such statements," she wrote at the time. "They are wrong in a presidential campaign; in our workplaces; in our homes; and anywhere else. I've called him out before, and I won't be shy if he does it again because he owes it to our party and our country to treat everyone respectfully and to build an inclusive coalition."
She said her support was "not exactly" enthusiastic. But still, she viewed Trump as potentially a positive force for the country, and the best choice for president.
That fence-straddling has never worked for her critics and those who oppose Trump, who may have underestimated the degree to which she has shown at least a smidgen of backbone.
But what the little nugget about the Trump Tower meeting shows is that it didn't really work for the president, either.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Ga. - Golf fans at the Masters are more polite than a teenager getting pulled over by the cops.
They roared for Rory McIlroy after he was nearly disqualified in 2009 over a possible rules violation in a bunker. They cheered for Tiger Woods in 2010 while a plane flew overhead with a banner reading: "TIGER: DID YOU MEAN BOOTYISM?"
It's an easy audience, a just-happy-to-be-here crowd that craves little more than birdies and barbecue sandwiches.
Yet when Patrick Reed won the Masters last year, the gallery around No. 18 responded with yawns and a golf clap. It's as if the spectators forgot that Reed was a Ryder Cup hero nicknamed "Captain America" - or that he led Augusta State, the school down the road, to national titles in 2010 and 2011.
Actually, they knew all too well about Reed's past, which includes accusations of cheating during a college tournament and stealing from teammates at Georgia, his original college, and his estrangement from his family, who live six miles from Augusta National but were not welcome on the course.
The crowd instead pulled for Jordan Spieth, who threatened to break the Masters record for greatest Sunday comeback; Rickie Fowler, whose 14-under total fell one shot shy; and McIlroy, who fumbled his chance for a career Grand Slam.
Reed noticed that McIlroy, his playing partner, got a louder ovation when they were introduced on the first tee.
"That played into my hand," Reed said last year on Sunday. "Fueled my fire."
Reed returns to Augusta National this week lighter - yet with similar baggage.
He looks great in his green jacket, having shed a dozen pounds.
"The reason I lost a little is because of tonight," he joked Tuesday, referring to his Champions Dinner menu of ribeye steak and sides such as creamed spinach and mac and cheese. "I need to leave a little room to be able to fit back into it."
But the baggage is such that Reed hasn't won a tournament since leaving the grounds last year. He chose to air some dirty laundry after the United States got thumped in the Ryder Cup, piling on captain Jim Furyk and his downtrodden teammates. And he told the New York Times he "wouldn't at all be surprised" if alienated family members show up to watch him this week.
Reed's security detail asked to have his father, Bill, removed from the 2014 U.S. Open at Pinehurst, with a USGA official telling the Times that Bill's badge was taken away after he made "intimidating movements" toward Reed's wife, Justine. (The Reeds have declined to comment.)
Patrick's father and sister, Hannah, traveled to Paris to watch the Ryder Cup. And they will be allowed on the Augusta National grounds if they choose, as long as they follow the rules of etiquette in the tournament spectator guide: Do not cheer a player's misfortune.
Asked on Tuesday if it's important to be well-liked by the Masters spectators, Reed sidestepped, saying: "I feel like I have a lot of fans around here. One great thing about the sport we play is that a lot of the fans respect great golf."
Reed, 28, is famously cocky, calling himself "one of the top five players in the world" when he was 23. He had yet to even play in a major. He rose to 11th after winning the Masters - three spots off his best - and enters this week 18th.
The odds of him becoming the first defending Masters champion to win since Woods in 2002 are 50-1, via BetOnline.ag. There are 23 players with a better shot, according to the books.
Reed's last four results were a tie for 24th in the WGC Match Play, a missed cut at Tampa, a T-47 in the Players Championship and a T-50 at Bay Hill.
That doesn't bode well. But Reed believes it's harder to win a first Masters than a second.
"Once you get over that hurdle," he said, "your confidence goes even higher."

Under President Trump, the chaos never ends

Texto completo: Jeb Bush was the Cassandra of the 2016 presidential race. She was the figure in Greek mythology whose gift was being able to foresee the future -- and whose curse was that she would not be believed.
Bush had the most accurate prediction of the campaign, if not of the 21st century. "He's a chaos candidate," he said of Donald Trump in a 2015 debate. "And he'd be a chaos president."
What elicited that accusation was Trump's vow to bar all Muslims from entering the country. Once in office, Trump moved quickly to confirm Bush's gift for prophecy by issuing an executive order blocking travel from seven Muslim-majority nations. International airports in the U.S. were thrown into turmoil, with hundreds of travelers detained, sent back on arrival or intercepted en route.
"The orders prompted massive protests Saturday and Sunday at airports in New York, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Los Angeles and near Washington, D.C.," reported The Wall Street Journal. The headline on that story? "Donald Trump's Immigration Ban Sows Chaos."
Even Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell expressed doubts about the policy. To add to the disarray, the travel ban was blocked by the courts, as was a second version. It took three tries for the administration to come up with one that didn't obviously violate the Constitution, though it is still under legal challenge.
But what would have been a low point for most administrations was just the beginning of the nonstop upheaval that has marked Trump's tenure. His sole talent is to upend normal, sensible ways of governing for no discernible purpose.
His addiction to upheaval is lately manifest in his firing of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, his withdrawal of the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to be head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and his dismissal of Secret Service Director Randolph Alles.
L. Francis Cissna, head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, is also expected to get the boot.
All these departures occur in the middle of what the president portrays as a grave national emergency at the Mexico border. The Department of Homeland Security will have to function with an acting secretary, current Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan.
Reported in The New York Times: "The latest departures, along with previous vacancies, will leave the Department of Homeland Security without a permanent secretary, deputy secretary, two under secretaries, Secret Service director, Federal Emergency Management Agency director, ICE director, general counsel, citizenship and immigration services director, inspector general, chief financial officer, chief privacy officer and, once Mr. McAleenan moves, Customs and Border Protection commissioner."
The agencies assigned to solve the crisis that Trump sees as paramount will be deprived of leadership. It's the equivalent of fighting a war without generals.
In two years, Trump has already parted ways with 15 Cabinet members, more than George W. Bush and Barack Obama, combined, lost in their 16 years. The attrition rate for his other senior positions is 66 percent, far higher than any recent president's. In this administration, there are two main types of high-level officials: those who choose to leave and those who get fired.
The pattern is an endless refutation of Trump's promise to bring in the best people. Either the people he's gotten rid of were not the best people, or the best people were not good enough for him. Everyone Trump appoints comes with his assurance of how wonderful they are; many of those who depart do so under a cloud of presidential disdain.
A journalist who described Trump's first secretary of state as "dumb as a rock" or his first attorney general as "mentally retarded" would be seen as grossly biased against the president. But it was Trump who flung those insults at Rex Tillerson and Jeff Sessions. What does it say about the president that he chose them?
His supporters contend that a "deep state" within the federal bureaucracy is working to subvert his noble policies. But every time one of his appointees leaves and a new one has to be found and installed, the bureaucracy is left to operate more or less on its own, unconstrained by a boss who has the capacity to put Trump's policies into practice. It would make more sense for Trump to enlist talented leaders and let them do their jobs.
Actions are revealing. When Trump keeps fomenting chaos, even when it prevents him from achieving what he says he wants, we have to conclude that what he really wants is chaos.

Blackouts hobble South Africa as election looms

Texto completo: PHOLA, South Africa - President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa assumed power promising a "new dawn." But just over a year later, he can't keep the nation's lights on.
A month before a national election, the worst rolling blackouts in years are regularly plunging South Africans into the dark. With annoying frequency, warnings of "load-shedding" pop up on cellphones, referring to the power cuts imposed to prevent a collapse of the national electricity grid.
Takeout dinners by candlelight are hastily arranged in the cities. Meals are prepared over coal braziers instead of electricity in places like Phola, a township in a region dotted with power plants, about 75 miles east of Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest city.
"You wake up and there's no hot water. You can't bathe, you can't iron," said Victoria Nkosi, 48, a longtime resident of a government-built house in Phola. "Why is there load-shedding when we're surrounded by power plants?"
The short answer is that the blackouts are the result of years of mismanagement and corruption in the state-owned utility, Eskom. They are also evidence of how difficult it is for Ramaphosa to reform the nation's state enterprises and secure stable electricity for South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa's most advanced economy.
The blackouts are contributing to another year of lackluster economic growth in South Africa, a deeply unequal society that desperately needs strong, sustained expansion to create the foundations of a post-apartheid economy.
Every sector of the economy, from the mining giants and car dealers to big retailers and informal entrepreneurs, has been hit badly by the blackouts. Eskom, which produces about 95 percent of the nation's power, is now regarded as the biggest risk to South Africa's economy, according to the national Treasury and outside financial experts.
In Phola, Frieda Madalane, 54, wakes up just after midnight to start cooking fried dough bread, called vetkoek. Starting before dawn, she sells the bread outside her home to neighbors going to work, making about $20 a day.
But her profits are now reduced by the amount she spends for kerosene to fuel the lamp she uses during load-shedding.
"And one time, there was load-shedding for one full day and I lost everything in my refrigerator," Madalane said.
On May 8, South Africans are scheduled to cast ballots in the sixth general election since the end of apartheid in 1994. The long-governing African National Congress is expected to garner the most votes, but its margin of victory remains the biggest uncertainty.
A strong showing could give Ramaphosa a mandate to carry out reforms in his party and in government, his allies say. But a poor performance could lead to a continuing standoff between Ramaphosa and his party rivals, or even fuel an outright challenge, party officials and political analysts say.
A main cause of the recent blackouts, experts say, is two new but under-performing coal-fired megaplants. Years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, the two plants had been expected to relieve stress from South Africa's aging power infrastructure.
But the plants, which have yet to be completed, are only partially operational because of frequent breakdowns - the result of shoddy construction, experts say.

Texto completo: Once again, PBS/13 last week presented Ken Burns' 2012 documentary on the Central Park jogger called "The Central Park Five." Once again, NYPD Confidential will tell you how Burns told only part of the story.
Burns is one of the nation's premier documentarians, and it's unclear why he chose to ignore certain facts in his Central Park jogger documentary.
The jogger, a white female, was raped and beaten unconscious in Central Park in April 1989. Five teens - four black and one Hispanic - were quickly arrested. Police maintained that the five, ages 14 to 16, were among 40 youths roaming the park who had assaulted a homeless man, a male teacher and a couple on a tandem bike. They were picked up near where the jogger was found unconscious and barely alive.
The five confessed to beating people in the park and having beaten the jogger, and implicated each other in her rape, though each denied having raped her. Based solely on that evidence - no DNA or anything else was found linking any of them to the rape - they were convicted and sent to prison. Then in 2002, 13 years after the attack, Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer serving a life sentence, confessed that he alone had raped the jogger. His DNA matched that found at the crime scene.
By then, the Central Park Five, as they came to be known, had completed their sentences, which were vacated. Under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the city settled their lawsuit, awarding them a $40 million. As mayor, Michael Bloomberg had refused to settle this or virtually any high-profile lawsuits involving the police.
Meanwhile, the NYPD conducted an investigation. Led by Michael Armstrong, who had served as counsel to the Knapp Commission on police corruption 30 years before, the probe concluded that it was "more likely than not" that the five teenagers had subjected the jogger to some sort of "hit and run" attack, consistent with their other activities that night.
However, Burns presents them as Little Lord Fauntleroys. He glides over a point made by his narrator, New York Times columnist Jim Dwyer, that even if they did not rape the jogger, the five were hardly innocents.
Burns also ignored the entreaties of Armstrong. "I agreed to be questioned on camera, and some months later went to Burns' studio, where I spent a full afternoon in a taped question-and-answer session, Armstrong told NYPD Confidential. "A few months after that, Burns called me to say that they were not going to go into the matters about which I had been questioned, so they wouldn't be using the footage of my interview. He thanked me for my help."

No fear of 'God' here; CBS show gets another season

Texto completo: Q: I am writing about this great show "God Friended Me." I find it very refreshing and it covers many facets of humanity with a diverse cast, all while talking about doing good by helping others. I hope this program goes on for a long time. It is so uplifting.
A: The drama will have its first season finale on April 14, but don't worry. It has been renewed for a second season. "It's one of the top three new series on television, has improved its time period significantly, and continues a long tradition of prestige dramas for CBS on (Sunday) night," said Kelly Kahl, president of CBS Entertainment, in the renewal announcement.

Q: Do you know if "Southern Charm" is coming back on Bravo? Being from Savannah and Charleston I sure liked the shows set there. There was a little too much bickering sometimes, but no more than on all those "Real Housewives" shows.
A: Bravo will offer a sixth season of "Southern Charm" and the Charleston, S.C., cast beginning May 15. According to the network, returning cast members will include Craig Conover, Kathryn Dennis, Cameran Eubanks, Austen Kroll, Chelsea Meissner and Shep Rose. Former star Thomas Ravenel, who is also Kathryn's ex, will not be in this season. He has reportedly said that being on "Southern Charm" was "the worst mistake of my life."
New to the cast are Naomie Olindo and Eliza Limehouse. Storylines include Kathryn hoping to rise in the social hierarchy, Cameran working on a work-life balance, Craig hiring a personal assistant, and Shep getting a new dog.

Q: Please explain the tagline "Bocca-Book Bocca-Boom" (or however it is spelled) for Choice Hotels TV commercials. No one I know has a clue what it means or the origin.
A: According to the hotel chain, the phrase is "Badda Book. Badda Boom." The slogan draws on the expression "bada bing, bada boom," which as the Oxford English Dictionary notes, refers to something happening suddenly or easily. The OED has references to the original phrase going back more than 50 years; the most famous uses of the term are likely those in mob chronicles such as "The Sopranos" (where the topless club was called Bada Bing) and "The Godfather." A Choice Hotels news release said its slogan indicates "there's an easy way to plan and book hotel stays and find the lowest hotel rates guaranteed."

Q: We were in Morocco from 1970 to 1973 when my husband was in the Navy. At that time, the king of Morocco was King Hassan. His wife was Latifa, which would make her Queen Latifa. I wonder if the American actress/singer chose her name, Queen Latifa, from the former Moroccan queen?
A: A New York Times profile of Queen Latifah (with an h, unlike the common spelling of the Moroccan royal) says the former Dana Owens "named herself Latifah as a child, after learning it was Arabic for 'delicate, sensitive and kind.' " I have not seen an account connecting her naming to the Moroccans. By the way, when Hassan died in 1999, the Times said his widow was "a commoner who is officially described as the Mother of the Royal Children." Several sources have called her a princess instead of a queen.

Texto completo: A year after one of the most critically lauded festival performances in recent pop history, Beychella is coming to Netflix.
"Homecoming," teased by the streaming service as "a film by Beyoncé," will be available on April 17, according to a trailer released Monday, which shows concert footage and backstage preparations from the singer's headlining performance at Coachella last year.
The documentary will provide an "intimate, in-depth look" at the concert, revealing "the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement," Netflix said.
[Video: A preview of the film. Watch on YouTube.]
The nearly two-hour show at the Empire Polo Club in California featured dozens of musicians backing Beyoncé in the style of historically black college marching bands and traced "a lineage of Southern black musical traditions from New Orleans second line marches to Houston's chopped-and-screwed hip-hop," said the critic Jon Caramanica in The New York Times.
"There's not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon," he wrote. "It was rich with history, potently political and visually grand. By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction."

Beyoncé had been scheduled to headline the festival in 2017, but pushed her performance back a year after becoming pregnant with twins. "Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella," she told the crowd at her comeback show.
The trailer for "Homecoming" features clips from rehearsals and Beyoncé's workout routine, in addition to moments with her children and husband, the rapper Jay-Z, who made a cameo appearance at Coachella. Using a 2013 interview with the poet and activist Maya Angelou, not long before her death the next year, a voice-over on the trailer says, "What I really wanted to do is be a representative of my race -- of the human race."
"I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be," Angelou continues. "I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. And I know that when I finish doing what I'm sent here to do, I will be called home."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: "I always loved farming, even when I was chopping and picking cotton. That was the making of who I am," she said of her youth in the fields and early exposure to exploitation. "When I was growing up and seeing those things happen, I was like, 'That's not gonna be me.'"
Everlyn Bryant
Though neither Joe nor Everlyn Bryant knew it the day they met in the late '70s, while working on the railroad in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, the future husband and wife had both grown up farming.
Joe Bryant Jr., now 78, had come of age farming with his dad, on land the family owned or leased, from the time he was 16 until he graduated from college. Joe Jr. then taught agriculture classes before going to work for the railroad.
Everlyn, meanwhile, had started farm work much younger, as a 10-year-old member of a family of laborers who neither owned nor leased land. Unlike her brothers and sisters, 71-year-old Everlyn said, "I always loved farming, even when I was chopping and picking cotton."
Where Joe Jr. grew up dedicated to his family-owned farm, Everlyn credits farm work with instilling her sense of determination. "That was the making of who I am," she said of her youth in the fields and early exposure to exploitation. "When I was growing up and seeing those things happen, I was like, 'That's not gonna be me.'"
Decades later, the couple had grown Joe Sr.'s farm from 250 acres to 2,500 — a scale of operation that only 1% of black farm operators reach, according to the most recently available Census of Agriculture figures.
But five years ago, the family faced a financial crisis after two consecutive years of farming soybeans that they say produced an inexplicably small yield, though the Stine Seed Co. seeds they purchased were synonymous with quality.
Unable to make their mortgage payment, the Bryants said they sold or stopped leasing more than 1,500 acres of land in 2014.
The problem with their yield, the Bryants say, is that the seeds they received were not the high-quality Stine seeds they ordered. And, the Bryants are not the only ones to make that claim, as of a federal civil suit filed in April 2018 against Stine and certain employees and affiliates.
Pitting a collaborative of five black farmers from Tennessee and Mississippi against Stine — a privately held company that Bloomberg valued at $2.9 billion in 2016 — a legal battle has been waging over soybean seeds a Stine representative sold the farmers, whose suit alleges fraud and discrimination. After meeting the representative at a trade show in Memphis in 2017, the farmers ordered certified, genetically modified Stine seeds but were instead given an inferior substitute, they allege.
Since news of the suit first made a splash in July 2018, the Iowa-based company has asserted the farmers' allegations have no merit. In a statement, company President Myron Stine vowed to fight for the suit's dismissal, while "continuing to serve all our customers with the highest degree of integrity and respect." Stine describes itself as the largest independent seed producer in the nation.
"I'm amazed when I sit in court and listen to Stine, and they don't want to take any responsibility," Everlyn said.
Low yields The pair married in 1979 and soon returned to farming full time. As the farm grew, Joe Jr.'s son from a previous marriage, Joe Bryant III — who goes by Joe Three — grew up alongside it, able to run a combine harvester from the time he was 12.
From 2010 to 2011, the farm took the hit that forced the family to sell hundreds of acres. Their soybean fields yielded 10 bushels per acre, instead of the previous yield of 40 bushels per acre, the younger Joe Bryant declared in a sworn statement.
The Bryants say the only thing different were the seeds used, purchased from Bryan Cornelius, a local sales representative for Stine, who declined to comment.
"I'm still farming. I never had it happen to me again and never before," said Joe Three, now 52 years old. "I did everything I was supposed to do. And then you're like, well, what did I do wrong?"
That question dissipated with the news of the lawsuit against Stine, filed by farmers affiliated with the Memphis-based Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, one of three distinct, multi-state organizations that support black farmers.
The details of the case resonated with the Bryants. One farmer said that the fields in Mississippi, where he planted the Stine seeds, yielded 24 to 25 bushels per acre, whereas fields where he planted a different soybean seed yielded approximately 48 bushels per acre. Another farmer said that some of his Stine fields yielded 35 bushels per acre or less — but in one 120-acre field, the yield was as low as 5 bushels per acre, the lawsuit alleges.
The Stine soybean suit When Joe Three attempted to join the suit, a lawyer for Stine filed an opposing motion, writing, "Mr. Bryant's allegations have nothing in common with Plaintiff's implausible seed-swapping scheme allegations."
Since President Myron Stine's initial statement, the company has decried the suit as baseless. "Stine takes seriously any allegations of unlawful, improper, or discriminatory conduct and is disturbed by the baseless allegations leveled against the company. Upon learning of these claims, the company took swift action to conduct an internal investigation, which has not revealed any evidence that would support these allegations," Stine wrote in a July 2018 statement.
In their complaint, the farmers highlight the results of a germination test performed by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture on seeds they submitted, which, at zero percent germination, did not match the germination rate of the certified seeds ordered. They also argued that the reluctance of a Stine agronomist to take samples from their fields for testing, while visiting the farm and remarking on their "yield problem," was suspect.
Those points remain unaddressed by lawyers for Stine because they were granted a motion extending the amount of time in which they were required to file an answer. The parties were since ordered into mediation and agreed to cease commenting on the case in the final weeks of talks.
Before that, the president of the Memphis farmers group, Thomas Burrell, said compensation was a matter of survival. "Farming is like any other business. Having inferior seeds guarantees that you're gonna lose," he said. And when yields are low, Burrell said, "you won't be able to service the debt for that $300,000 tractor. You won't be able to pay the rent."
When mediation was ordered, Burrell hailed the development as "one more step forward," referencing a historic class-action lawsuit filed by black farmers in 1999 that saw the U.S. Department of Agriculture admit discrimination and pay the largest settlement in U.S. history.
Burrell's related efforts have been highlighted by the media and subjected to scrutiny. A 2013 report by The New York Times, which does not attribute the source of its information regarding Burrell, states he solicited fees in exchange for help with discrimination claims. People who had not necessarily farmed and would no longer be eligible for a settlement, given filing deadlines, were encouraged to file, the report said.
In a case that sought to change eligibility limits, Burrell's group recently lost its appeal. "The association could not fight cases unless their members pay dues for the association to hire attorneys," Patricia Rogers, spokeswoman for the group, said, adding that dues also pay for an office and staff. Burrell was not available amid mediation, she said.
Restitution Everlyn retired from farm life in 2013, and Joe Three says he'd soon like to pass the baton to his son.
For the sake of future farmers, Everlyn hopes the case results in some form of accountability. "No farmer, black or white, should have to go through this," she said.
"We bought them in good faith and was hoping that it would produce a good crop," Everlyn said of the seeds. "We'll deal with it if they don't make any restitution at all. But we hope that they do."

Texto completo: No fue una sorpresa en Washington la salida de la encargada de implementar las duras políticas migratorias de Donald Trump.
Kirstjen Nielsen, quien estuvo al mando de la política de cero tolerancia en la frontera renunció hoy a la dirección del DHS.
La titular de la cartera de Seguridad Nacional abandonó este domingo el gabinete de Trump después de que éste le hubiera reclamado en público y en privado una mayor dureza en materia migrator ia, aunque sus labores hayan sido criticadas por defensores de derechos humanos en el país.
Nielsen fue la encargada de poner en marcha una agresiva política migratoria abanderada por Trump que ha incluido la separación de familias de inmigrantes con menores cuando cruzaban la frontera con México irregularmente durante meses, un veto migratorio contra países de mayoría musulmana y regulaciones para limitar el asilo en el límite con México.
Sin duda, una de las mayores sombras que quedará en el legado de Nielsen serán los llantos y lamentos desesperados que fueron grabados a los niños inmigrantes separados de sus padres cuando estos estaban detenidos en celdas.
Sin embargo, el desempeño de estas tareas no ha saciado las demandas de Trump de una mayor rigidez en temas migratorios, lo que ha generado múltiples desencuentros internos entre ambos que han sido recogidos por medios locales.
La secretaria saliente fue nominada para dirigir el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) en octubre de 2017 para convertirse en la tercera persona en hacerlo bajo la batuta de Trump, tras el paso del general John Kelly y de la secretaria interina Elaine Duke.
Precisamente, hasta ese momento, Nielsen había sido la jefa de gabinete de Kelly hasta que éste se convirtió en el jefe de Gabinete del presidente.
El general había sido hasta su salida a mediados de diciembre el principal defensor de Nielsen en la Casa Blanca.
Nielsen, una experta en ciberseguridad y gestión de desastres que formó parte del consejo de seguridad nacional durante el Gobierno de George W. Bush (2001-2009), comenzó a trabajar con Kelly a finales de 2016, cuando se encargó de preparar al general, nominado entonces como jefe de DHS, para sus audiencias de confirmación en el Senado.
Kelly quedó entonces impresionado por la dedicación de Nielsen, que tras contagiarse de una severa gripe tosió tanto que se rompió una costilla, y en lugar de tomarse una baja, se vendó el torso y siguió trabajando al mismo ritmo, según la revista Politico.
Dentro del Gobierno de Bush, al que entró en 2004, Nielsen trabajó en la Administración de Transporte y Seguridad (TSA), que depende de DHS.
Graduada en derecho por la Universidad de Virginia y en servicio exterior por la Universidad de Georgetown, Nielsen creó la década pasada su propia consultoría de gestión de riesgos y trabajó en un centro de estudios sobre seguridad nacional y cibernética; estuvo ligada a esta entre 2012 y 2016.
Fue su cercana relación con Kelly la que elevó a Nielsen a la Casa Blanca, donde se convirtió en jefa adjunta de gabinete y aplicó una marcada rigidez.
La escasa tolerancia de Nielsen por las luchas internas de asesores presidenciales se reflejó en su costumbre de cancelar las reuniones con altos funcionarios de la Casa Blanca si alguien llegaba tarde a reuniones y en su minucioso control de la agenda de Kelly.
La disciplina militar implicó que se ganara entre algunos el mote de “enfermera Ratched”, el autoritario personaje de la novela y película “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, mientras que, según el diario The New York Times, otros se refieren a ella como Joseph Ratzinger, el cardenal que pasaría a ser el papa Benedicto XVI.

WHY THE BIG EXTENSIONS ARE MLB'S LATEST CRAZE

Texto completo: Free agency used to represent a player's greatest leverage in baseball, his mightiest bargaining chip. Now it's looking like his biggest fear. Put another way, it's something that's best avoided if at all possible.
How else can we explain the sport's recent contract-extension craze?
Using Clayton Kershaw as the starting point - the Dodgers' ace re-upped on Nov. 2 for three years and $93 million - a total of 30 players with varying service time signed extensions worth  a combined $2.2 billion.
Those are players who chose to double-down with their current teams and, in many cases, pass on the opportunity to hit the open market in the very near future.
Nolan Arenado (eight years, $260 million), Paul Goldschmidt (five years, $130 million), Justin Verlander (two years, $66 million), Chris Sale (five years, $145 million) and Xander Bogaerts (six years, $120 million) were supposed to be the elite of next winter's free-agent class, a mere season away from auctioning off their services to the highest bidder.
Yet they decided to stay home. Free agency? No, thanks.
Everyone around the game watched with great interest as the long winter felt even longer for the two marquee free agents, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado. Both ultimately got what they wanted financially, with Harper's 13-year, $330 million haul and Machado's 10-year, $300 million contract. But listening to them afterward, it certainly didn't sound as if each wound up with his first choice in terms of destination.
Seeing both of those negotiations play out apparently had an effect on Mike Trout, universally regarded as the sport's top player and a two-time MVP who was only two years away from free agency himself. Realizing he was perfectly happy in Southern California, Trout simply decided to get fabulously wealthy right where he was in accepting a 12-year, $430 million deal from the Angels.
"I kind of saw what Bryce and Manny went through and it drew a red flag for me," Trout said at the news conference to announce the deal. "I talked to Manny and Bryce. It was a tough couple months in the offseason. They put it in perspective in my mind. I obviously want to be an Angel for life. That was a big key."
Locking up players such as Arenado, Trout and Jacob deGrom isn't the surprising part of this recent phenomenon, however. It's the younger players at the other end of the spectrum, such as 21-year-old Ronald Acuña Jr. - last year's National League Rookie of the Year - accepting an eight-year, $100 million extension from the Braves. It was a record for a player his age and a huge leap to sign away his free agency until he's 30. By comparison, Trout is 27. Harper and Machado are 26.
Cash in hand seems like the way to go now, with players preferring not to gamble on the sport's volatile economic system in the years ahead. The Astros' Alex Bregman, who at age 24 finished fifth in the MVP voting last year, signed a five-year, $100 million extension last month. The White Sox secured top outfield prospect Eloy Jimenez, 22, with a six-year, $43 million deal before he even played in a major-league game.
The teams and the players appear to be hedging their bets, even though we're likely years away from significant economic changes, as the current CBA doesn't expire until December 2021. So with general managers dangling more cash, hoping there are relative bargains to be had with so much uncertainty in the clubhouses, and players now happy to stay put, expect this trend to continue.
"It was two sides wanting to get together and build a winning environment," deGrom said of his own five-year, $137.5 million extension. "That's my goal here, is to win in New York City and play for the Mets for the rest of my career. So we were sitting there with a common goal in mind and trying to figure out a way that worked."
Jake vs. Sale
Speaking of Jacob deGrom and extensions, the Mets' ace and his Red Sox counterpart, Chris Sale, are going to be compared through the span of their new deals, based on the similarities between the two 30-year-old pitchers.
When Sale got his five-year, $145 million extension from Boston, that shaped up to be the road map for deGrom, who is 15 months older but has 581 fewer innings on his resume, the equivalent of almost three seasons.
Only two starts in, the Mets probably are feeling a little better about their investment, as deGrom seems poised to repeat a history-making Cy Young Award-winning season that everyone figures is impossible to duplicate. DeGrom not only tied Bob Gibson with his 26th consecutive quality start but hasn't allowed a run in 13 innings and has struck out 24 with only two walks. It's early, but the average velocities for both his fastball (97.1 mph) and slider (92.8) - according to FanGraphs - are career highs.
Sale, however, hasn't been himself so far. Coming off shoulder issues last season, he struggled on Opening Day - giving up three homers and seven runs to the Mariners in his three-inning start - and his velocity was notably down in his tough-luck April 2 loss to the A's (six innings, one run). Sale's average fastball velo is 91.4 mph, as compared to 95.7 last season.
"He had a long last year," Red Sox pitching coach Dana LeVangie told reporters, according to The Boston Globe. "He's building up to be the guy he wants to be. He started last year similar. We're getting to that point, but just not right now."
Between innings
Coming home from spring training meant a mailbox full of new baseball books, many written by colleagues, so I can verify them as required reading, even if I'm still working on getting through every page myself. These are the ones I currently have in my possession, with more releases scheduled in the near future.
INSIDE THE EMPIRE: The True Power Behind the New York Yankees, by Bob Klapisch and Paul Solotaroff. You may know Klapisch back from his newspaper days chronicling the 1986 Mets, up through the start of the '90s Yankees dynasty to the present, and his detailed, behind-the-pinstriped-curtain reporting brings the current Bronx machinery out into the spotlight, using the 2018 season as the backdrop.
AFTER THE MIRACLE: The Lasting Brotherhood of the '69 Mets, by Art Shamsky and Erik Sherman. The stunning news of Tom Seaver's retirement from public life last month closed a door that Shamsky and a traveling party of his 1969 teammates were the last to open in a visit with The Franchise at his Napa vineyard. This is a snapshot of that journey and a nostalgic return to that magical season.
K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches, by Tyler Kepner. No one celebrates the details of the game quite like Kepner, The New York Times baseball columnist, and for him to deconstruct the sport down to its most crucial yet arcane element - the art of pitching - is like Michelangelo explaining the brush strokes on the Sistine Chapel.
UNWRITTEN: Bat Flips, the Fun Police, and Baseball's New Future, by Danny Knobler. The title says it all for a sport played by a code of conduct that's widely known among those on the field but mostly undocumented. Consider this your handy guide. There's even a chapter titled "The A-Rod Rules (Or Stay Off My Mound)."
THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE: The '69 Mets, New York City, and the Most Astounding Season in Baseball History, by Wayne Coffey. The perfect primer for the 50th anniversary of the Miracle Mets, and Coffey traces the unbelievable path from baseball's laughingstock to arguably New York's greatest - and certainly most improbable - championship team.

Texto completo: I
n a recent interview on CNN, author Rebecca Traister pointed to a large, gaping hole in the history books: Namely, that they have habitually minimized the intensity and the effectiveness of women's anger as a force for social change.
“We've never been taught the story or given the view of women's anger as politically potent," said Traister, whose book “Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger" was published last fall. “Women's anger, even when it has existed, has often been covered over by the people telling the story of it."
At this moment, though, that story is being forcefully told on stages from Boston to Broadway. The anger of women, and their determination to fight back against the role of systemic misogyny in making them feel undervalued and unsafe in the world, has formed the basis of recent and current productions as different as Lyric Stage Company of Boston's “The Little Foxes," Sleeping Weazel's “The Audacity: Women Speak," Flat Earth Theatre's “Not Medea," Also Known As Theatre's “Extremities," and the riveting “What the Constitution Means to Me," at New York's Helen Hayes Theater.
Even generally lighthearted classics like Lerner & Loewe's “My Fair Lady," George Bernard Shaw's “Pygmalion" (from which “My Fair Lady" was adapted), and Cole Porter's “Kiss Me, Kate" now resonate differently, having been tweaked by contemporary directors to emphasize the defiance of their incensed female protagonists and the legitimacy of their grievances.
Doubtless this emphasis on women's anger is driven in significant part by the heightened awareness of male misdeeds engendered by the #MeToo movement. But reflecting the experiences and feelings of half the population of the planet — and perhaps to some degree offering a cathartic outlet — is the kind of day-to-day work that theater should routinely do and is uniquely well-suited to do.
Because immediate audience feedback is such a central component of the art form, the impact can be instantly measured. I can attest that at recent performances of stage works channeling, expressing, and foregrounding women's anger, the fervent reaction of female patrons could be summed up as: Me Too. To cite just one instance, when Kelli O'Hara tore through the number “I Hate Men" in the Roundabout Theatre Company revival of “Kiss Me, Kate," the response by female spectators inside Studio 54 signaled clearly that the song was registering not as a tantrum but as an expression of generalized disgust at the male gender.
In “What the Constitution Means to Me," playwright-performer Heidi Schreck emphasizes that “I love men," adding with a laugh:“I'm the daughter of a father!" Then she stops laughing and notes : “But the facts are extreme." Indeed. Schreck lays out those facts in unblinking and powerfully compelling fashion (New York Times critic Jesse Green wrote that Schreck's play “is angrier and more pointed now" than during its earlier run off-Broadway). She uses the nation's founding document as a lens through which to examine centuries of unchecked violence against women, including a few harrowing chapters of her own family history, and asks a question that cuts to the heart of the lofty promises contained in the Constitution: “What does it mean that the document will not protect us from the violence of men?"
Some members of the audience were brought to the verge of tears at the performance I attended when Schreck recounted stunning statistics about, for instance, the number of American women who have been killed by “violent male partners." She confessed that she has to get that out of her mind just to “get through the day," but then added, in haunting words that countless women would doubtless agree with: “Except, I think, the knowledge of it is always there. Even if you don't know the statistics, I think you can feel the truth of it underneath everything . . . humming."
Of course, this is not an era when women need to look very far beneath the surface to find fresh reasons for concern and fury. In the fall of 2016, Donald Trump won the White House — defeating Hillary Clinton, the first major-party female nominee in US history — even though he was heard boasting on the “Access Hollywood" tape about grabbing women's genitals and has been accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct (which he has denied). In the fall of 2017, the #MeToo movement took off on Twitter, triggering a near-daily flood of revelations about sexual misconduct by powerful men that continues to this day. Last fall, psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, which did not prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed to a lifetime seat on the nation's highest court, where he could rule for decades on issues affecting the lives of women.
Perhaps nowhere among recent local productions is the rage many women feel toward President Trump more scaldingly captured than in Sleeping Weazel's “The Audacity: Women Speak," a drama about sexual violence and harassment conceived and arranged by Charlotte Meehan, with contributions from more than 30 other women. One woman in “The Audacity" recounts being raped by a classmate when she was younger, then says bitterly: “I relive this every time 45 opens his filthy mouth. Words turn to sewage coming out from that hate-filled, smug face."
A combination of women's anger and determined action has defined several other productions in the Boston area and on Broadway. In Lillian Hellman's “The Little Foxes" (1939), Regina Giddens (indelibly portrayed by Anne Gottlieb at Lyric Stage), who is seething at being denied her rightful share of the family inheritance because she is a woman, finds a way to ruthlessly outmaneuver her two brothers and gain the fortune that had eluded her. In William Mastrosimone's “Extremities" (1982), a young woman named Marjorie (played by Alissa Cordeiro in the current Also Known as Theatre production) turns the tables on a would-be rapist and then proceeds to take drastic action while pondering the question of what, exactly, constitutes justice for her attacker.
In Flat Earth's recent production of Allison Gregory's “Not Medea" (2016), a haze of ambiguity surrounds a family tragedy involving a pediatric oncology nurse (Juliet Bowler, delivering a brave and intensely committed performance), but there is no mistaking her desire for vengeance on the narcissistic husband who has humiliated her by having an affair with a younger woman. In both the current Broadway revival of “My Fair Lady" and in the February “Pygmalion" at Cambridge's Central Square Theater by the New York theater company Bedlam, Eliza Doolittle has more agency, and Henry Higgins pays a steeper price for his arrogant mistreatment of her, than is often the case in productions of those works.
Perhaps one measure of the pervasiveness and perniciousness of male prerogatives can be found in the fact that even Cher has to fight for autonomy. In “The Cher Show," a bio-musical that is now at the Neil Simon Theatre on Broadway, a young Cher complains to Sonny Bono, her husband and costar in a TV variety show, that “It's always a bunch of guys telling me what to do." Sonny airily replies: “What are you gonna do? It's a man's world."
Cher pushes back hard against that notion (and you could say she spent the rest of her life refuting it). It's a constant battle, but there is plenty of evidence onstage today that it is a battle that women are ready to wage for as long it takes.

Trump administration continues to ignore corporate wrongdoing

Texto completo: Why didn't Boeing do it right? Why isn't Facebook protecting user passwords? Why is Phillip Morris allowed to promote vaping? Why hasn't Wells Fargo reformed itself? Why hasn't Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) recalled its Roundup weed killer?
Answer: Corporate greed coupled with inept and corrupt regulators.
These are just a few of the examples in the news these days of corporate harms inflicted on innocent people.
To be sure, some began before the Trump administration. But Trump and his appointees have unambiguously signaled to corporations that they can now do as they please.
Boeing wanted to get its 737 Max 8 out quickly because airlines want to pack in more passengers at lower fuel costs (hence the "max"). But neither Boeing nor the airlines shelled out money to adequately train pilots on the new software made necessary by the new design.
Nonetheless, Trump's Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane in March 2017. And after two subsequent deadly crashes, the U.S. was slower to ground the planes than other countries.
Last month, Facebook admitted to storing hundreds of millions of Facebook users' passwords in plain text that could be searched by more than 20,000 Facebook employees. The admission came just a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that Facebook shared the personal data of as many as 87 million users with a political data firm.
In reality, Facebook's business model is based on giving personal data to advertisers so they can tailor their pitches precisely to potential customers. So despite repeated reassurances by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the firm will continue to do what it wants with personal information.
The Federal Trade Commission has the power to force Facebook to better guard users' privacy. But so far Trump's FTC has done nothing -- not even to enforce a 2011 agreement in which Facebook promised to do just that.
Altria (Phillip Morris) was losing ground on its sales of cigarettes, but the firm has recently found a future in vaping. Because inhaling nicotine in any form poses a health hazard, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wanted to curb advertising of vaping products to teenagers.
Gottlieb thought he had Altria's agreement, but then the firm bought a major stake in the vaping company Juul. Its stock has already gained 14 percent this year. What happened to Gottlieb? He's out at the FDA, after less than two years on the job.
Wells Fargo has publicly apologized for having deceived customers with fake bank accounts, unwarranted fees and unwanted products. Its top executives say they have eliminated the aggressive sales targets that were responsible for the fraud.
But Wells Fargo employees told the New York Times recently that they're still under heavy pressure to squeeze extra money out of customers. Some have witnessed colleagues bending or breaking internal rules to meet ambitious performance goals.
What has Trump's Consumer Financial Protection Agency done about this? Nothing. It's been defanged.
Last week, a federal jury awarded $80 million in damages to a California man who blamed Monsanto's (now Bayer's) Roundup weed killer for his cancer after finding that Roundup was defectively designed, that Monsanto failed to warn of the herbicide's cancer risk, and that the company acted negligently. It was the second jury in eight months to reach the same conclusion about Roundup.
Roundup contains glyphosate, a suspected carcinogen. Cases from more than 1,000 farmers and other agricultural workers stricken with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are already pending in federal and state courts.
What has Trump's Environmental Protection Agency done about glyphosate? In 2017, its office of pesticide programs concluded that glyphosate wasn't likely to cause cancer -- although eight of the 15 experts on whom the agency relied expressed significant concerns about that conclusion, and three more expressed concerns about the data.
These are just tips of a vast iceberg of regulatory neglect, frozen into place by Trump's appointees, of which at least 187 were lobbyists before they joined the administration.
This is trickle-down economics of a different sort than Trump's corporate tax cuts. The major beneficiaries of this are the same big corporations, including their top executives and major investors. But these burdens are trickling down as unsafe products, fraudulent services, loss of privacy, even loss of life.
Big money has had an inhibiting effect on regulators in several previous administrations. What's unique under Trump is the blatancy of it all, and the shameless willingness of Trump appointees to turn a blind eye to corporate wrongdoing.
Trump and his Republican enablers in Congress yell "socialism!" at proposals for better balancing private greed with the common good. Yet unless a better balance is achieved, capitalism as we know it won't survive.

Congress shouldn't have to subpoena the Mueller report

Texto completo: By E.J. DIONNE JR.

WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee should not have had to vote Wednesday to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It should already have been sent to Congress. The fact that the body's Democrats had to take this forcing action underscores why Attorney General William Barr's handling of the document so far is irresponsible -- and, yes, suspicious.

Let's look at the timeline. Mueller submitted his report March 22. Two days later, on March 24, Barr issued his four-page letter that included not one complete sentence from the report. Barr quoted the report as saying: "[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Note that the quote leaves out the beginning of the original sentence.

And note also that Barr's own words said Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia." The phase "did not establish" is not the same as "did not find," but we have no way of knowing, absent the report itself, how significant that difference is. What we do know is that Barr seems to have put the best possible spin for Trump on what Mueller himself wrote.

Indeed, The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that there is dissatisfaction on the Mueller team with Barr's account.

"Some of Robert S. Mueller III's investigators," the paper reported, "have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated."

Yet another reason why Congress and the public need to see the real thing.

And The Washington Post reported that "some members" of Mueller's team "were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared." Barr needs to release those summaries, too, and be asked why he didn't make them public in or with his March 24 letter.

On obstruction, Barr quoted the Mueller document saying that "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him." Then, Barr made an astonishing assertion: "The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime." Barr, who had already criticized what he took to be Mueller's theory on obstruction before he became attorney general, went on (surprise, surprise) to absolve the president, writing "that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."

But wait a minute: Did Mueller's decision not to make a call mean that it was Barr's decision to make? There is nothing that automatically gives Barr that power. Perhaps Mueller intended to leave the decision on obstruction to Congress, not to Barr. Maybe Mueller was silent on this issue in his report. Maybe he wasn't. We can't know, because we haven't seen the report.

And then came a strange letter from Barr on March 29 in which he complained that many were "mischaracterizing" his March 24 letter.

"My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel's investigation or report. ... I do not believe it would be in the public's interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion."

So a summary was not a summary, and his first letter was, well, incomplete, or at least not "exhaustive" or ... well, what was it? A news release? President Trump certainly had no problem crying from the heavens that Barr's letter was a good-enough summary for him and that it cleared him of everything.

Which means that looking at everything Barr is doing with a suspicious eye is, at this point, the only safe thing to do. Especially when Trump, who had previously said he had no problem releasing the report, complained on Tuesday that it was a "disgrace" that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., was now demanding the very sort of disclosure the president had once endorsed. Trump, it would seem, was for releasing the full report before he was against it.

When the committee voted for the subpoena on Wednesday, Nadler said: "The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct. That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves -- not the attorney general's summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence." In light of everything that has happened since Mueller turned in his report on March 22, how could Congress settle for anything less?

Texto completo: Mindless and irresistible as chain letters or online surveys, most internet challenges are like Michael Corleone's mob in "The Godfather: Part III." You imagine you've given them the slip and they suck you back in. As a rule, I avoid these seductive time traps. Yet there I was recently, scrolling through Instagram for the 10th time that day, when I stumbled on the Seven Day Book Cover Challenge and was instantly hooked.
Actually, that's a misstatement. This innocuous game, which asks users to post a photo of a book cover on a social media platform every day for a week, requires an invitation; it is a challenge, after all. Since no one had actually tagged me, I figured I'd ask.
The person I approached was the fashion illustrator and stylist Bill Mullen, whose droll feed -- equal parts memoir, style commentary and grim account of a renovation from hell conducted by an upstairs neighbor he refers to as Minnie Castavet -- has become digital catnip for those of us hooked on a growing trend for using Instagram to write long.
Some Literary Show-and-Tell
Mullen himself had been challenged by @thebookmarc, the bookselling branch of the designer Marc Jacobs's empire, and his daily book posts skewed irresistibly toward oddball obscurities.
Day 1 found him posting a crumbling, yellowed paperback copy of "The Velvet Underground," a 1963 investigation into "aberrant behavior" among consenting adults, an image he accessorized with an assortment of sex toys that looked like they would hurt. Day 2 featured an unknown (to me) fan-bio-cum-takedown of Blondie by the great and lamented rock critic Lester Bangs, with a cover featuring a youthful Debbie Harry.
There followed on Day 3 a vintage Charles Addams book of cartoons and, next, a copy of the 1965 "Hollywood Babylon," Kenneth Anger's lascivious (and factually dubious) account of the inhabitants of Tinseltown and their sordid antics.
And so it went, through titles devoted to the occult (a core interest of Mullen's; he frequently cites Laurie Cabot, Official Witch of Salem, Mass., when recommending a color of the day) and, separately, Robert Mapplethorpe. It ended -- with neither comment nor review, as the challenge mandates -- on Day 7 with an original slipcased copy of Jacqueline Susann's deathless 1966 "Valley of the Dolls."
As with so much else on Instagram, Mullen's choices were offbeat and campy and also autobiographical, as literary show-and-tell tends to be. His apparent fascination with stuff once culturally marginal and now squarely in the mainstream seemed deliciously synchronous with my own. Because the terms of the challenge (which has been around for some time in various iterations, alternately devoted to books as sources of knowledge or else as pretty objects) stipulated that each post stand alone, there was minimal pressure to flaunt one's erudition.
It Made Sense at the Time
This, too, had its appeal. Once, in a long ago interview, the filmmaker Joel Schumacher remarked that -- while he would not want them all simultaneously to walk into one room -- he did not regret anyone he's ever slept with. This, essentially, is how I feel about my books. Each, in its own way, made sense at the time. Most are still around, though I don't think about them all that much.
The titles I chose were not so much intended to frame my intellectual landscape as to provide a frisson or engender a laugh. I posted what I liked and what came readily to hand. With each volume laid out on a rug in my apartment I did my best with an iPhone to prevent my shadow from falling across, say, a rare copy of "My Face for the World to See," the autobiography of the Warhol superstar Candy Darling and a book whose cover -- the pink vinyl of a schoolgirl's diary, replete with gilded lock -- obviates any need to bother with the text.
Next I posted "Ceylon," a 1950 book of gauzy homoerotic black-and-white photographs by Lionel Wendt, a pianist and polymath Pablo Neruda deemed the pivotal figure in the evolution of national identity in postcolonial Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. I was delighted to discover that book, having forgotten I owned it, and bemused afterward to learn that it now sells online for $1,800. After that came Dennis Cooper's too little appreciated 1984 novella "Safe," a book whose black-and-white cover photograph of an orgasmic man seemed prophetic in its resemblance to that on Hanya Yanagihara's 2015 best-selling novel, "A Little Life."
These were followed by a Pocket Series chapbook of Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1986 "Roman Poems," and an austere catalog from a 2001 exhibition mounted by the Institute for Contemporary Arts at the University of Pennsylvania and devoted to the visionary fashion designer (and gay liberation hero) Rudi Gernreich -- he of the topless monokini and the thong.
'A Very Welcome Rabbit Hole'
"I never even knew that book existed," Jennifer Baker, executive vice president of Bookmarc, said of the Gernreich volume, with its dark title, "Fashion Will Go Out of Fashion."
In a sense it was Baker's "fall down a very welcome rabbit hole" that set in motion my involvement in the challenge, since it was she who challenged Bill Mullen after having been challenged by the hairstylist Jimmy Paul, who had in turn been challenged by the makeup artist Dick Page.
"I got out all the books I had in closets," Baker said by telephone from her Los Angeles office. "I got the boxes out and found myself surrounded by books and thinking about all the feelings I have around books, that visceral connection to them, and not listening to Rachel Maddow for a change."
Like her, I took a deep and almost physical pleasure in the discoveries the book-a-day challenge produced. I knew in advance from his recondite Instagram account that a friend I challenged, the filmmaker Amos Poe, would produce surprises. He did not disappoint.
Starting the week somberly with the Polish writer Tadeusz Borowski's "This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen," a volume that, as it happened, had provided inspiration for the 1984 Style Council song "Ghosts of Dachau," Poe then leavened his offerings on Day 2 with a pulp fiction comic of the 1940s.
Lillian Ross's breezy "Portrait of Hemingway" and a paperback Signet copy of Thomas Wolfe's "Only the Dead Know Brooklyn" came next. Unlike myself, Poe was lavish in sharing the challenge, and although his invitation to play was taken up with relish by the historian and critic Luc Sante and the biographer Robert Becker, some he tapped demurred. Apparently not everyone thrills to the harmless voyeurism of peering into other people's back pages, as Baker of Bookmarc pointed out.
"The hardest part, quite frankly, was challenging seven different people and finding that only a few lived up to it," she said. "Fashion people followed the rules more than the book people," she added, which makes sense given that fashion is a largely conformist undertaking while literature depends for its existence on unruly types.
The Thrill of Possession
Still, the book cover challenge was both "lighthearted and inspiring," Baker said, in part because it evoked the thrill of possession she experienced upon unwrapping a special-ordered copy of Jean Stein's 1982 "Edie: An American Girl" one long-ago Nantucket summer and also because -- as with so much else on social media -- the stakes of playing along were negligible.
"We're all adults here," said Baker, who made wonderful, quirky choices in her postings of Joseph Szabo's 2003 photo essay "Teenage" (published by the magical and now dormant Greybull Press); David Bailey's 1964 "Rock and Roll Heroes"; Nan Goldin's 1993 "The Other Side"; and also a first-edition copy of Joan Didion's "Play It as It Lays," with its cover illustration of a tequila sunrise Los Angeles skyline and a rattler coiled in silhouette.
"I didn't originally read that particular cover. The cover I read was a stinky, smelly, yellowing 1970s paperback with a tacky illustration of Mariah smoking a cigarette," Baker said, referring to the novel's protagonist, Mariah Wyeth, that emblem of mid-20th-century acedia. "I discovered the original edition way later, and just giving it a revisit for the challenge completely brought back that excitement that wells up in your chest when you hold a favorite book."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
He has traveled to three early presidential primary states, held $5,000-a-plate events for donors and hired a small-dollar fund-raising consultant.
He spoke at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, and is now on another trip to raise money in Boston, after which he will meet with Democratic activists in Las Vegas.
These are the concrete steps of a man preparing to run for president.
But thus far, that man, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, would prefer that his words speak louder than his actions. When asked if he plans to run for president, he gives the same answers. He is "not ruling anything out," and will consult with his family before making a decision, one that he says will come "sooner than later."
Bank on sooner.
Mr. de Blasio has had two City Hall aides working on his tentative campaign on their own time; one of them, Mike Casca, is a veteran of Senator Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, and worked in the senator's office.
The other mayoral aide helping Mr. de Blasio with his 2020 exploration is Jon Paul Lupo; last month, Mr. Lupo brought aboard Trilogy Interactive, a Washington, D.C.-based company that does digital fund-raising and marketing for political campaigns and others, to assist the mayor's national political action committee, Fairness PAC.
Mr. de Blasio created Fairness PAC to fund national Democratic candidates, and to pay for his and his wife's political travel outside of New York. The fund raised just over $600,000 last year and has spent almost as much.
Stacey Bashara, a partner in Trilogy, said that the company's first task would be to reinvigorate and build out the PAC's email list. She said she has not spoken with the mayor, or discussed his potential 2020 run.
"The work we've been hired to do is for Fairness PAC," Ms. Bashara said. "There's been no conversation beyond that."
His potential candidacy has not caused much enthusiasm, even in New York. A poll released this week from Quinnipiac University found that 76 percent of New York City voters believe the mayor should not run for president. Another 47 percent of voters surveyed said they think a de Blasio presidential run would be bad for the city, including 43 percent of Democrats.
None of that seems to be deterring Mr. de Blasio.
"I'm glad I could unify the people of New York City," the mayor said at a news conference on Thursday when asked about the Quinnipiac poll.
That was in keeping with his generally dismissive response to polls that point to his unpopularity. "I have spent a lot of time in dead last in many a poll in many a race," the mayor told The New York Times after a January appearance in Iowa. "It's not where you start. It's where you end."
He repeated that message as recently as this week, when Mr. de Blasio appeared at the National Action Network's annual convention, a popular destination for presidential aspirants.
"Time and time again, people will tell you what you can't do," the mayor said. "But don't let anyone tell you what you can't do. Don't let anyone talk you out of your own power."
For all his public disregard of polls, Mr. de Blasio is no doubt aware that his chances of qualifying for the first of the Democratic presidential debates, which will take place in June, may hinge on how he does with poll respondents. Candidates can qualify either by meeting fund-raising goals or by gaining at least 1 percent support in three polls of Democratic voters, by any of several organizations approved by the Democratic National Committee.
By that measure, Mr. de Blasio is two-thirds of the way there. He met the 1 percent threshold in a poll released on March 11 by Monmouth University and another released on March 24 by Fox News.
"I feel like he's going to run," said Rebecca Katz, a former adviser to Mr. de Blasio and his family who is not currently attached to his exploratory bid. "I think he wants to be talked about in a serious way."
A $5,000-per-plate fund-raising breakfast on March 6 underscored the mayor's intentions. It was hosted by a real estate developer, Aby Rosen, whose company, RFR Holding, recently bought the Chrysler Building.
"This will be a private opportunity for a candid conversation with the mayor, who will share his insights and take your questions on the future of the New York City economy and the political trajectory of the Democratic Party, both nationally and locally," said the emailed invitation, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times.
It said that the mayor had "a lot of value to add on how to navigate successfully this fraught political moment."
A similar breakfast event took place Friday at the offices of Suffolk Construction in Boston. The company has been looking to expand its operations in New York. Later Friday, the mayor traveled to meet Democrats in Nevada.

For what it's worth, Mr. de Blasio does seem to be enjoying himself on the prospective campaign trail, in contrast to his often dour demeanor when parrying with reporters in New York.
In Des Moines, Mr. de Blasio, a devoted Red Sox fan, signed a Yankees batting helmet for a young fan. He stayed so long speaking with people after a speech at the Asian & Latino Coalition PAC that his staff members had to pull him away so he would not miss his flight back to New York City.
On the trips to South Carolina and New Hampshire, the mayor was accompanied by his wife, Chirlane McCray; in New Hampshire, the couple visited the home where Ms. McCray's mother was raised, and she led a round-table discussion about opioid abuse and mental illness.
"I've never seen a political race that the mayor has been involved in -- going back to the school board -- where Chirlane wasn't a part of the decision-making process, the strategy and the tactics," said Peter Ragone, a former top aide and now an informal adviser to Mr. de Blasio.
Mr. Ragone said he did not know whether Mr. de Blasio would run for president. "But if you look at his record and who's in the Democratic primary, why shouldn't he consider it?" Mr. Ragone said.
At the National Action Network, the civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the mayor seemed extraordinarily animated, and talked about the "painful intersection of structural racism and income inequality." More Democratic candidates for president have been addressing issues of racial inequality.
"My mission when I became the mayor of the largest city in the nation was to show that the status quo was unacceptable," the mayor said. "And isn't that a truth in our nation right now."
Mr. Sharpton, a political ally of the mayor, said that Mr. de Blasio told him that he was exploring a run for president because he was being encouraged to do so.
The mayor did not say who was encouraging him, Mr. Sharpton said.
"In a crowded field he has some unique things. He's progressive and has management skills. The question is, 'Does he distinguish himself?"' Mr. Sharpton said. "He's been underestimated before in the mayor's race, so I would not count him out."

Media pot reporting: Just don't call us uncool!

Texto completo: Illustration Ann Coulter Syndicated columnist

I think I'll direct a series of low-budget movies with names like "Tobacco Madness," "Gun Madness" and "White Male Madness." The plots will be exactly the same with, alternately, cigarettes, guns or whiteness causing high school students to go insane, causing mayhem and murder.
In addition to launching my campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, my films will be so silly that, in the future, they will anathematize any untoward remarks about smokers, gun-owners or white men. (Making certain arguments off-limits is terrific for generating fact-based solutions!)
A "No Smoking" sign in a hospital room? What is this? "Tobacco Madness?"
That's what the 1930s propaganda film "Reefer Madness" has done to the discussion of marijuana in the United States, as is evident from the eye-opening new book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence," by longtime New York Times reporter Alex Berenson. (Don't worry — he covered the pharmaceutical industry, not politics.)
The evidence that pot, and pot alone, triples your chances of developing a psychosis is overwhelming. Berenson cites hundreds of studies showing a direct link between cannabis use and psychoses like schizophrenia.
For every objection, he's got another batch of studies, including his own groundbreaking research.
Aren't these just schizophrenics-in-waiting who were self-medicating with pot? No, people with zero personal or family history of any type of mental illness show a statistically significant increase in psychosis diagnoses after using cannabis.
Don't the studies involve a lot of "confirmation bias," with scientists looking for psychosis in potheads? Totally false. A huge number of the studies linking pot and schizophrenia began with scientists looking at something else entirely and being floored by the marijuana results showing up in the data.
Isn't this because most pot-smokers are young men in their late teens to late 20s — the danger zone for schizophrenia? To the contrary, Berenson shows that new psychosis diagnoses among adults in marijuana-friendly states like Colorado have shot up right along with pot legalization. One Dutch study of 4,000 previously healthy adults found that marijuana use nearly tripled the risk of developing psychotic symptoms within three years.
If any other substance tripled the odds of losing your mind, I think the public would know about it. But in America, reporters — even scientists — are more worried about sounding cool. What? Do you believe in "Reefer Madness?"
There's also the problem that the Worst Generation smoked a lot of pot when they were idealistically rioting on college campuses in the 1970s and consider it harmless.
But, as Berenson says, the difference in the pot being consumed today and that smoked by earlier generations is the equivalent of comparing a martini to "near beer." In the 1970s, most pot contained less than 2 percent THC — the chemical that gets you high. "Today's users wouldn't even recognize that drug as marijuana," says Berenson. The legal pot sold today is usually at least 25 percent THC. Cannabis "wax" and "shatter" can be almost pure THC.
The United Kingdom's scientific community has been screaming from the rooftops about the link between cannabis and psychosis for decades. As a result, marijuana use and support for legalization have collapsed. From the early 2000s to today, cannabis use in the U.K. has been cut by a third.
In that same time period, marijuana consumption in the U.S. and Canada skyrocketed. American adults use cannabis in a month at a rate higher than British adults do in a year.
With the surge in cannabis consumption has come a surge in overdose deaths and psychosis.
In 2006 America — just as the latest rise in pot consumption began — there were about 30,000 emergency room diagnoses of psychosis with marijuana use disorder alone. By 2014, that number had tripled, with almost 90,000 ER visits for cannabis-induced psychosis.
Only a few of the emergency room patients with marijuana dependence showed any other drug in their systems. And the cannabis-related psychoses were more severe than the others, resulting in hospitalization twice as often as psychosis alone.
Here's my trailblazing study explaining the wide gulf in marijuana use in this country compared to the U.K.: British scientists and journalists weren't embarrassed by the hyperbolic nonsense of "Reefer Madness," so they could tell the truth.
I thought the American media's universal, exhaustive lying about immigration could never be matched for any other subject. Read Alex Berenson's "Tell Your Children," and you'll see how wrong I was — and you are, too.

Neoyorquinos caminan más rápido que el promedio mundial y superan buses en Midtown

Texto completo: Caminar en la ciudad de Nueva York es parte de la dieta diaria, y no siempre porque se quiera, sino porque hay que hacerlo.
Lo estimulan el diseño cuadriculado de las calles y el uso frecuente del Metro, además de lo difícil y costoso de estacionar, y el tráfico complicado, entre varios factores que se complementan entre sí.
Por ello no sorprende que aquí la mayoría de la gente camine rápido y hasta supere la velocidad a la que se mueven algunos buses en Midtown.
En 2018, la velocidad promedio de los buses locales fue de apenas 6.7 mph (10 kph). Para el M42, apenas 3.2 mph.
Los neoyorquinos tardan sólo 12 segundos en caminar 60 pies; eso es aproximadamente 3.4 millas por hora, y un poco más rápido que estar sentado en el autobús M42, destacó The New York Times, citando un viejo estudio mundial que consideran aún vigente.
Los caminantes de NYC están por encima del promedio mundial y son líderes en EEUU, pero no en el planeta, concluyó hace unos años el investigador Richard Wiseman, profesor de psicología de la Universidad de Hertfordshire (Reino Unido), quien estudió “el ritmo de la vida” en 32 ciudades.
Ubicó a Nueva York en el 8vo puesto. Mucho más rápido se camina en:
1. Singapore (Singapore): 10.55 segundos/60 pies.
2. Copenhagen (Dinamarca): 10.82
3. Madrid (España): 10.89
4. Guangzhou (China): 10.94
5. Dublín (Irlanda): 11.03
6. Curitiba (Brasil): 11.13
7. Berlín (Alemania): 11.16
Los resultados fueron parte de su libro, “Quirkology”. En el detalle puntual de la velocidad al andar a pie, investigadores en ciudades alrededor del mundo observaron a caminantes un día específico de verano, entre las 11:30 am y las 2:00 p.m. hora local.
Con un cronómetro registraron el tiempo que tardaron 35 hombres y mujeres en caminar por un tramo de 60 pies de pavimento. Descartaron a las personas cargando paquetes o equipaje, caminando con otros o hablando por teléfono.
Al comparar los resultados con los de un experimento similar realizado en 1994 por Robert Levine, profesor de psicología en la Universidad Estatal de California en Fresno, Wiseman concluyó que el ritmo de la vida urbana, medido al caminar, había aumentado 10% en promedio mundial, aunque en Nueva York se había mantenido estable a lo largo de los años.
En su registro de 32 urbes, la ciudad más lenta para caminar fue Blantyre en Malawi, en el sur de África, al ritmo de caracoles: una quinta parte de una milla por hora.
En comparación, el récord mundial de Michael Johnson para la carrera de 200 metros es equivalente a 23 millas por hora.

Texto completo: Before Don McPherson walked into his first class as a freshman at Syracuse in 1984, he already was known to most every student on campus. His name and face preceded him, splashed on the front pages of the city's and campus's newspapers. Local broadcasters discussed his prospects on television and radio. He was the new hope for the Orangemen, their new quarterback.
Yet McPherson, who went on to a Hall of Fame career at Syracuse, said he felt like a suspect, just as he had in high school, where he was one of a few black kids on a similar predominantly white campus where he arrived from a mostly black inner-city New York neighborhood.
"I didn't want to be the black kid . . . just as a football player," McPherson said to me last week. "I always wanted to present that I wasn't just that."
So he adopted a disguise. A collared shirt. A tie, even. The New York Times tucked under his arm everywhere he went.
It was not unlike what we learned in recent weeks was the ultimate costume to hide actual unworthiness of college admission. His appearance was fashioned, after all, to look like most of his campus's populace at the time. Or, fast-forward to 2019, to look like any of the upward of three dozen children of wealthy and well-connected mostly white families - Hollywood and Silicon Valley types, doctors and lawyers - the government alleged are in elite colleges and universities only because of bribes from their parents of college admission gatekeepers.
Until the federal government stepped in last month, the black male college athlete held that distinction on college campus - academically unworthy - almost alone. We in the media wrote extensively about those high school athletes, predominantly and disproportionately black males, headed to college to play its revenue-generating sports of football and basketball despite failing standardized tests and not meeting individual college admission prerequisites. We quoted Notre Dame's legendary football player Paul Hornung when he remarked during a tough stretch for Fighting Irish football that "we can't stay as strict as we are as far as the academic structure is concerned because we've got to get the black athlete."
We rarely, however, wrote exposés about the sons and daughters of the wealthy and white whose real eligibility at the best schools we wondered about. We never allowed the collective intelligence of their class to be castigated in public.
"I was a commodity," McPherson said. "And I knew that. Not only did I not feel like I belonged on campus, I never got treated like a student.
"I was a celebrity on the campus of an academic institution surrounded by people who didn't see me as an intellectual," said McPherson, who went on to work in academia at Northeastern and Adelphi universities as well as television commentating on college football. "That goes back to, who belongs? I wasn't viewed as contributing anything to the academy other than my body as a football player."
It was an understandable sensitivity for black male athletes then. It is borne out even more than three decades later. While they represent more than half of major college basketball rosters, such as those headed to the Final Four, and more than 60 percent of those colleges' football rosters, black males compose less than 3 percent of the undergraduate enrollments at those institutions. In short, black athletes are on college campuses mostly to make money for the athletic corporation rather than be nurtured by the academic apparatus.
And that truth may be what makes the system constructed and funded by well-heeled white parents to hijack the college admissions system for the benefit of their undeserving kids particularly devious. Many of them used the blood and sweat of black male athletes to make space for their kids.
This was why the government nicknamed its investigation, which netted 50 adults, Operation Varsity Blues. Upward of a dozen of those indicted involved coaches or other athletic department officials who accepted money from parents to have the parents' kids posed as athletic recruits, who get preferred admission at many colleges and universities.
And almost all of these fake athletes purportedly played a sport other than football or basketball. They supposedly sailed. Played soccer. Volleyball. Tennis. Participated in games known in the college athletic industry as expenditure sports. They are sports that cost the schools money to run without bringing in money. They are played predominantly by white athletes. And their overheads are mostly paid for by the revenue generated from football and basketball, which are mostly stocked by black male athletes.
That is an overlooked truth about college athletics. Most of it is not football and basketball but everything else. And most everything else is played by everyone except black males who make everything else possible.
"There's no greater form of hypocrisy in American culture than athletics in higher education," McPherson said. "When you look at stadiums that put 100,000, 110,000 people in the seats and the brothers on the field can't even read, it is staggering to wrap your brain around. And I love college football, but it is hard when you hear the term non-qualifiers [for black male athletes]. That means you don't belong on campus."
At the very least, however, those black male athletes are providing a function for the university. They are producing financial returns to keep a part of the institution afloat. They are being used to attract applications and students and alumni.
They do have a space on campus, albeit exploitative, where they belong. And they had to be gifted and talented to occupy that space.
The kids finally found out in the admissions investigation are the real scandal. They are the ones who have no space on the campus and are without gift or talent even to be exploited.

Texto completo: America is a nation that only pretends to care about education, and the best way to change that is to give teachers a raise, Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris told a Carson City audience on Tuesday.
"That's why I'm proposing, for the first time in our nation's history, a federal investment to close the teacher pay gap," Harris said during a fundraiser hosted by Battle Born Progress, a nonprofit progressive political advocacy group based in Henderson. "I strongly believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children.
"One of the strongest expressions of love a society can extend to its children is to invest in educating those children, and by extension (invest) in those teachers."
Harris — the junior senator from California who hopes to become the first African American woman to be elected president — spent much of her first campaign trip to Northern Nevada courting educators.
That effort started in Carson City at Eagle Valley Middle School, where she spelled out a plan to offer a $15,000 pay raise to Nevada teachers. The $315 billion effort would be paid for by closing tax loopholes and "strengthening" the estate tax, according to Harris' campaign website.
If elected, Harris told teachers she would also look to reform the nation's local property tax-based school funding system, and "fight vigorously" to ensure each teacher has a right to join a union.
The teacher pay hike proposal may have won the loudest response during Harris' roughly half-hour speech at the Union.
But her attacks on President Donald Trump ran a close second.
"We can't afford to have a commander-in-chief who takes the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community," she said to thunderous applause. "We can't afford to have a commander-in-chief who takes the word of a Saudi prince over the word of the national intelligence community when it comes to a journalist who was assassinated."
Harris went on to say that a dumping nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, located about 100 miles north of Las Vegas, wouldn't happen on her watch.
Like many top Senate Democrats seeking the 2020 presidential nomination, Harris has expressed support for efforts to enact the Green New Deal and offer Medicare to all Americans. She's also sworn off corporate PAC money, relying instead on individual donations to fund her campaign.
But those efforts have fallen far short of winning over critics on Harris' left.
Detractors have slammed the 54-year-old Oakland native as little more than a political opportunist, highlighting her close ties to police unions and shifting stances on marijuana legalization, bail reform and the death penalty.
Harris, for example, sought to eliminate the cash bail system as a senator, less than a year after her attorney general's office defended the oft-criticized practice in a pair of federal court cases.
She also refused to support a California bill requiring her office to investigate officer-involved shootings and declined to back statewide standards for the use of police body cameras. Today, she says "too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America."
In 2014, Harris laughed at the idea of legalizing marijuana during television interview. On the presidential campaign trail, she's argued that nationwide legalization is the "right thing to do."
Perhaps most controversially, Harris authored a statewide truancy law that threatened to jail parents of children who missed too much school. It's resulted in hundreds of parents being prosecuted.
Harris mostly skirted such criticisms during her three-stop swing through Northern Nevada, preferring to focus on her upbringing in Oakland and her proposed education reforms. In response to critics of her record as California's top cop, Harris in 2016 told The New York Times, "I have a client, I don't get to choose my client."

Texto completo: WikiLeaks claimed Thursday its founder Julian Assange would be expelled within “hours to days” from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived in asylum for nearly seven years.

WikiLeaks said it had a “high level” source within Ecuador that said Assange would be expelled and that the country already had an agreement with the United Kingdom for Assange’s arrest. Hours later, it said it had “secondary confirmation from another high level source.”

Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno said earlier this week Assange had repeatedly violated the terms for his asylum at the embassy.

“We should ensure Mr Assange’s life is not at risk but he’s violated the agreement we have with him so many times,” Moreno said.

Under the agreement, Assange “cannot lie or, much less, hack into private accounts or private phones” and he could not “intervene in the politics of countries, or worse friendly countries,” Moreno said.

The president said private photos of him and his family has been widely shared on social media, but stopped short of blaming WikiLeaks.

Moreno has previously discussed offering up Assange in exchange for debt relief from the U.S., the New York Times reported in December.

Assange took refuge in the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning in a sexual assault investigation. That case has since been dropped but WikiLeaks believes Assange could be extradited to the U.S.

Hal Boyd: Notes from a Latter-day Saint, born-again skeptic

Texto completo: Editor's note: A version of the following article was originally published by the Wheatley Institution at Brigham Young University.
On the contemporary college campus, believers exhibit their own brand of skepticism.
The academics I know tend to be thoughtful, well-meaning types who, on the whole, expand knowledge and aspire to foster a pluralistic vision of society. But, as New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has observed, “the one kind of diversity that universities disregard is ideological and religious.”
He continues: “We’re fine with people who don’t look like us, as long as they think like us.”
Kristof points to University of North Texas sociologist George Yancey: “Outside of academia I faced more problems as a black. But inside academia I face more problems as a Christian, and it is not even close.” Yancey’s own research suggests that about half of “academics would be less willing to hire someone they find out was a conservative Protestant.”
Within the academy, religion is often viewed as an outdated relic. Sure, it may have once served as a helpful mythos. But, like Plato’s “noble lie,” it’s an illusion — or, in Karl Marx’s parlance, an opiate to sedate the suffering masses.
More generous critics say religion provides humans with Darwinian advantages. Evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein, for example, contends that even though religion can be metaphorically true (that is, it can produce positive outcomes), it will still be “literally” false.
And yet, not everyone within the Ivory Tower imbibes these or other emerging secular dogmas. There’s skepticism, it seems, regarding the skeptics.
Take Elaine Pagels, a Princeton professor and the author of the new book “Why Religion?”
“My father gave up the kind of ferocious Calvinism of his family for Darwin,” she says in a recent interview discussing her book. “He basically said, well, religion is just a bunch of old folk tales, and we don’t need that. Educated people don’t need that. Only people who aren’t (educated) would ever bother with the Bible and all that stuff.”
Then something happened.
As a 15-year-old, Pagels attended a sermon by Billy Graham at Candlestick Park in San Francisco with a group of friends. While there, she felt something. She experienced something. Her “conversion” to evangelical Christianity lasted only a year. But her encounter with the numinous lingered.
It expanded her worldview beyond the strident Darwinism of her father. She began to doubt his doubts and discover the wisdom in Hamlet’s remark to Horatio: “There are more things in heaven and earth … than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”
Within today’s prevailing academic posture toward religion there’s an inherent assumption: bona fide believers are woefully wrong. And, by extension, bona fide believers must be ill-informed, ignorant or simply unintelligent.
This, perhaps, helps explain why some scholars express a bias regarding hiring conservative Christians. After all, aspiring academics must demonstrate intellectual acuity, a commitment to data and facts, critical thinking abilities, curiosity and an unrelenting scholarly skepticism.
But what if, as in the case of Pagels and others, the skepticism cuts the other way.
Pagels describes a conversation she had with noted poet Marie Howe. While discussing Howe’s poem “Annunciation” — in which Jesus’ mother, Mary, suddenly “senses a divine presence of overpowering love approaching her” — Pagels asked how she came to write it.
“Well you know, it happened to me. But, of course, I couldn’t say that,” Howe responded.
Such experiences, Pagels implies, may be more common than we imagine.
A predecessor of the French philosophes of the 18th century, Blaise Pascal was a child prodigy. By age 16 he had written his first influential work on geometry, and by 21 he had invented the Pascaline — what many consider to be the world’s first mechanical calculator.
And yet, perhaps more important to him were the events that took place in his life on the night of Nov. 23, 1654.
Sometime between 10:30 p.m. and midnight, Pascal had an ineffable experience, a personal theophany — a revelation. Though the specifics of his mystical moment remain unknown, Pascal recorded the following words: “Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob not the God of the philosophers and of the learned ... Certitude. Certitude. Joy. Peace.”
Pascal closed his lines by quoting the biblical psalmist, “‘I will not forget thy words.’ Amen.”
He placed the parchment containing these words in his jacket lining, as if to put it closer to his heart.
In academia, skeptics are revered as shrewd truth-seekers. They stand in the grand tradition of scientists like Galileo, who was condemned to home confinement during an inquisition for his reasoned-based worldview. The orthodoxy of Galileo’s day refused to entertain the evidence.
What of the orthodoxy of our day? To paraphrase Pascal, there are many truths — the only real heresy is excluding some of them.

Texto completo: Algunos de los investigadores del fiscal especoal Robert Mueller han advertido que los hallazgos de su investigación son mucho más perjudiciales para el presidente Donald Trump de lo que se ha dado a conocer.
Hasta el momento, el fiscal general William Barr sólo ha dado a conocer un resumen de tres páginas y media donde señala que no indagará al mandatario sobre posible “obstrucción de la justicia”, dado que el reporte de Mueller no halló pruebas concluyentes al respecto, aunque no lo exonera.
El New York Times cita a funcionarios del gobierno y otros personajes familiarizados con el caso, quienes creen que Barr debería haber incluido más del reporte integral sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
A pesar de la alerta, no hay detalles sobre qué información sería “más perjudicial” para el presidente Trump.
El procurador general se comprometió a publicar el informe de casi 400 páginas a mediados de abril, con ciertas partes bloqueadas, como la protección de la información secreta del gran jurado y las fuentes y métodos de recopilación de información.
El presidente Trump reaccionó a la revelación del Times al afirmar que el periódico no tiene “fuentes legítimas”, incluso consideró que quizá el diario “¡no tenga realmente fuentes!” , acusando que su reportaje es “falso”.
The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

Texto completo: Algunos de los investigadores del fiscal especoal Robert Mueller han advertido que los hallazgos de su investigación son mucho más perjudiciales para el presidente Donald Trump de lo que se ha dado a conocer.
Hasta el momento, el fiscal general William Barr sólo ha dado a conocer un resumen de tres páginas y media donde señala que no indagará al mandatario sobre posible “obstrucción de la justicia”, dado que el reporte de Mueller no halló pruebas concluyentes al respecto, aunque no lo exonera.
El New York Times cita a funcionarios del gobierno y otros personajes familiarizados con el caso, quienes creen que Barr debería haber incluido más del reporte integral sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
A pesar de la alerta, no hay detalles sobre qué información sería “más perjudicial” para el presidente Trump.
El procurador general se comprometió a publicar el informe de casi 400 páginas a mediados de abril, con ciertas partes bloqueadas, como la protección de la información secreta del gran jurado y las fuentes y métodos de recopilación de información.
El presidente Trump reaccionó a la revelación del Times al afirmar que el periódico no tiene “fuentes legítimas”, incluso consideró que quizá el diario “¡no tenga realmente fuentes!” , acusando que su reportaje es “falso”.
The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former Vice President Joe Biden, facing multiple allegations from women of unwanted and inappropriate behavior, promised to be more "mindful and respectful" in a video released Wednesday
Biden, who is considering a bid for the White House in 2020, says his touching was all about making a "human connection. "
"It's just who I am," Biden says in the video. "I've never thought of politics as cold or antiseptic. "
Hours after the video, The Washington Post reported allegations from three more women, including a former White House intern who said Biden got very close to her face and called her a "pretty girl. "
The additional accounts bring the total number of women who have brought forward complaints about Biden to seven, since Friday.
Biden contends his close contact is his way of showing people he cares.
"I’ve always tried to be, in my career, I’ve always tried to make a human connection. That’s my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this,” Biden said in the video posted to Twitter. “It’s the way I’ve always been. It’s the way I’ve tried to show I care about them and I’m listening. ”
But he says he understands times have changed and so should his behavior. "I get it. I get it. I hear what they're saying. I understand," Biden says. "I’ll be much more mindful. "
"I’ll always believe that governing, quite frankly life for that matter, is about connecting with people," Biden says. "That won’t change, but I will be more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space – and that’s a good thing. "
The string of accusations started when Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature, accused Biden of "demeaning and disrespectful" behavior when he kissed the back of her head.
In a column for New York Magazine, Flores detailed a backstage encounter with Biden during an event in 2014 in Nevada where he spoke to help boost voter turnout for Democrats.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," Flores wrote. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. "
Since then, three women told similar allegations stories to the New York Times and another three on Wednesday came forward in the Post.

Opinion: I worked with Joe Biden for a decade. I saw nothing inappropriate: Today's talker
Among the allegations, Vail Kohnert-Yount, a former intern at the White House, told the Post that in 2013 she met the vice president at the White House.
After shaking hands, "he put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me. I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ‘pretty girl,’" Kohnert-Yount told the Post.
Another accuser, Sofie Karasek, told the Post that she told Biden a story about a college student who was the victim of a sexual assault during the Oscars in 2016. She told the Post that after she told Biden that the student had committed suicide after the assault, Biden took her hands and placed his forehead against hers.
Karasek told the Post that it was an awkward moment and that she did not know how to react. She said she doesn't feel Biden's video apology was enough.
"He emphasized that he wants to connect with people and, of course, that’s important. But, again, all of our interactions and friendships are a two-way street," Karasek said, adding that Biden "still didn’t take ownership in the way that he needs to. "
A third woman on Wednesday told the Post that Biden held her close "for a beat too long" during a 2008 event when she was introduced to the former vice president.
Ally Coll said Biden leaned in, squeezed her shoulders and complimented her smile, according to the Post.
The allegations against Biden come amid #MeToo, a movement started nearly a decade ago that went viral in 2017 as women in Hollywood and across the country shared stories of sexual harassment and assault.

It’s led to the resignation or downfall of more than 100 entertainers, executives and politicians, including Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. , announced his resignation in 2017 after accusations of sexual misconduct.
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. , also stepped down, as well as Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. , who resigned amid reports he discussed with female staffers the possibility they could be surrogates for his and his wife's baby.
President Donald Trump suggested at an event Tuesday that Biden may have been one of the Democrats' best shots at taking the White House in 2020, then he cracked several jokes.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him, our former vice president," Trump said. "I was going to call him. I don't know him well. I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?' "
Trump again mentioned Biden while telling the crowd at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner about a general who told him defeating the Islamic State could be done within a week. "Give me a kiss," Trump said he told the general.
He continued: "I felt like Joe Biden. "
Wednesday, the president said, "I wish him luck. I do wish him luck. "
More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the years, including eight women who accused him of forcibly kissing them.
Trump denied the allegations. In an “Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced during the final weeks of the presidential campaign in 2016, Trump made lewd comments and bragged about groping women. The president said that was "locker-room banter. "

Trump's Embattled Pick for Fed Has No Plans to Step Aside

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Stephen Moore, President Trump's presumptive nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve board, said on Tuesday that he had no plans to withdraw from contention for the job despite ethical and financial problems that have surfaced in recent days.
"It's full speed ahead," Mr. Moore said in a brief interview before an event he was attending at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.
His potential nomination to the Fed has been clouded by revelations of a current tax lien and child-support issues stemming from a previous marriage. Court records show that Mr. Moore, a conservative economist and a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, was held in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than $330,000 for spousal support, child support, attorney's fees and a one-time fee to his ex-wife, Allison Moore.
Mr. Moore also owes $75,000 in federal taxes, interest and penalties, according to court documents filed last year, which said a tax lien had been placed last year on his home in Montgomery County, Md.
Mr. Moore said that the White House was "100 percent" behind him and that he did not expect any other red flags to derail his expected nomination. He declined to address the specifics of the tax lien or the contempt-of-court citation.
"It's all been resolved," Mr. Moore said.
After his divorce became final in 2011, Mr. Moore failed to pay six consecutive months of child support -- and only a small fraction of the nearly $19,000 a month that he had agreed to pay his ex-wife, according to court documents.
Mr. Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case. In 2013, the court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month. After Mr. Moore paid $217,000 toward the debt, Ms. Moore asked the court to revoke the order to sell his home, which it did.
Mr. Moore previously told The New York Times that his dispute with the Internal Revenue Service was a result of a misunderstanding. He said he had claimed both the value of alimony to his former wife, which is deductible on federal tax forms, and the value of his child support payments, which are not eligible for a tax break. He also referred questions about the tax lien to his wife, Anne Carey Moore, who also said Mr. Moore had inadvertently deducted both alimony and child support payments.
On Monday, a Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County, Va., issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr. Moore's former wife. The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal, and Mr. Moore said he planned to ask the court to seal them permanently.
A moment before the interview, Mr. Moore was overheard telling an acquaintance that the attention on his personal life had been difficult.
"It's been a stressful time," he said.
But the personal drama does not seem to have affected Mr. Trump's plan to nominate Mr. Moore, who recently impressed him with calls for the Fed to cut interest rates. When the president told reporters that he would nominate Mr. Moore, a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth, the White House had not performed the kind of vetting that is typical for nominees.
On Tuesday, Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said both he and Mr. Trump continued to support Mr. Moore for the Fed's board of governors.
"I think he'll make a great governor," Mr. Kudlow said. "We are standing fully behind his candidacy."
Asked if Mr. Trump was concerned about any of the recent allegations against Mr. Moore, Mr. Kudlow replied, "No, not at all."
He declined to specify when Mr. Moore would be formally nominated: "He's being vetted right now. He's going through the regular process. He'll do fine."
Mr. Kudlow, who was a best man at Mr. Moore's wedding, appeared to make light of the situation on Tuesday evening during a screening of a new film at the Trump Hotel.
After Mr. Moore gave opening remarks and saluted his wife, Anne, Mr. Kudlow expressed confidence in the nomination and offered a comedic caveat:
"All those good things will come true as long as you let Anne Moore deal with the I.R.S."
The audience erupted in cheers and laughter.

Trump team overruled 25 clearance denials, official says

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - A career official in the White House security office says dozens of people in President Donald Trump's administration were granted security clearances despite "disqualifying issues" in their backgrounds, including concerns about foreign influence, drug use and criminal conduct.
Tricia Newbold, an 18-year government employee who oversaw the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides, says she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year but then had those denials overruled by senior administration officials.
The allegations were detailed in a letter and memo released Monday by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. The documents, which are based on Newbold's March 23 private committee interview, don't identify the officials on the list but say they include "two current senior White House officials, as well as contractors and individuals" in different parts of the Executive Office of the President.
"According to Ms. Newbold, these individuals had a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use and criminal conduct," the memo says.
The release of the documents sets the stage for another fight between the White House and the Democratic-controlled House, and immediately drew criticism from House Republicans who called the allegations overblown and "cherry-picked."
Cummings' panel has been investigating security clearances issued to senior officials including Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former White House aide Rob Porter. That probe has picked up steam after The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner a clearance over the objections of national security officials, and after Newbold spoke out to NBC News and other news outlets about her concerns.
On Monday, Cummings said he will move this week to authorize his first subpoena in the probe. The subpoena will be for the deposition of Carl Kline, who served as the White House personnel security director and supervised Newbold. He has since left the White House for the Defense Department.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's ranking Republican, said in a statement that Cummings' probe is a "partisan attack" and an "excuse to go fishing" through personnel files. He also said that one person on Newbold's list is a GSA custodian.
Also, in a response memo circulated to Republican members, Jordan's staff cast Newbold as a disgruntled employee who had only limited knowledge of the reasons security clearances were granted. The Republican document also suggests Newbold's concerns were "overblown," saying that four or five of the clearance denials for "very serious reasons" were a small fraction of about 5,000 employees who work in the Executive Office of the President.
According to Democrat Cummings' memo, though, Newbold considered the decisions to be part of a "systematic" problem within her office where the decisions of security clearance reviewers were "continuously" overridden.
Newbold said she raised her concerns up the chain of command in the White House to no avail. Instead, she said, the White House retaliated, suspending her in January for 14 days without pay for not following a new policy requiring that documents be scanned as separate PDF files rather than one single PDF file.
Newbold said that when she returned to work in February, she was cut out of the security clearance process. The office also announced a plan to "restructure" that would remove her from a supervisory role, she said.
In response to Newbold's interview, Cummings is asking the White House to turn over the list she created as well as documents related to the handling of security clearances for several senior officials including Flynn, Kushner and Porter.
Flynn maintained his clearance even after the White House learned that he lied to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's ambassador and that he was under investigation by the Justice Department for his previous foreign work.
Kushner failed to initially disclose numerous foreign meetings on security clearance forms, and, according to the Times, career officials recommended against granting him a clearance before Trump personally overruled them.
Porter had high-level access with an interim security clearance even though the FBI repeatedly told the White House of past allegations of domestic violence lodged against him by two ex-wives.
Porter resigned after the allegations becoming public.

The art of literary humor

Texto completo: Those who read certain weekly magazines specifically for the cartoons may be overjoyed to learn about a brand-new anthology. "The Ultimate Cartoon Book of Book Cartoons" by NYC-based cartoonist Bob Eckstein focuses exclusively on works about bookstores and the literary world at large through the work of 33 cartoonists, including Sam Gross, Roz Chast, Liza Donnelly and Bob Mankoff. Some cartoons have been previously published in The New Yorker, while others are exclusive to this new title, out Tuesday. amNewYork spoke with Eckstein about his career cartooning, how he compiled this massive collection and why the internet is endangering cartoons as we know them.
How did you start cartooning?
I got into cartooning on a dare. I was finishing my book, "The History of the Snowman," and I was invited out to the famous New Yorker weekly lunch. There, I met Sam Gross, and he invited me to come back and submit cartoons to The New Yorker, and they actually purchased the first cartoon that I did. But that was just beginner's luck. It took a long time to sell the second one. I became a cartoonist and started working for Barron's, Reader's Digest, Playboy, Wall Street Journal and [in 2011] was nominated Gag Cartoonist of the Year [by the National Cartoonists Society], so I had some success.
As a newly successful cartoonist, what did you work on next?
I was writing a book on bookstores and wanted to raise awareness of independent bookstores. I spoke a lot about that on radio and TV. I'm also an expert on snowmen, man's earliest form of folk art.
What made you want to compile "The Ultimate Cartoon Book"?
This book is a follow-up to my book, "Footnotes from the World's Greatest Bookstores," which was a New York Times bestseller, and warmly received by the independent bookstore community. I couldn't get someone to do a sequel with more bookstores, so this is a celebration of bookstores and books and all the people who I've befriended who own and work in bookstores. It's a celebration of cartoons, the good old days of The New Yorker, giving a showcase and forum to veterans who we no longer see in the magazine.
How did you curate the collection?
It was very easy [to curate]. I have so many favorite cartoonists, so I made a list ranging from household names like Roz Chast to people who I know who haven't been on the radar, like Nick Downes. I reached out to all of them and invited them to be in this book. Every few weeks I have brunch with friends who are New Yorker cartoonists, and they all chimed in with opinions and which cartoons are their favorites.
And how did you organize all the cartoons?
The last stage was putting them in order, so the cartoons would complement each other, so there's a certain flow. Visually, I didn't want to fatigue the viewer. I didn't want every scene to be in a bookstore, so I thought of creative ways on how we were commenting on bookstore life without making everything the same bookstore scene. For example, there's a cartoon about the Brontë sisters out on the moors, if they had written science fiction, and Charlotte is getting sucked up into the UFO - it's an unusual way to comment on a classic without going into a scene in the bookstore. I like to keep the viewer surprised.
In addition to themes, did you aim to include a wide range of voices in the collection?
When I chose who the cartoonists would be, I kept diversity in mind, young and old [cartoonists] and different styles, but that kind of comes naturally. That's the case with the top cartoonists. They are diverse and come to the game with their own voice. I prided myself by making selections based on merit more than anything else. Nothing political, no back story, but the cartoons are simply the funniest cartoons I could find that were about bookstores. My end game was to make the book as funny as it could be.
What is your advice for aspiring cartoonists?
Cartooning isn't an easy business, but hopefully this book will help make it an easier business to get into by making people more aware again of cartoons. It's a little bit of a forgotten thing and I hope that in some way I'm shining a light back on cartooning. The main thing is to find your own voice and state your own point of view. Art is about storytelling and your ability to tell a story.
Has the internet changed cartooning?
Unfortunately the internet has made the art of cartooning a less valued commodity, just like it's harder for photographers to sell images or musicians to sell physical albums. With cartoons, people can lift them from the internet and people can steal more easily. Unfortunately society doesn't value our artists the same way we have in the past, but I'm hoping having a physical book of cartoons changes that perception.

Texto completo: What's a day like tracking President Donald Trump at the White House?
"Like you'd expect," said Doug Mills, photographer with The New York Times, "never a dull moment with this president."
Except, maybe, on this particular Friday, when Trump was on his way for a weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his getaway in Florida, which left Mills a day of sorting through credentials and expenses during a rare down day.
It also gave Mills, who had a hand in two Pulitzer Prize-winning efforts in a career that spans to Ronald Reagan's time in the White House, time to catch up with Brian Lamb ahead of a trip to Purdue University, the C-SPAN founder's alma mater.
On Wednesday, Mills will join Lamb on campus to meet with students and hold a "Center for C-SPAN Conversation" Q&A about a career that has produced a stack of iconic photos: Ronald and Nancy Reagan waving from a Bethesda Naval Hospital window after the president was treated for cancer in 1985; George W. Bush getting the news whispered into his ear about the terrorist attacks of 9/11; Bush, again, rallying first responders, bullhorn in hand, in the 9/11 aftermath in New York City; and, more recently, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi giving Donald Trump a sarcastic clap during the 2019 State of the Union.
Question: So, if the president being at Mar-a-Lago means a day off this time, what is a typical day, if you're chasing the president?
Doug Mills: My normal day is to go to the White House at 8 or 9 in the morning and wait to see what happens. Usually the night before, we get a schedule from the White House press office that tells us what the president's doing the next day. Within that schedule are events that could be open or closed to the media. ... Very often, even though it says closed press, the president will start his meeting and ask his staff, "Where's the media? Go get them." They'll bring in the White House travel pool or the in-house pool. That pool will assemble in the briefing room, and we'll be ushered into the Oval Office, Cabinet Room, Roosevelt Room or wherever it is to do an event. If it's something that's open press, or we know that we're going to get coverage of it, then we start planning when we get there, and take our day from there. It's never a dull moment. It's certainly not a dull moment covering President Trump.
Q: So, how do you cover someone like President Trump compared to other presidents that you've covered?
Mills: Let's see, no different, other than the unexpected, which is always something. I think that's something that he thrives on, also. Being the president, I think he thrives on the spontaneity – just something happening. As far as previous administrations ... it's one of those things where we have more access to Donald Trump than we've had to really any president since I've been there.
Q: Has that been good or bad?
Mills: It's been great. For a photographer, you couldn't ask for anything better. More pictures, more access to events. We're in events a lot longer than we've normally been in events. Honestly. I started with Ronald Reagan. A normal photo op with each president, sometimes you're in for two minutes or 10 minutes. With Donald Trump, they can be an hour and a half. You can go into a Cabinet Room and be in there 90 minutes.
Q: How do you figure that with the fact that he seems to love to fall back on this distrust of the media, yet you have all this great access. How do you make sense of that?
Mills: I know. Because he always talks about that, which is one of those things that, obviously, irritates everybody who's in the media and covers the White House. When he says the "fake news media," sometimes when he's around us, he'll say, "Not these guys, but the other fake news." ... If there's somebody in the room that he knows he doesn't agree with, he will call them out. Whether it's CNN, (CNN White House correspondent) Jim Acosta, or somebody else. It's usually Jim who he usually has some sort of, not confrontation, but a little beef back and forth. There are a couple of other reporters who he can go toe to toe with, and he does.
But, it's one of those things. I don't know how to explain it other than he knows how to drive a news cycle unlike any other president.
It used to be, my experience has shown me, that presidents would come in on a certain week and say, "OK, this is education week," or, "This is infrastructure week," or, "This is health care week," or, "This is health care month," or whatever. And everything they do or talk about all day is all about that subject. That doesn't happen with this guy. We can be told there's going to be a lot of stuff about trade this week. Then he'll start off on immigration, and it gets completely turned upside down, and the week turns into immigration rather than trade or whatever, and it just goes back and forth. He's able to drive news cycles now like nobody else because he can do it via Twitter or assembling the (press) pool at the White House and talking to them.
In that press pool are all the major players within the media, whether it's AP, Bloomberg, Reuters, New York Times, The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal. And that's the way he can drive it. He can drive the news cycle three different stories in one day. So, for a photographer who's in my position, it's like a win-win.
Q: How do you handle implications of media bias? I mean, you could make the president look stupid or heroic, probably in the matter of a minute, on every story. How do you approach that kind of thing, knowing that readers and viewers are going to interpret everything you shoot, particularly with this president?
Mills: Because he is so polarized, no matter what kind of image I take and put it on Twitter or Instagram, or whatever, people are either going to hate it or love it. As a photographer with The New York Times, my most important thing I can do is be fair. If he happens to be surrounded by a bunch of sheriffs (for an event about border control) and it all goes well, then all of a sudden the story completely changes to something where a reporter or the subject gets under his skin, and now he is yelling about it – which he often does – or gets very forceful, then I've got to show that.
He is one that makes a lot of different faces. He is easy to illustrate. He wears his feelings on his sleeves. You can tell what kind of mood he's in when you enter the room. Obviously, in the last few days, we've seen quite a shift in his mood. The whole staff seems happier now, after the Mueller report has come out. He seems to be in a much better place, and a much more confident place. ... I think I've been around long enough to know there are photographers or reporters who sometimes can be leaning one way or the other. I can't do that. I'm sure if I was, then the Times would call me out on it, whether it was too positive of Trump, or too negative, or whatever. ...
I am very conscious of it, though, I really am, because we are in such a polarized time right now. If you go to a rally and tell them you're with The New York Times, the first inclination is, "What? New York Times? Oh, you guys hate him." I'm like, "Wait, it's not like that. Nobody hates him." But that's where we are right now. So, it's hard, but it's challenging, and that's why I love it.
Q: How'd you land this gig?
Mills: I've been at this gig a long time. I started at a small newspaper in Virginia. I've been in Washington all of my career. So, I went from a small newspaper in Virginia, covering mostly sports and local news, to United Press International where I was, I think, one of the youngest photographers to be hired in the Washington bureau. I came in and a couple months into my job they were like, "Hey, kid, you got the night shift for the next year. So, go over to the White House and relieve the day photographer." So, I started covering Ronald Reagan, and then fell in love with covering politics, because it was a lot like sports. There always seemed to be a winner or loser, and there was a lot of things on the edges that were really important.
Q: Of all that time, who's been the best president to shoot?
Mills: I would say that Barack Obama was probably the most photogenic. Donald Trump is by far the most iconic. You see a picture of him, and you know right away who it is. Whether it's his hands, his hair, his stature, because he's tall, he's heavy set, he wears big black jackets. He's just so easy to pick out of a crowd. And Obama, you couldn't take a bad picture of him just as far as just his nature, his charisma, his smile, his thin build. But that doesn't mean that Ronald Reagan didn't take great pictures, and George Bush didn't take great pictures. And Bill Clinton, you couldn't make a bad picture of that guy greeting crowds. Because he would climb into a crowd like he was surfing. Just all engulfed.
Q: I'm looking at your photo right now of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the State of the Union giving the president that pity clap (after Trump called for an end of the "politics of revenge.") Does it feel like a sports moment – like, say, Odell Beckham Jr. catching some crazy pass in an NFL game? People who were on Trump's side, or against Trump, probably knew exactly what she was doing. But do you shoot that and say, "Yeah, I got that moment that really shows it?"
Mills: That's perfect for what I was thinking. Every moment, every photo op or every event you go to, you're looking for the peak action. You're looking for that moment that illustrates that photo op, that event, the State of the Union, whatever. ... I was listening to him, and he was talking about the House turning over and different leadership, and that sort of thing, and they were playing off of each other. But when he said (that) ... I just remember lighting up. The hair on the back of your neck stands up.
You're like, "Uh oh, OK, he's going there," and then sure enough ... I was on him, watching him speak, with my camera, and then when he said that, I immediately focused on her. Because I thought she may do something. Sure enough, she reacted. I didn't know what she would do, whether she would just roll her eyes or do something. But when she did that, I was like, "OK, I know exactly what she means there." Then I immediately texted my editor, who was editing the photos. I was like, "OK, there's an important one coming next." ... She sent me back a text after she saw it and she's like, "Wow, what a moment."
I didn't realize that it would go viral. I had no idea, because I knew that there were in that room another 50 photographers shooting the same things, but from different angles. I happened to be the pool photographer on the floor, so I was the only news photographer in that location, in that position. Thank God I didn't miss it.
IF YOU GO: C-SPAN founder and Purdue grad Brian Lamb will interview Doug Mills, White House photographer for The New York Times, at 6 p.m. Wednesday, April 3, in Stewart Center's Fowler Hall.

Israel's Netanyahu aims to debunk report on 'bots' manipulation

Texto completo: Social media accounts coordinated to boost campaign, watchdog says
JERUSALEM - When Ziv Knobler arrived at work Monday, he said, he was surprised to find an image of his Twitter account featured in a dramatic front-page story in the main Israeli daily, Yediot Aharonot.
The headline above the image read: "A fake network."
The story described how Knobler is part of a network of social media accounts - real and fake - deployed to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's election campaign.
"I was really surprised to see my account mentioned," said Knobler, who added that he is a "private" father of four who works in a bank and isn't a member of any party.
Yediot Aharonot's story, which also was carried in part by the New York Times, was based on an advance copy of a 36-page report from the Big Bots Project, a nonprofit watchdog. It said the manipulative network of social media accounts was designed to "disrupt democratic elections and influence public awareness using improper means."
But when Knobler and several other account holders named by the report contacted Israeli media outlets protesting that they were simply normal citizens and part of no such network, it turned around what had appeared to be a difficult day for Netanyahu's campaign, just a week before a hard-fought election.
Netanyahu's ruling Likud party quickly released a campaign video mocking the report, and Netanyahu brought a man he said was one of the bots - "Captain George," whose real name he said was Giora - to a news conference in Jerusalem on Monday.
"Captain George, are you a bot?" asked a smirking Netanyahu. "It is unbelievable this thing - Giora is only saying what he thinks."
The man took to the lectern to say that he was not a bot. "As you can see, I'm not a robot," he said, adding that everything he writes is "from the heart."
But Netanyahu's main political rival, former military chief of staff Benny Gantz, filed a formal complaint against Likud with the Central Elections Committee, calling for a "cessation of this ugly fake news campaign."
Speaking to The Washington Post, Yuval Adam, one of the report's authors, said that specific accounts being real was not the issue.
"There are real accounts in that system, and there are real people. We did not say anywhere that there were bots, but that there are a group of accounts working together to promote an agenda," he said.
The report describes a "network made up of hundreds of accounts that have no identifying name or profile photograph." These accounts, said the report, "manipulated, slandered, lied and spread rumors anonymously" and at their height wrote and shared thousands of tweets a day supporting Netanyahu and Likud. Many of the messages were shared by the prime minister's son Yair Netanyahu and Likud campaign officials, the report said.
Adam and his partner, Noam Rotem, say at least some of the social media accounts received payment.
Though Giora, or Captain George, and Knobler denied receiving payment, the report identifies Yitzhak Haddad, an Israeli citizen, as being behind the network of social media accounts as well as a Twitter profile called "Bond."
A message published from that account Monday threatened to sue Yediot Aharonot, accusing the newspaper of spreading lies. The account holder did not respond to a request for an interview.
In the new campaign video released by Likud, Netanyahu's controversial line that Arabs are flocking to the polls - which some argue helped him win the 2015 election - is reworded to "Bots are flocking to the polls."
"It turns out that those mentioned in the article are actually real people who have been interviewed on Israeli media," Rachel Broyde, head of Likud's English campaign, told The Washington Post.
Gantz and the other top candidates from his Blue and White party held a news conference Monday, highlighting what the former general referred to as Netanyahu's house of cards. He said it was all about to come crashing down.
Tal Pavel, founder and CEO of the Cyber Empowerment Center, said the manipulation of information online is very problematic.
"When we read a newspaper or watch television news, we know how to judge the information we receive," Pavel said. "But online, we don't always know who is behind the accounts and can suddenly find ourselves taking part in something we think is legitimate, but which is really fake news."

Why Does the World Hate Haredi Jews?

Resumen: "While other municipalities are out to smother all of their open space with abhorrent high-density housing, our goal is to 'Preserve Clarkstown' and our beautiful parks! " And last year, Bradley criticized New York state's governor, Andrew Cuomo for visiting Hasidic Jewish community leaders, since they weren't, he complained, "normal Jews." Posting his message shortly after last October's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, he wrote: "Normal Jews and non-Jews alike were grieving at the JCC while they were meeting 'the guy with the checkbook.'" Bradley's fellow Rockland County politico, Lawrence Garvey, head of the county's Republican Party, recently posted on the party's official webpage the contention that Orthodoxy is "the most egregious example of women's oppression in our entire country," and that Orthodox women are insufficiently educated and forced into arranged marriages. No apology was forthcoming, sadly, from Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, former president of the Union for Reform Judaism, for writing in Haaretz that "the ultra-Orthodox political leadership" in Israel is "destroying the State of Israel."

Texto completo: A recent political advertisement from Israel compared ultra-Orthodox Jews to terrorists.
"It makes no difference if one is subjugated by someone with raised weapons," the ad proclaims to images of masked, ominous Hamas militiamen with mortars, "or by someone who isn't prepared to raise a weapon." Cue shots of a Haredi Jew next to a dumpster fire, and a gathering of Haredi rabbis on a dais, protesting the conscription of yeshiva students.
This ad, put out by Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party ahead of the April election, is shocking in its comparison. And yet, it differs only in degree from what has long been a staple of both Israeli and U.S. political discourse: the vilification of Haredi Jews.
Haredi society has long been a convenient pincushion for the jabs of ambitious Israeli politicians seeking the votes of those who dislike the bearded and hatted, the long-sleeved and hair-covered. And here, too, in these United States, Haredim have been an expedient target for ambitious American politicians seeking to keep identifiably Jewish Jews out of their neighborhoods.
Take Pete Bradley, New York councilman of Rockland County. Bradley isn't bashful about his desire to prevent Orthodox families from entering his county's public parks.
In a September 28, 2018, Facebook post, Mr. Bradley encouraged residents to call or text him if they "suspect that non-residents are using our Town Parks. "
"If I don't personally conduct the security check," he assured them, "I will ensure that the appropriate town employees arrive to perform the same."
"Remember," he cautioned. "While other municipalities are out to smother all of their open space with abhorrent high-density housing, our goal is to 'Preserve Clarkstown' and our beautiful parks! "
And last year, Bradley criticized New York state's governor, Andrew Cuomo for visiting Hasidic Jewish community leaders, since they weren't, he complained, "normal Jews."
Posting his message shortly after last October's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, he wrote: "Normal Jews and non-Jews alike were grieving at the JCC while they were meeting 'the guy with the checkbook.'"
Bradley's fellow Rockland County politico, Lawrence Garvey, head of the county's Republican Party, recently posted on the party's official webpage the contention that Orthodoxy is "the most egregious example of women's oppression in our entire country," and that Orthodox women are insufficiently educated and forced into arranged marriages.
It came as surprising news to countless Orthodox women, many of them well-educated and none forced into marriage. But more important, it came as welcome reassurance to countless bigots - of which there are many, unfortunately - that some elected officials share their biases.
No doubt, overdevelopment in rural areas is a valid concern and an entirely proper subject for discussion. But no valid concern should ever serve as an opportunity to vilify another group of people.
And yet, you see this again and again and again.
Even someone as rightfully respected as World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder isn't immune to bouts of animus toward Haredim. Despite his laudable philanthropy, which includes support for institutions that educate Jews overseas about their religious heritage, Lauder made a public statement last year that many of us in the Haredi community found particularly jarring.
In a New York Times op-ed in March of 2018, Lauder decried, inter alia, "Israel's capitulation to religious extremists." Those would-be duly elected representatives of an important segment of Israeli - and Jewish - society - traditionally observant Jews.
Again, Lauder, and anyone, can argue the merits of maintaining or trashing the religious status quo in Israel, which grants religious authority to Orthodox halachic decisors. But labeling people committed to Jewish observance as "extremists" should be beneath a Jewish leader. To his credit, Lauder subsequently apologized in a full-page ad.
No apology was forthcoming, sadly, from Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, former president of the Union for Reform Judaism, for writing in Haaretz that "the ultra-Orthodox political leadership" in Israel is "destroying the State of Israel." And, in case readers might assume that he was waxing metaphorical, he took care to add "Literally."
That same paper reported earlier about how some American Jewish federations had funded an ad cam paign conceived by non-Orthodox movements to vilify Haredim. The campaign reportedly posted nearly 1,000 signs and billboards in Israeli cities, reading, in Hebrew, "We are liberating the Kotel - Enongh with Haredi domination."
Subjugation. Capitulation. Domination. Run for your lives, normal people! The barbarians are at the gate!
Again, one can argue for the jet tisoning of the religious status quo in Israel, in law or at the Kotel But it can be done without incitement or demonization.
Compounding the effects of anti-Haredi animus is how the community is ignored in other contexts where it shouldn't be.
Assaults on Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn's Crown Heights and Boro Park have become almost commonplace of late: 15, at last count, since mid-October, in the former neighborhood alone. And almost no one outside of the Jewish media cares to even report on it.
Where one does find considerable coverage of the Haredi community is when one of its members is accused of doing something wrong or has actually committed a crime. That would be fair enough if there were more coverage in the general Jewish media and non-Jewish media of the community's myriad laudable acts and its educational outreach to other Jews.
But when attacks on Haredim are ignored and the community shows up exclusively in reports of accusations or wrongdoing, well, that inexorably leads to generalizations.
Yes, we have our ethically and morally challenged members, like any group. But isn't the essence of prejudice generalizing a group's worst examples to the entire group?
The vilification of Haredi Jews should horrify all good people.

Texto completo: Oprah Winfrey
emphasized the
importance of the word intent.
What insights can former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Richard Branson impart about running your small business? Solid ones, it turns out.
Those three were the powerhouse speakers addressing the crowd of 11,000 at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last month.
Though neither the conference nor the speeches were political, Obama did take the opportunity to call on us to respect our democracy and each other.
"We live in such a polarized time," Obama said at the Salt Lake City event presented by Qualtrics, the experience management software company recently bought by SAP for $8 billion.
"If you watch Fox News, you're in one reality, and if you read The New York Times, you're in a different reality. ... It's been challenging to have a common conversation. ... If we listen to the voices that help us rediscover our common hopes and dreams and values rather than constantly gravitating to those things that push us apart, that oftentimes are designed to make us angry ... we can accomplish big things."
Obama also said: "Things like rule of law, competence and facts are not partisan ideas. Nor do they happen automatically. There must be citizens who insist that they happen. A democracy is a garden that must be tended to carefully."
Here are other insights helpful to small business owners:
Overcoming fear: "What's happened to me over the last decade is a shedding of fear," Obama said. "(There were) times when you were constrained by, 'Man, I don't want to screw this up, let people down, be seen as a failure.' ... I was a better president in my second term not because of policy, (but) you get enough reps and familiarity that you stay focused on the task and not on how you are doing the task."
Handling your ego: "By taking your ego out of what you do, it liberates you and makes you more able to do it," said Obama. "You get more accomplished. ... One of the problems with people in big jobs is they start feeling like, 'I have to project that I have every answer.'" He said he was not afraid to ask questions and rely on those who had more expertise on a a particular subject.
Being clear about your goals: Oprah Winfrey emphasized the importance of the word intent. "I don't do anything without thinking about what I ultimately want the energy, the motivation I'm putting into it (to be). ... The intention is the force field that carries from the action and all the way to the end result." Oprah told her staff, "Don't come to me with an idea unless you know why you're doing it."
Hiring: Obama and Richard Branson had good advice on hiring. "I was good at making sure that the people who are working for me, with me, were there for the right reasons and there was a core integrity to what they were doing," said Obama. And Branson: "Find somebody that's better than yourself and leave day-to-day (issues) to someone else. ... Don't try to do everything yourself."
Employee treatment: "All that business is, is a group of people," said Branson. "We (at Virgin companies) do everything we can to insure we have the happiest people. ... The reason people leave companies is because they're not being listened to." He also decried the lack of required paid holidays in the U.S., the worst holiday policy of any advanced economy. "Something of a disgrace," he called it.
Company culture: "If you can build a culture where it's about solving the problem, or getting the work done, as opposed to who's getting the credit or 'how much money am I making out of this' or what have you, that builds a transparency that allows for good decision-making because there's clarity about the goals and objectives and values at the heart of the organization," Obama said. "And it also means that you don't have big scandals and indictments."
Purpose: Oprah's "show wasn't about a show nor is any of our work really about the work," Winfrey said. "It's about how you use your inner self, your one grand, big, precious life in service to the world. ... Ultimately you want to be able to live out the fullest, highest truest expression of yourself as a human being."

Lyft IPO: 'It's Probably Overpriced'

Texto completo: Ride-sharing giant Lyft had its initial public offering (IPO) last week. Archrival Uber and other big-name, billion-dollar techies should follow soon. Investors see big bucks: They'll buy an IPO and ride the next Amazon to unfathomed heights.
In the 1980s, that dream meant getting in on the ground floor of the next Apple. Now it's the next Google or Facebook.
My advice: Don't waste your time – or money.
In my 1987 book, "The Wall Street Waltz," I detailed why IPO really means "It's Probably Overpriced."
Thirty-two years and one huge dot-com crash later, many missed the memo. Folks only remember the super winners such as Apple and Intel. They forget the flame-outs includng Pets.com, Webvan and, well, the majority. Average all IPOs, and returns are sad. Early booms usually bust.
Few winners
University of Florida professor Jay Ritter studied IPOs launching from 1980 through 2017. The facts? After the initial pop, IPOs trailed similarly sized peers by an average 3.3 percent a year over their first five years. As with most speculative investments, a few winners mask legions of laggards.
IPOs often rise out of the gate, sometimes hugely. Thank investment bankers for that. Those handling the IPO get big bucks for hyping the sale and attracting buyers. So they whip up a mindless frenzy. The excitement and lure of magic returns suck in otherwise rational folks. The party can last days, even weeks, as stories of quick gains attract suckers who hate missing out. But when it stops, the stocks often get clobbered. Even such long-term winners as Apple and Facebook spent time in the wilderness after debuting.
One problem: The companies' and buyers' incentives aren't aligned. An IPO has two main purposes: raising money and giving early backers a big payday. That requires a high price – too high, usually, to be priced well for buyers. Even when the price does pop, by the time retail investors can buy, the new stock has typically changed hands several times, eating up much of your potential gain. The early birds got the worm.
No stock bubble
That IPOs over-price is actually good news for investors now. It is abnormal, relative to history, to have so many huge companies that haven't "IPOed" yet. How long have we heard Lyft, Uber and Airbnb IPO chatter? Years! That's bullish for stocks overall. That the entire group of them in recent years didn't find fancy pricing on public markets tells you stocks weren't overvalued. No bubble here.
The presumed 2019 IPO rush isn't reason to sell, though. Yes, IPOs often frenzy near market peaks. But when quality firms with strong sales and business plans first start going public in numbers, it signals a healthy latter-stage bull market. The dangerous time is when investment bankers are pushing slop with scant sales or hopes of ready profits. The 1990s demonstrated this.
According to Ritter, IPO issuance peaked in 1996, with 677 new offerings. By 2000, when stocks peaked, there were only 380 IPOs. The difference? Those mid-1990s IPOs were higher-quality firms, overall and on average. The few big successes among them drove a mania for more IPOs, leading to the late-decade slop crop, when new issues blew their cash more often than Austin Powers said, "Groovy, baby."
Today's impending IPOs aren't so scary, with positive cash flows and long-term business plans. Moreover, investors aren't blinded by euphoria. There is more than abundant skepticism now – about everything.
But instead of gambling on IPOs, just own stocks. Benefit from the bull market that inspires IPOs. Be an investor, not a speculator.

Texto completo: From Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime to Blue Apron and beer of the month, your debit or credit card statements are likely littered with subscriptions that are costing you dearly.
Not that all subscriptions are bad. You might be happy to pay a monthly fee to work out at the gym, for instance. But recurring charges can be insidious, some eating away at your wealth when you don't value the subscription anymore. Three $30-per-month subscriptions don't sound like much until you realize they can total nearly $1,100 per year.
Inertia leads to a dozen free trials morphing into mainstays on your MasterCard. (Maybe not much longer, though. MasterCard has said it will require merchants to get your approval to proceed with charges after a free trial ends, although it applies only to physical-product subscriptions, like home-delivered sampler boxes.)
"The situation with subscriptions could end up being death by a thousand cuts when it comes to your budget," says Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
Adding to the problem are so-called gray charges, deceptive and unwanted credit and debit card charges that stem from misleading sales and billing practices. They total more than $14 billion a year among U.S. cardholders, according to a 2013 study by industry research firm Aite Group.
Here's how to spring-clean recurring charges so you can spend on things that matter to you more.
Subscription audit. Job No. 1 is to identify recurring charges. Scan recent payment statements, including credit cards, debit cards or online accounts, like PayPal. Go back 12 months to catch auto-renew annual subscriptions. Don't ignore the analog world: lawn mowing, home security monitoring, pest-control service and memberships in social and professional organizations. Some credit card issuers, such as Citi, identify recurring charges in your online account.
Multiply by 12. To feel the full impact of your subscriptions, multiply monthly charges by 12 to get an annualized idea of what you're spending. If you see yourself keeping the subscription five years, do that math, too. Then, a seemingly insignificant $30-per-month expense becomes $1,800.
"On the surface, subscription costs may seem minimal, but when you add them up it can really pinch your monthly budget," says Paul Golden, spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education.
Reassess value. Do you use and value the subscription? A gym membership is perhaps the best example of a noble subscription gone wrong - when you quit going but continue paying. Ask yourself if a subscription saves you money or time. Has it lived up to its promise? "It's a good idea to do a subscription evaluation on a regular basis - perhaps a couple of times a year," Golden says.
Is it redundant? If you have cable or satellite TV, plus Netflix, YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video, you have overlap. "There are so many redundancies across those platforms that you're more or less paying for the same service over and over again," McClary says.
The same assessment goes for streaming music services, cloud storage and phone services. Are you hanging on to a landline for no reason?
Opt to share. Can you legitimately share a subscription? "Some of these subscriptions offer a buddy pass," McClary notes. YouTube TV allows family groups to share subscriptions, and certain New York Times subscriptions come with a bonus subscription to share. Some families choose to group their wireless phones on a single plan to lower costs.
Don't forget about freebies at your local public library, which can substitute for subscriptions: digital access to books, audiobooks, movies, music and magazines.
 Downgrade. Downgrading or subscribing seasonally can work, too. Can you downgrade from the premium to free version of software or website access? Are you getting value from your credit card's annual fee? You can probably downgrade to a fee-free card with the same issuer and keep your long credit history.
Cancel. Liberally pause or cancel services. You can always restart and resubscribe later. You might even receive a discount offer to return.

Legislature on right track in helping recovery

Texto completo: Say what you want about the 2019 legislative session. I certainly have. But it's hard to deny that there's been a sea change in attitudes across party lines about issues of recovery and re-entry for people who've struggled with addiction and/or had trouble with the law.
That may be one silver lining of our opioid crisis. It's touched so many lives that more and more people can have empathy now. It's harder to shut people out when they have a name and face.
Several bills were passed by huge margins that should make life easier for people trying to put their lives back together.
One makes it easier for people to recover a driver's license. Another would require the state to issue photo IDs to people getting out of prison - something that makes it a lot easier for people to find housing and jobs and get to work. Yet another removed license barriers to enter some occupations. Another ended the lifetime ban on SNAP food assistance for people with drug convictions.
One of the biggest victories in the last legislative session was the passage of Senate Bill 152, which allows for the expungement of some misdemeanor and felony convictions. Recently, The New York Times reported on a Michigan study of what that can mean to people.
Here's the good news:
"... people who get expungements tend to do very well. We found that within a year, on average, their wages go up by more than 20 percent, after controlling for their employment history and changes in the Michigan economy. This gain is mostly driven by unemployed people finding work and minimally employed people finding steadier positions.
And the research shows that giving people a second chance doesn't compromise public safety:
"... contrary to the fears of critics, people with expunged records break the law again at very low rates. Indeed, we found that their crime rates are considerably lower than those of Michigan's general adult population. That may be in part because expungement reduces recidivism.
The bad news was that only a small percentage of eligible people actually got the expungements, as in around 2,500 out of possibly hundreds of thousands (Michigan is a big state). Also, they took a long time to get. Only 6.5 percent got them within five years of becoming eligible.
We've had some experiences like that here with earlier efforts, where legislative or policy victories don't reach as many people as we'd like. The takeaway is that the process needs to be as simple as possible and that people need to know they are eligible get the help they need to walk through the process.
That could be where people of good will could make a huge difference. Churches, synagogues, mosques, businesses, community organizations, public agencies and individuals could all play a role.
Surprisingly, those bills passed with relative ease. The hard part will be making sure their intended results really happen.

Texto completo: The news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that President Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors and the Russian government," Mr. Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."
Mr. Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Mr. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Mr. Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."
Mr. Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone.
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Mr. Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians."
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that."
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians."
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy."
And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Mr. Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mr. Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Mr. Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Mr. Trump's Helsinki summit, Mr. Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Mr. Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called [Trump's] behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."
This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Mr. Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Mr. Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes." In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash."
Now, Mr. Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Mr. Trump was right to revoke Mr. Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst in the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Texto completo: At the beginning of "The Brink," Stephen K. Bannon appears, as he often does, wearing two shirts and wielding two cellphones. In the course of this fast-moving, tightly packed, at times unnervingly entertaining documentary (directed by Alison Klayman), he wears a number of metaphorical hats, some of which are knocked off his head.
Bannon flies around the United States, meeting with and campaigning for Republican candidates loyal to President Trump, including Roy Moore in Alabama. He flies around Europe, meeting with members of far-right parties, including France's National Rally (formerly the National Front) and the Brothers of Italy. Given his walking papers by the White House in the wake of the murderous Charlottesville, Va., "Unite the Right" rally, Bannon is eventually dumped from Breitbart News and cut loose by prominent financial backers. The New Yorker disinvites him from its festival. None of that seems to faze him much.
A monster to his ideological foes and an occasional embarrassment to his allies, Bannon possesses a curious kind of charisma. "The Brink," which made its debut at Sundance in January, is the second documentary about him to emerge from the festival circuit in the past year. (The other one, Errol Morris's "American Dharma," has yet to secure distribution in the United States.) Bannon likes attention, and journalists and filmmakers like to give it to him.
This is partly because, in spite of his frequent statements of contempt for "lefties," "the opposition party" and "the fake news" -- more or less synonyms in his lexicon -- he clearly enjoys the company of these adversaries. He's always game for a debate or a bull session. The only times he loses his cool are when underlings or colleagues disappoint him.
Klayman, whose previous subjects include the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and the Cuban-American painter Carmen Herrera, spent more than a year filming Bannon in the air, on the road and in his Washington townhouse. She captures a lot of interviews with reporters (from publications that include Politico, The Guardian and The New York Times), in which Bannon is friskily combative but almost never hostile.
He gives good quotes. He contradicts himself. He spars over facts and semantics, generally in gruff good humor. After an appearance on British television, he is almost giddy at the toughness of the questions he faced. "This movie is going to crush me," he says with a smile, referring to the fact that it frequently shows him, an avowed populist class warrior, on private jets and in five-star hotel suites.
Bannon's sometimes ironic demeanor and perpetually rumpled appearance may be temperamental attributes, but they are also tactics. He looks like he's having fun, while his opponents appear humorless in their indignation. Depending on who he's talking to, he can be coy about some of his views and alliances. He adamantly denies that attacks on George Soros or nefarious "globalists" are anti-Semitic code, and denies that some of his European confreres are really the heirs to Fascism they resemble to the naked eye. He may seem to treat politics as a grand game, but there is no doubt that he takes himself and his beliefs seriously and that he has weaponized his own personality in the service of what he views as a revolutionary cause.
"The Brink" is a movie that people who hate Bannon may embrace -- they are surely the intended audience -- but that doesn't mean Bannon himself will hate it. It both exposes and flatters his vanity. His ego is the film's ostensible subject and connective tissue, but also something of a red herring.
In a little more than 90 minutes, Klayman races through hundreds of news cycles from 2017 and 2018, inducing an especially acute version of the information whiplash that characterizes the Trump era. Horror alternates with grim comedy. Events you may have forgotten about collide with others you can't believe took place so long ago, or so recently. Bannon harks back to earlier moments -- Hillary Clinton's "deplorables" speech; the scandal he calls "Billy Bush week" -- as if they were Civil War battles. In a sense, they are.
[Video: A preview of the film. Watch on YouTube.]
The war as he understands it extends beyond particular battleground states or congressional districts, though he pays close attention to those. What Bannon calls the nationalist-populist movement -- there are other, more precise names for it -- has scored victories in Hungary, Poland, the Philippines and Brazil, and his current project is to knit together like-minded, far-flung rightists in an antiliberal, anti-immigrant counterglobalism.
There is a lot of money behind this, and it would be interesting to know whose. But money is one topic around which Bannon insists on discretion, shooing Klayman away when terms are being talked. He is otherwise remarkably transparent about his goals and theories, as if he has nothing to fear from exposure. Which is, frankly, terrifying.

Kraft Asks Judge to Suppress Video Evidence in Sex Case

Texto completo: Robert K. Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, has asked the judge overseeing his case on charges of solicitation of prostitution to suppress key evidence against him, including video that the police have said shows him receiving sex from a masseuse at a spa in Jupiter, Fla.
The filing in Palm Beach County on Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Kraft, who was charged with along with 24 other men, to have the misdemeanor charges thrown out and keep the video of the incidents on which they are based from public view.
Last week, Mr. Kraft asked that the evidence be kept private only until his case was finished.
The fate of the video, which could prove embarrassing as well as incriminating, has turned into the central tug-of-war in the case, which began in late February when the police in Palm Beach County charged Mr. Kraft and the other men with soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia spa.
The case has garnered international attention for its mix of sex, celebrity and sports, and Mr. Kraft's decision to fight the charges has turned what are normally perfunctory legal proceedings into a high-stakes game of chicken with prosecutors and the police in South Florida.
In their filing on Thursday, Mr. Kraft's lawyers said they had asked the judge in the case "to suppress video recordings that are the fruits of an unlawful sneak-and-peek search warrant that the Town of Jupiter Police Department used to spy on Mr. Kraft and others, while they were in the private rooms of a licensed spa (the "Spa"), receiving treatment from licensed masseuses."
The lawyers described the video surveillance as a "governmental overreach" and maintained that the search warrant was filed under false pretenses because the human trafficking the police contend was taking place in the spa has not been proved.
"Florida resorted to the most drastic, invasive, indiscriminate spying conceivable by law enforcement -- taking continuous video recordings of private massages in which customers would be stripping naked as a matter of course -- in order to prosecute what are at most (according to Florida's own allegations) misdemeanor offenses, as to which (according to Florida's own affidavits and search warrants) a wide array of alternative, benign modes of proof was readily available," the lawyers wrote in their filing.
Mr. Kraft's lawyers also asked that evidence related to a traffic stop, in which the police pulled over a car in which Mr. Kraft was riding, also be suppressed.
It is the videos of Mr. Kraft's two visits to the spa in late January, though, that are the most consequential.
Last week, Sheriff William Snyder of Martin County, citing Florida law, said that the videos might be made public once the case has concluded.
This week, news organizations, including ABC, ESPN, The Associated Press, The New York Times and the publishers of numerous newspapers, including The Miami Herald, filed a motion to oppose Mr. Kraft's request that the evidence in the case be kept private.
In their filing, the news organizations said that the Florida Constitution "does not provide a right of privacy in public records."
In addition, they said, "Florida courts also reject the notion that simply alleging embarrassment alone is sufficient grounds to defeat Public Records Act disclosure mandates."
The judge in the case has scheduled a hearing for April 9 to create a schedule for further proceedings. Mr. Kraft may have settled the case before then, however.
Last week, the state attorney in Palm Beach County offered to drop the charges if Mr. Kraft and the other men agreed to pay a fine, perform community service and agree that if the case went to trial, the prosecutors would win. That would effectively force Mr. Kraft to admit guilt in the case. He has opted not to accept the plea and instead to contest the case.

Adam Schiff has no business on the Intelligence Committee

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Madre inmigrante acusada de muerte de dos hijas acepta irse del país para evitar la cárcel

Texto completo: Haya Konte, una madre inmigrante de El Bronx (NYC) cuyas dos hijas infantes murieron en el incendio de su apartamento, llegó a un acuerdo de culpabilidad de homicidio por negligencia criminal, optando por irse del país para evitar la cárcel.
No había detectores de humo en funcionamiento en el apartamento y el fuego fue causado por la quema de incienso mientras Konte (29) lavaba la ropa afuera, en abril de 2016, según los bomberos.
Konte, que estaba embarazada en ese momento, dijo que pensaba que un compañero de residencia estaba en casa cuando cruzó la calle para lavar la ropa.
El acuerdo de culpabilidad fue acordado con su ex esposo, el padre de las niñas fallecidas de 2 años y 18 meses de edad, dijeron las autoridades.
Su tercer hijo, una bebé de 2 años, estuvo en el tribunal ayer, cuando el Fiscal Auxiliar de Distrito Morgan Dolan pidió que se impusiera la sentencia aprobada por el padre “de las dos niñas que murieron como resultado de la acción de la señora Konte”, citó New York Post.
Nacida en Francia y criada en Gambia, Konte no se convirtió en ciudadana estadounidense, a pesar de que su entonces esposo sí lo era.
El mes pasado le dijo a The New York Times que no sabía a qué país se iría con su bebé.

Texto completo: BANKING
Wells Fargo CEO resigns Timothy J. Sloan, the embattled chief executive of Wells Fargo, abruptly stepped down Thursday, the company announced. Sloan, who has been at the company for 31 years and became chief executive in 2016 after his predecessor resigned under pressure, has been facing intensifying criticism about the bank's culture and sales practices. Wells Fargo said Sloan, 58, would be replaced by the bank's general counsel, C. Allen Parker, on an interim basis as it searches for a permanent chief. Wells Fargo, once regarded as among the nation's best-run financial institutions, has been reeling since it admitted in 2016 that it had for years opened thousands of fictitious accounts in customers' names, improperly charged them fees and sold them unwanted products. Since then, the bank has been hit with numerous financial penalties by regulators. Last year, the Federal Reserve punished Wells Fargo for its yearslong pattern of misconduct by barring the bank from expanding until it cleans up its culture and establishes better internal checks and balances. Sloan twice pushed back his estimate for when the Fed would lift its restrictions. It wasn't clear what prompted Sloan to tender his resignation. He appeared before a congressional committee this month and defended his work repairing the bank's practices and culture. Lawmakers from both parties attacked his record. After Sloan's testimony, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — Wells Fargo's primary federal regulator — took the unusual step of publicly criticizing the bank. Days before his Capitol Hill testimony, The New York Times reported that many Wells Fargo employees felt they remained under intense pressure to reach the types of internal sales targets that bank executives had insisted were no longer in force. — NEW YORK TIMES
RIDE HAILING
Lyft raises $2.34b in IPO Lyft Inc. raised $2.34 billion in its initial public offering, pricing its shares at the top of an elevated range in a listing seen as a bellwether for Silicon Valley companies, according to people familiar with the matter. The No. 2 US ride-hailing company priced shares Thursday at $72 each, after increasing the marketed range on Wednesday to $70 to $72, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren't public. The company later said in a statement that it had increased the size of the offering to 32.5 million shares from 30.8 shares. At that price, the IPO gives Lyft a market value of more than $20.5 billion, based on the shares that were to be outstanding after the IPO. That value rises to almost $25 billion, including restricted stock and greenshoe shares that could be issued by underwriters. The San Francisco-based company beat its larger ride-hailing competitor Uber Technologies Inc. to the market. Uber is expected to publicly file for its offering in April, kicking off a listing that could value it at as much as $120 billion, people familiar with its plans have said. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
THEME PARKS
Disney to ban smoking at theme parks Disney is eliminating smoking areas at its theme and water parks in California and Florida. The company said in a statement on Thursday that smoking also won't be allowed at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex or Downtown Disney in California starting May 1. Smoking areas will be available outside the parks and those entertainment areas. Disney Springs in Florida and the company's hotels also will have smoking areas. The smoking policy was part of several rule changes the company is making at its parks. Loose or dry ice won't be permitted for coolers or cooler bags, and Disney is limiting stroller sizes to 31 inches wide and 52 inches long. The company also said stroller wagons wouldn't be allowed after May 1. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
CYBERSECURITY
British inspectors find significant risks with Huawei software British cybersecurity inspectors said Thursday they found significant technical issues in Chinese telecom supplier Huawei's software that pose risks for the country's mobile networks. It's the latest salvo in a global battle over Huawei, which the United States says could give the Chinese government backdoor access to sensitive data worldwide. The annual update on Huawei Technologies' security said officials are not confident Huawei is up to fixing the problems, pointing out that the company still hasn't done anything to address flaws identified in last year's report. Thursday's report said it's possible to only give "limited assurance" that long-term national security risks from Huawei's involvement in critical British telecom networks can be adequately managed. The US government wants its European allies to ban the company from next-generation mobile networks set to roll out in coming years over fears China's communist leaders could use Huawei gear to carry out cyberespionage. Britain has so far resisted, saying it can manage the risks without resorting to a boycott. The European Union is also leaning toward a similar approach, with the bloc's executive commission avoiding a ban when it released security recommendations for 5G networks earlier this week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
30-year rate has steepest drop in a decade Purchasing a home just became a lot cheaper, thanks mostly to the Federal Reserve's decision to put its interest rate hikes on hold for now. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage plunged to 4.06 percent this week, down from 4.28 percent last week. That's the steepest weekly drop in a decade. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FINANCE
Goldman Sachs to pay record $45 million fine in UK Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s UK unit must pay a record fine of 34 million pounds ($45 million) for failing to provide accurate and timely reporting relating to 220 million transaction reports between 2007 and 2017. The failures, including 9.5 million transactions that weren't reported at all, were violations of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directives, or MiFID, regulation designed to ensure markets are safer and more transparent, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said Thursday in a statement. Goldman Sachs got a 30 percent reduction by cooperating with the FCA and agreeing to settle. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ONLINE COMMERCE
Amazon to hire 800 engineers in Austin Amazon.com Inc. says it will hire an additional 800 engineers in Austin, Texas, the company's first major US office expansion since backing out of a corporate campus in New York. In February, the online retailer abandoned plans for a campus in Queens, New York, amid opposition from local politicians and labor groups. Amazon said it will distribute the 25,000 jobs formerly bound for New York among some 17 research and development offices in North America, including Austin. As part of the Austin expansion announced on Thursday, which Amazon says was in the works before the withdrawal from New York, the company will occupy an additional 145,000 square feet of office space in the city. Amazon continues to plan for an expansion in Northern Virginia that it says will ultimately be home to 25,000 workers. The jobs in Austin will include software and hardware engineers, alongside research staff. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ATHLETIC CLOTHING
Lululemon shares climb on fourth-quarter estimates Lululemon Athletica Inc. shares soared Thursday after the maker of upscale yogawear topped fourth-quarter estimates and its forecast eased concerns of decelerating sales. Lululemon's new products are resonating with consumers, driving more store visits, and turning window shoppers into buyers, as well as limiting markdown activity, analysts said. Investments into digital improvements are paying off, as e-commerce penetration reached 26 percent. Shares rose as much as 16 percent to $171 in New York trading. The stock has now added almost 40 percent since the year began, about three times the gain in the 159-member Russell 1000 Consumer Discretionary Index. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Barbuto, a Casual Fixture In the Village, Is Closing

Texto completo: Barbuto, the chef Jonathan Waxman's vibrant fusion of a casual neighborhood hangout and a destination restaurant, will close at the end of May after 15 years in a former garage in the West Village.
Industria, the building it occupies on a corner just south of the meatpacking district, was sold last year, and Mr. Waxman's lease ran out at year's end. In an interview on Wednesday, he said the building's owners no longer wanted a restaurant in the space. Barbuto's last day is Friday, May 31.
"Barbuto was more than a success," Mr. Waxman said. "I regard it as the crowning glory of my career." He said he was looking for another space in the neighborhood, and would like to reopen Barbuto by the end of the year. "I hope to find a silver lining in all of this," he said.
Until that happens, many diners are likely to be as dismayed by the loss as they were by the closing of the Red Cat in Chelsea last year, which the restaurateur Jimmy Bradley opened before there was a High Line and art scene in that neighborhood. Mr. Waxman's thriving restaurant also predated the High Line, the Whitney Museum of American Art and other developments that brought throngs of tourists and new residents to the West Village.
Barbuto is Italian for "bearded," an apt description of the chef, 68, who says he isn't thinking about retiring. The restaurant, which opened in February 2004, has a wood-fueled open kitchen, bare tables, wicker chairs and garage doors that roll open in warm weather. It's where Mr. Waxman, a French-trained chef who had first caught the food world's eye when he headed the kitchen at Michael's in Santa Monica, Calif., turned to Italian cuisine.
In a 2008 review in The New York Times, Frank Bruni remarked on the contrast between Barbuto's low-key style and high culinary standards. The restaurant, he wrote, "feels wholly relaxed, and that's a big part of why I've eaten here so often. But I've also been drawn by the possibility of a satisfying meal for a price that's not stratospheric."
At Barbuto, salsa verde replaced beurre blanc and was paired with the roast chicken, Mr. Waxman's signature since the days of Jams, the Upper East Side restaurant he owned with Melvyn Master, a wine expert, from 1984 to 1990. There, Mr. Waxman brought bright, fresh California flavors to New York. The chicken is still served at the reboot of Jams in 1 Hotel Central Park in Midtown Manhattan.
Though Waxman fans can appreciate the chef's food at Jams, which borrows a great deal from Barbuto, the restaurant is in a hotel surrounded by luxury apartment towers, not brownstones and lofts.
For Barbuto's long run, Mr. Waxman gave credit to his staff, especially the general manager, Jennifer Davidson, and his wine director, Michael Kelly.
"They make it exciting for me and for the customers," he said. And he hopes that they, like his clientele, will stick around for the next Barbuto.

Recipe: Jonathan Waxman's Roast Chicken
This unadorned but deeply flavorful roasted chicken is served with a vibrant salsa verde of capers, anchovies, garlic, parsley, arugula, basil, tarragon and sage. The chef Jonathan Waxman created the dish at Barbuto, an Italian restaurant in the West Village, where it became a diner favorite. (Daniel Boulud was a fan.) Serve it with a side of creamy mashed potatoes or a hunk of good bread to soak up the juices.
Free-range organic chicken, 3 1/2 pounds
Sea salt
black pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon (preferably Meyer)
1 tablespoon capers
2 anchovy fillets
3 cloves garlic (peeled, green germ removed)
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup arugula, chopped
1/4 cup basil leaves, chopped
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 tablespoon tarragon leaves
1 tablespoon fresh chives
1 tablespoon fresh sage, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Wash the chicken in hot water and dry with paper towels. Using kitchen shears, cut out the backbone of the chicken and remove any fat. Then, using a heavy chef's knife, cut out the breastbone. Season the two halves with sea salt and fresh black pepper. Dab an earthenware or metal baking dish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place the chicken halves inside it, skin side up. Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Cut the lemon in half and place the halves, cut side down, next to the chicken in the baking dish. Roast for 35 minutes, basting every 8 minutes. Rotate the pan during basting to allow for even cooking. The chicken is done when the juices from the thigh run clear (about 165 degrees).
2. Meanwhile, make the salsa verde. Rinse capers in cold water, then drain. Soak anchovies in cold water for 5 minutes, then pat dry and remove the bones. Using a mortar and pestle (or a small mixer if you are in a hurry), smash the capers, anchovies and garlic with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl. Add all the herbs and remaining olive oil. (The mixture should be chunky, not oily.) Season with sea salt. Serve the chicken topped with the salsa verde, and garnish with the roasted lemon.
Yield: 4 servings

Recipe: Bucatini With Tuna
Bucatini is tossed with dense chunks of tuna poached in olive oil in this recipe from Barbuto in New York. Lynn McNeely, a sous-chef at the restaurant in 2005, bolstered the flavor with black olives, capers and chile flakes, and added complexity to the texture with chickpeas and a shower of bread crumbs.
Salt
1 pound bucatini (or penne)
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, smashed
1 small shallot, minced
2 large pinches chile flakes, or to taste
1/2 cup pitted oil-cured black olives, sliced
1/4 cup large salt-cured capers, well-rinsed
1/2 cup canned chickpeas
12 ounces imported canned solid tuna, drained
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
1/4 cup chopped mint leaves
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup coarse, lightly toasted bread crumbs
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook bucatini for about 8 minutes, until al dente.
2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large skillet if using bucatini, a large skillet for penne. Add garlic and shallots. Sauté until soft. Add chili flakes, olives, capers and chickpeas and cook another minute or so. Break up tuna in flakes and add. Cook until ingredients are warm. Remove from heat.
3. Drain pasta, reserving about a cup water. Add pasta, parsley and mint to skillet. Return to low heat and toss well. Add remaining olive oil and pasta water to moisten ingredients. Season with salt, black pepper and more chili flakes if desired. Transfer to a warm serving bowl, top with bread crumbs and serve.
Yield: 6 servings

Most of Levine's Claims Against Met Dismissed

Texto completo: A judge on Tuesday dismissed all but one of the defamation claims that the conductor James Levine made in a lawsuit he filed against the Metropolitan Opera last year after it had fired him amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
The ruling came just over a year after the Met fired Mr. Levine, who had been its music director for four decades and who had recently assumed an emeritus position -- making him the biggest classical music star to lose his job during the national reckoning over sexual misconduct.
Mr. Levine, who has denied any wrongdoing, sued the Met for breach of contract and defamation; the Met countersued him, accusing Mr. Levine of decades of misconduct and saying that he had violated his duties to the company and harmed the institution.
After Justice Andrea Masley of the New York State Supreme Court issued a ruling Tuesday dismissing most of Mr. Levine's defamation claims, but allowing one to proceed, lawyers representing both Mr. Levine and the Met said that they were pleased.
One of the dismissed claims centered on statements that Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, made after The New York Times and New York Post published articles in 2017 in which several men accused Mr. Levine of abusing them as teenagers or young men.
Mr. Gelb told The Times then that the Met was awaiting the outcome of an investigation it had commissioned, and made reference to "a tragedy for anyone whose life has been affected." He later wrote to the Met's supporters, calling the period "a sad moment in the company's history and a tragedy for anyone whose life may have been affected."
Mr. Levine's lawsuit claimed those statements were defamatory.
Justice Masley disagreed, writing: "The reasonable interpretation of those statements by an average reader in the whole context is that, true or false, defendants were sympathetic to anyone negatively affected or harmed in connection with the accusations; that is, the situation was 'trag[ic]' whether the accusers were harmed by alleged conduct or Levine and the Met, Levine's longtime employer, were harmed by false accusations in the press."
She also dismissed the claims that two other statements were defamatory on the grounds that they were made by the Met's lawyer in response to Mr. Levine's lawsuit.
One centered on the statement by the lawyer, Bettina B. Plevan, that the Met had conducted "an in-depth investigation" of Mr. Levine "that uncovered credible and corroborated evidence of sexual misconduct during his time at the Met, as well as earlier." The other was her statement that the Met had made Mr. Levine music director emeritus "when it became obvious that Levine was no longer physically capable of carrying out his duties as music director." (The company had announced the change in his position in 2016, when Mr. Levine was 72 and having complications related to his Parkinson's disease.)
But Justice Masley found that Mr. Levine could proceed with his claim that a March 12 statement the Met made was defamatory, since it preceded the lawsuit. That statement said that the Met had "uncovered credible evidence that Mr. Levine engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct."
Mr. Levine's lawyer, Edward J.M. Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, said he was pleased the judge had kept what he called "Maestro Levine's strongest defamation claim."
"The Met didn't just fire him," Mr. Little said in a statement. "As we have alleged, it defamed him on the way out after his 50 years of brilliant artistic genius that contributed greatly to what the Met became."
The Met's lawyer, Ms. Plevan, a partner at Proskauer Rose, said in a statement, "The Metropolitan Opera is pleased that the court dismissed virtually all of the defamation claims filed by James Levine against the Met, including the only claim against Peter Gelb."
The rest of Mr. Levine's suit is proceeding; there is a conference scheduled for next month.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Swept up by authorities after the Sept. 11 attacks, Adham Hassoun, a Palestinian computer programmer who lived in Florida, served 15 years in prison for sending support to Islamist militants abroad. His sentence completed, he then waited in immigration detention more than a year and a half while the government fruitlessly hunted for a place to deport him.
Finally, a judge ordered him temporarily released in the United States. But instead, the Trump administration, citing a little-used immigration regulation issued after Sept. 11, notified Mr. Hassoun last month that he was being declared a security risk and would be kept locked up indefinitely.
Mr. Hassoun, 56, has sued the government in a case that is shaping up to be the first legal test of that assertion of executive power. The lawsuit is the latest chapter in a series of disputes -- dating back to the opening of the Guantánamo Bay prison in January 2002 -- over when the government may label people terrorism risks to hold them in open-ended detention, and what due-process rights they have to contest their indefinite lockup.
"The government is saying it can hold someone solely because it claims he is a danger, without a justification like he's a combatant in an armed conflict or has a mental illness that prevents him from controlling his own actions," said Jonathan Hafetz of the American Civil Liberties Union, who is consulting in the case. "This is a monumentally important issue courts have never addressed."
Mr. Hassoun is difficult to deport because he is stateless. He was born in Lebanon, which did not grant him citizenship and has declined to take him. The Palestinian Authority said he may go to the West Bank, but Israel and Jordan have not consented to letting him get there, according to his volunteer lawyers, Nicole Hallett and Jonathan Manes of the University at Buffalo School of Law.
Before Mr. Hassoun's case, the government had invoked the Bush-era regulation only once, the Department of Homeland Security said. That was in a 2015 case in which the Obama administration cited the regulation to justify keeping another Palestinian man detained; he had finished a prison sentence for planting a bomb on a Hawaii-bound airliner in 1982, and the government was having trouble finding a place to deport him, too. But before a judge could rule on whether his continued detention was lawful, Mauritania took him in.
Mr. Hassoun is linked to a far more famous terrorism case: Jose Padilla, an American citizen who was arrested in Chicago in 2002. The Bush administration deemed him an enemy combatant and held him for years at the Charleston, S.C., naval brig -- including a 22-month period when he was denied access to a lawyer and interrogators subjected him to extreme isolation and sensory deprivation.
Eventually, to avoid Supreme Court review of whether its handling of Mr. Padilla was unconstitutional, the Bush administration transferred him to the criminal justice system for a trial. Mr. Hassoun was a co-defendant. They had attended mosque together, and Mr. Hassoun -- an outspoken advocate of helping oppressed Muslims -- was accused of recruiting Mr. Padilla to the "global jihad" cause.
Evidence presented at the trial showed that Mr. Hassoun had separately been under F.B.I. surveillance for years. He was accused of sending money and supplies to mujahedeen fighting in places like Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya, under the guise of humanitarian relief for Muslims facing oppression.
Prosecutors sought a life sentence. But Judge Marcia Cooke balked, noting that there were no specific, identifiable victims of his crimes and that the F.B.I. had known what he was doing for years before arresting him -- a fact that she said "does not support the government's argument that Mr. Hassoun poses such a threat to the community that he needs to be imprisoned for the rest of his life."
In the lawsuit, Mr. Hassoun's lawyers accused the government of seeking "to impose what amounts to a life sentence on the very same basis that the trial judge considered and rejected."
The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice declined to comment.
Complicating matters, the lawsuit says that the F.B.I. has produced a memorandum assessing Mr. Hassoun as a security risk for reasons that go beyond his actions two decades ago, citing allegations that he used unspecified "incendiary rhetoric" in Muslim prayer services at the immigration facility and tried to recruit three unidentified fellow detainees for illegal activities.
Neither the government nor his defense team would provide the memo to The New York Times or describe the purported illegal activities. Ms. Hallett and Mr. Manes called the claims false, and said making the details of such "slander" public would only smear their client's reputation. Part of their argument is that he has a right to a hearing to confront his accusers and contest the credibility of such claims.
While the dispute over Mr. Hassoun is new, the dilemma it raises is not. A longstanding immigration statute says that when a foreigner is subject to a final removal order, the government should take him into custody for deportation. But it does not dictate what should happen if that goal proves impossible.
In June 2001, the Supreme Court rejected the idea that the government can hold such people indefinitely. Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that it would be unconstitutional to interpret the law as permitting perpetual civil detention, and set a general six-month limit for such custody.
Still, in that case, Zadvydas v. Davis, the majority also suggested that exceptions could be made for "special circumstances," like if a detainee had a mental illness that caused him to pose a threat to public safety. Justice Breyer also noted that the case before the court in 2001 did not involve terrorism.
Several months later, the Sept. 11 attacks touched off a period of heightened fears about Islamist terrorism, including sweeps aimed at rounding up and prosecuting or deporting hundreds of noncitizen Muslim men -- like Mr. Hassoun.
Meanwhile, in November 2001, the Bush administration issued its regulation responding to the Zadvydas ruling. Among other things, it carved out an exception to the six-month release rule for foreigners deemed to be linked to terrorism. But that provision sat on the books, unused, for years.
Mr. Hassoun's lawsuit challenging it may face steep obstacles, legal experts said.
The five-member conservative bloc that now controls the Supreme Court appears less sympathetic to people facing deportation than the court was in 2001. The court ruled 5 to 4 last week that immigrants facing deportation proceedings because they committed crimes, including minor ones for which they were released from criminal custody long ago, must be detained during that process without bail.
The Supreme Court will be unlikely to order Mr. Hassoun released if the Trump administration says he poses a security threat, predicted Jamil Jaffer, a George Mason University law professor who held several national-security positions in the Bush administration.
"The government's hand is stronger when it comes to evaluating a national-security threat because courts generally give the president more deference in that space," he said. "I just don't see a court granting him relief."
Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas, Austin, law professor, noted that a provision in the USA Patriot Act, enacted in October 2001, creates a way for the attorney general to hold terrorism-linked foreigners in open-ended custody if they cannot be deported. While the government is not invoking that statute, he said, it may argue in court that its existence means the regulation is reasonable.
Several dozen noncitizens will complete prison sentences for terrorism-related crimes in the coming years, according to a database compiled by the Center on National Security at Fordham Law. Many are from troubled nations like Somalia where officials may be reluctant to repatriate them.
"The creation of any precedent will be a big deal," Mr. Vladeck said. "Once there is case law on the books that the government is able to subject even some immigrants to perpetual detention, it's not hard to imagine the government taking advantage of it."

Texto completo: California police say they are investigating a fire at a mosque as an arson and a hate crime after graffiti that made reference to the deadly New Zealand mosque attacks was found at the scene.
The incident happened early Sunday about 30 miles north of San Diego in Escondido, police said in a release. Police say the graffiti was left by the suspected arsonist.
Seven people were in the mosque at the time, but no one was injured, police say. The fire caused minor damage to the outside of the building.

The San Diego office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the incident: "It is disturbing enough that some sick individual would attempt to burn a house of worship to the ground, but referencing the slayings in New Zealand is beyond the pale," Executive Director Dustin Craun said in a written statement.
The statement says the California incident was motivated by the "same hatred" held by a gunman who killed 50 people in a terrorist attack on two mosques in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand.
Police believe the fire was set with an accelerant, but there are no suspects as of Tuesday, The New York Times reported. The fire, which scorched an outside wall, was put out using a fire extinguisher, the newspaper reports, citing police.
Escondido police said Sunday that Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives agents are assisting with the investigation.

Texto completo: On Monday, Apple announced something altogether different from its typical new products that consumers can touch and feel: An entertainment service that in some ways resembles Amazon Prime and will include Apple's own films and television shows with Hollywood stars including Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steven Spielberg.
At an event at its campus in Cupertino, California, Apple said it was launching a raft of new services, from news to video games and a credit card. Its biggest initiative is entertainment streaming service Apple TV+, which, in an effort to attract a wider audience than just Apple customers, will be available on smart TVs.
Apple didn't announce a price for the streaming service or when it will launch.
Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event, in the Steve Jobs Theater, after a short opening movie that paid homage to Apple's products, from the iPhone to Siri. "We've also been creating a collection of world class services, and that is what today is all about, Cook said.
Cook highlighted what the company has already been doing in the services realm, such as iCloud information storage, and touted the way they work across a myriad of Apple's devices, all the while keeping users' information "private and secure, a line that drew big applause.
Usually, when Apple holds big, splashy press events, it unveils a new product like the iPhone or the MacBook. For years, Apple's business has centered around the iPhone, but sales of that once-revolutionary but now commonplace device have slowed. And the entire world of computers has been flipped on its head. Apple has been diversifying beyond hardware, selling iCloud storage to its customers, a $10 a month music streaming service and movies and television shows through iTunes.
But Monday's anticipated announcement takes that diversification to a whole new level.
First, Cook unveiled a new service called Apple News+, a $10 a month subscription service that will include magazines like Sports Illustrated and The New Yorker.
"Quality journalism matters, Apple said in a short video touting the magazines it would include in the new service.
What Apple didn't talk about in its presentation is that it had largely failed to convince some of the largest newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, to participate in the service. Though it briefly featured The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times during the presentation, it more or less focused on magazines.
The design of the paid news app downplayed the publications behind individual articles. Articles about Costa Rica from several publications were mashed together into one place. That might be good for readers, but it takes away the power of distribution from the publishers of the magazines and hands it to Apple, much like what happened to the music industry when Apple launched 99 cent songs on iTunes in the early 2000s.
Another selling point for its news service: Apple uses "on-device intelligence to make recommendations, so that the company doesn't actually know what you read and the data can't be used to target advertisements, the company said.
Apple also announced Apple Card, which builds on the popularity of its Apple Pay service that allows people to pay for products using their phones and watches. Offering its own credit card, with the backing of Goldman Sachs and Mastercard, allows Apple to cut out some of the middlemen in payment transactions. Apple is offering consumers competitive cash back and no late fees.
Apple Card requires Touch ID or some other form of authentication for payments to reduce fraud, and it said it won't collect purchase data. It said Goldman Sachs won't sell or share data with third parties, which implies Goldman would be able to get some data on users. Apple didn't say whether it would pass on late payment information to credit agencies.
As far as Apple's bottom line is concerned, its announcement of a credit card may one day turn out to be the most significant announcement of the day. It puts Apple one step closer to placing itself in the middle of a large swath of consumer transactions. By combining this with the company's vast number of customers who carry around its devices, its payments services have the potential of giving Apple a massive, low overhead revenue stream.
Cook said iOS has become the largest gaming platform in the world, with roughly 300,000 games on the platform. With its new gaming subscription service called Apple Arcade, the company says it has created a way to help game developers monetize their games.
Apple Arcade appears positioned to compete in some ways with Google's new "Stadia service, which was announced last week. Google will sell a game controller that will allow people to pay high quality videogames on any screen, from televisions to tablets, without an expensive gaming PC. Apple Arcade and Google Stadia both still have not named a price.
Apple is expected to invest many billions a year, according to analysts, on making video content to compete in a crowded market that includes Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and Disney. It's a gamble with no guarantee of success, which signals just how important these new businesses are to Apple.
Last week, as hype around Monday's event steadily built up in the media, Apple made three hardware announcements, with upgrades to its iMac Pro, iPad Mini and AirPods. There was no news conference devoted to those announcements. It was unusual, because it showed Apple's hardware taking a back seat to its new services-oriented businesses. Wall Street liked what it saw, rewarding Apple with a stock bump that boosted the company's market cap above $900 billion. It had fallen below $700 million in January after news of slowing iPhone sales.
The real magic in consumer technology is happening less and less inside the devices people carry around and more and more in server farms scattered around the world, where massive amounts of data get processed and then transmitted to gadgets like the Amazon Echo or Google Home.
In essence, the gadgets people are excited about buying are becoming vessels for sending and receiving data. And in that area, Apple has fallen behind companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which now pull in significant revenue from selling cloud services, which is a fancy term for data center usage and storage.
The invite Apple sent to invitees said simply, "It's show time. The question now is whether Apple can break a leg.

Texto completo: The prime minister of Romania stayed at President Donald Trump’s hotel during her trip to Washington over the weekend. She is the first foreign government leader known to have booked a room at the property in more than a year.
The stay at the Trump International Hotel by Viorica Dancila, who is attending the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, provides the latest piece of evidence that Trump’s company continues to do business with foreign officials. Such payments could violate the Constitution’s anti-corruption provisions, which prohibit the president from accepting gifts or “emoluments” from foreign governments.
Dancila was seen Friday night inside the hotel’s atrium surrounded by a group of about eight people after leaving the hotel’s BLT Prime restaurant. She made her way to one of the building’s elevators, which are operated with room keys of hotel guests. She was seen again on Sunday, entering an elevator shortly after 6 p.m. On Monday she tweeted a picture of herself meeting with Vice President Mike Pence at AIPAC.
Trump still owns the hotel through a trust from which he can draw money at any time. Trump’s lawyers have rejected the idea that a hotel visit from a foreign official can be construed as an emolument, saying instead that it is a “fair value exchange” not addressed in the Constitution. Trump faces several lawsuits over the emoluments issue, filed by the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Maryland, Democratic lawmakers and a government watchdog.
The Trump Organization has pledged to donate all profits from foreign governments to the U.S. government. As of February 2019, the company had provided the Treasury Department with more than $340,000. The company has not explained how it calculates foreign profits or disclosed if those figures were audited by an independent party.

Glad to meet Vice-president Mike Pence @VP, in #WashingtonDC. ???? and ???? have a strong #StrategicPartnership. We will continue to work together in strenghtening the economic and security dimensions of our cooperation. pic.twitter.com/DM2a9xvUFW
— Viorica Dăncilă (@VDancila_PM) March 25, 2019
It is not clear how many rooms the Romanians booked, what price was paid or who paid. The Romanian Embassy in Washington did not respond to phone calls or emails. Last year, the Romanian Consulate in Chicago held its national day celebration at the Trump hotel in that city.
A spokeswoman for the Trump hotel declined to comment. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The last foreign leader known to have to stayed at the hotel was Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, in September 2017.
Romania, a member of NATO, has a range of military and trade interests with the U.S. It recently increased its military spending, in accordance with Trump’s complaints that European states should bear more of the costs of their defense. Dancila has said she would like Romanian citizens to be able to travel to the United States without a visa; so far, the State Department has not added Romania to its visa waiver program.
While Dancila was in Washington, she announced her intention to move her country’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, though it’s not clear whether that will happen. Last year, the United States moved its embassy to Jerusalem, but few other countries have followed it.
Also during her visit to Washington, Romanian news outlets reported that Dancila met with executives of a number of companies, including three military contractors: Oshkosh Defense, Parsons and Textron.
Seeking Influence in Romania
Two key Trump allies have made overtures to the Romanian government since Trump was elected.
One of them is the president’s attorney in the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, Rudy Giuliani. Last August, Giuliani sent a letter to Romania’s president “to express my concerns about continuing damage to the rule of law in Romania being done under the guise of effective law enforcement.” Romania, which Transparency International ranks among the most corrupt countries in Europe, has seen several high-profile graft prosecutions.
Giuliani told The Washington Post he had been hired to write the letter by the consulting firm Freeh Group International Solutions, but he did not specify his client.
Giuliani was at the Trump International Hotel on Friday. He was not seen with Dancila, and his spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Another Trump associate, fundraiser Elliott Broidy, has also reportedly done business in Romania. The New York Times reported Broidy’s security company, Circinus, sought contracts with the Romanian government.
In January 2017, the leader of Dancila’s political party was a guest of Broidy’s at a celebration of Trump’s inauguration at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Liviu Dragnea posted a photo of Trump to his Facebook page the night before Trump was sworn in as president.
Broidy resigned from a Republican National Committee leadership post in 2018.
Dancila, who took office in January 2018, is an ally of Dragnea. Their political party, the Social Democratic Party, has a lobbyist in Washington, who was hired in 2017 to arrange a meeting between Dragnea and Trump, according to disclosure filings. Romanian media reported that Dragnea was invited to the AIPAC meeting but did not attend.
Dragnea himself has been a target of Romania’s prosecutors. He applauded Giuliani’s letter criticizing prosecutorial “excesses” in a statement on his website.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the U.S.-supported news agency, wrote in November that Dancila “has little executive power. Liviu Dragnea, the chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party, basically runs the government but can’t be prime minister because of a conviction for vote-rigging.”

Texto completo: ORLANDO, Fla. - He appeared as if a hologram at first - then solid - suddenly there and clear as you or I, at the edge of the forest behind Trish Bishop’s home in Kissimmee.
It was a Thursday in March 2013, the glow of the afternoon tucking in for the day behind the trees. He stood tall, at least 6-foot-3, perhaps 220 pounds and certainly muscular, wearing a formfitting tan-colored uniform, boots and gloves. He lingered by the crape myrtle tree in the middle of the backyard.
When he turned around, it was his face, she remembers, that stopped her.
Bulging eyes jutting so far out of the sockets that Bishop wondered whether he could close them. Skin white as chalk. And a jaw so large, it dispelled any notions the government worker had of the visitor being human.
“If you compare a human jawbone to his, we would be a Chihuahua to a pit bull,” Bishop said.
Paralyzed with fear, she watched as what she believed to be an alien appeared to climb invisible steps, stopping often to snatch glances at her from where she sat on her back porch, fumbling with her phone to appear as though she couldn’t see him.
Her finger was pressed on the number “9” to dial for help.
When he was about 10 feet off the ground, he turned his back to her and pulled himself up - “into a UFO?” she thought - and was gone.
Bishop sat stunned. “I’ve got a freaking alien in my backyard,” she thought.
It would be four years before she told anyone her story, before she’d discover the Mutual Unidentified Flying Objects Network, a nationwide organization 50 years old, and file her report under case number 84886 with the local Florida chapter. But she worried: Who would believe her?
These days, more people than you’d think.
Across restaurants and meeting rooms in the United States, MUFON groups still gather every month to discuss cases like Bishop’s with the enthusiasm that once gripped the nation during the Cold War, when UFO sightings still made a splash on the front page.
The Space Coast group, made up of some former NASA employees and engineers, has 118 members, the largest in the state. Across the U.S. they number 3,500, with additional offices in 42 countries.
For many years, they were alone entertaining UFO theories. No more.
In the past two years, scientists, politicians and professionals have increasingly been willing to touch the taboo subject and perhaps lend a little credence to those who still believe.
In December 2017, The New York Times uncovered that the U.S. had gone so far as to fund a secret, $22 million, five-year project to study UFO claims.
Since then, respected researchers, from the chairman of Harvard University’s astronomy department to at least one scientist at NASA, have come out with theories, albeit controversial ones, that suggest closer study of the role extraterrestrials may play in certain phenomena.
What’s changed, said Robert Powell, an executive board member on the nonprofit Scientific Coalition for Ufology, is our understanding of the universe. As scientists have discovered more Earth-like exoplanets and begun to delve into the options for interstellar travel - one idea includes using a laser-propelled, microchip-shaped probe - the conversation has been shifting.
“We still think of ourselves, as a species, as the center of everything,” Powell said. “Once you … at least start to discuss interstellar travel, you have to admit that, if there is intelligent life out there, then they have to be able to travel interstellar, too.”
The challenge with UFO and alien sightings has always been the lack of evidence. Bishop said she was too scared to take a photo of her alien. Little to no consequential evidence exists in other cases.
Psychology can explain some of it. Common explanations include people projecting their unconscious desires onto something, or a predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories informing what people think they saw, said Alvin Wang, a psychology professor at the University of Central Florida.
People who believe they witnessed something may seek out others who reaffirm that belief, like “being in an echo chamber,” Wang said.
“People tend to hold on to that particularly if it fits in with their worldview and their belief system that there are other beings that inhabit the universe,” Wang said. “And they get … confirmation support, when they are members of a UFO believers community.”
But Bishop stands by what she said she saw. She works a government security job with three area contractors and said she has no reason to lie.
And she’s on the hunt for ET now. After reporting her case in 2017, she bought three hunting trackers on eBay and set them up in her backyard. They’re motion activated, and sometimes they’ll go off in the night and capture 6,000 images - but there’s nothing in the frame. She once caught a Tic Tac-shaped blur in the sky she believes to be a UFO.
“I just think it’s a belief thing until you actually see them,” Bishop said. “You always gotta wonder.”
Some people, like Kathleen Marden, have been wondering all their lives.
It was September 1961 when the then 13-year-old got the call: Her aunt, Betty Hill, and her uncle, Barney Hill, said they’d seen a UFO on their drive through the White Mountains in New Hampshire.
Betty’s dress was torn and Barney’s shoes were scuffed. There were two hours they couldn’t account for and Barney was sure he’d seen eight to 11 figures dressed in black shiny uniforms that were “somehow not human,” said Marden, who now lives outside Orlando.
It wasn’t until the Hills were put through a hypnosis session by Boston psychiatrist Dr. Benjamin Simon that their stories of being taken into a UFO and physically examined were revealed.
“They were interested in the skin, in the skeletal structure, in the joints,” said Marden, MUFON’s director of experiencer research. “They examined their hands, they took their shoes off, they examined their feet, they did tests on them that appear to be testing their nervous systems, as well.”
The Hills’ alleged abduction was made public in 1965 - and the story gripped the nation. “Did They Seize Couple?” the Boston Traveler posited. “I Was Quizzed in ‘Space Ship,’  ” read another headline.
Marden has dedicated her life to uncovering the truth behind what she says was government tampering with the Hills’ case and has written four books about her aunt and uncle and flying saucers. She’s seen the change in perception about UFOs in the public and scientific community firsthand.
“I absolutely do think that there is a shift, that people are giving more credence to this than they did in the past,” she said, pointing to the 2017 New York Times story on the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program as the turning point.
The program was run by military intelligence official Luis Elizondo and put together at the request of then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. It ran from 2007 to 2012 in partnership with businessman Robert Bigelow’s company Bigelow Aerospace, which studied cases of American military personnel observing unknown objects.
One case in particular garnered attention when it was declassified because videos showed a craft with no apparent propulsion moving at alarmingly fast speeds. It was filmed in 2004 by two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets off the coast of San Diego.
Navy pilot Commander David Fravor, who witnessed the Tic Tac-shaped craft, told The Washington Post in late 2017 that he maintained it was “something not from Earth.”
Then came Harvard’s astronomy department chair, Avi Loeb, a renowned scientist whom Time magazine named one of the 25 most influential people in space in 2012.
He, along with colleague Shmuel Bialy, wrote in Astrophysical Journal Letters that a thin interstellar object seen passing through our solar system called Oumuamua “is a lightsail, flowing in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment.”
Loeb went a step further, theorizing that, “alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.” The theory has provoked the ire of the scientific community, but Loeb has stood by it.
Is it aliens, for sure? Loeb can’t say. He just says he can’t find another explanation.

Texto completo: On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S streets. This was two days after Don Winslow published "The Border," the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels ("The Power of the Dog" and "The Cartel") about the cartels and the U.S. "war on drugs." He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.
His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures.
Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong - body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. "supermax" prison, and his incarceration - he has been in custody since 2016 - will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow's description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels' billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly - very thinly - disguised President Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people.
However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market - 30 million consumers of illicit drugs - must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, "so much cash," Winslow says, "they don't even count it, they weigh it." But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, "Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled."
The "supply side" attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The "demand side" is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick - and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick.
Says New York University's Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today's prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. "Fifty grams of fentanyl - just over an ounce and a half - has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it's way, way cheaper." Three hundred micrograms - "roughly the weight of a grain of table salt" - can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
"We have," Kleiman says, "about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980" but today's dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, "cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order."
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is "still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis." And "the fentanyls aren't going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they're just the first." Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow's epic.
George Will is a columnist for the Washington Post.

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: "The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid."
Julie Lythcott-Haims
Former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success"
While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid."

Texto completo: Within three hours of landing at Palm Beach International Airport on Friday, President Donald Trump had canceled sanctions imposed a day earlier against North Korea, imposed sanctions against a Venezuelan bank, cautioned would-be followers of ISIS, appointed a long-time supporter to the Federal Reserve Bank and met with the leaders of five Caribbean nations.
The frenetic paced afternoon began moments before the president stepped off Air Force One, when the president posted a two-part Tweet that warned would-be followers of ISIS.
“ISIS uses the internet better than almost anyone, but for all of those susceptible to ISIS propaganda, they are now being beaten badly at every level....” Trump wrote in the first tweet.
“...There is nothing to admire about them, they will always try to show a glimmer of vicious hope, but they are losers and barely breathing. Think about that before you destroy your lives and the lives of your family!” Trump wrote in the second tweet.
With ISIS fresh in mind, Trump approached a group of supporters and reporters on the PBIA tarmac with two maps of Syria. He said one showed ISIS’ extensive strongholds in Syria in November 2016 and the other he said showed the vast rollback and recapture of those areas under his administration.
“You guys can have the map,” Trump said, handing it to reporters.
At 12:47 p.m., about 15 minutes after arriving at Mar-a-Lago, Trump tweeted that he had offered a position on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors to Stephen Moore, a conservative economic adviser who helped draft Trump’s tax proposals in the 2016 campaign.
Moore, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, has been an outspoken critic of the Fed’s interest-rate policy and, as a nominee, will likely face intense criticism in the U.S. Senate from Democrats.
Trump took a short break but was back on Twitter at 1:22 p.m., announcing that he was canceling sanctions against North Korea that the Treasury Department had imposed on Thursday.
“It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!” Trump tweeted.
The Treasury Department on Thursday imposed new sanctions on two Chinese shipping companies that it says have been helping North Korea evade international sanctions. The sanctions came less than a month after a summit meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader, collapsed in Hanoi, Vietnam, without a deal.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the decision to reverse the sanctions was a favor to Kim, according to the New York Times.
At Mar-a-Lago, Trump and first lady Melania Trump appeared outside one of Mar-a-Lago’s arched entrances for photos with leaders of the Bahamas, Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and St. Lucia.
The president did not take any questions from reporters, who were then escorted to Mar-a-Lago’s Gold and White Ballroom to view the beginning of talks with the Caribbean leaders. Trump was joined by National Security Adviser John Bolton, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and John Sullivan of the State Department.
“We look forward to spending a lot of time together this afternoon and discussing ways that we can be beneficial to you and you can be beneficial to us,” Trump told the other heads of state.
While the leaders met, the White House released a statement announcing sanctions against a Venezuelan bank and four subsidiaries that it said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his regime had used as “slush funds to evade United States sanctions and to move money out of Venezuela.”
“The United States will continue to take steps to pressure Maduro, his regime, and those who support him, until they step out of the way and allow a democratic transition to occur under Interim President Guaido and the National Assembly of Venezuela,” the statement read.
About 90 minutes later, the Caribbean leaders emerged and spoke briefly to reporters.
“I think in summary, the essence of the meeting was the United States expressing great support for the region, which was not expressed in awhile,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “We are very appreciative of that. We believe it will benefit the entire region.”
Although trade and investment were on the agenda, the leaders did not say whether China’s burgeoning trade and investment in the region came up during their discussions. In a statement released on Wednesday, the White House said Trump intended to address China’s “predatory economic practices.”
“We focused on trade, we focused on investment, we focused on disaster recovery and we focused on national security issues,” Holness said. “Speaking for all the members here, that is a good message for us to take back to the people of the Caribbean. I think it’s a great day for the Caribbean.”
In a statement released after the meeting, the White House said the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency that helps U.S. businesses invest in developing areas, would give priority status to the five countries and send a high level delegation in the next 90 days.
Asked about Venezuela, St. Lucia Prime Minister Allen Chastanet said it was not a focus of discussion but said: “I think we all recognize there’s a problem in Venezuela. Most people recognize the need for new elections.”

Texto completo: Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story - and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction - and invitation - to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.
Bilal Qureshi is a culture writer and radio journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek, and on NPR.

Texto completo: An announcement could be coming any day now.
It's become increasingly evident former Vice President Joe Biden is likely to declare his candidacy for president, especially after his comments at a Democratic fundraiser in Dover this past weekend.
Here are the five ways Biden recently has hinted at a possible presidential run:
The slip at the Democratic fundraiser Saturday During a fundraiser on Saturday night, Biden he told Delaware Democrats he has the "most progressive record of anybody running."
He quickly backtracked, saying he meant to say "anybody who would run."
The rest of his speech at the First State Democratic Dinner sounded like one he could make on the campaign trail. He criticized President Donald Trump and the Republican Party and emphasized the importance of restoring civility in American politics.
He's 95 percent there Speculation around Biden's presidential campaign intensified when The New York Times reported earlier this month that his strategist is telling Democrats the former vice president is 95 percent of the way to deciding to run.
The Times also reported that Biden's advisors are offering campaign positions and looking at sites for headquarters.
'Run, Joe, run' When Biden spoke last Tuesday at the International Fire Fighters Association in Washington, the crowd erupted into applause and chanted "Run, Joe, run" when he alluded to his candidacy. Biden told the crowd to save its energy.
"I may need it in a few weeks," he said. "Be careful what you wish for."
Coons is 'confident' Biden is going to run U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del, has been serving as a quasi-Biden spokesman in recent weeks, speaking publicly about how he is "confident" and "all but certain" Biden is going to run for president.
"I'm optimistic he's going to run," the junior senator said on "CBS This Morning" last week. "Everything is put in place but that last decision, which understandingly is a big decision."
He's asking other Democrats for their support Earlier this month, Biden called a senior Democratic lawmaker, telling congressman he is running for president and asked for his support, The Hill reported.
During this conversation, Biden asked if he "could bounce some campaign strategy ideas off the lawmaker and invited the lawmaker to sit down with him in person in the near future," The Hill reported.
Trump takes on Biden after verbal slip in speech President Donald Trump is targeting Joe Biden after the former vice president made a verbal slip about a potential 2020 presidential bid.
Trump, who has eagerly followed the 2020 Democratic field, tweeted Monday: "Joe Biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for President."
Added Trump: "Get used to it, another low I.Q. individual!"
At a dinner over the weekend, Biden said he had "the most progressive record of anybody running." But Biden hasn't announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House. He quickly corrected himself, but the comment prompted frenzied speculation.
Trump previously labeled California Congresswoman Maxine Waters and actor Robert De Niro as being "low I.Q."
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

‘Allegiance,’ a musical inspired by George Takei’s internment story, comes to Hawaii

Texto completo: “Allegiance,” a musical theater treatment of the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, was inspired by the experiences of film, TV and stage star George Takei — who is perhaps best known as Sulu in “Star Trek.” It opened on Broadway in November, 2015, with Takei starring as camp survivor and combat veteran Sam Kimura.
On March 28, Manoa Valley Theatre presents the Hawaii premiere production of “Allegiance” at Hawaii Theatre.
Takei and his family were among the more then 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast — many of them American citizens, the others immigrants who had come into the United States legally but were denied the opportunity to become citizens — who were sent to internment camps in the spring and summer of 1942.
The United States declared war on Japan the day after Japanese forces attacked Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941. There were concerns on the West Coast that some members of the Japanese community gave their first loyalty to Japan — and, that if Japanese forces landed in California, some local Japanese would aid the invaders. People of Japanese ancestry living in an Exclusion Area were sent to the camps.
Takei was 5 when his family was sent from Los Angeles to the Rohwer War Relocation Center in the rural swamps of southeastern Arkansas. Internees were allowed to take up to 50 pounds of their belongings with them. They had to make whatever arrangements they could for everything else.
He was 8 when they were released from the Tule Lake Segregation Center in northern California in 1945.
“The internment shaped who I am. It was a defining experience in my life,” Takei said, taking the call on March 5 from Vancouver, Canada, where he is working as both an actor and as cultural consultant for “The Terror: Infamy.”
“The Terror” is related to Takei’s experience as well: The 10-part AMC network mini-series is set during World War II, and follows a young man’s attempt to understand and fight a malevolent entity responsible for a series of deaths among Japanese-Americans in an American internment camp.
The mini-series is the latest in a growing list of projects Takei has undertaken in recent years to make sure that the internment of the internment of Japanese immigrants and Japanese- Americans on the West Coast is not forgotten.
“The internment has been one of the subjects that I’ve been speaking at universities on all over the country, and, indeed, in England at Oxford and Cambridge. I’ve become something of a go-to guy as far as the internment is concerned,” Takei said.
Takei shared the story last year in “American,” a short film about an elderly internment camp survivor whose memories of his experiences are stirred up by a young woman looking for information about her grandfather. He has also been working closely with the illustrator of “They Called Us Enemy,” a graphic novel treatment of his childhood experiences as an internee at Rohwer and Tule Lake, scheduled for publication in July.
“I want the story be known by future generations,” Takei said. “It’s so important for young people to have a sense of how history shapes us — and can shape us when we’re very young.”
In “Allegiance,” the Japanese-American family are California farmers, sent to Wyoming after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A young Sammy is turned away when he attempts to enlist — but he doesn’t give up on his goal of proving his loyalty to America. Hardship and romance ensue in what the New York Times described as a “singing history lesson,” influenced by classic dramatic musicals such as “Miss Saigon.”
DANN SEKI plays the dual roles of Sam Kimura in the present day, and Sam’s grandfather — known by the Japanese honorific Ojii-chan — in flashbacks. Kristian Lei plays Sammy’s older sister, Kei Kimura. Ethen Le Phong portrays a young Sammy. All three musical theater veterans say they feel personal connections to the characters they play.
Seki, the only one of the three born a citizen of the U.S., says his father, a Hawaii-born combat veteran of the original 100th Battalion, never shared much about his experiences. Seki channeled some of that reticence in playing Sam Kimura, a combat veteran for whom the emotional scars of the conflict have never healed.
“He was very proud of serving, I think, but I got more information about what he did from talking to some of the other guys,” Seki said on March 7, while the cast was assembling for a rehearsal.
“It’s a story that I’ve been more interested in in the last few years,” he said. “We have the movies about the men who went to fight the war — the 100th (Battalion) and the 442nd. Now we’re trying to tell the story of the folks who stayed in camps.
“The third leg that we still need to look at are the folks who chose not to go — the ‘No-No Boys,’ the people who said ‘No, this isn’t right.’ I think their story should be told as well — and we do address it in ‘Allegiance’ a little bit.”
Lei, who was born in the Philippines but raised in Waianae, identifies with the experiences of Sam’s older sister, Kei Kimura, for several reasons, including the fact that Lea Salonga, who originated the role in New York, is a friend. Lei is the most-featured vocalist in “Allegiance,” in a role praised by the New York Times for providing the musical highlight of the production.
Lei knows first-hand the experience of having a loved one in a war zone: Her husband is a Green Beret and a Purple Heart recipient.
Her character Kei is forced to postpone her career to raise Sam after Kei’s mother dies. Lei identifies, saying she “grew up immediately” helping her mother care for her younger brother, Joshua, who has cerebral palsy.
“It’s very personal,” Lei said.
“I have a nisei (second- generation Japanese-American) grandma, and I wanted to do something to honor her. … But the performance that you’re going to get is not just me finding some kind of meaning. It really is my experiences that I’m bringing to the role.”
PHONG WORKED with Takei in a Los Angeles production of “Allegiance” in 2018; he reprises his role of Sammy for MVT.
Phong’s family came to the United States from Vietnam when he was 3. Phong’s father, who worked with the American forces during the Vietnam war, was one of the thousands of Vietnamese who were left to fend for themselves when the United States pulled out.
“I was drawn to Sammy because of his struggle to find himself throughout the story,” Phong said. “Being born as an American, he didn’t have any of that history of being in Japan. I don’t remember anything of Vietnam, so there’s that relationship that I can bring to Sammy’s role.”
Phong’s feelings while taking the oath of citizenship also give him insights into the experiences of the internees — and the loyalty oaths they were confronted with during their internment.
“How could you go fight for this country, who put us in this environment?” Sammy asks, on behalf of the internees.
“When I became an American citizen, the question was asked, ‘Will you pledge your allegiance?’” Phong said.
“I had to think about it — I’m becoming an American citizen, so depending what Vietnam might do towards this country, where I have been raised in and where my loyalty is, I will have to fight with the Americans, even though I am Vietnamese,” Phong said. “Just like Sammy,” regarding Japan.
Takei’s production schedule won’t allow him to be in Honolulu for opening night, but his heart will be in Hawaii when the curtain rises.
“I learned about American democracy from my father, who bore the pain and the anguish and the degradation and the sense of total alienation (of internment). I owe so much to that extraordinary man,” Takei said. “He taught me that we have a great system, and we’ve had a history of great presidents, but they are all fallible people, and we who cherish those ideas have to be personally and actively engaged.”
“I’m an actor, so I use my chosen profession and art and craft to make that statement.”

In Our View Presidential tax returns an issue for Congress

Texto completo: The goal is laudable, but the process is flawed. The state House of Representatives should reject a bill requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on the ballot in Washington.
The impetus for the legislation is President Donald Trump's refusal to make his returns available. Since his time as a candidate, Trump has claimed that because he was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service, he could not release his tax returns. This is an absurdly disingenuous claim that is not supported by any law or policy, and it breaks with a practice that every major presidential candidate has embraced since Richard Nixon.
Releasing tax returns allows the public to see the sources of a candidate's income, be it domestic or foreign. While the president and his supporters have long claimed that investigations into Russia's influence in the 2016 election amount to a “witch hunt,” there is credible evidence that members of his inner circle met frequently with Russian operatives. The New York Times reported in January that there have been more than 100 Russian contacts involving at least 17 Trump associates.
Releasing his tax returns could help clear a cloud that has lingered over the Trump administration and reassure the public that the president is working on behalf of American interests rather than a foreign power. Instead, Trump has invited mistrust.
But while the public would be well-served if the president were to release his tax returns for the past several years, the Legislature is not the proper venue for trying to force his hand. Congress must take the lead in compelling that transparency.
Last month, the U.S. House passed H.R. 1 to require the release of tax returns (Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, voted against the bill). In the Senate, the legislation has been blocked by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Even if Congress were to pass the bill, it certainly would be vetoed by Trump, but that would not be the end of the matter.
Several House committees are empowered under the U.S. Tax Code to require Trump to turn over his tax records. Republicans in Congress have declined to seek such transparency, but the House is now under Democratic control. The chairs of those committees have said they will wait until Special Counsel Robert Mueller completes his investigation into Russian election meddling before possibly pursuing that avenue.
Regardless of how the issue plays out, it must be handled in Washington, D.C., rather than this Washington. State Attorney General Bob Ferguson told lawmakers that the state's approach is “likely constitutional” but that it “would definitely be challenged in court,” a development that could push the question beyond the 2020 election.
If Trump is kept off the Washington state ballot — Gov. Jay Inslee has expressed support for the bill — such an outcome would create as many problems as it solves. Unilaterally preventing voters from considering the candidate of a major party would exacerbate the nation's deep political divide and ratchet up the partisanship that is infecting our electoral system.
We believe that candidates should release their tax returns. That secrecy should lead to questions about what a candidate is hiding. That transparency should be a requirement for somebody who wants to lead this nation. But while voters should reject any presidential candidate who refuses to release their financial records, those voters should have the opportunity to decide fo

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's feud with the late Sen. John McCain dates back many years, to long before the real estate magnate launched a campaign for president.
Trump, who occasionally re-airs his grievances with the late Arizona Republican, launched a new line of attack during an address in Ohio Wednesday, suggesting the McCain family never thanked him for "the kind of funeral that he wanted. " Trump's role in the services were limited to allowing McCain's body to fly on planes used as Air Force Two.
How did Trump's feud with McCain begin? The late senator's war record was one of Trump's early complaints and has been a running theme. Here's a look at the back and forth:
Jan. 11, 2000: Trump, considering a run for president, criticized McCain's war service as he sized up other potential candidates in an interview on CBS. “He was captured,” Trump said, in remarks he would echo years later. “Does being captured make you a hero? I don’t know. I’m not sure. ”
June 30, 2015: McCain tried to distance himself from Trump soon after the real estate magnate entered the 2016 presidential race by suggesting immigrants were “rapists” and drug smugglers. "I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans," the senator told The Arizona Republic in 2015.
July 11, 2015: Trump hammered McCain during a campaign rally in the senator’s home state, saying he was “weak” on immigration. "We have incompetent politicians, not only the president," Trump said. "I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain. " The audience booed at the mention of McCain's name.
July 16, 2015: McCain responded to Trump in a piece in The New Yorker. The senator said Trump “fired up the crazies” and Trump responded by calling McCain a "dummy. "
July 18, 2015: Most Americans caught their first glimpse of the feud when Trump, speaking in Iowa, questioned whether McCain was “a war hero because he was captured" in the Vietnam War. Trump, who did not serve in the war, said he liked “people that weren’t captured. ” Many political prognosticators predicted the remarks would bring about the undoing of Trump’s campaign.
Feb. 9, 2016: Trump won the Republican primary in New Hampshire after coming in second in the Iowa caucuses days earlier.
April 19, 2016: McCain announced he would not attend the Republican National Convention in July, where Trump would accept the party's nomination.
May 5, 2016: McCain was heard telling supporters at a fundraiser that Trump was hurting the GOP brand with Arizona's Latino electorate, according to audio of his remarks published by Politico.
May 11, 2016: Trump seemed to backtrack from his original remarks, telling a radio program that: “You know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. ”
Aug. 1, 2016: McCain blasted Trump amid a scandal over the nominee’s remarks about U. S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. Trump criticized the fallen solder’s mother, who stood silently by her husband’s side during the Democratic National Convention.
Aug. 5, 2016: Trump reversed course and endorsed McCain. "I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office," Trump said.
Oct. 4, 2016: McCain defended Trump over comments the nominee made about soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder. Trump received criticism for saying some soldiers who return from war are "strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can't handle it. " Critics said the comment spread the misconception that veterans with PTSD are weak. McCain said the media distorted Trump's meaning. Trump thanked McCain on Twitter the following day.
Oct. 8, 2016: McCain withdrew support for Trump after a 2005 recording emerged in which Trump discussed kissing women and grabbing them by their genitalia. McCain said the recording made it “impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. ”
Jan. 20, 2017: Trump is inaugurated the 45th president of the United States.
July 19, 2017: McCain's cancer diagnosis becomes public. Days earlier, before the diagnosis was known but after McCain had undergone surgery to remove a blood clot, Trump said, "We hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him. ”
July 28, 2017: McCain joins other Republican senators to block the so-called "skinny repeal" of Obamacare, a last-ditch effort to make good on a Trump campaign promise.
Sept. 23, 2017: Trump blasts McCain for opposing the GOP attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying McCain was snookered by Democrats.
Oct. 18, 2017: McCain swipes at Trump during a C-SPAN interview, noting that during the Vietnam War “we drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur. " Trump received several draft deferments during the Vietnam War, including one medical deferment for a diagnosed bone spur in his heels, the New York Times reported.
May 5, 2018: The New York Times reports that McCain’s inner circle informed the White House he doesn’t want Trump to attend his eventual funeral.
June 20, 2018: During a rally in Duluth, Minnesota, Trump blamed McCain for the collapse of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “We had a gentleman way into the morning hours, go thumbs-down," Trump said. "He went thumbs-down. " A woman in the crowd reportedly shouted, “He’s a war hero,” but Trump ignored her and changed topics. When McCain voted against the repeal plan in 2017, he gave a thumbs down and said "no," which drew a gasp from members in the Senate chamber.
Aug. 25, 2018: McCain dies.
Aug. 27, 2018: Trump faced a public outcry after raising U. S. flags two days after they had been lowered out of respect for McCain. The American Legion and other veterans groups criticized the move, and the White House quickly lowered the flags again.
Sept. 1, 2018: Honoring McCain’s wishes, Trump does not attend the senator's funeral at the Washington National Cathedral. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, attend the service. Meghan McCain later says they were not invited by the family.
March 17, 2019: Trump tweets, incorrectly, that a court document shows McCain attempted to publicize a dossier alleging misdeeds by Trump before the election. McCain provided the document to the FBI after the election, and there is no evidence he also provided it to the media.
March 18, 2019: On ABC’s The View, McCain’s daughter, Meghan, slammed Trump’s criticism of her father, saying: “He spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it and I know it and all of you know it: He will never be a great man. ”
March 19, 2019: In an Oval Office meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Trump tells reporters he never liked McCain over differences that included Russia and health care. "I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be,” he said.
March 20, 2019: Trump expanded his attack, suggesting he did not receive a thank you – presumably from McCain's family – after Trump "gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted. "

On Privilege of Candidates, and Ambitious Plan to Deliver Florida to the Democrats

Texto completo: Andrew Gillum has more free time than he would like.
After losing his bid for Florida's governorship by less than one half of a percentage point, Mr. Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor, is now carefully planning his next steps amid speculation that he would run for president. On Wednesday, he announced he will not join the Democratic field seeking to oppose President Trump, but instead return to political organizing. He said he aims to build a voter mobilization network in Florida that will help whoever becomes the Democratic Party's nominee to capture the state's all-important 29 electoral votes.
Mr. Gillum spoke with The New York Times about why he's confident Democrats can wrest Florida from Mr. Trump in 2020, what he hopes to see from the primary field, and how he grades the performance of the Republican who beat him last year, Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The interview has been edited and condensed.
I heard your father recently passed and wanted to offer my condolences.
That means a lot, I really appreciate it.
How serious were you thinking about running for president? Did you give it real thought?
Everybody has to consider what role they play in Trump's America right now to bring this to an end. But for me, it was a pretty quick consideration. I had to put into focus that I'd spent the better part of two years running around the state of Florida and away from my three children and my wife.
[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 race.]
If Beto O'Rourke can get into the presidential race, why not Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum? Is that a sign of privilege, as some have suggested?
There's no doubt that O'Rourke enjoys a set of privileges in his decision making that other candidates don't. Can you imagine it for any of the women that are in the race for president or considering a run? They probably could not muse out loud, or in the recesses of their mind have these sorts of conversations and then say them out loud, and think it would be taken seriously or they would be taken seriously.
I recognize that, but, as I understand it, the congressman also recognizes that there is privilege that accompanies him here. That doesn't make him less deserving of consideration, it's just something that has to be acknowledged.
I think over the course of this race, we will -- and America will -- discover what Beto O'Rourke's views are. And I think he'll be measured on that.
What's the importance of this effort you're announcing Wednesday ? It's Florida-specific, right?
This is Florida-specific, but guess what -- Florida-specific impacts the nation. Twenty-nine electoral voters answers a lot, and not just for the state, but for the country. My dad used to give me this advice a lot: "Son, when you know better, you do better." And having just come from two years on the campaign trail, and having looked very critically at my own race, there's some things I learned that I recognize that we can do better at.
When Obama was on the ballot in 2008, Democrats enjoyed a registration advantage of almost 800,000. When I showed up on the ballot, that advantage had shrunk to less than 300,000. And it makes a difference, if you have more marbles on the table and more voters you can choose from and have the opportunity to produce.
Given the migration patterns in our state, and given the challenges we have around producing an electorate that's favorable to Democrats to get out and vote -- we've got to put more people in the game.
Florida is tired of being a cheap date. You can't just come in when it's a presidential election and we've got a nominee and then do a few months of organizing.
Republicans have been disciplined in our state in that way now for 24 years. And now it's time for Democrats to do the same.
Is this work only happening now because the Democratic Party and state party historically dropped the ball?
When you don't have a governor who can raise money for a party in 24 years, it's very difficult for you to expect that party to turn on a dime and pull rabbits out of the hat. I'd say it's a failure, writ large, of how people have treated Florida when it comes to organizing. It's a state to go to when you want a presidential win, but outside of that? Good luck.
What are you looking for the Democratic presidential candidates to prioritize?
I am convinced that, through our primary process, we will produce the person who's our strongest bet toward winning the White House. I hope whoever that is will be closer to my ideological end of the spectrum, but the truth is these primaries tend to produce candidates who are likely going to be our best bet to compete against Donald Trump. And more than anything, I think Democrats want to win.
But what about a Joe Biden-esque figure, a moderate who doesn't have the same type of progressive message you ran on?
Whatever message Joe Biden may carry is closer to what I carry than Donald Trump's.
But if you're Joe Biden, you're really going to have to search the recesses of your past and make sure that you're ready to reconcile those places that will put you outside the mainstream of where Democrats are today. And I expect that that's probably part of the preparation to him entering the race, right? He's got a long record, and there's a lot for him to mull over, and a lot for him to assess where he's evolved. And maybe where he hasn't.
Has Governor DeSantis been more pragmatic than you thought he'd be?
The governor recognizes what I know, which is, 30,000-odd votes separated the two of us. We each got 4 million-plus votes, and the difference was practically a rounding error. So the governor did what I think any smart politician would do: He reduced those areas in the early phases that would divide. He tacked a little more toward a pragmatic and less ideological place, and that has produced some good will for the governor. The test is how he performs, now that he has a Republican-controlled House and Senate that may push him back to either his natural leanings, or create a contrast within his party.
I know you have to go, but I keep coming back to you, Beto O'Rourke, and Stacey Abrams. It is striking that the two black candidates are currently going to work in grass-roots organizing and the white candidate is running for president? You don't have anything else to say on that?
Listen, man, we're used to working.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."
Actor Andrew Rannells' memoir is "Too Much."

Rep. King posts meme: Red states have '8 trillion bullets'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Rep. Steve King posted a meme Saturday about a hypothetical civil war between "blue states" fighting over which bathroom to use and "red states" with trillions of bullets.
The post is an image of two figures composed of traditionally Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states in fighting postures with text superimposed over the top. The caption reads: "Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use."
"Wonder who would win?" the Iowa Republican wrote on Facebook.
The post was later deleted.
The image appears to have originated in a 2013 New York Times Book Review by Michael Kinsley titled "War of Umbrage."
King's post comes at a time Muslim civil rights leaders and others have urged for political leaders to be thoughtful in their rhetoric in light of the mass shooting targeting two New Zealand mosques last week that left at least 50 people dead.
King may have posted the meme without much deliberation, as it escaped his notice that Iowa is pictured as a "blue state."
The post follows lobbying by King for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to reinstate him to congressional committee posts.
King was stripped of committee assignments by congressional leadership following years of white nationalist statements, most recently in an interview with The New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King said in the January article.
King disputes the quote in a letter to McCarthy that he has asked supporters to endorse.
"The New York Times misquoted me and misrepresented my beliefs as a freedom-loving American," King wrote.
The form letter also includes a button to donate to the King for Congress political committee.
King was defiant in a February interview with Iowa Public Television insisting, "I have nothing to apologize for."
While King disavowed white nationalism, he argued that term has been "weaponized by the left" to mean racism, but didn't give his definition of the term.
King has often voiced the far-right theory that immigration and diversity will lead to a collapse of Western civilization. Advocacy groups dedicated to rooting out hate speech say "Western civilization" used in that context is a euphemism for whites.

Texto completo: JOHANNESBURG - A high-ranking politician in South Africa's governing African National Congress was arrested in connection with the assassination of a party member who had exposed corruption in a public works project, officials said Monday.
Mluleki Ndobe, one of the most influential ANC power-brokers in KwaZulu-Natal province, was arrested early Sunday for suspected involvement in the mafia-style killing of a nationally known party leader, Sindiso Magaqa, according to party and police officials.
Magaqa, who had loudly condemned the theft of public money in the town of Umzimkhulu, was fatally shot inside his Mercedes-Benz in 2017 by two hit men who sprayed the car with gunfire. A man suspected of being one of the killers was arrested in September.
The assassination - the most high-profile in a wave of political killings that have swept across South Africa since early 2016 - came to symbolize the decline of the ANC, whose members have increasingly targeted anti-corruption whistleblowers and turned on one another in lethal fights over political posts.
Police also arrested Zweliphansi Skhosana, municipal manager of Umzimkhulu, according to party officials. Skhosana was considered the leader in town of an ANC faction that was led by Ndobe at the district level.
The two men are expected to appear in court Tuesday. It was not clear Monday what charges they would face or whether either had a lawyer.
In an interview last year, Skhosana denied the allegations of corruption in the town and accused Magaqa of making up stories to further his political ambitions.
Separately, Ndobe, the district mayor, told The New York Times that infighting inside the ANC was worse than the struggle against apartheid.
"It was better before we attained democracy, because we knew the enemy - that the enemy was the regime, the unjust regime," he said. "Now, you don't know who is the enemy."
Given the political sensitivities of the recent killings inside the ANC, few cases have led to arrests - and even fewer to convictions. The government of President Cyril Ramaphosa, criticized by human rights groups and even ANC officials for doing little to crack down on the killings, had come under increasing pressure to make progress on the investigation of Magaqa's killing.
Reflecting the party divisions, allies of each of the men involved reacted with astonishment, relief or dismay according to their allegiances.
"We are surprised," Mphuthumi Mpabanga, Umzimkhulu's mayor and an ally of Skhosana, said Monday morning. "This is bad news."
"I'm feeling better now that the law still applies," Jabulile Msiya, a political ally of Magaqa's who was inside his car during the shooting, said Monday. "We'd like to see justice happening in our town in Umzimkhulu."
Magaqa began receiving death threats in early 2017 after he accused fellow ANC members of siphoning money in the multimillion-dollar renovation of a community hall. Two of his political allies, who had supported his call for an official investigation, were killed by hit men in their homes.
Then in July 2017, hit men in a red BMW ? attacked Magaqa in his car.

Rep. King posts meme: Red states have '8 trillion bullets'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Rep. Steve King posted a meme Saturday about a hypothetical civil war between "blue states" fighting over which bathroom to use and "red states" with trillions of bullets.
The post is an image of two figures composed of traditionally Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states in fighting postures with text superimposed over the top. The caption reads: "Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use."
"Wonder who would win?" the Iowa Republican wrote on Facebook.
The post was later deleted.
The image appears to have originated in a 2013 New York Times Book Review by Michael Kinsley titled "War of Umbrage."
King's post comes at a time Muslim civil rights leaders and others have urged for political leaders to be thoughtful in their rhetoric in light of the mass shooting targeting two New Zealand mosques last week that left at least 50 people dead.
King may have posted the meme without much deliberation, as it escaped his notice that Iowa is pictured as a "blue state."
The post follows lobbying by King for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to reinstate him to congressional committee posts.
King was stripped of committee assignments by congressional leadership following years of white nationalist statements, most recently in an interview with The New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King said in the January article.
King disputes the quote in a letter to McCarthy that he has asked supporters to endorse.
"The New York Times misquoted me and misrepresented my beliefs as a freedom-loving American," King wrote.
The form letter also includes a button to donate to the King for Congress political committee.
King was defiant in a February interview with Iowa Public Television insisting, "I have nothing to apologize for."
While King disavowed white nationalism, he argued that term has been "weaponized by the left" to mean racism, but didn't give his definition of the term.
King has often voiced the far-right theory that immigration and diversity will lead to a collapse of Western civilization. Advocacy groups dedicated to rooting out hate speech say "Western civilization" used in that context is a euphemism for whites.

Worse living through chemistry

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - On Feb. 12, Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka "El Chapo," was convicted of multiple crimes related to running the Sinaloa drug cartel, Mexico's largest. Thirteen days before his conviction, authorities seized enough of the synthetic opioid called fentanyl for 100 million lethal doses. It was hidden in a truck carrying cucumbers through the Nogales port of legal entry. On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S. streets. This was two days after Don Winslow published "The Border," the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels ("The Power of the Dog" and "The Cartel") about the cartels and the U.S. "war on drugs." He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.
His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures. Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong - body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. "supermax" prison, and his incarceration - he has been in custody since 2016 - will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow's description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels' billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly - very thinly - disguised President Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market - 30 million consumers of illicit drugs - must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, "so much cash," Winslow says, "they don't even count it, they weigh it." But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, "Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled."
The "supply side" attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The "demand side" is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick - and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick. Says New York University's Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today's prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. "Fifty grams of fentanyl - just over an ounce and a half - has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it's way, way cheaper." Three hundred micrograms - "roughly the weight of a grain of table salt" - can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
"We have," Kleiman says, "about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980" but today's dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, "cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order."
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is "still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis." And "the fentanyls aren't going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they're just the first." Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow's epic.

Texto completo: [Video: The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley (2019) | Official Trailer | HBO Watch on YouTube.]
A new documentary on HBO chronicles the baffling Theranos story. And a legal drama series begins on ABC.
What's on TV
THE INVENTOR: OUT FOR BLOOD IN SILICON VALLEY (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO; streaming on HBO platforms. After Elizabeth Holmes claimed that she had revolutionized personal health care with a breakthrough blood-testing technology, Inc. magazine hailed her as "the next Steve Jobs." But an investigation by The Wall Street Journal revealed that no such technology existed, and that Holmes's company, Theranos, had taken hundreds of millions of dollars from investors under false pretenses. (Holmes and Theranos's former president were indicted on charges of conspiracy and wire fraud last year.) This new documentary from Alex Gibney ("Going Clear: Scientology & the Prison of Belief") traces how Holmes was able to swindle high-profile investors and bamboozle the world to reach her dream of becoming "a billionaire."
9-1-1 9 p.m. on Fox. Ryan Murphy's procedural drama about a group of emergency responders in Los Angeles makes its midseason premiere. The crew receives a bizarre call about a man who was attacked by a tiger shark on a freeway, and a plastic surgeon's office falls into disarray after a gas leak. And of course there's the frothy drama outside of work: After taking their relationship to the next level, Athena (Angela Bassett) and Bobby (Peter Krause) reach another milestone, and Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) tries to put her marriage behind her once and for all.
THE FIX 10 p.m. on ABC. Some have speculated that this new legal-drama series is based on the 1994 O. J. Simpson murder case. (One of the writers and executive producers of the show is Marcia Clark, who was the lead prosecutor on the Simpson trial.) Clark has said "The Fix" is not based on her experiences from that time, but it does bear some resemblance: A stone-faced Robin Tunney ("The Mentalist") stars as Maya Davis, a district attorney who left Los Angeles for Washington after she lost a high-profile murder case involving an actor, Sevvy Johnson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of "Lost"), who may or may not have killed his wife. Eight years later, Sevvy is suspected of murdering his girlfriend, and Maya is lured back to California for another chance to put him behind bars.
What's Streaming
ASSASSINATION NATION (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Take the social issues that have rattled the United States in the past few years, throw in commentary on the detrimental effects of social media and add some references to President Trump, and you get "Assassination Nation." This horror-comedy is set in a fictional town that goes haywire after an anonymous hacker exposes half of the residents' dirty little secrets. "Often it feels like reading a Twitter thread of ideas and hashtags, rather than watching a movie," Aisha Harris wrote in her review in The New York Times. Yet the final, vengeful act, she adds, "is aesthetically arresting."

Commentary: What is the ‘Utah way’? Depends on who you are.

Texto completo: If you are involved at all in Utah politics, you most likely have heard about the “Utah way” of doing things. But what exactly is the “Utah way?”
The New York Times referred to the firing squad as “a Utah way of death.” The arrival of Frontrunner ahead of schedule and under budget was described as being “kind of the Utah way.” Gov. Gary Herbert declared that “turning a blind eye and doing nothing” to help “our neighbors, our friends, and our family members” was not the Utah way, shortly before the House of Representatives rejected his Healthy Utah proposal. The phrase was used by political commentator Paul Mero to describe the Utah Compact and by Keith McMullin, CEO of Deseret Management, when referring to Utah’s business-friendly policies. Most recently, the Utah way has been trotted out when discussing the ballot initiatives during last year’s November election.
As the electorate was unwillingly subjected to having its voice as expressed through the initiative process overridden in the name of doing things the Utah way, it has become increasingly clear that the Utah way is actually just an empty phrase, ready to be filled with whatever meaning or principles the speaker desires. And in that vein, I believe this year’s legislative session has given us all a new framework through which we can evaluate the Utah way.
I don’t know how many times lawmakers said “Utah is a business friendly state” during the session. What I do know is that while Utah’s policies may be “business-friendly,” it too often comes at the cost of being “people-friendly.” Business interests always seem to come before the interests of the people who lawmakers are elected to represent. EnergySolutions showed that money talks, as they convinced lawmakers to allow them to import and store depleted uranium in the state, putting countless future generations at risk. The interests of gravel pit owners came before the health and local control of surrounding communities. Fossil-fuel industries continued to receive millions of dollars in subsidies and handouts even though many social programs went away empty-handed. Maybe helping business instead of people is the Utah way.
As a progressive, I normally don’t get my hopes up when it comes to the legislative session. But I thought this year would be different! A great bill prohibiting conversion therapy looked like it would sail through, but some lawmakers decided to disregard scientific consensus and put their faith in a few quack therapists who preferred the status quo. We finally had a hate crimes law make it all the way through the process but it was hijacked and watered down by those who couldn’t stand to see real marginalized communities receiving protection without describing themselves as marginalized too. After last year’s acknowledgment that climate change might exist, this year we swung back toward denial by striking those two words out of a resolution on wildfires. Maybe denying truth and fact is the Utah way.
And then there are those ballot initiatives — democracy in action. Claiming that the over 500,000 Utahns who voted for Proposition 3 did not know what they were voting for, lawmakers took Medicaid coverage away from tens of thousands of Utahns. Lawmakers managed to spend even more money to force these low-income individuals and families onto health care exchanges where they’d have to pay for their premiums — premiums that lawmakers proposed subjecting to a new excise tax! After saying dozens of times how much they hate the initiative process, lawmakers made it harder to get propositions on the ballot, required signers to have their names posted online, and gave the Legislature more time to change initiatives once they’re approved. Maybe showing contempt toward voters is the Utah way.
Now don’t get me wrong — lawmakers did follow the Utah way in passing many good and much-needed bills, such as compromising to create a budget in the final days of the session and protecting our immigrant neighbors by tweaking the punishments for misdemeanors . But rather than being beguiled by politicians who use this phrase to tout only the good they have done, hopefully voters will remember that the Utah way, and its meaning, is in the mind of the beholder.

Texto completo: In the last year elite college admissions has been touched by three different but related scandals. The newest one is also the most entertaining, because it includes pretend water polo players, staged standardized tests and outright bribery, all to help desperate rich people and TV stars buy their progeny into a top-flight school.
The other scandals are less amusing, involving dilemmas of race and meritocracy with no celebrity leaven. One involves revelations from the latest affirmative-action lawsuit, which has exposed how Harvard's rejection of qualified Asian applicants seems to uncomfortably resemble the old Jewish quotas of the 1930s and 1940s. The other involves a brace of Ivy League admissions offices being taken in by a tough-love Louisiana school that produced fraudulent transcripts for its African-American students, while its founder treated the kids brutally behind the scenes.
In their different ways all these scandals feed into two critiques of elite academia, one more left-wing and one more right-wing, which take different routes to the same condemnatory claim: These schools claim to be meritocratic, but they aren't.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
The left-wing critique focuses on class, noting that the desperate-rich-parents scandal is just an exaggerated and criminal version of the general way that legacy admissions and athletic programs boost wealthy applicants, making elite schools into havens of privilege despite their best-and-brightest boast.
The right-wing critique focuses on race, arguing that racial preferences are corrosive to merit-based admissions, because the quest for racial balance creates unfair and discrediting results -- a "not too many Asians, please" quota system, a seeming tilt against lower-middle-class white applicants, and a bias (to the point of credulity, in the Louisiana case) in favor of African-Americans and Hispanics.
You can blend the two critiques by noting how racial bias in admissions and economic privilege interact -- the tilt against lower-middle-class whites may reflect the fact that schools want richer kids (and their tuition dollars) to take up the "white" slots, while affirmative action can benefit the children of wealthy immigrant families as much as the descendants of slaves.
Blending the two critiques can get you the centrist prescription for reform: Elite schools should emphasize class-based rather than race-based affirmative action, the argument runs, while phasing out preferences for jocks and legacies that give privileged whites their own leg up -- a combination that might yield a still-diverse, more authentically meritocratic upper class.
I used to believe in this prescription. But lately my skepticism about meritocracy itself has made me doubt whether we need more of it.
Elite institutions, by their very nature, are not a mass-opportunity system. Even (especially?) in a democratic society they exist to shape a ruling class. And the tension between legacy admissions and affirmative action and merit-based admissions is really a tension between three ways that a ruling class can be legitimated ---- through intergenerational continuity, through representation and through aptitude.
The "more meritocracy" argument against both legacies and racial quotas implicitly assumes that aptitude -- some elixir of I.Q. and work ethic -- is what our elite primarily lacks.
But is that really our upper class's problem? What if our elite is already diligent and how-do-you-like-them-apples smaht -- the average SAT score for the Harvard class of 2022 is a robust 1512 -- and deficient primarily in memory and obligation, wisdom and service and patriotism?
In that case continuity and representation, as embodied by legacy admissions and racial quotas, might actually be better legitimizers for elite universities to cultivate than the spirit of talent-über-alles. It might be better if more Ivy League students thought of themselves as representatives of groups and heirs of family obligation than as Promethean Talents elevated by their own amazing native gifts. It might be better if elite universities, in being open about seeking a specific ethnic mix and encouraging an intergenerational tradition, ceded a certain amount of talent to public universities, and even saw their average SAT score go down.
And who knows -- the Ivies might even teach undergraduates a little more rigorously if they weren't so determined to prove they admitted the smartest kids by never ever letting anyone flunk out.
This is all admittedly fanciful, because to be open about racial quotas would require private schools to sacrifice federal funds, and to emphasize legacy advantages would cost them in the U.S. News rankings. And it might be culturally impossible, given the sway of the meritocratic idea, for elite schools to lean into their aristocratic profile rather than insisting (in whatever defiance of reality) that they are offering opportunity to all.
But the "more meritocracy" world -- the world where bipartisan criticism produces a Harvard class of 2032 with fewer legacies and non-Asian minorities and an average SAT of 1570 -- could be worse than what we have. Because such a change's essential premise, that intelligence alone really merits power, is the premise that has given us many present difficulties, and if extended may only give us more.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."
Actor Andrew Rannells' memoir is "Too Much."

Texto completo: It’s 1990 and I’m in the batter’s box facing Tom Seaver.
It’s a publicity stunt. Seaver was drumming up publicity for a baseball art show at the New York Public Library.
I — and the rest of the lineup of professional scribblers — were the stunt. Adding to the surreal atmosphere is that we were taking swings inside the Midtown Tennis Club, a good dozen miles from Shea Stadium, where Seaver led the Amazin’ Mets in 1969 to one of the definitive underdog victories in sports history. He wasn’t just a Met. He was, is, and will remain, The New York Met.
Which is why I couldn’t understand why he would do something as gauche as pitching to reporters.
“It’s fun,” he told me.
For us, sure, but ...
“Invariably, newspapers run a photo of Tom Seaver throwing a baseball. In the long run it’s going to get people into this exhibit. It’s going to get the kids here.”
Two years earlier, I asked an editor if I could take a swing at an interview with Seaver. He had been living in Greenwich for two decades, but colleagues failed to get time with him, labeling him as brusque. After a news conference announcing a fundraising celebrity softball game to raise money for the Greenwich Adult Day Care Center, I asked him and event co-chair Heller DeMeritt for an interview. We settled onto nearby benches and I executed my game plan. I threw every question at DeMeritt. A radio journalist spotted us and poked his microphone toward Seaver. Finally, radiohead interrupted to inquire if he could ask baseball questions.
Seaver held out two fingers like a catcher signaling a bender.
“Two.”
He answered them swiftly and I returned to our discourse on senior care. Finally, I cracked and asked if I could have two baseball questions.
Seaver waved me off. “Ask as many as you like.”
As I watched Seaver warm up two years later, I had another question: Why was he throwing like this matters?
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Pop. Cowhide kept smacking leather a little too hard.
Seaver mowed through the lineup, giggling at his own gags, like pretending to help hapless batters by telling them when to swing. Advice didn’t matter. No one touched him.
So I had nothing to lose.
He surprised me by throwing his first pitch high. I didn’t surprise him by swinging under it.
Strike one.
I dug in with my loafers (did I mention the batters were in business attire?) and blocked out the identity of the guy 60 feet 6 inches away. He brought inside heat and I caught a piece of it ... driving the ball straight at our photographer near the imaginary first base.
Strike two
Seaver came back at my hands and I pulled a grounder.
He tried a little more chin music, which I fouled off into my own knee.
Count stands at 0-2. Batter stands lopsided.
Seaver finally gave me an outside pitch. I was thrilled to recognize it as a ball. I may just have been immobilized, resisting the temptation to run my throbbing knee.
1-2
I stepped back to roll up my sleeves and smooth out my tie. Seaver had no pause button and I stumbled back into my stance. I read another inside pitch, shifted onto the heels of my loafers, swung and waved at Mister Major League Curveball, which took a hard left toward Queens.
Steeeerike three.
I felt good. I put wood on the ball three times more than anyone else. Then came a batter who slammed the first pitch into the rear wall. He humbly placed his bat on the ground and slinked away.
The Pitcher wordlessly motioned for him to get back in the box.
Three pitches. Three swings.
Oh, that’s right, he’s Tom Seaver. He was able to strike us out any time he wanted.
As a tour of the library exhibit was wrapping up, Seaver and I exchanged observations about the art.
“Come over here and take a look at this one,” he suggested.
I got too comfortable at the plate again. Promotion of the exhibit included a wine event for patrons. I casually mentioned to Seaver that I heard he was something of a wine connoisseur.
“NO,” he barked. “DO NOT WRITE THAT. I AM NOT A WINE CONNOISSEUR.”
I blushed like a White Merlot. “Um, sorry, I guess I heard wrong, sorry ...”
Seaver threw another curve.
“Now my wife, Nancy, she is something of a wine connoisseur,” he said drily.
Like any good wine, his real punchline needed time to ferment.
Fifteen years later, I opened The New York Times to the headline “Warming up in the vineyard, Tom Terrific.”
The Seavers were making wine at their own three-acre Napa Valley vineyard.
It’s there that Seaver will toil now that he is stepping away from public appearances due to a diagnosis of dementia. His Miracle Mets teammate Art Shamsky revealed that Seaver traced it to Lyme disease he contracted in 1991 while living in Greenwich.
This year was supposed to be a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Mets’ finest hour. But Seaver’s family announced he won’t be able to participate.
There will be tears in Flushing Meadows this summer. As fans reflect on images of a certain vintage, they might pause to admire the dirt that would appear on Seaver’s right knee as it scraped the mound at the finale of his iconic motion. Then, as now, working the earth was the mark of a good day for The New York Met.

YouTube Star Is Thrust Into the Spotlight After Mosque Slayings

Texto completo: One of YouTube's biggest celebrities found himself entangled early Friday in news coverage of the mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand.
A gunman who had broadcast part of the attack that left at least 49 people dead urged those watching to "subscribe to PewDiePie," referring to the alias used by Felix Kjellberg, a Swede whose channel has long dominated YouTube and courted controversy along the way.
Mr. Kjellberg was quick to distance himself from the shooting.
"I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person," he said on Twitter. "My heart and thoughts go out to the victims, families and everyone affected by this tragedy."
Mr. Kjellberg is no stranger to controversy. In recent years, he has been embraced by some on the far right and faced criticism for his use of anti-Semitic imagery and racist and sexist language. Here is a closer look at PewDiePie and the New Zealand gunman's words.
Who Is PewDiePie?
As PewDiePie, Mr. Kjellberg has amassed a following of 89 million YouTube subscribers over the past decade with videos that feature a mix of comedic rants, commentary and video game narration.
Though edited, the videos carry an intimate, unguarded aesthetic that has helped Mr. Kjellberg remain relevant and sought after by advertisers. According to Forbes, a sponsored video with PewDiePie can cost up to $450,000. Mr. Kjellberg earned $15.5 million last year.
[ Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day.]
The Meaning of 'Subscribe to PewDiePie'
There's more to the gunman's words -- "subscribe to PewDiePie" -- than meets the eye.
Kevin Roose, a columnist for The New York Times, wrote on Friday that the message may have served two purposes: to inflame political tensions and to serve as a knowing nod to those who might be watching the gunman's actions with approval.
To achieve those ends, the gunman, who has not been officially identified, used a meme born out of a competition for YouTube dominance.
Last year, T-Series, a music label and film production company based in India, emerged as a threat to PewDiePie's top-ranked status on YouTube.
In response, Mr. Kjellberg jokingly rallied his fans to stave off T-Series, even going so far as to make a comedic diss track to play up the competition. Other YouTubers got in on the fight, too, with some buying radio and display advertising.
As with many other oft-repeated phrases online, "subscribe to PewDiePie" became a symbol, a meme, unto itself.
Embraced by the Far Right
In 2017, Disney severed ties with Mr. Kjellberg and YouTube distanced itself from him after The Wall Street Journal identified at least nine of his videos that featured anti-Semitic gestures and imagery.
In one, a pair of men hired by Mr. Kjellberg unfurled a sign that read "Death to All Jews" and then laughed and danced. In another, he wears a brown military uniform, nodding along to archival footage of Hitler delivering a speech.
Some of the videos were removed and Mr. Kjellberg described the segments as jokes, saying in a statement that he was "in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes" and that "I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive."
Despite those comments, members of the far-right embraced what Mr. Kjellberg had done.
A post on The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, noted that the videos raised questions about Mr. Kjellberg's own views, but concluded that they didn't matter: "the effect is the same; it normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies."
In an article last year, Paul MacInnes, who writes on sports and popular culture for The Guardian, faulted mainstream publications for largely ignoring Mr. Kjellberg.
"To call him an alt-right agitator would perhaps be unfair as he has never publicly identified with the proto-fascist movement," Mr. MacInnes wrote. "But he shares much of their culture and amplifies it across the world. People should pay PewDiePie more attention."
Other Controversies
Later in 2017, Mr. Kjellberg used a racial slur during a video game livestream, which he later described as "extremely immature and stupid."
"I said the worst word I could possibly think of, and it just sort of slipped out and I'm not going to make any excuse as to why," he said in a video apologizing for his use of the word.
Last year, Mr. Kjellberg got into a feud with Natalia Mogollon, another online personality famous on Twitch, where she goes by the alias Alinity Divine and narrates livestreams of video games.
In a video testing out an eye-tracking device, Mr. Kjellberg jokingly referred to women in one of the videos he watched, including Ms. Mogollon, as "stupid Twitch thots," a derogatory term.
Ms. Mogollon took offense. In an ensuing back-and-forth, Mr. Kjellberg suggested that she intentionally dresses provocatively on her stream.
"Oh, you're just playing games with the shortest skirt ever, that's our fault for looking at it in any sexual way, right?" he said.
A few months later, he was criticized as insensitive for sharing a meme that made light of the singer Demi Lovato's struggle with drugs.

BUSINESS BEAT; Plane wreckage offers clue; Device shows jet that crashed in Ethiopia was configured to dive, according to a preliminary review.

Texto completo: A screw-like device found in the wreckage of the Boeing Co. 737 Max 8 that crashed Sunday in Ethiopia has provided investigators with an early clue into what happened as work begins in France to decode the "black boxes" recovered from the scene.
The so-called jackscrew, used to set the trim that raises and lowers the plane's nose, indicates that the jet was configured to dive, based on a preliminary review, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The evidence helped persuade U.S. regulators to ground the model, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss the inquiry.
France's aviation safety agency BEA received the cockpit voice and data recorders Thursday for analysis, while investigators on the scene near Addis Ababa continued to sift through the plane's wreckage.

The second crash of a 737 Max in five months has thrown Boeing into a crisis, sending the company's stock plunging and raising questions about the future of its bestselling jet.
Separately, the New York Times reported that the doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to Nairobi was in trouble almost immediately after takeoff as it lurched up and down hundreds of feet at a time.
The captain asked in a panicky voice to turn back only three minutes into the flight as the plane accelerated to abnormal speeds, the newspaper reported, citing an unnamed person who reviewed the jet's air traffic communications.
"Break break, request back to home," he told air traffic controllers as they scrambled to divert two other flights approaching the airport.
The aircraft had accelerated far beyond what is considered standard practice.
All contact between air controllers and the aircraft was lost five minutes after it took off, the report said.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief Daniel Elwell on Wednesday cited unspecified evidence found at the crash scene as part of the justification for the agency to reverse course and temporarily halt flights of 737 Max planes. Up until then, U.S. regulators had held off, even as nation after nation grounded the model.
Boeing shares, which had plunged more than 12%, or $28 billion, in market value since the crash in Ethiopia on Sunday, closed up 1.5% Friday, at $378.89.
The jackscrew, combined with a newly obtained satellite flight track of the plane, convinced the FAA that there were similarities to the Oct. 29 crash of the same Max model off the coast of Indonesia. In the October crash, it was determined that a safety feature on the Boeing aircraft malfunctioned and repeatedly put the plane into a dive.
All 157 people aboard the Ethiopian Airlines jet died when the plane crashed near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital.
In France, BEA posted a photo of the mangled hardware but has yet to comment on any progress on getting the data.
"The investigation process has started in Paris," Ethiopian Airlines said Friday on Twitter.
The discovery of the jackscrew was reported earlier by NBC News.

Top Obama aide praises Kushner-Trump high-tech drive

Texto completo: Former President Obama’s top tech advisor has praised the Trump administration’s push to modernize government IT, singling out Jared Kushner’s expanding bid to make Uncle Sam much more customer friendly.

In a New York Times story that mocked President Trump over his sometimes old school ways in preferring paper over digital delivery of information, Aneesh Chopra, Obama’s chief technology officer, said that the administration was in sync with the Obama effort to reform government technology.

He told the newspaper that there was a “surprising alignment on a number of key areas.”

He said: “I may strongly disagree with the president’s views of health care reform...but I am pleased with the president’s commitment to build on progress on the long-term technical foundation of what we refer to as a health care internet.”

While it is easy for critics to focus on Trump’s crowd pleasing stabs at green technology, his team led by son-in-law Kushner have pushed far further than any past administration into overhauling government technology that both cuts costs and helps taxpayers get the help they need, sometimes with a simple click on a government website.

“Mr. Chopra and several of the president’s aides credited Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, with pushing Mr. Trump to recognize the importance of some of those efforts,” said the Times.

A recent Examiner story noted that Kushner has made IT reform his goal.

“Jared is deeply passionate about this,” said Matt Lira, Kushner’s associate with the White House Office of American Innovation.

He explained that changes made to government websites, including at Veterans Affairs and Agriculture, have been a big help to consumers, vendors, farmers and veterans.

What’s more, it is helping to improve the reputation of those agencies.

“When the average American interacts with their government, there is a huge delta between the quality of those experiences and the quality of any other experience in their life,” said Lira. “Every time one of these negative customer experiences occurs, it undermines the people’s faith that institutions are working for them. They deserve better — that is why we are focused on improving the quality of those experiences,” he added.

Conservative lawyers steal page from progressive playbook

Texto completo: For liberals, legislative defeats are just a temporary setback until the real battle begins in court.
Whether it’s environmentalists shutting off water to Central Valley farms or the ACLU demanding sex changes for prisoners, left-wing groups have long used the courts to advance their political agenda. Now, the Resistance has taken it one step further with 46 taxpayer-funded state lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Conservatives have been quick to criticize activist judges legislating from the bench and slow to match the left’s artful use of lawfare as a political tactic — until now. Conservatives are slowly awakening to the importance of lawfare and how legal challenges can thwart the progressive agenda.
What can conservative lawfare accomplish?
Harmeet Dhillon, my RNC counterpart and California RNC committeewoman, just filed suit seeking to prevent the powerful teachers’ unions from taking dues via mandatory paycheck deductions/
Dhillon is following last year’s Janus decision, which restored the First Amendment rights of thousands of union workers. The National Education Association lost 72,325 dues-paying members. More than 6,000 teachers left the New York State United Teachers. According to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 86,000 workers in California dropped their unions over the past year. That’s a 5 percent net drop in union enrollment.
“Until Janus, California’s government unions could force public servants to pay the unions,” explains Mark Bucher, founder and CEO of the California Policy Center, which has helped educate union members about their rights. “That coercion allowed union leaders to collect $2.7 million per day — about $1 billion per year. No other political player in the state even comes close, and that makes our union leaders the unelected rulers of California.”
Conservative lawfare is challenging fake news peddled by the mainstream media. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student unfairly vilified for attending a pro-life march, filed suit against the Washington Post and CNN for “using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles … to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.”
News reports that Sandmann’s attorneys have “sent preservation letters to more than 50 media organizations, celebrities and politicians — including The Post, The New York Times, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and actors Alyssa Milano and Jim Carrey — the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.”
Last year’s Supreme Court 7–2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop gave the owner permission to refuse certain services based on his First Amendment claim of free speech and free exercise of religion. The conservative lawfare Alliance Defending Freedom took the case to the Supreme Court, defeating the ACLU.
Harmeet Dhillon represented the Young America’s Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans in their legal challenge to UC Berkeley’s censorship of conservative speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and David Horowitz. Under the settlement, UC Berkeley not only changed its “Major Events Policy” and security fee schedule but also paid out $70,000 in attorney’s fees. My firm along with Freedom X 1st Amendment pioneer Bill Becker represent several injured participants at the Berkeley riots when Milo attempted to speak.
Conservative lawyers throughout the country are fighting battles defending the First, Second and Fifth Amendments with success. Nonprofit law firms such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, the libertarian Center for Individual Rights and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty are making dramatic legal precedents and proliferating. George Mason University renamed its law school the Antonin Scalia Law School. Spontaneously, hundreds of lawyers and firms are building a nationwide movement of conservative lawfare warriors to challenge the progressive agenda. This is a big step toward developing a national network of conservative and libertarian lawyers to share tactics toward defeating the left.
Shawn Steel is a trial attorney, Republican National Committeeman and former California Republican Party chair.

Texto completo: Francesco “Franky Boy” Cali, jefe de la “familia Gambino de “La Cosa Nostra”, trató de esconderse debajo de su propio vehículo cuando un hombre le disparó varias veces con un arma 9 mm luego de chocar su Cadillac, la noche del miércoles 13 de marzo, frente a su casa en Staten Island.
La policía dijo que Cali recibió seis disparos, no tenía guardaespaldas y ni siquiera estaba armado esa noche. Obviamente se consideraba inmune, destacó The New York Times.
Los informes iniciales dijeron que Cali había sido baleado y atropellado, pero parece que en realidad un testigo se confundió al verlo escondido bajo su auto, reportó New York Post.
“Lo que creo que sucedió fue que Cali fue alcanzado varias veces por disparos. Tratando de eludir disparos adicionales, huyó a la parte trasera de su vehículo privado y alguien probablemente pensó que fue atropellado, pero era más que estaba tratando de meterse debajo del auto para eludir los disparos”, dijo el jefe de detectives de NYPD Dermott Shea en una conferencia de prensa.
Shea agregó que la policía aún no sabe exactamente qué motivó a Cali a salir de su casa. Probablemente lo hizo al escuchar que alguien había golpeado su vehículo estacionado en la calle.
El atacante, un hombre de entre 25 a 40 años de edad, habló con Cali menos de un minuto antes de sacar su arma y comenzara a disparar. Pero Shea no sabe si la corta charla fue un altercado o una conversación calmada.
Los policías recuperaron 12 casquillos en la escena y al menos seis de las balas alcanzaron a Cali, precisó Shea.
NYPD retiró cuidadosamente el Cadillac de la escena del crimen ayer, para proseguir las pesquisas.
Un experto dijo que el crimen de Cali parecía un trabajo interno, es decir, de su propia “familia” mafiosa.
Durante años, las rentas y la comida de los neoyorquinos eran más caras debido a los “impuestos invisibles” impuestos por la mafia, según Selwyn Raab, ex reportero del Times y autor de varios libros sobre la mafia y la policía.
“La mafia, te guste o no, siempre ha sido parte de la trama de la vida de Nueva York”, dijo.
Alguien se sintió en peligro con Cali y quiere hacerse cargo de la “familia”. “No lo harían si no hubiera alguna riqueza involucrada. Normalmente, te matan con un sólo disparo, pero la idea de que realmente lo atacaron es un mensaje: la gente que lo atrapó es muy violenta”.
La Cosa Nostra funciona a través de entidades conocidas como “familias”, que en Nueva York son cinco: Bonanno, Genovese, Luchese, Colombo y Gambino. A pesar de ser entidades separadas, los miembros de esta organización colaboran entre ellos en actividades criminales.
Desde 1985 un jefe de la mafia de Nueva York no había sido asesinado, cuando John Gotti ordenó ejecutar al entonces jefe de Gambino, Paul Castellano, en un restaurante de Midtown.
En octubre, el socio de Bonanno, Sylvester Zottola (71) fue abatido a tiros en el estacionamiento de un restaurante McDonald’s en El Bronx.
A diferencia de Gotti, Cali no era extravagante y mantenía un perfil bajo. Su muerte predice el fin de una era de paz. El crimen fue un movimiento muy drástico que aumentará la atención sobre la mafia, algo que obviamente no les conviene.

Texto completo: In 2008, Larry Ossei-Mensah returned to New York after spending years in Switzerland studying marketing and hospitality. Or at least that was the pretext -- he went there to find himself as a black man.
Back in New York, he walked into the House of Campari's show "Defining a Moment: 25 New York Artists" and was immediately drawn to the works of Titus Kaphar and Rashid Johnson, artists who would soon become modern black masters.
That show helped propel the career of Mr. Ossei-Mensah -- a Ghanaian-American who grew up in the Bronx -- as an independent curator and entrepreneur. A co-founder of communities like ArtNoir and a writer, critic and teacher, the 38-year-old is seemingly everywhere. In September, he became the Susanne Feld Hilberry senior curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (known as Mocad).
He talked to The New York Times about his transition to an institutional role and connecting the dots, connecting people to what inspires and excites them. (This interview has been edited and condensed.)
How are you? You've been traveling for a week straight.

Two weeks. I started my first show at Mocad, "Parallels and Peripheries," which is Part 2 of a series that started in South Florida [Miami Beach]. It looks at how artists use their practice as a platform for inquiry, storytelling, asking questions. Particularly thinking about artists who function on the margins. That could be black and brown artists, that could be queer artists.
The show in Miami was specifically all women. And then, in the case of this show, it was looking at artists whose work functions at the intersection of art, technology and science. It's 12 artists, 10 women.
The show also relates to the fact that, in my experience of growing up in the Bronx, most things that I find to be culturally exciting come from the peripheral. So I opened that, and then opened up another show, "Race and Revolution: Still Separate, Still Unequal," at Penn State, which I co-curated with Katie Fuller.
I opened two shows in one week, which is not smart, but it worked out because it fed two different desires. I'm a Gemini, so it feeds two brains.
What do you find culturally exciting?
People who are looking to instigate a conversation that might not be in the mainstream, voices that might not always have a platform. Because I look at a lot of art all the time, I see a lot of shows, but then there are the things that stimulate me because it's historic or an artist who is trying to break the form.
What's it like, marrying your years of independent curating with working at Mocad?
With Mocad, it's definitely a continuous work in progress. You're continuously trying to make the shows weirder or more tactile. With the independent shows, it's pretty much one and done. At Mocad, you have got to keep it interesting, asking different questions, seeing what people were responsive to and what they weren't.
And I think, over time, the shows that I do at Mocad will have a slightly different lens than the independent stuff, because the independent stuff is just me and whoever I'm collaborating with. Whereas at Mocad, there's more of a process. Mocad's definitely taught me how to be more patient and not try and do everything at onetime. That will seep into my other projects where, it's like, O.K., how do I do three dope programs that are going to change the game now?
How has it been, moving around back and forth between the Bronx and Detroit?

I think the nomadic component of my practice is really kind of what fuels it. New York has its own energy, pace and tension. And Detroit is a city that's redefining itself, and to be part of that moment -- it's just a rare life opportunity. But then I'm also traveling everywhere all the time.
It's going to slow down at some point, but I think that's where my head is at, because so much of my life is about connecting the dots. Right now I'm single, but if I'm blessed to have a family, I'm not going to be able to move as much, so I'm planting these seeds, building my tribe.
How do you see your role in this reinvention of Detroit?
I've done my best to be aware and listen and not try to project my ideas, and to spend time with artists and curators on the ground, who really know the city. Detroit is a very nuanced space, so for me, it's about how can we amplify the magic of Detroit. How do we find the diamonds in the rough who have been grinding, doing their thing, and give them a platform?
That doesn't just mean an exhibition in the museum, but it could be recommending them for, like, an art prize or a show. I never want to be a savior, I always want to be a good neighbor, and add value where I can. And I'm cognizant about how a lot of cities are going through a similar shift.
A shift in what way?

Like, when I tell people I'm from the Bronx, they'll say the Bronx is gentrifying. Where I am? No. Where I live? No. The day that happens, I know that I'm in trouble. And I'm still there because of that reality check.
Working in the space that I work in is a privilege, but when you're dealing with an everyday reality, friends are dealing with whatever they're dealing with -- it brings you back to center. That grounding is important. It gives me this edge to hustle because [opportunities] are not going to be given to you.
So, in the case of Detroit, it's how do we create that space, or amplify the magic of that space, in a generous, generative way. And how do you bring people with you? How do you watch out for each other? How do you make sure everyone is good? Because you got a lot of people who will put up a front, to save face. Nah, we got to do this together.
Do you think you're redefining what a gatekeeper in the art world could be?

I think so. I mean, it's a reality that I won't say I'm in denial about, but I'm cognizant of it. I try to be careful not to embrace it to the point that, like, I become something that I don't want to be. I don't abuse it. But, for me, it's also that a lot of this is coming from illusion, and I'm not caught up in the illusion. For me it's more about supporting people who are passionate, working hard, deserve a shot, deserve the attention.
I think that I've built a lot of trust, and so much of this is about trust. But, you know, you put in the work, you show up. I think all of this comes from this weird desire to be a great cardinal. There's so much that curators will do in the background that artists will never see. For me, it's more like personal nourishment. You'll never hear me say, "I discovered this person." That feels weird to me. I would like to say that I was more part of someone's process.
What's next for you?
Figuring out what the next shows will be at Mocad. I'm working on my first public project, a billboard project, that will be in Kansas City. And continuing to spend more time in Detroit, do more studio visits and putting my hand on the pulse. As long as it's fun, I'm fine. If it stops being fun, time to do something else.

A poster hanging on the walls of New York City subway stations advertises a new book celebrating the life and work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling the Supreme Court justice a "trail blazer" and a "history maker."
On Tuesday, the advertisement at one Brooklyn subway stop included another message: an anti-Semitic slur and a swastika scrawled over her face.
The New York Police Department's hate crimes unit and officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were investigating the incident, which came to wider attention after it was reported by a commuter on Twitter, officials said.
The vandalism, which was swiftly condemned by city officials, came amid a rise in hate crimes in New York City, driven in large part by anti-Semitic attacks and incidents. There were 86 hate crimes reported in the city this year as of March 10, an increase of 62 percent over the same time period last year, the police said. About 60 percent of those were anti-Semitic crimes, with 52 such incidents reported so far this year, compared with 32 by the same time in 2018.
In 2018, hate crimes in New York City rose by 5 percent; anti-Semitic crimes alone rose 22 percent last year compared with the year before.
The poster, which was hanging at the Nassau Avenue stop on the G line in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, was defaced with the phrase "Die, Jew" and another profane slur written in capital letters in what appeared to be black marker. Underneath the expletive, which was punctuated with an exclamation point, was a swastika drawn over Justice Ginsburg's lips.
The graffiti was removed from the poster on Tuesday afternoon, the transit authority said.
"We have zero tolerance for hate and violence, and this is a horrendous example that has no place anywhere," an agency spokesman, Shams Tarek, said in a statement.
Officials said they would share any available surveillance video with the police to assist them with their investigation.
The Police Department confirmed on Wednesday that its hate crimes unit was investigating the incident.
The subway poster was advertising the book "The Unstoppable Ruth Bader Ginsburg: American Icon," a photo history released in 2018 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Justice Ginsburg's appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993.
When she was confirmed, Justice Ginsburg, a Brooklyn native, became the second woman and first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. During her confirmation hearings, she spoke about facing anti-Semitism in her past.
At one point during the hearing, she recounted a childhood experience of seeing a sign in front of a restaurant that read, "No dogs or Jews allowed."
"One couldn't help but be sensitive to discrimination, living as a Jew in America at the time of World War II," she said.
In an interview with The New York Times in 2015, she also spoke about facing anti-Jewish sentiment when she was trying to find a job after she graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959.
"I had three strikes against me," she said. "First, I was Jewish, and the Wall Street firms were just beginning to accept Jews. Then I was a woman. But the killer was my daughter Jane, who was 4 by then."
In a tweet on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that Justice Ginsburg represented "the very best" of New York City and vowed that city officials would find and punish whoever defaced her portrait.
The vandalism was the latest in a string of high-profile, anti-Jewish hate crimes in New York City in the last month. At the end of February, a 12-year-old boy was arrested and charged in connection with swastikas and other Nazi symbols on a public school playground in Queens.
Weeks earlier, two men threw an object into the front window of a synagogue in Brooklyn at about 2 a.m. No one was injured, but the attack, which broke the window, was being investigated as a possible hate crime.
The Jewish community in Brooklyn has been particularly on edge after a set of videos that showed Orthodox Jewish men being beaten, chased and choked in Crown Heights.
The graffiti found this week also came a week after a chalk drawing depicting a noose showed up on a wall at another Brooklyn subway station. Transportation authority officials worked quickly to clean it up and denounced the drawing as hateful imagery.

Advice to you soon-to-be millionaires: Don't become the people you used to hate

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL NEWS FOR SAN FRANCISCO
BROKE-ASS STUART
BROKE-ASS CITY
Last week an article came out in The New York Times titled "Thousands of New Millionaires Are About to Eat San Francisco Alive." In it, Nellie Bowles discusses how several large tech companies like Uber, Lyft, AirBnb, Slack and others plan to go public this year, making millionaires out of thousands employed by them.
The effect of the article on those of us who are not joining the millionaire's club was harrowing. After nearly a decade of hyper-gentrifica-tion - where too many friends and family members were displaced, landmark businesses shuttered, and the artistic community gutted - there was a collective groan of "Oh f*****ck..." The question of "How could things get any worse here," had been answered resoundingly.
The last time something like this happened was between March 2012 and November 2013 when Face-book, Twitter, and Yelp all went public over an roughly 18- month period. The effect on the housing market was visceral: evictions skyrocketed, rents tripled, and we began using the term "housing crisis" to describe what was happening.
The scary thing is, considering how many companies might issue an IPO this year, and how many employees they each have, there may be far more overnight millionaires in San Francisco than ever before.
So how do we fix this? For one, San Francisco needs to build more housing, especially affordable housing. The City needs to continue to create more incentives for affordable housing construction, and expand its efforts to make it easier to have in-law units.
San Francisco legislators can also pass laws to de-incentivize real estate speculation. In 2014, an initiative was put on the ballot that would've put a steep tax on anyone who tried to sell a multi-unit property within five years of when they bought it. The measure was called Proposition G and was meant to deter the rapacious speculation that was happening.
Unfortunately, the real estate industry dumped millions of dollars from around the county into the battle and defeated Prop G, but maybe it's time the Board of Supervisors starts working on a similar bill.
While there are plenty of things The City can do to in response to the coming IPO-pocalypse, the people who are about to become rich need to take some responsibility as well.
I know a fair amount of people who fall into this category. Many of them are people who have been around since before things got so crazy and have seen the changes. To them I say this: Don't become the people you used to hate.
There's nothing wrong with making money. You've probably worked hard and it's wonderful to see that you're achieving success. But it's also important to remember that your success affects your neighbors too.
As to the newly rich, here are some simple guidelines for reducing your millionaire footprint:
* If you buy a place, don't evict people just so you can make more money. That's evil, especially since you just made a ton. If you are going to do an owner move-in, then actually live there and don't try to turn a profit on someone else's misery.
* Don't buy a place where someone was evicted. You can find out if anyone was evicted from a spot you're considering by looking it up on AntiEvictionMap.com.
* Donate some of your new wealth to organizations fighting for tenants rights. Organizations like the SF Tenants Union, Tenants Together, Eviction Defense Collaboration, and Housing Rights Committee of SF are all working towards keeping people in their homes during these terrifying times. Your money can help them do that. While I obviously, don't have all the answers, these are good places to start.
And if You have more suggestions on ways the newly minted can avoid making things worse, please leave them in the comments.
Just try not to be a jerk about it.

Texto completo: Headnote Award- Winning Journalists Explain Ramifications of 'Power of the Pen
Howard University students were the target audience for a powerhouse panel featuring nationally recognized and honored journalists who discussed the "Power of the Pen."
Ta-Nehisi Coates, former staff writer at The Atlantic, Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for the New York Times Magazine, and Jelani Cobb, staff writer at The New Yorker, shared perspectives about the how to approach a journalism career. During the discussion, there were several interesting moments of self-reflection that were drawn out by moderator Anthony Brown Jr., an independent journalist and Howard University alumnus who conceived the idea of the panel discussion.
Hannah-Jones, co-founder of the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, expounded on why she chose to be a writer and why people should care.
"I felt journalism was my mission," the 2017 MacArthur Prize recipient told the audience. "I would hope my work is deeply reported, is illuminating and forces us to see the truth about our country."
Cobb, who wears multiple hats as a professor, historian and journalist, spoke of how he approaches his work while juggling these roles.
"I'm a Black man trying to be responsible to his community and these times," said Cobb, a Columbia University professor and Howard University alumnus who was an English and history major. "I did not think those two majors were mutually exclusive. My mission has always been to use the tools I gained at this institution in a way that was befitting the people who invested in me"
Throughout the question-and-answer period, students sought pearls of wisdom to position themselves in pursuit of a dream. The panelists encouraged them to stand firm in their conviction.
Coates, who also attended Howard University, spoke about the strength that comes from being dedicated to the challenge of journalism.
"It's not enough to work for the New York Times, or The New Yorker or The Atlantic," said Coates, a 2016 MacArthur Fellow. "You have to use the work that you create like a sword. It feels like weight, but it's really an accelerant."

Author Berenson to talk in Colorado about kids, risks and pot

Texto completo: Best-selling author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson is coming (back) to Colorado to talk about the "truth" related to pot and kids.
He will talk about his new book -- "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence" -- in Colorado Springs and Centennial Tuesday and Denver on Wednesday.
Berenson has penned 12 fiction thrillers and two nonfiction books. He started his journalism career as a Denver Post business reporter in 1994.
His three events in Colorado are free and open to the public:
* From noon to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday in Colorado Springs at The Warehouse at 25 West Cimarron St.
* From 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at Arapahoe High School in Centennial at 2201 East Dry Creek Road.
* On Wednesday from noon to 1:30 p.m. in Denver at the History Colorado Center at 1200 North Broadway.
Attendees are asked to RSVP by noon on Monday;
Berenson's talks are sponsored by The Gazette, Colorado Politics and Children's Hospital Colorado.
In his journalism career, Berenson has reported from the battlefields of Iraq to the boardrooms of the pharmaceutical industry.
Berenson is a father of two. His book, he has said, grew out of conversations with his wife, Jacqueline Berenson, who is a forensic psychiatrist who treats mentally ill criminals. "They all smoke" pot, she told him.
He and his new book, which takes on the science and research around marijuana, were profiled in The New Yorker magazine in January.
"Berenson is constrained by the same problem the National Academy of Medicine faced -- that, when it comes to marijuana, we really don’t know very much," the magazine reports. "But he has a reporter’s tenacity, a novelist’s imagination, and an outsider’s knack for asking intemperate questions. The result is disturbing."
Berenson makes the case that marijuana goes hand in hand with opiates and cocaine, noting that research shows their use rise and fall together.
He also argues that the chemical in pot that delivers the high could cause psychotic episodes and possibly psychosis.
Psychosis is linked to violence, and "cannabis-linked violence is spreading," Berenson says on his website.
Editor's note: This article was updated at 9:07 a.m. to correct the event's list of sponsors.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – It was supposed be the final act in Paul Manafort’s bruising, 17-month odyssey through the criminal justice system.
In the end, Wednesday’s sentencing hearing for the former chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign only added to the now-convicted felon’s legal misery.
U. S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson began her remarks to a packed courtroom by characterizing Manafort as a serial “liar” whose “ongoing contempt” for the law spanned more than a decade. It got worse from there.
Jackson delivered a searing critique of the one-time counselor to Republican presidents, whose high-flying lobbying work paid for expensive clothes and homes, who now is convicted of conspiracy, fraud and plotting to obstruct justice. Then she tacked more than three years onto a four-year prison term he received last week in a related case in Virginia.
And the bad news for Manafort did not stop at the threshold of Jackson’s second-floor courtroom.
Even as Manafort, who now uses a wheelchair because of declining health, was rolled into custody of U. S. Marshals, New York state authorities announced a 16-count indictment charging him with mortgage fraud and conspiracy, arising from the same conduct prosecuted by federal authorities.
Wednesday's developments offered a vivid illustration of the danger facing at least some of the high-profile subjects of Russia special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. As Mueller's inquiry grinds toward its conclusion, federal and state prosecutors are in the midst of their own investigations – many sprawling far beyond the bounds of Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Manafort's fate on Wednesday suggested the peril they face is real, and at least partly beyond Trump's control.
The strategically-timed action by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance would put Manafort beyond the reach of a potential pardon, should President Donald Trump choose to set aside the federal convictions against his former aide.
Trump said Wednesday that he felt "very badly" for Manafort, adding that he was not aware of the new charges filed in New York. Trump also did not immediately address a possible pardon.
But as recently as late last year, Trump said he "wouldn't take (the possibility of a pardon) off the table. "
"Why would I take it off the table," Trump told The New York Post in November.
Sentenced (again): Paul Manafort sentenced to a total of 7. 5 years in prison: 'It is hard to overstate the number of lies'
Charged (again): Ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort, just sentenced to federal prison, faces new charges in N. Y. indictment
In Manafort's case, the question of such presidential intervention has never been especially distant. Just last month, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told Jackson that Manafort lied to investigators despite an existing cooperation agreement as a possible way to “augment his chances for a pardon. ”
Trump and those around him face a multiplying set of investigations.
In addition to the New York state charges lodged against Manafort, federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating fundraising irregularities involving the Trump Inaugural Committee and hush-money payments made by the president, Donald Trump Jr. , and Trump Organization financial chief Allen Weisselberg to women who have claimed affairs with the president.
The Trump Foundation, a charity established by Trump long before he took office, also has been the subject of a separate investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office. More recently, according to the New York Times, the New York attorney general issued subpoenas to two banks as part of a separate examination of the Trump Organization, the president's sprawling real estate enterprise.
And beyond the myriad criminal inquiries, several congressional investigations have gathered fresh momentum following the recent testimony of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who asserted that the president had indirectly advised him to lie to Congress about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a lucrative real estate development in Moscow. The lawyer also publicly accused his former boss of inflating the value of his assets to get bank loans and insurance coverage.
The timing of the state charges against Manafort, however, were particularly striking, analysts said.
Patrick Cotter, a white-collar defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor in New York, characterized the action as "extraordinary. "
“It’s uncommon in the sense that, usually, if the feds take (a case), the state usually leaves it alone," Cotter said. "If the state is interested in addressing state crimes, more often than not, they sort of work with the feds and come up with a global resolution that addresses both state and federal issues. "
In Manafort's case, the action appeared to be designed as a back-stop to a possible presidential pardon.
Cotter said he doesn't think the new charges would place Manafort in an endless legal jeopardy, suggesting that Manafort's attorneys would likely try to reach a plea deal with the New York prosecutors that would result in little or no additional time in prison.
“You can only punish a guy so many times,” he said.
Jason Maloni, a Manafort spokesman, declined to comment on the New York state action.
Manafort's attorneys also did not address the new charges.
Instead, they blasted Judge Jackson, asserting that the additional 3. 5-year prison sentence was excessive, while describing her public rebuke of Manafort's conduct as unnecessary.
“The judge displayed a level of callousness and hostility that I have not seen before,” attorney Kevin Downing said outside the courthouse where he was partially shouted down by protesters.
Indeed, Jackson's verbal scolding of Manafort was often-merciless and struck a decidedly different tone than last week's sentencing in Virginia, where U. S. District Judge T. S. Ellis III, said the former political operative had led "an otherwise blameless life" before pronouncing a sentence of 47 months for convictions on eight counts of tax and bank fraud.
The prison term represented a dramatic departure from federal guidelines that recommended a sentence of between 19. 5 and 24. 5 years. Few federal defendants get prison sentences so far below the guidelines unless prosecutors ask for it.
Jackson, by contrast, delivered a withering admonishment, asserting that Manafort spent much of his career “gaming the system,” lying to government officials, and cheating taxpayers of more than $6 million in unpaid taxes.
“It is hard to overestimate the number of lies, the amount of fraud and the extraordinary amount of money involved,” Jackson said before pronouncing sentence.
All of it, the judge said, was aimed at propping up an “opulent” lifestyle that included “more homes than one family can occupy and more suits than one man can wear. ”
During Manafort's federal trial in Virginia, prosecutors offered the testimony from a parade of witnesses who detailed how the veteran political consultant funneled money from dozens of foreign bank accounts to purchase homes, cars and racks of designer clothes from select haberdashers in Manhattan. They showed jurors photos of the clothes FBI agents found in his closet.
Like he did at his sentencing last week, Manafort addressed the court from his wheelchair Wednesday, expressing remorse for his actions.
"The person who I have been described as in public is not the someone who I recognize," Manafort said in a raspy voice as a packed courtroom fell silent.
Among those watching shoulder-to-shoulder in the gallery were nearly all of the Mueller team members – FBI agents, prosecutors and paralegals – absent Mueller himself.
"While I know that I am not that person, I feel shame and embarrassment for the suffering that i have caused my family and friends and all who have been affected by my behavior.
"Let me be very clear," he said, "I accept responsibility for the acts that have caused me to be here today. "
In one last appeal, Manafort referred to his wife, Kathleen, seated just a few yards behind the defense table, asking that the judge sentence him to no more additional prison time than the 47 months leveled last week in Virginia.
“Your honor, I will be 70 years old in a few weeks,” Manafort said, adding that he remained his wife's primary caretaker. “Please, let me and my wife be together. "
Jackson appeared unmoved by the emotional display.
"This defendant knew better, and he knew exactly what he was doing,” the judge said, adding that she did not believe Manafort's apology was genuine.
"Saying I’m sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency," Jackson said.
Then, later Wednesday, she inflicted one more indignity, signing an order turning over several of his homes and bank accounts to federal authorities. Among them, an estate in the Hamptons and his condo in Trump's eponymous New York tower.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.
Travelers who need to check flight status and aircraft type can do so a couple of ways. First, check your ticket to determine the aircraft type. It’s often listed as “equipment.”
Flight tracking websites also can help determine what’s flying at any given moment. For example, FlightAware.com shows United 1117, operating a Boeing 737 Max 9, is due to land at LAX by 2:22 p.m. The site said the flight, with the aircraft type listed as “B39M,” is running 8 minutes late. Two other Max 9 aircraft (United 2373 and 417) and were heading to the Hawaiian islands from LAX.
A more generic search for the Max 8 aircraft (listed as aircraft type B38M) shows dozens of the twin-jet airplanes in the sky worldwide.
The travel website kayak.com told MarketWatch it would begin including aircraft type.
If you want to switch flights based on the assigned aircraft, be warned: That will most often come with steep flight-change fees.
Trump’s order to ground the two aircraft types came hours after Canada’s transport minister said newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Trump’s announcement, the FAA also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets, the New York Times reported.

TELL-ALL BOOK LOOKS AT POWER PLAYS BY IVANKA AND JARED

Texto completo: A new tell-all book, which focuses on how Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner rose to "extraordinary" power in the White House, is sure to bolster the opinion among President Donald Trump's critics that his daughter has a princess complex and that nepotism is the only reason she and her husband have their jobs as senior advisers.
According to The New York Times, "Kushner Inc.," by journalist Vicky Ward, portrays Ivanka Trump and Kushner as the heirs of New York real estate empires that were forged by domineering fathers. However, in Ivanka Trump's case, her father was "disengaged," and her childhood often was "isolated."
The book also describes, in reportedly unflattering ways, how the two "climbed to positions of power by disregarding protocol and skirting the rules when they can," added the Times, which got a sneak peek at Ward's book. One example of Ivanka Trump and Kushner's apparent sense of entitlement and rule-skirting comes in the way they have demanded use of Air Force One at times when it was "not appropriate," Ward writes, according to the Times.
The couple wanted to control who could travel on trips funded by the State Department, according to the Times. When former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denied their requests, the couple tried to get around him by inviting along a cabinet secretary, usually Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to get access to the plane.
One purpose of the book is to dissect the kind of influence Ivanka Trump and Kushner have on President Trump and on his administration's management and policies, the Times reported. There is a common "narrative" that the two serve as "stabilizing voices inside an otherwise chaotic White House," but the book instead depicts the two as Trump's "chief enablers," the Times reported.
According to the Times, Ward spent two years interviewing 200 people for her book, which will be published March 19.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Nancy Salzman was known to her followers as "Prefect." She was a co-founder of Nxivm, a cultlike group near Albany in which women were branded with the leader's initials and forced to have sex with him, federal prosecutors say.
On Wednesday, Ms. Salzman is expected to plead guilty to charges contained in a federal racketeering indictment filed last year against six people in the group, including the former leader, Keith Raniere, a government official and a lawyer familiar with the case said.
Ms. Salzman, a former psychiatric nurse, helped Mr. Raniere found the group in the 1990s. In addition to being accused of being part of a criminal enterprise, she was specifically charged with identify theft and altering records to influence the outcome of a lawsuit against the organization.
On Tuesday, prosecutors filed a notice of a "criminal cause for pleading" for Ms. Salzman in a Brooklyn federal court, an indication that Ms. Salzman would enter a plea the following day. A government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private plea negotiations, confirmed she had agreed to plead guilty but declined to give details.
Robert Soloway, a lawyer representing Ms. Salzman, did not return an email seeking comment. Another lawyer involved in the Nxivm case, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss confidential plea negotiations, said that he had been informed that Ms. Salzman would plead guilty. Her intention to enter a guilty plea was first reported Tuesday by The New York Post.
A guilty plea by Ms. Salzman would be significant given her high position within Nxivm (pronounced Nex-ee-um). Others charged in the case include Ms. Salzman's daughter, Lauren Salzman; Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune; and an actress, Allison Mack, best known for her role in the television series, "Smallville."
An indictment filed last July charged the defendants with a variety of crimes, including racketeering, identity theft, money laundering, sex trafficking and extortion.
The federal investigation into Nxivm started after The New York Times published an article in late 2017 detailing how women seeking to join a secret sorority within the group were branded on their hip with a symbol that contained Mr. Raniere's initials.
In addition, women had to provide personal secrets as "collateral" to join the sorority and were warned that the damaging or embarrassing information would be made public if they revealed the sorority's existence.
Federal authorities described Mr. Raniere, known to his followers as "Vanguard," as the ultimate master of the sorority. They charged in a criminal complaint that women were forced to have sex with him because they feared that their personal secrets would be released if they refused.
Ms. Salzman's daughter, Lauren, was reportedly involved in the secret sorority and oversaw branding ceremonies. For her part, Ms. Salzman worked closely for two decades with Mr. Raniere and developed the behavioral programs that formed the basis of Nxivm, former members have said.
Beginning in the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm, which said they were designed to bring greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants took a few workshops but others were deeply drawn into the group, giving up careers, friends and families in order to move to the Albany area.
It was only after they left Nxivm, several former members have said, that they realized it operated as a cult.
Last March, Mr. Raniere was arrested in Mexico, where he had gone after the federal inquiry started. A few days later, federal agents raided Ms. Salzman's home in Halfmoon, N.Y., an Albany suburb.
Nxivm has since shuttered its operations. The trial of the remaining defendants in the federal case is scheduled to begin in late April.

Texto completo: A former aide to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand resigned last year after accusing top aides to the senator of mishandling a sexual harassment complaint she filed against a colleague. Ms. Gillibrand's office investigated the claim and kept the worker on staff, but dismissed him last week after Politico presented new details about the allegations to her Senate office.
The allegations stand in contrast to Ms. Gillibrand's record as an advocate for women's causes who has battled sexual harassment in the workplace, a message she has made central to her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The staff member's resignation, first reported Monday by Politico, included a letter she wrote to Ms. Gillibrand and two top aides in August in which she describes frustration over the office's response to allegations of harassment and intimidation against the co-worker, Abbas Malik, a former special assistant to the New York senator.
She had accused Mr. Malik of making unwelcome advances toward her, as well as inappropriate misogynistic remarks about female colleagues and potential hires, Politico said. The woman was not identified by the news organization and her name was redacted from the letter.
"I felt defeated, not just from the humiliation and pain that the harassment had brought me, but that in attempting to seek appropriate disciplinary actions for my harasser, my experience was devalued. I was devalued," the aide said in her resignation letter.
The former staff member could not immediately be identified by The New York Times. Mr. Malik, who served primarily as a driver for Ms. Gillibrand, could not immediately be reached for comment. His recent firing followed the emergence of a new allegation, according to a member of Ms. Gillibrand's staff.

Ms. Gillibrand's communications director, Whitney Mitchell Brennan, defended the office's handling of the complaint. "At every step of the process, immediate action was taken by the office," she said in a statement Monday. "A full and thorough investigation into the evidence revealed employee misconduct that, while inappropriate, did not meet the standard for sexual harassment."
Speaking with reporters outside the Capitol later in the day, Ms. Gillibrand also asserted that the woman's complaint was taken seriously. "I told this employee at the time that she was loved, that we loved her," Ms. Gillibrand told reporters. "I deeply valued her."
She said her office investigated the allegations immediately "and did a professional and thorough investigation that was taken very seriously from the beginning."
Asked why her office did not interview two former staff members whom the woman suggested they contact, Ms. Gillibrand said that the allegations those former employees knew about -- involving inappropriate comments -- had already been corroborated.
Taking an unyielding stand against sexual misconduct has been central to Ms. Gillibrand's political profile since late 2017, when she was the first Democratic senator to call for the resignation of Senator Al Franken of Minnesota following allegations that eventually led to him stepping down.
Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist, said that because Ms. Gillibrand has taken up the cause of sexual harassment, she should respond to the allegations by discussing them publicly.
"It's an opportunity for her to talk about these issues and their complexity," said Ms. Sefl, a former senior adviser to the super PAC Ready for Hillary. "And the fact that a lot of people get it wrong. How do you make it right? I'd like to hear from her about that."
The allegations from the former aide included claims that Mr. Malik called a woman fat, called someone ugly, rated women's appearances and said that a woman working at the Senate as an intern was "into him."
[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]
Mr. Malik had served two tours in Iraq and was at one point assigned a title related to military affairs, but his primary responsibility remained as a driver.
The former aide initially indicated she thought the investigation was fair, but she later complained in her letter that she felt retaliated against for making the complaint.
One senior staff member commented to her that Mr. Malik could have been fired for "a number of reasons but isn't going to. So he should consider himself lucky," the letter said. The woman then said she was "deeply confused and saddened by this."
An aide to Ms. Gillibrand, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal matters, said an investigation into the staffer's complaint was initiated within 42 minutes after she filed it in July. Seven staff members were subsequently interviewed.
After the investigation confirmed unprofessional behavior, the office rescinded Mr. Malik's promotion and warned him that any additional misbehavior would result in his firing.
He was fired recently, after Politico began working on its article, when new information emerged.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Democrats, Debate on Fox," by Liz Mair (Op-Ed, March 9):
This Op-Ed seems to make sense: Why should the Democrats spurn those who watch Fox News, many of whom are moderates and, indeed, Democrats themselves? Why abandon any substantial audience?
Someone has to call Fox out, that's why. Fox News is a full-time propaganda channel. It is not just the hours of preaching to the right-wing choir in the evenings. The news menu during the day is, itself, carefully and cleverly designed to incite fear and set up the audience for the evening-long bashing of moderates, liberals and Democrats.
All of America should reject this arm of the Republican Party. As for me, I don't want any deliberately slanted news from any source. I want facts, and Fox does an excellent job of obscuring them.

To the Editor:
The Democratic National Committee's decision to bar Fox News from hosting a presidential debate is indeed, as Liz Mair writes, "shortsighted and pointless." What better way to counter the right's worldview and present an alternative. Go into the belly of the beast. Yes, a Democrat may not garner many votes from this exercise, but at least he or she will be able to present an unvarnished point of view free of Fox spin.
Theresa Mannix
Seattle
To the Editor:
Fox viewers have access to all of the same channels as everyone else and therefore should be no more aggrieved than viewers of ESPN, MTV or whichever other channels don't host a debate.
Jane Mayer's exhaustive piece "The Making of the Fox News White House" in The New Yorker chronicled the corrupting connection between Fox and the G.O.P. Fox News is a mouthpiece of the G.O.P. and vice versa.
Hosting a debate is a privilege, and Fox hasn't earned it.
Josh Wilson
Kobe, Japan
To the Editor:
When Bret Stephens joined The New York Times there were cries of protest from liberal readers. Although as a lifelong Democrat I don't agree with everything he espouses, his articles have proven to be extremely astute as he presents sides of the political argument that challenge left-wing policies. This is important.
Now the Democrats, having made the decision to bar Fox News from hosting a 2020 presidential primary debate, are once again closing their ears and minds to opposing views. Liz Mair is right in stating that this is very shortsighted. She rightly points out that many Democrats and independents watch Fox News.
Not only is there a danger of shutting those potential voters out, but one also has to ask: What are the Democrats afraid of?

Texto completo: Aunque el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos se anotó un importante logro febrero, luego de que un jurado hallara culpable a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , líder del Cártel de Sinaloa, el tráfico de cocaína al país parece no tener fin.
Apenas el 28 de ese mismo mes, aproximadamente 3,200 libras (unos 1,400 kilos) de cocaína con un valor estimado en la calle de $77 millones de dólares fueron incautados en un operativo intersinstiucional en el Puerto de Entrada Nueva York / Newark, sobre el cual apenas informaron autoridades.
Pruebas hechas a sesenta paquetes revelaron que el contenedor estaba lleno de droga, por lo que oficiales de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP), la Guardia Costera, la Administración de Control de Drogas (DEA), el Departamento de Policía de Nueva York (NYPD) y la Policía del Estado de Nueva York (NYSP) procedieron a la incautación, la segunda más alta en ese puerto y la mayor en casi 25 años.
“Esta es una incautación importante, de hecho, es la mayor incautación de cocaína en el Puerto de Nueva York / Newark desde mayo de 1994”, dijo Troy Miller , director de Operaciones de Campo de Nueva York de CBP.
No queda claro si toda la droga se distribuiría en los Estados Unidos, ya que un porcentaje del tráfico se envía luego a Canadá. También se desconoce el grupo criminal al que se le atribuye el cargamento, pero el Reporte de la Oficina de Drogas y Crimen de las Naciones Unidas de 2018, la mayor parte de esta droga se envía de México, Centro y Sudamérica.
Las rutas son variadas, tal como fiscales federales explicaron en la Corte Federal de Brooklyn, sobre cómo la organización criminal de Guzmán Loera adquiría la droga de países como Colombia y Ecuador para enviarla a México y de ahí a Estados Unidos , aunque también había envíos que evitaban México.
Aunque “El Chapo” no opera el Cártel de Sinaloa, éste sigue siendo uno de los más poderosos en México, donde también ha aumentado la participación del Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), liderado por Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias “El Mencho” , por quien autoridades estadounidenses ofrecen $10 millones de dólares.
Las autoridades no especificaron a qué grupo criminal atribuyen la cocaína incautada ni su origen, pero ABC citó a una fuente relacionada con la investigación que afirmó que el cargamento llegó a Newark desde Buena Ventura, Colombia, y su siguiente parada era Amberes, Bélgica.
“Las organizaciones criminales transnacionales confían en las redes ilícitas de todo el mundo para suministrar, transportar y distribuir cocaína y otras drogas peligrosas”, dijo Brian Michael , agente especial a cargo de la oficina de Investigaciones de Seguridad (HSI) Newark.
Un reporte del New York Times indica que a pesar del juicio contra Guzmán Loera, las drogas nunca han dejado de cruzar la frontera, ya que en 2016 y 2017, los años en que el mexicano fue arrestado y enviado para ser procesado en Nueva York, la producción de heroína mexicana aumentó en un 37 por ciento y las incautaciones de fentanilo en lugares como Nogales aumentaron a más del doble, según la DEA.
En tanto, el Departamento de Estado indicó que el 90 por ciento de toda la cocaína introducida de contrabando en los Estados Unidos todavía ingresa al país desde México.
El reporte de Naciones Unidas señala que en 2016 hubo un récord en producción de cocaína, con 1,410 toneladas, un 25 por ciento más que el año anterior y el 69 por ciento de esa droga tuvo su origen en Colombia cuyas organizaciones criminales tienen fuertes lazos con las mexicanas.

“La cocaína, la némesis de Nueva York de los años 90, es indicadora de que los traficantes impulsan la construcción de una base de clientes emergente de usuarios que mezclan cocaína con fentanilo”, dijo el agente a cargo de la DEA, Ray Donovan.

Texto completo: Did you hear the latest conspiracy theory?
You see, the Seahawks did not really lose Super Bowl XLIX against the Patriots. They handed off to Marshawn Lynch on the 1-yard line and scored the winning touchdown with 20 seconds to play.
Really! You can watch it on YouTube!
Well, maybe after I create the video, complete with 27 8-by-10 color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph explaining what each one is. I'll add some ominous music to lend gravitas, and then post it on Facebook and get my friends to share. And then YouTube will start to recommend it. And before long it will be a movement! Millions of people will believe the Seahawks won Super Bowl XLIX, in spite of what their eyes told them four years ago.
Because that is the way these things work. As a recent headline in The New York Times asked: “YouTube Unleashed a Conspiracy Theory Boom. Can It Be Contained?”
Good question. From theories about the moon landing being a hoax to 9/11 being an inside job to the earth being flat, there is no shortage of reminders about humans' willingness to be duped. As P.T. Barnum said, there's a sucker born every minute. Some people claim he never uttered those words — but that's probably a conspiracy.
Anyway, a recent study by Texas Tech University found that attendees at flat earth conferences typically cite YouTube videos as a primary influence in their belief that the earth is not round. Having never watched such a video, I'm not sure how they explain why people don't literally fall of the edge, but I'm sure there is an answer.
“There's a lot of helpful information on YouTube,” professor Asheley Landrum said, “but also a lot of misinformation. Believing the earth is flat is of itself not necessarily harmful, but it comes packaged with a distrust of institutions and authority more generally.” To which a certain segment of the population would reply that Landrum is obviously part of the deep state.
Some of this apparently is fueled by YouTube's algorithm for recommending videos. If you watch a 9/11 conspiracy video, you are more likely to find a moon landing conspiracy video next on your list — rather than, say, interviews with people who lost relatives on 9/11 or people who were in the World Trade Center.
Because of this, YouTube is changing how it figures which videos to recommend, reducing the spread of “borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.” For examples, it cited “videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.”
Of course, “borderline” and “misinform” and “harmful” are in the eye of the beholder. But repeated exposure to “information” alters our viewpoint — regardless of how untrue it might be. As Mike Caulfield, the director of blended and networked learning at Washington State University Vancouver tweeted recently: “I will say this until I am blue in the face — repeated exposure to disinformation doesn't just confirm your priors, it warps your world and gets you to adopt beliefs that initially seemed ridiculous to you.”
There is nothing new about this. As a pair of European researchers detailed in 2017, “Contrary to common assumptions, belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout human history.” It's just that they are much easier to share in the digital age.
Take the anti-vaccine movement. Despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, millions of people have come to believe that vaccines are linked to autism. The result: An outbreak that has infected at least 70 people in Clark County.
Or take climate change. Despite near unanimity among climate scientists, millions of people believe the earth is not warming or that change is not caused by human activity. The result: Well, we might find out the hard way.
All of which, I suppose, is a reminder to be discerning about your sources of information. Lest you come to beli

Texto completo: It’s a happy accident that the five books I’m looking forward to reading this spring are all by women, and an even happier one that this column coincides with Women’s History Month:
The Dreamers by Karen Thompson Walker – San Diego hometown girl, UCLA alum, and New York Times bestselling author.
In her previous novel, “The Age of Miracles,” Walker imagines a world where the days and nights are inexplicably growing longer while her young protagonist, Julia, is experiencing her own off-kilter experience of adolescence. Walker’s new novel has a similar theme: Inexplicably, the residents of a small Southern California college town are falling asleep, and they don’t wake up. The only clue to this mysterious illness is that the sleepers are experiencing unusually high levels of brain activity that suggest heightened dreams. Vogue, Huffington Post, Real Simple, and BuzzFeed all called Walker’s second novel one of the most anticipated books of 2019, and I’m not surprised. Walker has an exquisite ability to imagine near-future dystopian circumstances that illuminate the provocative reality of the human experience. (Out now)
The Other Americans by Laila Lalami – Critically acclaimed novelist, Pulitzer-Prize finalist, American Book Award-winner, Los Angeles Times critic-at-large, Fulbright Fellowship recipient, Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and UC Riverside creative writing professor.
Lalami’s newest novel tells the story of Driss Guerraoui, a Moroccan immigrant in California killed by a speeding car while crossing the street. Lalami introduces an extraordinary cast of characters, each connected to the event in some way, as this family saga and murder mystery are woven to reveal a tapestry of immigration and “other” in America. The book has received rave reviews from the likes of Roxane Gay, J.M. Coetzee, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, and it was named one of the most anticipated books for 2019 by Entertainment Weekly, The Boston Globe, and New York Magazine/Vulture. It’s also received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. (Out March 26)
The City in the Middle of the Night by Charlie Jane Anders – Award-winning novelist (Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Lambda Literary Award); prolific short story writer (Tin House, Monkey Bicycle, and Boston Review, to name a few); organizer of the monthly San Francisco reading series Writers with Drinks; publisher, along with Annalee Newitz, of the magazine other; and the creator of the Ballerina Pie Fight — and yeah, it’s exactly what you think it is.
That’s a lot about the author and not a lot about the book, but imagine a tale of a dying planet and its reluctant young revolutionary, Sophie, told by the person I just described and you’ll see why this novel is compelling enough to be named one of Book Riot’s Most Anticipated Books of 2019. (Out now)
Magical Negro by Morgan Parker – Author of “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé” (a Time magazine Best Paperback of 2017) among others; National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship recipient; Pushcart-Prize winner; writer for The Paris Review, Best American Poetry, The New York Times, and The Nation; creator and host of Reparations, Live! at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, and an Angeleno.
Wry. Intelligent. Lyrical. Urgent. Atmospheric. Profound. These are just some of the adjectives used to describe this important book of poetry about black womanhood that Publishers Weekly awarded a starred review. (Out now)
Finding Dorothy by Elizabeth Letts – New York Times bestselling author whose writing career was inspired in part by Mrs. Barclay, the children’s librarian at Malaga Cove Library in Palos Verdes.
Letts imagines the life of Maud Gage Baum, wife of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” author Frank Baum, taking the reader back to 1938 and Hollywood’s production of her late husband’s masterpiece. Seventy-seven-year-old Maud — the daughter of a suffragette and one of the first women in the Ivy League — is determined to ensure that the film’s producers stay true to the spirit of the real secrets behind it which only she knows. Letts started writing at the age of 40 with much success: two New York Times bestsellers and a BookPage starred review for this newest book. (Out now)
This eclectic list of accomplished women celebrates the rich diversity of California authors and the power of the female voice offering us the perfect reading list for Women’s History Month.

Suffragist dared to run, but couldn't vote

Texto completo: Women weren't given the right to vote nearly a century ago. They fought for it.
Suffragist Emma Beckwith was one of the bold women who paved the way for equal rights and to give women a voice in politics. In 1889, she ran for mayor of Brooklyn, New York – 30 years before women's votes were counted.
Born Emma Knight in Cincinnati in 1849, Beckwith grew up in Toledo and graduated from high school at age 17. After she was married, the couple moved to Brooklyn.
Beckwith used her knowledge of bookkeeping to find a position on Nassau Street in New York City's Financial District "by promising to be good and not demoralize the men employed in the several offices in the building," according to her profile in "A Woman of the Century."
She was also active in suffrage groups and charities to support working women.
Then, Belva Lockwood became the second woman to run for president of the United States, appearing as the Equal Rights Party candidate in 1884 and 1888. (The first woman to run, Victoria Woodhull in 1872, would not yet have been 35 and so was not eligible to be president if she had won.)
Beckwith was inspired by Lockwood to run on the Equal Rights Party ticket for mayor of Brooklyn, an independent city at the time.
"Brooklyn is not greatly torn up over the canvas of Mrs. Emma Beckwith for mayor, but the lady herself asserts that she is deadly earnest about it," reported the Erie County Independent of Hamburg, New York.
News reports were patronizing. The New York Sun described her looks: "She is, contrary to all traditions of suffragists, extremely womanly in appearance." The New York Times noted that when she was nominated, the hall "was not large enough to hold all those who were eager to see the ceremonies. It was a very small hall."
Beckwith's platform was to help women achieve municipal positions as police matrons and coal inspectors, and to serve equally on the school board and park board. She suggested "strong women" could sweep the streets because men knew nothing of sweeping.
The Sun paraphrased Beckwith saying that "true women, not fashionable and frivolous butterflies, are more prudent, economical and better managers than men."
Lockwood came out herself to campaign for Beckwith. "I can see no reason, for my part, why a competent householder, who is able to keep her own house and family in order shouldn't have the ability to clean out the City Hall and the municipality of this city," Lockwood told the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. "... I believe that Mrs. Beckwith, as Mayor of Brooklyn, will be able to clean out the political rats who have been gnawing at the granary bins of the city treasury."
The campaign lasted 10 days and cost $75, which Beckwith paid out of her pocket. She printed her ballot on pink paper.
Brooklynites re-elected Democratic Mayor Alfred C. Chapin on Nov. 5, 1889. Beckwith had to request the tally for how many votes she got. She was told her results were not announced because the public was more interested in Chapin and the Republican candidate, Col. Andrew D. Baird.
Various sources reported that she received between 25 and 100 votes. Of course, women couldn't vote. Progress was slow.
Beckwith remained active in women's causes such as the Women's Peace Circle along with suffragists Lockwood and Clara Barton. She was the first president of the Rainy Day Club, which supported women who wore shorter "rainy day" skirts that reached their shoe tops and became a symbol of women's emancipation.
Beckwith died Nov. 25, 1919. Nine months later, the 19th amendment declaring that the right to vote could not be denied on account of sex was adopted.

Developers eye bin Laden house; Apartment complex proposed for 18-acre site of former vacation house of al-Qaida founder's brother

Texto completo: A west Orange County estate that was once a vacation home for a brother of Osama bin Laden could be turned into an apartment complex - a prospect some who live nearby fear will harm their lakefront neighborhood.
Project developers want to build 242 apartments with a view of idyllic Johns Lake on some of the gated 18 acres formerly owned by Khalil bin Laden, a brother of the architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Michael Rausch, who lives across the lake from the site, said the property's uncertain future concerns him more than the bin Ladens ever did.
"Never gave it a thought," he said of the Saudi businessman who visited with his family only a few times a year and never after 9/ 11.
The property, dubbed "Desert Bear" for bin Laden's company that owned it, is on State Road 50 across from the Killarney outpost of the West Orange Trail, about a mile west of a Florida's Turnpike interchange.
The Mediterranean mansion, built in 1928, would remain. Current owner Gary English said he hopes to restore it to its past splendor.
The land was annexed in October by Oakland, a community of about 3,000 people often likened to the sleepy TV town of Mayberry because of its dirt roads and oak tree canopies.
Neighbors who live in unincorporated Orange County in the adjacent Deer Island community, contend the proposed apartment project is incompatible with the surrounding community, especially the luxury waterfront homes.
They say it would flood the neighborhood with unwanted traffic, especially during morning and evening rush hours, when S.R. 50 is bumper-to-bumper with commuters, and draw crime, noise and problems they say are common to multi-family complexes.
"It is just not a good fit for the area nor for the town of Oakland, which bills itself as a 'quaint small town,'" resident Nancy Bramley said in an email, adding that a majority of her Deer Island neighbors also oppose the project.
Some say apartment buildings would mar their view of the water and landscape.
"Out my back door, what I see now is oak trees and darkness at night. ... What I don't want to see is a bright-lit horizon and what appears to be a college dormitory in my backyard," said Mike Leo, who lives across the lake in adjacent Lake County.
English contends the griping is without merit.
He said traffic studies don't square with neighbors' worries and the apartments wouldn't be visible to most neighbors.
English, who bought the property in March 2014 for $1.5 million, pointed out that Alabama-based LIV Development also trimmed its original plan for 288 apartments in four-story buildings to 242 units in three-story buildings.
"I think it's the best bet for the property," he said.
More than 100 people, many clad in red T-shirts declaring "no apartments in Oakland," packed a town planning and zoning board meeting last month to protest the project's requests for a change in land-use policy and zoning.
Some argued apartment towers would destroy Oakland's small town charm, where peacocks roam unpaved streets.
But the town's zoning board voted 6-1 to recommend town commission approve the land change to "mixed-use activity center," which could allow the high-density, multi-family housing.
Another zoning board discussion is set for March 19 and town commissioners won't consider the issues until April 23.
Deer Island resident Ernie Marsh said his neighborhood would be more welcoming to an assisted-living facility or single-family homes on the property. He said lakefront homes could fetch $1 million or more.
The west Orange homestead made news nearly 18 years ago after the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, which killed nearly 3,000 people.
The victims included passengers aboard airliners flown into the buildings and on a San Francisco-bound United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pa.
An Orange County sheriff's official said at the time that Khalil bin Laden, who was vacationing at the Desert Bear estate, "had been cleared by the federal government and he had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks."
Khalil bin Laden told authorities his family had received death threats, according to published reports. He was among more than 50 siblings or half siblings of Osama bin Laden, according to The New York Times. Their billionaire father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, was married 22 times.
Eight days after the attacks, an Orange County sheriff's motorcade escorted Khalil, his wife, Isabel, and son Sultan to Orlando International Airport, where they met other family members and boarded a flight to Washington's Dulles International Airport.
Desert Bear sold the Orange County property for $4 million in 2006, more than double the $1.6 million it paid in 1980.
It changed hands two more times before Gary and Dana English bought it in 2014.
English said he has discussed the property with about a dozen other developers but all other suitors wanted to build on the entire site - and none agreed to save the homestead.
His daughter, Victoria, created an online petition a month ago on change.org to "Help Save Our Historic Home in Oakland, FL" that was signed electronically by 1,176 people.
"We've exhausted every option to save our home and are being forced to sell off a portion of the property," the family's online appeal read. "By doing so we'll be able to keep our home and preserve the surrounding lakefront."
It made no mention of bin Laden or John Leclair, who leased the property in 2014 to stage weddings but left brides at the altar after taking deposits for nuptials.
Circuit Judge Donald Myers ordered Leclair to make restitution of $37,000 for "deceptive and unfair" business practices, according to court records.
Located near the Orange-Lake county line, the property had been zoned for "agricultural use" by Orange County's comprehensive land-use plan, though most of the surrounding properties are residential.
Oakland, desperate to build a tax base, annexed the property in October and has been trying to connect properties in town with new municipal water and sewer lines.
If the apartment complex is built as planned, it would become the single-largest property taxpayer in Oakland, generating $270,000 a year in property-tax revenue, an attorney for the project said.
LIV Development also would pay the town about $1.2 million in impact fees for parks and recreation facilities, roads, and police and fire services.
Nonetheless, neighbors say the apartment buildings would hurt their property values.
The Rausches, who are selling their home across the lake, had always considered the estate to be a neighborhood asset and a selling point in their favor, but the apartment proposal is troubling.
"You can't find another Oakland anywhere around, the reputation, the look," said Mike's wife, Teresa.
After the zoning-board hearing, she called her real-estate broker and dropped their asking price by $50,000.

Might the Democratic push for reparations benefit Trump?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Tiptoeing along the edge of caricature, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says: Native Americans should be “at the table” with African-Americans for a “robust discussion” about making some Americans pay reparations to other Americans to atone for misdeeds by still other Americans. The enumeration of the misdeeds, and the assignment of guilt for them, will presumably come later. What is, however, already clear is that the Massachusetts Democrat is going to need a large table.
If reparations are owed to the descendants of all members of minority groups that experienced protracted discrimination, the Irish can apply, citing the widespread practice of employers posting admonitions that “Irish need not apply.” Italians, too: An 1895 advertisement seeking labor to build a New York reservoir said whites would be paid $1.30 to $1.50 per day, “colored” workers $1.25 to $1.40 and Italians $1.15 to $1.25. Asians on the West Coast were subject to severe discrimination and violence. And Jews were restricted from acquiring the momentum that elite universities impart on the path to wealth.
Native Americans and African-Americans experienced uniquely severe injustices. However, there must be some statute of limitations to close the books on attempts to assign guilt across many generations to many categories of offenders (racial, ethnic, class). How does one compute the compensation that can justly be extracted from persons who, although they participate today in the national prosperity to which slaves involuntarily made substantial contributions, had no participation in the injustices inflicted?
It is also true that the nation as a whole was injured by the exclusion of African-Americans’ talents from American dynamism, both before and after hundreds of thousands of white Union soldiers were killed or maimed -- should their descendants be exempted from paying reparations? -- in the Civil War that ended slavery. But, then, semi-slavery survived for almost a century in Jim Crow laws after the end of Reconstruction.
If, however, you doubt that American discord can become much worse, try launching a scramble among racial and ethnic constituencies to assign varying degrees of guilt to others for varying degrees of injuries. Should reparations be means-tested, making affluent African-Americans ineligible? To avoid using moral micrometers to measure guilt and injuries, should lump sums (taken from whom? by what mechanism?) be awarded to groups? Does it matter that 3.1 million African-Americans identify themselves as of mixed race? Or that in the 2010 census, 1.8 million people self-identified as both white and black? Who would administer reparations? And at what cost to social harmony? Racial preferences (“affirmative action”) remain broadly unpopular after more than 50 years (the Philadelphia Plan to integrate building-construction unions began in 1967).
And which African-Americans shall count when counting for purposes of reparations? In 2005, The New York Times reported that since 1990, the average annual flow of immigrants from Africa -- about 50,000 -- had been more than came in chains in any of the peak years of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
There have been instances when reparations could be precisely targeted to defined cohorts that suffered clearly identifiable injuries. Consider an American infamy recounted in William K. Klingaman’s “The Darkest Year: The American Home Front, 1941-1942.” In 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of War Henry Stimson said “there has been no substantial evidence of sabotage” by people of Japanese extraction living on America’s West Coast. But California Attorney General Earl Warren said the “very absence of sabotage” was “the most ominous sign in the whole situation”: “I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security.” So, 120,000 American residents of Japanese descent -- a majority of them U.S. citizens -- were interned in camps. In 1988, each living survivor was promised a paltry $20,000 in compensation. Two more zeros would have been appropriate.
But today’s flippant talk about reparations illustrates a worsening pattern of behavior among congressional Democrats, including presidential candidates. (California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also express vague openness to reparations.)
A quarter-baked idea (reparations, a Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all) is floated. There is a stampede to endorse it before thinking about the idea’s dependence on enormous revenues of unknown origin and/​or unavailable technologies. Then, when details, or the lack thereof, reveal the idea’s wild impracticality, the stampeders breezily say: Nevertheless, the idea is virtuous because it is “aspirational.” Which means that the Democratic Party is again assisting, as in 2016, Donald Trump’s electoral aspirations.

Reading Baseball Babe Ruth: the legend and the man examined

Texto completo: Once Major League Baseball’s spring training camps open, the publishing industry gets ready to launch dozens of new baseball books. As baseball fans shake off the winter blues, commercial and academic presses hope fans will want to warm themselves and get ready for a new season by reading about baseball’s past seasons.
The most noteworthy baseball book published last year was Jane Leavy’s "The Big Fella: Babe Ruth and the World He Created," published by HarperCollins. A New York Times bestseller, it was named baseball’s best history or biography for 2018 by the Society for American Baseball Research.
In "The Big Fella," Leavy, as she did in her biography of Sandy Koufax, takes a single event, in this case Ruth’s barnstorming tour in 1927 with Lou Gehrig, as the centerpiece for her narrative of Ruth’s life from his early days when he was sent by his father to a Baltimore orphanage to his extraordinary and tumultuous career with the New York Yankees — a career that, Leavy contends, changed America’s culture. No one roared more during the Roaring Twenties than Babe Ruth.
The reason that Leavy selected the 1927 barnstorming tour was that Ruth was coming off the most monumental and memorable season of his career. In 1927, he hit 60 home runs, a record that would stand until the Yankees’ Roger Maris broke it in 1961 with the help of a season expanded from 154 to 162 games. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees, with Ruth hitting the only home runs, swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games.
Ruth’s 1927 barnstorming tour lasted three weeks and took him cross-country from New Jersey to California. At every stop, Ruth was mobbed by fans, who often disrupted the game by storming the field. Leavy uses the fan frenzy to illustrate Ruth’s hold, at the height of his career, on the imagination of Americans and the difficulty of finding the man behind the legend.
While Leavy’s book claims it breaks through "the mythology that has obscured the legend and delivers the man," "The Big Fella" spends most of its narrative recounting the gargantuan appetites and herculean feats that transformed Ruth into an American idol. There was, however, another Ruth biography published last year that does cut through the legend to get at the man.
Edmund Wehrle’s "Breaking Babe Ruth: Baseball’s Campaign Against Its Biggest Star," published by the University of Missouri Press, unveils Ruth as more victim than hero. Fearing that Ruth was becoming bigger than the game, baseball owners and their commissioner, abetted by sportswriters who portrayed Ruth as a ignorant man-child, used threats, fines and suspensions to control Ruth, eventually forcing him into submission.
While Ruth was a free spirit and often defied baseball’s establishment, the reserve clause gave the owners the weapon they needed to stifle Ruth. While he had a running battle with Yankee ownership over his salary, he had no option other than holding out or making an idle threat to leave the game.
Toward the end of his career, Ruth, struggling with injuries and illness, gave in to ownership demands because he wanted to become a major league manager after his playing career was over. But baseball’s establishment, once the aging Ruth was no longer a threat, exploited the image of Ruth as a man-child incapable of managing himself and blackballed him.
When Ruth died of cancer on Aug. 16, 1948, at the age of 53, an estimated 82,000 mourners wound around Yankee Stadium, where Ruth’s body lay in state. Over 6,000 surrounded St. Patrick’s Cathedral for Ruth’s funeral mass. While sportswriters lamented the loss of the Big Fella and celebrated his legendary exploits, the man who was finally laid to rest had his spirit broken before cancer eventually destroyed his body. * Reading Baseball is a series of stories and commentaries by Richard "Pete" Peterson, co-author with his son Stephen of "The Slide: Leyland, Bonds and the Star-Crossed Pittsburgh Pirates" and the editor of The St Louis Baseball Reader.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Can the memory of Michael Jackson survive "Leaving Neverland?
After all, it has bounced back before. The superstar's image was tarnished by allegations of sexual abuse that shadowed him throughout much of his adult life and even stood trial on child molestation charges in 2005, for which he was acquitted. His untimely death in 2009 seemed to wash that stain away in an outpouring of public love and a resurgence of sales of his always popular music.
Now, 10 years later, the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland has aired detailed and disturbing stories from two men who say Jackson groomed them for sex and molested them when they were just little boys.
It has cast a spotlight on Jackson's unsavory history at a #MeToo moment when old allegations against stars have been taking hold, and taking them down.
So far, there has been no evidence of major damage to Jackson's music or his estate, which has made an estimated $2 billion since his death. His music has been featured in commercials and is the subject of a Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas. A play about his life by Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage is due out on Broadway next year.
And it may not. After all, Jackson is dead now, which means he can't be charged or put on trial, keeping the story in the headlines for months or years to come.
And there is Jackson's nearly unparalleled star status - starting out as a cherub-faced 11-year-old sensation with the Jackson 5, then catapulting into a global phenomenon with the world's best-selling album of all time, "Thriller, to his credit and hits adored by multiple generations.
"It's hard to compare someone of Michael Jackson's caliber to anyone else, said Danny Deraney, a publicist who often handles crisis management. "I don't think we've seen anything like it.
Still, Oprah Winfrey, with her vast influence, may have heralded a shift in public attitudes just by hosting the special "After Neverland, in which she interviewed the documentary's subjects, James Safechuck and Wade Robson.
"I hope we can get beyond Michael Jackson the icon, stop staring into the sun, and do what is necessary to help our children and ourselves, Winfrey said in front of an audience of sexual abuse survivors and their supporters.
She did not directly condemn Jackson. But she praised the film, treated its assertions as truth, and said that she was expecting an earful from Jackson's defenders.
"I'm gonna get it, Winfrey, who interviewed Jackson before the allegations emerged in 1993 and his family after his death, said at the end of the show that aired Sunday and Monday on HBO and OWN just after the documentary.
And she did. Even before the special taped, she was subject to fierce criticism by some who left disparaging comments on her social media account.
It could be that Jackson's fandom is so pervasive, especially in countries that don't follow his personal news closely, that the documentary and renewed allegations will just make a small dent.
"For Michael Jackson's fans, more so probably outside of America, I don't think it will have an effect, because they'll ride or die with Michael, Deraney said.
Robson and Safechuck's allegations didn't emerge until 2013, when they filed lawsuits seeking money from Jackson's estate that have since been thrown out and are under appeal. Both men had previously denied Jackson sexually abused them and had been among his fiercest defenders when Jackson was alive, but say having their own children and Jackson's death led them to confront their truth.
Because of the men's past denials, some Jackson fans have dismissed their testimonies as lies, motivated by money. Some even refused to watch the documentary. Still, after the film began airing, there were casual fans who felt gutted by the revelations, with some saying they could not listen to his music the same way - if at all.
"People have already made the decision one way or the other, Deraney said. "I think when a lot of people think of Michael Jackson they already think pedophile,' whether or not there is any proof.
"I think what it comes down to, Deraney added, "is future generations.
Many millennials have only vague knowledge of the Jackson accusations, and are shocked even by facts that are acknowledged by both sides.
"I'm young enough to have not been aware of the allegations about Michael Jackson as they were happening, 31-year-old New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie tweeted while watching the documentary. "It is WILD TO ME that anyone thought his behavior around and constant contact with young boys was remotely okay.
Some of Jackson's fellow artists have indicated they will not give him and his influence up easily, and say they can separate the performer from the person.
Jason Derulo recently released the first music and videos from a planned boxed set of EPs that the singer and dancer made in tribute to Jackson. It's set to be released in its entirety on June 25, the 10th anniversary of Jackson's death.
"Michael was the sole reason I started singing and dancing, so this was a way for me to give back, Derulo, who has not seen "Leaving Neverland, told The Associated Press. "I started this project because of my love of the performer that Michael Jackson is and the influence that he had on my life as the best performer that ever lived. This has nothing to do with anyone's personal life.
India.Arie says it was right to speak out against R. Kelly, who faces new sexual abuse charges after the Lifetime documentary "Surviving R. Kelly aired more than a decade after he was cleared of child pornography charges. But Jackson's situation is different, the singer said.
"I think it's too late for people to be saying mute Michael Jackson,' Arie told the AP.
"With R. Kelly there's video, she said, referencing a sex tape that allegedly shows the singer's abuse. "With Michael Jackson, there's a lot of speculation. I don't know if it's going to go as far. ... Not because we love him more, I just think it's a different situation.
Jackson's estate, his most ardent fans, and his family, have no such ambiguity in their views. They say the documentary repeats discredited allegations from admitted liars.
Jackson's brothers said they were already in a rough period of managing his memory and legacy with their father Joseph Jackson's death last year, when they heard that "Leaving Neverland was coming.
"This time is difficult for us because you know Michael, coming up on the 10th anniversary of his passing and my father passed away six months ago, Marlon Jackson told the AP last week. "So those things are still there, and you never get rid of them. You learn to live with them. And now we're dealing with something that's totally different but has no truth to it. There's no facts at all.
At least one prominent and formerly devoted fan says he's been forced to reconsider.
"I've spent a lifetime loving MJ, Los Angeles Times music writer Gerrick D. Kennedy wrote after seeing the documentary's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
"Roughly an hour into Leaving Neverland,' it felt like my chest had caved in ... It wasn't long before I accepted that Leaving Neverland' would force me - and likely many others who also feel a deep connection to Jackson's work - to see that none of us really knew him. And that maybe we'd been avoiding the truth.
The subjects of the documentary themselves don't have strong feelings about whether people should give up Jackson's music.
"It's a chance to reevaluate who you want to be your idols, Safechuck told the AP at Sundance. "Because you can write a song, does that mean you should be people's moral compass? ... It's less about tearing down somebody and more about an opportunity of who do we want to look up to.
"There's plenty of other amazing people to fill that role.

HIV patient seemingly cured in second remarkable case, London doctors report

Texto completo: A patient in London is HIV-free, doctors announced this week in what appears to be an astounding case.
A patient who was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 has become the second patient ever known to be cured of the infection that affects close to 37 million people worldwide after receiving a bone marrow transplant intended to treat cancer, doctors say. The patient received the stem cell transplant from a donor with a rare CCR5 mutation that allows HIV resistance in May of 2016 to treat his Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
The London patient, who is remaining anonymous, also underwent chemotherapy. He took antiretroviral therapy drugs for HIV until September of 2017, doctors say. His drug regiment was much less harsh than the only other known patient who was cured of HIV.
He has been HIV-free, in remission, for 18 months, according to tests.
In a research letter set to publish Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, doctors who treated him say this proves that the Berlin patient cured of HIV in 2007 wasn’t an anomaly and HIV remission is possible.
“Everybody believed after the Berlin patient that you needed to nearly die basically to cure HIV, but now maybe you don’t," said Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at University College London who presented the findings at a conference in Seattle, The New York Times reports.
The first patient to be cured of HIV, Berlin patient Timothy Ray Brown, underwent two bone-marrow transplants also for cancer treatments, took a cocktail of drugs and experienced serious complications that put his life in danger. At one point, doctors induced a coma. He survived the ordeal, coming out of it without HIV. Over a decade later, he is still considered cured. Treatments that have tried to replicate Brown's result in other HIV patients have failed, until now.
Gupta's team says the London patient's treatment isn't conventional for all HIV patients, but does offer hope for future HIV and AIDS treatments.

I vetted judges and senior Justice officials and never came across anyone like Jared Kushner

Resumen: Trump son-in-law got a top-secret security clearance despite intelligence community concerns. I was denied clearance for a blog post about hacking.

Texto completo: On the surface you wouldn’t think Jared Kushner and I have much in common, but we both have an interest in access to secret information.
As a private eye in the 1970s and 80s, I started tracking down skipped debtors, then performed due diligence employment investigations and finally graduated to high profile corporate accountability cases. In the 1990s I became a congressional investigator — like those working for the House Committee on Oversight and Reform chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.
Cummings in January launched an investigation into security irregularities in the Trump White House, focused in particular on top-secret clearances for nine current and former high level White House appointees. Kushner is now at the top of the list in light of what Cummings called "grave new reports" that President Donald Trump "may have falsely claimed that he played no role" in the clearance process for his son-in-law and senior White House adviser, a highly leveraged real estate developer whose foreign partners include Saudi Arabia and other countries potentially at odds with U. S. policies and interests.

The Rob Porter mess reveals a broken White House, not a broken security process
If people on food stamps made Jared Kushner's paperwork mistakes, they might starve
I worked on the Senate Judiciary Committee staff for Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, for three years researching judicial nominees and high-ranking Justice Department appointees seeking confirmations. Typically the individuals whose backgrounds I delved into had long, impressive resumes and abundant bona fides. They had been vetted by the FBI, had completed long detailed questionnaires, and had provided reams of financial records, academic papers and speeches for review.
While I had access to power, I had none of my own. I had an edgy past that included dropping out of college and living in Mexico among hippies and drug dealers. I knew for sure I would never be confirmable. I sat on the bench behind my senator boss during Anita Hill’s devastating testimony, but watched Clarence Thomas survive the vote. I saw Zoe Baird’s attorney general bid go down in flames over a nanny. I eventually left government for journalism.
On paper, Kushner is even less fit for high-level access than I am. He omitted potentially disqualifying details from his background questionnaire, suggested setting up a back channel to a hostile foreign government during the transition, and has been discussed as a weak link by foreign powers, according to a Washington Post report sourced to "current and former U. S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter. "
But, while he may not be qualified, Kushner is deeply persistent and impeccably connected. He was a key player in his father-in-law’s election and was responsible for bringing (later disgraced) Cambridge Analytica into the digital campaign. When they arrived in Washington, among other chores, Trump tasked Kushner with brokering Middle East peace.
Kushner given access despite concerns
When his original security clearance was delayed, Kushner was assigned an interim designation approved for top-secret access to intelligence reports. The privilege allowed him access to our government’s most sensitive secrets — including his own preview copy of the president’s daily intelligence briefing.
Provisional approvals are typically issued to allow appropriately vetted individuals to start a security level job right away while the bureaucratic wheels turn. In the months following Trump’s inauguration, interim approvals were apparently handed out like Halloween candy. NBC recently reported, based on "two sources familiar with the matter," that career bureaucrats recommending against top-secret clearances for inexperienced officials and unsuitable candidates were overruled in “at least 30 cases. ”
The indefinite interims came under scrutiny in February 2018 after White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, working on conditional authority, was publicly accused of domestic abuse. The alleged battering had been disclosed to the FBI agents conducting Porter’s background investigation a year before, but Trump’s assistant was nevertheless still privy to the president’s highly classified papers and phone calls.
Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, a retired 4-star Marine general, took considerable heat from the press on whether he had previously known about Porter’s transgressions. Within weeks Kelly revoked or downgraded dozens of the interim clearances, including Kushner’s. The New York Times, citing "four people briefed on the matter," reported last week that in May 2018, three months after the interim clearances were revoked, former White House General Counsel Don McGahn cited CIA concerns and continued to refuse to recommend Kushner for a permanent top secret pass. Trump, with ultimate authority in the decision, directed Kelly to give Jared what he wanted.
I didn't make the cut for far less
Both McGahn and Kelly, perhaps anticipating future requests from Cummings and other authorities, documented their objections in internal memoranda. The president announced McGahn’s departure three months later and Kelly was gone before the year ended. Kushner is still enjoying his West Wing office.
After many years of vetting others, in 2013 I was finally recruited for a clearance level job by a U. S. agency with most of its focus in the Middle East. I was flattered, but I suggested that a history of substance indiscretion would surely eliminate me in a review. My backers and would-be colleagues assured me such past activity would not be a problem (“they are looking for spies, not pot smokers”).
I filled out the questionnaire, but it was not to be. The week my application file was assigned for clearance, Edward Snowden turned up in Hong Kong fresh off his National Security Agency desk to humiliate the same federal agency that would review my file. They had repeatedly cleared the talented cyber analyst-turned-whistleblower and were suddenly facing finger-pointing from Congress. My interrogators were especially concerned by a blog post I’d written a few years earlier confessing my respect for hackers as a component of transparency. My job offer was regretfully withdrawn.

Jerrold Nadler says 'very clear' Trump obstructed justice, sending 60 document requests Monday

Texto completo: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said with complete certainty Sunday that President Trump obstructed justice, but he's not ready to pursue impeachment proceedings just yet.

He was asked during an interview with CNN's Jake Taper: "Do you think the president obstructed justice?"

"Yes, I do," Nadler replied.

"It’s very clear that the president obstructed justice," he added. "It’s very clear – 1,100 times he referred to the Mueller investigation as a witch hunt, he tried to – he fired – he tried to protect [former national security adviser Michael] Flynn from being investigated by the FBI. He fired [former FBI Director James] Comey in order to stop the Russian thing, as he told NBC News."

Nadler also said Trump has intimidated witnesses in public, likely referring to the president's tweets about Michael Cohen.

Asked if this meant Democrats were making a political decision in not pursuing impeachment right now, Nadler said the issue is Democrats don't "have the evidence all sorted out."

Nadler said on Monday his committee plans to send document requests to more than 60 different people and individuals from the Trump administration and the president's inner circle to begin "investigations to present the case to the American people about obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power."

The chairman was also asked about a New York Times report last week that said Trump overruled his White House counsel and the intelligence agencies that wanted to deny a top-secret security clearance to Jared Kushner, the president's adviser and son-in-law.

"Yes, I think it was an abuse of power. Look, the president has the right to do a lot of things but he can abuse his power in doing that," he said.

Texto completo: It's a vision of two Detroits that have mostly faded now -- the social set born of the American auto industry's vast wealth and the galvanizing magic of '60s Motown -- together in a room.
In June 1965, the Supremes, one of America's biggest and most glamorous groups, performed at a debutante party at the Country Club of Detroit in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the posh all-white enclave just northeast of the city.
It was the debutante party of Christy Cole Wilson, and The New York Times pictures of the event tell a layered story of two groups connected, at least for the evening, by the music of that time and place.
The three elegant darlings of Detroit, led by the 21-year-old Diana Ross, serenade a room of finely attired guests, many of practically the same age. But between the groups were also the realities of race and class -- the distance between Grosse Pointe and the Brewster projects where the Supremes grew up, 10 miles and several worlds away.
The Times covered the lavish event in avid detail. "It took three days, hundreds of fresh blue irises, thousands of little Italian lights and hundreds of thousands of yellow plastic flowers to turn the club into a French garden," the story enthused. "Whole walls had disappeared behind Austrian silk panels of gold and mirrors before the 750 guests arrived."
Not until the eighth paragraph did the story mention that "when they were not dancing and being entertained by a rock 'n' roll group called the Supremes, the Wilsons and their guests were polishing off 20 cases of French champagne, attempting to create a liquor shortage (the plot failed), and heaping their plates with food from an abundantly stocked buffet table."
The trio hardly needed an identifier at that point. Between August 1964 and June 1965, the Supremes had five No. 1 singles, including "Baby Love," "Stop! In the Name of Love" and "Back in My Arms Again," which had gone to the top of the charts just six days before this party. Which is exactly why Ms. Wilson's parents hired them.
"Everyone had very glamorous deb parties when I was growing up," said Ms. Wilson Hofmann, 72, who now lives in Bristol, R.I.
Her father, Ralph C. Wilson Jr., a millionaire insurance scion who had "a stable in Lexington, Ky., and the Buffalo Bills football team," seemed happy to toast his daughter in such style. The event reportedly cost $85,000, which would be roughly $675,000 today. (This was just the hometown event; the 18-year-old Ms. Wilson had already been formally presented at the Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball in New York in December 1964.)
It was an era when families of distinction across the country presented their daughters to society, with the intention that suitable men from similar backgrounds would meet their future wives. In Grosse Pointe, it was the "Ford girls," the great-granddaughters of Henry Ford, who had ramped up the deb-ball arms race. Nat King Cole sang at Charlotte Ford's storied party in 1959, while Ella Fitzgerald performed at her sister Anne's soiree in 1961.
Racial dynamics were changing in the 1960s, but often in fits and starts. The Supremes performing at a private club in Grosse Pointe, which still had no black residents, reflected this lurching progress.
"Music filtered in," said Izzy Donnelly, the director of education at the Grosse Pointe Historical Society. "The '60s were about breaking tradition. Bringing black entertainers to debutante balls and private clubs was putting a big foot in the front door."
It wasn't an intentional political statement to hire the Supremes to perform at her party, Ms. Wilson Hofmann said. She chose them because she loved their music, and she was from a family that could make her request happen.
"I grew up in Grosse Pointe and loved the Supremes and that kind of music, like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye," said Ms. Wilson Hofmann.
"They were extraordinarily popular with white audiences, black audiences and everyone else," said Dolores Barclay, an author and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, who collaborated with Diana Ross on the singer's memoir. "Appearing in white venues was breaking down racial barriers. But it's a different type of disruption. It's nonconfrontational. It's having a platform and saying, 'Yes, we're here, we're great and we're a part of American music."'
The Supremes were homegrown celebrities in Detroit and received star treatment, but there were black entertainers across the country still entering clubs and performance halls through the kitchen.
"Anything in the South was still tenuous," said Coraleen Rawls, collections manager at the Motown Museum in Detroit. "On one hand, we had artists who were happy to perform because that's their passion and vocation. But it was also disheartening to be international stars and still be treated differently."
Just two years after Ms. Wilson's debut, Detroit would experience the devastating unrest of 1967, as the city's racial and economic disparities exploded into national awareness. And the Motown sound would prove to be a powerful force in the healing process.
"It unified people and brought us all together," Ms. Rawls said. "Where there were ropes between whites and blacks, those ropes started disappearing, as the people on both sides were like, 'We're all dancing. Why do we have to have a rope in the middle? You're dancing, I'm dancing. We're singing, you're singing, so why do we have to be separated by some rope because of some thoughts prior to our generation as to how you think we should be?"'
The year after the Supremes played Ms. Wilson's party, the first black family moved to Grosse Pointe, and by 1974, The Times reported that three African-American families called the town home. In 2019, Grosse Pointe Farms, where the Country Club of Detroit is, remains 94 percent white, while the city of Detroit is 79 percent black.
The deb parties continued in Grosse Pointe, albeit in a scaled-back fashion. In 1970, The Times covered the celebration for Sheila Ford, another heir of the automobile family. She opted for a short purple dress instead of traditional formal attire, and hired the group Sha-Na-Na, who "played what the listeners called real modern blues music."

Texto completo: Headnote Race and Politics
The "revelation" that Del. Mary Ann Lisanti from Harford County (who is White), referred to an area in predominantly Black Prince George's County as a "nigger district," has taken Annapolis by storm. The mandatory shock and outrage has ensued.
Here we go again.
According to the Washington Post, Lisanti was at Annapolis Cigar (stating the obvious, a cigar bar in Annapolis) in late January when she allegedly made the comment in the presence of a small, racially mixed group of fellow lawmakers. Specifically, Lisanti allegedly told a White colleague at the after hours gathering that when he campaigned in Prince George's on behalf of a candidate last fall, he was door-knocking in a "n- district."
"This morning (Feb. 26), Delegate Mary Ann Lisanti apologized to the House Democratic Caucus for her use of the n-word," said Speaker of the House Michael Busch in a statement. "While I believe her apology was heartfelt, the damage among her colleagues and the public has been done."
Apparently, the knowledge of Lisanti's alleged use of the so-called "n-word" is even more stinging in the midst of Black History Month.
"The month of February marks the commemoration of Black History Month. Astoundingly, racial transgressions have been a staggering theme in a month which celebrates the rich history, culture, and progressions of African-Americans," said Del. Darryl Barnes of Prince George's County and chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, in a letter to Speaker Busch. "The blatant act of racism by Delegate Mary Ann Lisanti has blanketed a time where we should be recognizing achievements in the African-American community."
I don't mean no harm, as we say in West Baltimore and pardon my cynicism but, why are we flabbergasted by a White woman from Harford County referring to a community in Prince George's as a "n-- district?"
Don't get me wrong, we shouldn't let Lisanti slide for disrespecting the people of one of the most prosperous Black counties in America. If she can be forced to resign, that seems appropriate to me; racist statements by public servants (while in office especially) shouldn't be tolerated ever. But, why are we shocked? Why are we in our feelings?
Afterall, this is Trump's America.
For the record, I covered Annapolis as a reporter for years and over time I've forged relationships with dozens of state legislators, the vast majority of them Black. Most of the Black legislators from the venerable, to the backbenchers have confided that the Maryland General Assembly operates like a legislative plantation. So, allegations of White legislators spewing racial slurs seems like par for the course in many ways. However, within the nation's broader current political arena the machinations of the 45th President of the United States dominates the American political scene and gives expansive cover I believe, to people like Harford County's Lisanti and so many others. Take Iowa's Steve King, for example.
His phalanx of breathtaking racist statements over the years culminated recently with the Iowa Congressman finally coming clean when he declared to the New York Times in January, "White nationalist, White supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" he asked.
Trump seems baffled by that question as well.
While campaigning for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the heat of Cruz's battle against Rep. Beto O'Rourke during an Oct. 22 rally in Houston, Trump proclaimed, "You know, they have a word - it's sort of became old-fashioned - it's called a nationalist. And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, okay?" Trump proudly proclaimed. "I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word. Use that word."
Trump isn't a Hispanic nationalist. He's not an Asian nationalist. He's not an Indigenous nationalist. He damn sure ain't a Black nationalist. Donald John Trump is a White nationalist and he's proud of it. Are we all clear now?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is expected to host his first major fundraiser of 2019 at Mar-a-Lago on March 10, according to published reports.
The fundraiser is sponsored by Trump Victory, a joint fundraiser committee authorized by Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee, according to the invitation tweeted by New York Times reporter Thomas Kaplan.
Trump’s appearance would mark his 21st visit to his private Palm Beach club, dubbed the Southern White House, as president. It is not clear if the president would be in Palm Beach for more than the day. The Federal Aviation Administration has not issued any alerts on flight restrictions.
Trump would appear at the event alongside Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, and RNC finance chair Todd Ricketts.
McDaniel has offered unwavering support for Trump, leaving no doubt that she would back the president even if another Republican entered the race.
“They have the right to jump in and lose,” McDaniel said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. “That’s fine. They’ll lose horribly.”
The March 10 fundraiser will kick off a busy month of politicking at the president’s club. The Republican Party of Palm Beach County announced GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, will headline its annual Lincoln Day dinner at Mar-a-Lago on March 22.
Trump also hopes to finalize a trade agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago sometime in March, according to two tweets the president posted on Feb. 24.

Fresh Hopes, Familiar Disappointment Follow Gov. Newsom's Call for New DNA Testing in Kevin Cooper Case

Texto completo: On Friday, Feb. 22, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered new DNA tests in a 35-yearold quadruple murder case involving African American death row inmate, Kevin Cooper.
Newsom's decision could lead to the overturning of Cooper's 1985 conviction in the killing of a rural Chino Hills family and their 11 -year-old house guest. The case has the potential, some political watchers say, to divide Californians.
Both the California and United States supreme courts and more than a dozen lower courts have rejected Cooper's past appeals.
"I take no position regarding Mr. Cooper's guilt or innocence at this time," Newsom said in his executive order about the highprofile case that has drawn international interest. New York Times' columnist Nicholas Kristof, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and reality TV star, Kim Kardashian have all called for re-testing using current, more sensitive forensic technology.
The ACLU and other human rights and social justice groups have also urged California state officials to launch a deeper investigation into Cooper's conviction.
Gov. Newsom's order Friday expands previous direction issued by former Gov. Jerry Brown in December to test four pieces of crime scene evidence. Brown's order allowed analysts to perform DNA retesting on a tan T-shirt; an orange towel; and the handle and sheath of a hatchet prosecutors say Cooper used in the murders.
In this new investigation, analysts will look at strands of hair from the victims' hands, blood samples and a green button Cooper's attorney Norman Hile maintains investigators planted at the scene of the crime. A retired Los Angeles County Superior Court judge will oversee the investigation.
Cooper, 61, has maintained his innocence over the years. His lawyers hope the results of the re-testing ordered by Gov. Newsom, which could take several months, will help prove their client's innocence and finally exonerate him.
In 1985, a San Diego County jury convicted Cooper on four counts of murder. At the time of his arrest, he was 26 and an escaped prison inmate. His lengthy criminal record - including several burglaries and the rape of a minor in Pennsylvania - did not help his case.
Cooper, formerly named Richard Goodman, was born in 1958 near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When he was six months old, he was adopted and renamed Kevin Cooper. During his childhood, his parents physically abused him and he spent a good part of adolescence living in several juvenile detention centers. In 1982, Cooper escaped from a mental health facility in Pennsylvania before moving to California.
During his murder trial, prosecutors successfully argued that Cooper killed husband and wife Doug and Peggy Ryen, their 10year-old daughter Jessica and an 11-year-old neighbor Christopher Hughes. Police found the bloodied bodies in the Ryen's home with a total of 143 stab wounds. Joshua Ryen, the victims' 8-year-old son, suffered a slash wound on his throat. He was the only survivor of the attack.
After Coopers's jail break, investigators found, he illegally stayed in a house next door to the victims. They also say they found evidence in the Ryen's home and in the family's station wagon that tied Cooper to the murders.
For some, Gov. Newsom's order to broaden DNA testing in the case is being met with dismay. The lone survivor of the murders, Ryen and family, friends and supporters of the Ryens and Hughes all across the state say they are disappointed with the governor's decision.
"Unfortunately, over time it seems the victims' desire for justice in this case matters less and less," San Bernardino District Attorney Jason Anderson said in a statement. "Prior DNA testing that Mr. Cooper sought, agreed to and claimed would exonerate him have all confirmed Mr. Cooper's guilt."
Yet persuasive arguments based on conflicting testimonies and allegations of evidence tampering, keep raising reasonable questions about the methods and stories investigators used to nail Cooper. Three weapons were used in the attack, and in sworn testimony, Ryen said he saw three attackers who were White. He later testified that they could have been Hispanic.
Further complicating the prosecutions' claims, a woman named Diana Roper came forward with bloody clothing belonging to her former boyfriend, who was a violent criminal. She turned the evidence over to the police, but they destroyed it.
African Americans, Hispanics and other minorities living in San Bernardino County are not surprised about the allegations Cooper's attorneys are making about their D.A.'s office. Many of them frequently complain about racial biases and discrimination in the way their cases or complaints are handled. Just last month, a San Bernardino gang prosecutor, Michael Selyem, who is White, resigned under pressure for making crude and racist and comments on social media. His insults targeted former First Lady Michelle Obama, U,S. Rep. Maxine Waters and an unnamed Black shooting victim.
Thomas R. Parker, a former deputy head of the FBI's Los Angeles office, believes Cooper.
"This guy is innocent," he told the New York Times. "The evidence was planted, he was framed, the cops lied on the stand."
What has kept the case going - and Cooper alive - is a federal appellate court's decision in 2004 to stay his execution and review the case with more scientific evidence.
Gov. Newsom's decision to allow another round of DNA testing comes early in the term of the progressive California Governor whose supporters on the political Left have high expectations.
"DNA testing should immediately take place to resolve the Ryen case and finally ensure justice is served," Chiang said during the campaign. "Not only is it proven that DNA evidence can help law enforcement solve crimes, but testing in this case would come at no cost to the state."
Even though Newsom's decision in the Cooper case is bold, he is treading carefully on a potentially polarizing issue that California voters across the political spectrum are watching. He is keeping his focus on fairness and justice with the realization that the convictions of thousands of felons - particularly AfricanAmerican men - have been overturned after DNA testing proved their innocence.
"Especially in cases where the government seeks to impose the ultimate punishment of death," he said. "I need to be satisfied that all relevant evidence is carefully and fairly examined."

Texto completo: It’s fun to imagine what the Angels might be called if they played their home games in Long Beach. “Los Angeles Angels of Long Beach” has a nice ring to it, if you’re the kind of person who voted to rename the team’s Double-A affiliate the Rocket City Trash Pandas.
From a distance, the Angels appear to flit back and forth, the realization of Dante’s Rose of Paradise. They have moved from Los Angeles to California to Anaheim to Los Angeles of Anaheim, often without relocating. Last month their lease on Angel Stadium was extended, but only to Dec. 31, 2020. That opened the possibility for another move. If you’re the mayor of Long Beach, why not pay a call to 2000 E. Gene Autry Way?
Late Monday, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia confirmed to the Southern California News Group that city officials have approached the Angels about potentially relocating to a 13-acre waterfront property near the Convention Center. It’s a bold proposition. Angel Stadium is surrounded by 128 acres of city-owned land, mostly parking lots. The Long Beach site doesn’t leave much room for imagination. Steve Goodling, the President and CEO of the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, said Tuesday that officials haven’t begun a “formal visioning process” for the site. That sounds as important as it does vague.
The idea of moving the Angels to Long Beach demands another sort of visioning process: How does a professional sports franchise derive its identity?
Players are lucky to remain with one team for a decade. Managers and coaches, half that. Uniforms can remain static for generations, though even changing clothes won’t alienate an entire fan base. The simple, obvious answer is geography. If we follow the money, regional television contracts still reign over Major League Baseball unlike any other league in North America. Teams are assigned official “territorial rights” under MLB bylaws. If location is not the primary supplier of a team’s identity, what is?
Location was the centripetal force compelling baseball’s last franchise relocation. When executives for the Atlanta Braves plotted the home address of every fan who purchased a ticket during the 2013 season, the map revealed a disconnect. Turner Field anchored a giant red cluster of dots spreading out like a fan from downtown Atlanta. The cluster extended some 40 miles north, east and west. The area south of downtown was mostly blank.
Like the Angels, the Braves were a tenant in their city-owned ballpark. When the team failed to renew its lease agreement with Atlanta officials, it looked elsewhere for a home. SunTrust Park, located in the city of Cumberland, opened its doors in 2017. It’s a 14-mile drive north from downtown Atlanta, closer to the center of that big red cluster of dots. Turner Field was only 20 years old when it hosted its last Braves game, yet the move made sense.
If the Angels were to leave Anaheim, the dots would not lead them to Long Beach.
Using a crude but clever metric – Facebook likes – the New York Times attempted to plot MLB team fandom on a map of zip codes in 2014. There was a certain logic to the Angels-Dodgers divide. The farthest west that “Angels territory” extended was Seal Beach, in the northwest corner of Orange County. It’s separated from Long Beach by the San Gabriel River. Cross the river and you’re in Los Angeles County. According to Facebook, this is the beginning of Dodgers territory.
It would be inaccurate to say there are no Angels fans in Long Beach, but moving the team there would defy the simple logic that led the Braves to Cumberland.
A better metric for delineating the boundaries of “Angels territory” would be to identify where their season-ticket holders live. The team declined to provide this data, however. If we trust the Facebook data, once you leave Orange County, the only trail leading to more Angels fans is the Eastbound 91 Freeway: Chino Hills, Chino, Eastvale, Riverside, Norco. These isolated pockets are surrounded by Dodgers territory.
Facebook likes, however accurate, do not inform the official position of Major League Baseball.
MLB defines Dodgers territory and Angels territory as one and the same: “Orange, Ventura and Los Angeles counties; provided, however, that this territory shall be shared with” the other team. San Diego County is Padres territory. San Bernardino County is shared by its two Class-A California League teams, in Rancho Cucamonga and San Bernardino. Riverside County belongs to the Cal League’s Lake Elsinore Storm. The rest of Southern California is neutral land in the eyes of the league. Long Beach’s “formal visioning process” will certainly reveal its share of obstacles, but red tape from MLB should not be among them.
This is what makes the Braves’ relocation, or any other recent move, an apples-to-oranges comparison next to a possible Angels move to Long Beach. The Braves do not share their official territory with any other MLB team. Only the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, and the New York Yankees and Mets share certain slivers of their territory with each other. The Angels and Dodgers are the only teams that share 100 percent of their territory.
That’s why regional identity is so critical here. For all their name changes, the Angels have a geographically defined fan base within Southern California, even if MLB’s definition of “Angels territory” and “Dodgers territory” isn’t specific. Relocating to Long Beach – a Dodgers hotbed, and more than an hour away from the Angels hotbeds in Riverside County – would inconvenience a large portion of the team’s fan base. That makes for a questionable business plan.
It’s more than that, though: In baseball, running from your fans amounts to running from your identity.

Texto completo: Headnote Check It Out
In 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teen, was fatally shot by a White police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri. Witnesses said Brown had his hands up, and one witness claimed he heard Brown say, "I don't have a gun, stop shooting." And the picture was painted that Brown was gunned down by a trigger-happy racist cop.
But the same' witnesses confessed to the grand jury that Brown held his hands up at shoulder level for a brief moment, then he dropped his hands and charged the officer.
The phrase, "Hands up, don't shoot" may have never happened.
But activists continued to use "hands up, don't shoot" as a rallying cry against another narrative, the increase of extrajudicial killings of unarmed Black males by American police forces. This too, was statistically inaccurate, but that didn't matter, because the ulterior motive was to suggest the election of the first Black president changed nothing and racism was more prevalent than ever.
Since most people believe America is a racist society, first reports about White racism are accepted without question.
Last month a video segment showed a Covington Catholic high school student, wearing a red MAGA hat, smiling at a Native American playing a drum. The public rushed to judgment and accused the teenager of mocking the Native American's ancestry with the smirk of White privilege. But after a review of two hours of video footage, this turned out to be another false narrative, and an attempt to prove White racism was on the rise during the Trump presidency.
Not long after the Covington incident, where it was first suggested that red MAGA hats were the new KKK hoods, it was reported that in Chicago, Black/ gay actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted by individuals wearing red MAGA hats and the attackers put a noose around his neck. After an investigation the Chicago police declared the incident a hoax and charged Smollett with filing a false report.
But the initial public response was a unanimous condemnation of racial violence, and one media host lamented, "This is the state of America in 2019." The insinuation was that racism in 2019 was rampant, but that notion is just as fraudulent as "Hands up, don't shoot."
The current state of America can be defined as a state of post-racial denial. After the election of America's first Black president in 2008, the national dialogue centered around a single question: Is America finally a post-racial society? The answer was a resounding... No! Then the term was banned from any racial discussion, because "post-racial" was characterized to mean colorblind or a society where racism no longer existed. But that definition was inaccurate. The term post-racial first appeared in the New York Times in 1971. Its original context did not imply the disappearance of racism, but an era when race relations were not the biggest problem. So, when the term was re-introduced in 2008 the implication was that racism was not the preventive force it was in the past.
The implication was rejected, false narratives prevailed, and post-racial denial has turned into America's reality crisis.

U.S. disrupted Russian troll factory's internet during midterms

Texto completo: The U.S. military blocked internet access to a Russian entity seeking to sow discord among Americans during the 2018 midtermelections, several U.S. officials said, a warning that the group's operations against the U.S. are not cost-free.
The strike on the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, a company underwritten by an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, was part of the first offensive cyber campaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election, the officials said.
"They basically took the IRA offline," according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. "They shut 'em down."
The operation marked the first muscle-flexing by U.S. Cyber Command, with intelligence from the National Security Agency, under new authorities it was granted by President Donald Trump and Congress last year to bolster offensive capabilities.
Russia's tactics are evolving, and some analysts were skeptical of the deterrent value on either the Russian troll factory or on Putin, who, according to U.S. officials, ordered an "influence" campaign in 2016 to undermine faith in U.S. democracy. Officials have also assessed that the Internet Research Agency works on behalf of the Kremlin.
Cyber Command and the NSA declined to comment.
Disruption to Internet Research Agency networks took place as Americans went to the polls and a day or so afterward, as the votes were tallied, to prevent the Russians from mounting a disinformation campaign casting doubt on results, according to officials.
The blockage was so frustrating to the trolls that they complained to their system administrators about the disruption, the officials said.
The Internet Research Agency, according to federal prosecutors, is financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a tycoon from St. Petersburg and an ally of Putin. Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency and a company Prigozhin runs called Concord Management and Consulting, were among 16 Russian individuals and companies that a grand jury indicted a year ago as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Another element of the Cyber Command campaign, first reported by the New York Times, involved "direct messaging" that targeted the trolls as well as hackers who work for the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. Using emails, pop-ups, text or direct messages, U.S. operatives beginning last October let the Russians know that their real names and online handles were known and they should not interfere in other nations' affairs, defense officials said.

THE CASE FOR CELIBATE CLERGY CRITIQUES OF CATHOLICISM CHANGE OVER THE CENTURIES, YET THEY REMAIN THE SAME

Texto completo: The rhetoric of anti-Catholicism, whether its sources are Protestant or secular, has always insisted that the church of Rome is the enemy of what you might call healthy sexuality. This rhetorical trope has persisted despite radical redefinitions of what healthy sexuality means; one sexual culture overthrows another, but Catholicism remains eternally condemned.
Thus, in a 19th-century context, where healthy sexuality meant a large patriarchal family with the wife as the angel in the home, anti-Catholic polemicists were obsessed with Catholicism's nuns - these women who mysteriously refused husbands and childbearing and who were therefore presumed to be prisoners in gothic convents, victims of predatory priests.
Then, a little later, when the apostles of sexual health were Victorian "muscular Christians" worried about moral deviance, the problem with Catholicism was that it was too hospitable to homosexuality - too effete, too decadent, too Oscar Wildean even before Wilde's deathbed conversion.
Then, later still, when sexual health meant the white-American, two-kid nuclear family, the problem with Catholicism was that it was too obsessed with heterosexual procreation, too inclined to overpopulate the world with kids.
And now, in our own age of sexual individualism, Catholicism is mostly just accused of a repressive cruelty, of denying people - and especially its celibacy-burdened priests - the sexual fulfillment that every human being needs.
The mix of change and consistency in anti-Catholic arguments came to mind while I was reading "In the Closet of the Vatican," a purported exposé of homosexuality among high churchmen released to coincide with the church's summit this week on clergy sexual abuse. The book, written by a gay, nonbelieving French journalist, Frédéric Martel, makes a simple argument in a florid, repetitious style: The prevalence of gay liaisons in the Vatican means that clerical celibacy is a failure and a fraud, as unnatural and damaging as an earlier moral consensus believed homosexuality to be.
The style of Mr. Martel's account is fascinating because it so resembles the old Protestant critique of Catholic decadence. Instead of a tough-guy Calvinist proclaiming that Catholicism's gilt and incense makes men gay, it's a gay atheist claiming that gays use Catholicism's gilt and incense to decorate the world's most lavish closet. Instead of celibacy making men deviant, celibacy is the deviance and open homosexuality the cure. Celibacy used to offend family-values conservatism; now it offends equally against the opposite spirit.
The book is quite bad; too many of its attempted outings rely on the supposed infallibility of Mr. Martel's gaydar. And yet anyone who knows anything about the Vatican knows that some of the book's gossip is simply true - just as the other critiques of Catholicism have some correspondence to reality.
The church's teaching that gay sex is sinful has clearly coexisted with and encouraged powerful gay subcultures in the priesthood. Priests really have seduced and abused nuns, and still do today. Celibate men are not more likely to be predators (as one would hope the #MeToo era has decisively established), but particular kinds of predation have flourished in the priesthood, and the worst of that predation looks like an anti-Catholic polemic brought to life.
So if Catholics look at these changing-yet-recurring critiques of the church and see only bigotry, they would be making a grave mistake. A critic of the church can be quicker to see problems than a believer, and when critiques are dismissed just because they partake of anti-Catholic stereotypes - well, you get the disgraceful way the church treated allegations of clerical sex abuse for many years.
But at the same time, the way the "healthy sexuality" supposedly available outside the church seems to change with every generation offers a reason to be skeptical that all Catholic ills would vanish if Rome only ceased making "unnatural" demands like celibacy and chastity.
The sexual ethic on offer in our own era should make Catholics particularly skeptical. That ethic regards celibacy as unrealistic while offering porn and sex robots to ease frustrations created by its failure to pair off men and women. It pities Catholic priests as repressed and miserable (some are; in general they are not) even as its own cultural order seeds a vast social experiment in growing old alone. It disdains large families while it fails to reproduce itself. It treats any acknowledgment of male-female differences as reactionary while constructing an architecture of sexual identities whose complexities would daunt a medieval schoolman.
In the name of this not-obviously-enlightened alternative, Catholicism is constantly asked to "reform" away practices that are there because they connect directly to the New Testament - in the case of celibacy, to Jesus' own example and his hard words for anyone making an idol of family life.
This seems like a bad bargain, no matter how much hypocrisy there may be in Rome.
That clerical celibacy doesn't guarantee asceticism is obvious, any more than attending Mass guarantees prayerfulness (trust me on that one). But it preserves the call even when the system is corrupted. And to lose that call, in this era of scandal and unfinished purgation, could easily leave only the corruption, undiluted and unchecked.

Texto completo: John Everdell had lived most of his life with kidney disease. As a young man awaiting a transplant, he had briefly undergone dialysis. That’s how he knew, when the prospect of kidney failure loomed again in his late 60s, that he would refuse dialysis this round.
“He was a very independent man, with an idea of how he was going to live his life,” said Trix Oakley, his partner of 22 years.
“He didn’t want to be tied down to the routine, having to report to the dialysis clinic every other day. He didn’t like the ups and downs - feeling good but washed-out, then feeling crummy. He didn’t like being attached to the machine.”
A woodworker and furniture-maker, Everdell had been in his 30s when he was first diagnosed with kidney disease. By his 60s, he had received two transplants, with kidneys donated by his siblings.
But in recent years, living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he and Oakley could see that his second transplanted kidney was faltering. The readings on his monthly blood tests grew troubling; he felt cold and tired; his hands and feet began to swell. His doctors again suggested dialysis.
Instead, with Oakley’s help, he relied on what’s often called “conservative management,” which helps slow the disease’s progression and treats its symptoms and complications. He followed a careful diet, controlled his blood pressure, avoided weight gain and gave himself hormone injections to ward off anemia. A sister offered her kidney for a third transplant, when needed.
In the meantime, he and Oakley enjoyed road trips, particularly seeking out ferry routes from Canada to Florida. Everdell, who had once sailed across the Atlantic, was no longer strong enough to handle a boat, Oakley said. “So we took as many ferries as we could, because he loved being on the water.”
Developed as a temporary measure to keep patients with kidney disease alive until they could receive transplants, dialysis instead often becomes a way of life. More than 104,000 people over age 75 were receiving dialysis in 2016, the United States Renal Data System has reported; so were more than 130,000 patients ages 65-74.
It is a safe bet most never learned about an alternative: managing their disease and its symptoms medically, with frequent physician monitoring and consultation - but without dialysis.
Challenges of dialysis
Dialysis prolongs survival, but it also imposes burdens - like traveling to a clinic three times a week for four-hour sessions of hemodialysis, or doing multiple fluid exchanges daily for peritoneal dialysis, which can be performed at home. Conservative management can help patients avoid those routines.
Moreover, while some studies show that older patients undergoing dialysis survive longer than those using conservative management, those differences fade among people over age 75 who also contend with other serious health problems, as most do.
And survival, of course, is not the only thing patients value. Conservative management may allow greater freedom to pursue what matters to them, even if they live fewer weeks or months.
“Dialysis is a life-changing event,” said Dr. Susan Wong, a nephrologist at the Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Center in Seattle, and lead author of a new study in JAMA Internal Medicine. “It’s a very demanding form of treatment. It involves medical issues, spiritual issues, quality of life. It’s a big decision.”
Yet patients often tell researchers that they do not recall making a decision, or even discussing one. Physicians frequently present dialysis as inevitable; in a small study of nephrologists, only a third routinely informed patients about conservative management.
“Patients didn’t recognize it as a choice - ‘My doctor told me I’d die if I didn’t do dialysis,’ ” said Keren Ladin, director of an aging and ethics program at Tufts University, who has interviewed both patients and nephrologists. “Or they’d say that it wasn’t their choice, that their doctor made the choice.”
Those patients might have wanted to know, for example, that at the end of life, patients using conservative management were less likely to be hospitalized than dialysis patients, less apt to undergo aggressive procedures and less likely to die in a hospital.
Yet doctors frequently doubt that decision, according to Wong’s new study of 851 Veterans Affairs patients who declined dialysis. Medical records showed doctors questioning patients’ competence, pushing them to change their minds.
“Most were skeptical,” Wong said of the doctors’ response. “It’s a relatively unusual decision, and providers find it suspect.”
Outside the U.S.
Other developed countries take a different approach, especially at advanced ages. Among patients over age 85 with failing kidneys, fewer than 7 percent received dialysis in Canada, a large retrospective study has shown, and fewer than 5 percent in Australia and New Zealand.
In the United States, by contrast, a 2016 study of Veterans Affairs patients found more than 40 percent of those over age 85 with advanced kidney disease received dialysis.
Medicare and other insurers help propel reliance on this treatment. “Our financial incentives are all about putting people on dialysis,” said Dr. Alvin Moss, a nephrologist and palliative care specialist at West Virginia University School of Medicine.
Low reimbursement for monthly office visits to supervise conservative management might doom a practice financially. But Moss and other researchers also suspect that “conservative management” implies lack of care.
Perhaps, they have suggested, the approach needs rebranding as “active medical management” or “comprehensive supportive care.”
For now, patients interested in conservative management, or whatever we decide to call it, will not find supportive doctors easy to locate. A few nephrologists have launched programs at New York University, the University of Washington, the University of Rochester and UPMC in Pittsburgh, among other medical centers.
Elsewhere, Moss suggests seeking out palliative care specialists. Patients should also document their preferences for conservative measures in advance directives, including state POLST (Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment) forms.
Organizations like the Coalition for Supportive Care of Kidney Patients and the American Association of Kidney Patients have useful websites. Moss also recommends a Canadian site, Conservative Kidney Management.
Conservative management helped John Everdell take a lot of ferry rides. But last spring, after years of managing his disease conservatively, Everdell, 69, was hospitalized with heart failure, a common illness in kidney patients. That ruled out a third transplant as his donated kidney failed.
He agreed to give peritoneal dialysis a try. “If you hate it, you can stop,” Oakley told him.
But Everdell developed a serious infection. When his doctors advised switching to daily hemodialysis, “He said no, he didn’t want to live that way,” Oakley said. He explained his decision to his doctors, his sisters and his best friend.
He died at Tufts Medical Center in May, two months after entering the hospital and two days after refusing dialysis for the final time. His partner said he had no regrets.

Economic policies or pipe dreams?

Texto completo: As Democrats swing left, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for America. The presidential candidates endorse a variety of far-reaching proposals that, if adopted, would represent the largest expansion of government since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The added spending, taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions.
Are these sound economic policies or partisan pipe dreams?
Let's review the main proposals. For context, remember the following: The U.S. economy (gross domestic product) is about $20 trillion, so a federal program costing $200 billion would be 1 percent of GDP. It would also be about 5 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget.
Here's the rundown:
Guaranteed job program: Several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn't find one. Economists at Bard College estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at $15 an hour; health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent. The initial cost would be around $300 billion annually.
Medicare-for-all: Bernie Sanders proposed this, and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage. Its cost is unclear (in 2017, there were an estimated 27 million uninsured), says a report from PolitiFact of the Poynter Institute. Sanders thinks replacing private insurance with Medicare could cut expenses. Other experts disagree. There would be pressures to sweeten benefits. In a recent New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman wrote that "we'd need a lot more [tax] revenue" to implement for Medicare-for-all.
"The Green New Deal": Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., propose putting the country on a war footing to purge U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions over a decade. The costs aren't known, because the "new deal" manifesto contains no concrete proposals. However, it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize "clean" energy and suppress fossil fuels.
Everything else: There are smaller proposals that, in other years, would seem large. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of $70 billion. Sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students. That's perhaps another $50 billion. Then there's "infrastructure" spending - more billions - and a proposal to raise Social Security benefits.
Counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates, the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit ($779 billion in 2018). The actual amount could be more - or less. No one really knows.
How would Democrats pay for this? Some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy. Krugman doubts these would suffice. Adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in "payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class," he writes.
Of course, there is another choice: more deficit spending. Last week, I tried to educate myself on so-called "modern monetary theory." Embraced by some Democrats, its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we've been led to believe. Here's the case for that view, as best I can determine.
"The biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household" that has to repay its debt, says Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and an adviser in 2016 to Sanders.
The United States won't default on its governmental debts, because it can always create more dollars - through the Federal Reserve - to honor U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, she says. She rejects the argument that the Fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money. To prevent that, inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates, just as occurs today.
The obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment, she contends. This may or may not be good economics, but it's certainly expedient. No one likes to raise taxes and cut spending, and that may explain why benign neglect of deficits is now going mainstream.
Check out the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. "Washington should end its debt obsession," urge Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, top economic officials in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Interest rates are low. It's better to borrow and spend on "education, health care and infrastructure."
What's missing from this picture is old-fashioned prudence. True, the government doesn't have to default on its debt in a legal sense. But if financial markets worry about the escalating debt, Treasury bonds will lose value. If the fall in confidence is great enough, it might trigger a panic, made worse by the reality that the dollar is the main international currency.
Our ever-ascending debt increases our vulnerability to a future crisis that we cannot see but, almost certainly, awaits us.

Did 'Green Book' win the Oscar because it makes white people feel good?

Texto completo: It's the morning after the Oscars, and my editors have asked me to weigh in on the best picture win by “Green Book," Spike Lee's angry reaction when the award was announced, and why white viewers and black viewers might see this movie so differently.
My first response was that asking a white movie critic to write such an article is evidence of the problem itself.
My second might be to direct readers to the mordantly hilarious Twitter thread that quickly made the rounds after the win, with the opening salvo — “Green Book thinks you're so articulate" ­— piled onto with follow-ups. “Green Book doesn't see color." “Green Book wants to touch your hair." “Green Book would have voted for Obama a third time." “Green Book truly believes all movies matter." The New York Times's Aisha Harris spoke for many when she tweeted “Congratulations to DRIVING MISS DAISY for being the first movie to win Best Picture, twice."
There's a lot of love out there for the film, of course. It's a feel-good throwback to the sort of entertaining social-message movies that once united audiences, and it ultimately united enough of the Academy's old guard and its new generation to take the field. The fact that that unity isn't fully there in the critical community, on social media, and among many moviegoers seems to drive some of the movie's fans crazy.
A great many white moviegoers and probably some black moviegoers just adore “Green Book," although to be fair, the handful of people of color I've asked about the movie have rolled their eyes and said they haven't seen it because why bother? They don't have to see it to know it's a story they've been served before. The one that promotes interracial brotherhood by subtly making the white characters take the lead in the struggle for civil rights and equality. The one that subtly weakens and diminishes the black characters, the better to make them victims for the white characters to assist.
Despite such caustic viral critiques as the fake “White Savior" movie trailer cooked up by “Late Night with Seth Meyers," this is still a story that makes white audiences feel happy and comforted by the thought that we mattered, we made a difference, we played an equal part in the fight. That really, it just couldn't have happened without the white folks.
Ask a person of color their opinion of that one and see what they say.
I understand why Spike got up and tried to leave the Dolby Theater when the best picture Oscar was announced. It wasn't that “BlacKkKlansman" lost, it was that “Green Book" won, and in so doing proved that the creative community hasn't moved forward in any meaningful way since “Driving Miss Daisy" won out over “Do the Right Thing" in 1989. A film about the black American experience still has to be filtered through a white lens to be fully embraced by a white audience. We can't — won't — attend to these stories without an onscreen representative to hold our hands.
To which you might respond: Well, “Moonlight" won the best picture Oscar two years ago. And I would say you're right — and also point out that “If Beale Street Could Talk," director Barry Jenkins' follow-up film, was absurdly under-represented at this year's awards (Regina King won the supporting actress award), as was Boots Riley's too-cool-for-Oscar “Sorry to Bother You." “Beale Street" did win best film at the Indie Spirit awards, held the night before the Academy Awards and in the past few years a more reliable arbiter of cinematic quality than the Oscars.
Back to “Green Book": I don't forgive Oscar-winning screenwriters Nick Vallelonga, Peter Farrelly, and Brian Currie for weakening the character of Dr. Don Shirley by isolating him from his family (the opposite of true, say his surviving brothers). I don't forgive them for presenting Shirley as a tragic freak genius caught between the races. (“If I'm not black, Tony, and I'm not white, then what am I?" Shirley tearfully asks his driver-protector in a much-clipped scene.) I definitely don't forgive them for the fried chicken scene in which a casually racist white bouncer instructs a cultivated African-American on how to eat like the real black folk do.
Actually, I wonder why Italian-Americans aren't up in arms over Tony's friends and neighbors, who embody every cartoon stereotype in the book. (The exception is Tony's wife, played by Linda Cardellini as the only genuine human in the film.) I have been informed by an acquaintance who grew up in the North End and who loves “Green Book" that that's exactly what his relatives were like.
OK, fine. But Nick Vallelonga's telling this story, his father's story, and he can lean on those clichés because he's lived in them and knows their truth. Why, then, did he not approach any of Don Shirley's relatives to find out their truths? Why was Mahershala Ali, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor, not told those relatives even existed? I'm guessing because it might have complicated the sweet story Vallelonga wanted to tell, where his dad matured as a white man by befriending, protecting, and saving a black man unwise to the ways of the world.
I imagine Dr. Donald Shirley was plenty wise to the ways of a world that men like Tony Villelonga navigated with comparative ease, as do many of the Academy members who voted for the film. I imagine Shirley knew exactly what he was doing when he made Nick Vallelonga promise to make “Green Book" only after Shirley was dead. That way he's not around for us to hear what he might have to say in response to the movie.
It might sound a lot like Spike.

Texto completo: On an Oscar night when all eight best picture nominees took home one or more awards, "Green Book" emerged as the big winner, taking the top prize along with wins for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali's supporting performance as Dr. Don Shirley, an African-American concert pianist touring the South during segregation. A few of the winning features have yet to debut on streaming services -- "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" is coming Tuesday, and "If Beale Street Could Talk" and "Vice" follow in successive weeks.

'Green Book'
Won for: Best picture, original screenplay, supporting actor
How to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
Despite persistent criticism over its "white savior" narrative and storytelling liberties, this warm comedy-drama has appealed to many with its optimistic vision of racial harmony against a hostile backdrop. Ali and Viggo Mortensen have a likable odd couple chemistry as a celebrated African-American pianist and an Italian-American bouncer who escorts him on a concert tour through the segregated Deep South in 1962. One of the writers, Peter Farrelly, has a background in broad comedies like "Kingpin" and "There's Something about Mary," which informs the unlikely camaraderie between the two men and buoys the film in its darker stretches.

'Roma'
Won for: director, cinematography, foreign language film
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
At once a personal reflection on his childhood and an expansive look at the cultural turbulence of early 1970s Mexico City, Alfonso Cuarón's "Roma" is an empathetic attempt to look at the past from a fresh perspective. As an upper-middle-class family adjusts to life without a patriarch, a mother (Marina de Tavira) and her children become increasingly reliant on their live-in housekeeper, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), for comfort and order, not realizing that Cleo's life is in heartbreaking disarray. "Roma" feels like Cuarón's long-overdue acknowledgment of his own caretaker's private hardships, shot through with overwhelming passion and stylistic brio.

'Bohemian Rhapsody'
Won for: actor, editing, sound editing, sound mixing
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
Despite controversies over its original director's behavior and its casual relationship to the band's actual history, the Queen biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody" has survived and thrived this awards seasons by adhering closely to the formula of films like "Walk the Line" and "Ray" and by anchoring itself to a transcendent lead performance. As Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek overcomes a distracting set of prosthetic teeth to project the restless, exuberant artist who defied conventional notions of what rock songs and rock singers could be.

'The Favourite'
Won for: actress
How to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
With his delectable black comedy, the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos tiptoes into the mainstream after a series of odd, misanthropic art films like "Dogtooth," "The Lobster" and "The Killing of a Sacred Deer," but he hasn't entirely buffed out their serrated edges. In the rivalry between two women (Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz), who are fighting for influence over an ailing Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Lanthimos and his screenwriters, Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, reveal the corrosive influence of power, but they have a lot of fun doing it. As the queen, Colman is especially good at playing a woman who may be deteriorating but knows how to get what she wants.

'BlacKkKlansman'
Won for: adapted screenplay
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
The director Spike Lee has a reputation for audacity and provocation that carries over to this fact-based film about a black cop in Colorado Springs named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), who infiltrated a Ku Klux Klan chapter in the early 1970s. But what stands out about "BlacKkKlansman" is how expertly Lee modulates tone, playing up the fish-out-of-water absurdity of Stallworth's operation while suggesting a history of white supremacy in America that continues to manifest itself today. Adam Driver embodies that tonal duality as Stallworth's partner, alternately a source of gravitas and comic relief. (Read a transcript of Lee's passionate acceptance speech here.)

'Black Panther'
Won for: original score, costume design, production design
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
For years, the popularity of the superhero genre has exposed the disconnect between the films the Academy Awards acknowledges and the films that mainstream audiences actually watch. "Black Panther" is a groundbreaking achievement in that respect, a spectacle that conforms to the familiar template of the Marvel Cinematic Universe while smuggling across a substantive and surprisingly political study of black identity. As Erik Killmonger, the chief threat to the techno-utopian African nation of Wakanda, Michael B. Jordan plays a villain whose motives are so complex that the word "villain" seems like too narrow a descriptor.

'A Star is Born'
Won for: original song
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
All four iterations of "A Star is Born" are fascinating era-specific snapshots of the entertainment industry, and with his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper contends with an ascendant moment for female pop artists and the star-making machinery that sustains them. As a drag-bar singer discovered by a hard-drinking stadium rocker (Cooper), Lady Gaga's Ally begins the film as a raw, unproven, unvarnished talent and ends it looking closer to the glammed-up superstar Gaga has become in the real world. Her performance of the Oscar-winning song "Shallow" is the bridge that gets her there, an electrifying howl that sets the trajectories of her and her benefactor in opposite directions.

'Free Solo'
Won for: documentary
How to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
Alex Honnold is not only one of the best climbers in the world, he is also one of tiny fraction of climbers who specialize in "free soloing," which involves ascending a rock face without ropes or any other form of safety gear. "Free Solo" chronicles Honnold's extraordinary effort to scale El Capitan, a 3,000-foot granite rock in Yosemite National Park. As Honnold prepares for the big day, the film also takes a keen interest in his romantic life, which both he and his partner know can be extinguished by one small, tragic misstep.

'First Man'
Won for: visual effects
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
Damien Chazelle's follow-up to "La La Land," his swooning valentine to the movie musical, more closely resembles the film that preceded it, "Whiplash," in its visceral attention to the rigors and ardors of achieving greatness. Unlike other films about the space program, "First Man" doesn't romanticize mankind's ascent to the heavens, and it doesn't give the famously reticent Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) some hidden depth that had never been accessed before. It's more concerned with giving viewers a powerful, you-are-there impression of men rattling through the sky in crude vessels, not knowing if they will ever make it back to Earth.

THE OSCARS | PARTIES; Luster abounds at Vanity Fair

Texto completo: They said the Vanity Fair party had lost its luster, that it was no longer the hottest Oscar night bash.
But I don't know, guys. It seemed pretty cool to me.
Sure, yes, I'm just a lowly reporter who is granted access to the Hollywood bash for a precious 60 minutes. And, no, you're right: I did not receive a coveted invitation to Madonna or Jay-Z's Oscar after-parties, which are infamously press-free.

So I get why you think I'd be awed by a fancy party attended by the likes of Lady Gaga, Serena Williams, Elton John and Ashley Olsen. (Because when's the last time you saw an Olsen twin in the wild? Kind of a major sighting.)
But, no, my friends. This year was the fourth time I was asked to cover the Vanity Fair party, and I am jaded. I do not enjoy driving from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood to the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, which I'll admit feels like a kind of random and soulless place for this event.
I am not impressed by classy junk food like In-N-Out burgers and beignets and fried chicken. A free tube of L'Oreal lipstick from the bathroom? Please.
This year, I wanted to be wowed -- particularly in the wake of the New York Times' damning article last week about the VF party, which decried the Oscar bash as no longer a hot ticket. The magazine was so upset about the story that it disinvited a New York Times reporter, which generated only more negative headlines.
One of the main arguments in the NYT piece was that Vanity Fair's party is no longer cool because it has so many brand partners. The paper argued that a slew of corporate executives from companies such as Johnnie Walker and Verizon would be attending this year's bash, leaving less room for major stars. Further, the paper said, Hollywood royalty like Angelina Jolie and Leonardo DiCaprio no longer bother attending the VF party.
Which is true. I definitely did not see Angie tossin' back a glass of champs. But I also didn't see her at the Oscars. Because she wasn't nominated. Or presenting.
But you know whom I did see at the Vanity Fair party? All of these people, doing these things:
Glenn Close at the center of a dance circle, surrounded by the likes of Judd Apatow, Sam Rockwell and Marisa Tomei, boogieing so hard she actually lay down on the ground as part of her routine.
Taylor Swift and boyfriend Joe Alwyn fully chowing down on burgers, sans any security. T. Swift always has bodyguards with her at parties! I did not see them! (But maybe they were spying on me from afar.)
Jason Momoa showing off his second scrunchie of the evening. This one was tan and made to match the blazer he was wearing to the party. He had it on his wrist, because the much-talked about pink scrunchie he'd worn to the Oscars was still holding up his man bun. He said the late Karl Lagerfeld had designed the velvet suit he wore to the ceremony entirely around that pink scrunchie.
Terry Crews gushing over how much he loved "Roma" to supporting-actress nominee Marina de Tavira.
"Very few movies can take you to another place and another time," he told her. "When those kids were in that water? It was the most nerve-racking thing for me!"
Chris Evans and Bill Maher, deep in conversation on the smoking patio, discussing something having to do with stem cells.
Newly anointed Young Hollywood heartthrob Noah Centineo chatting it up with fellow youngs Shailene Woodley and Lily Collins.
Awkwafina approaching Natalie Portman to tell her: "You're amazing!" To which Portman replied: "No, you're amazing!"
A shoeless Amy Adams and Richard E. Grant on the dance floor, jumping up and down in unison to Madonna's "Into the Groove."
And then there was Ava DuVernay, holding court at the party after tweeting out her support for the bash earlier in the week.
She had told her followers she was a fan of new Vanity Fair editor Radhika Jones, who put Lena Waithe on the cover of the magazine and "invited a beautiful array of black and brown people" to the 2018 event.
"Funny how now it's suddenly 'lost its luster,' " the filmmaker tweeted. "Luster for some. Closed doors now open for others."
Throughout the night, DuVernay continued to share photos of the event on her feed -- writing under a snap of Diana Ross and her daughter, Tracee Ellis Ross: "That's luster to me."
Was the crowd younger? Yes. There was Amandla Stenberg and Cole Sprouse and Lana Condor and Rowan Blanchard. But all the big winners were there too: Gaga, Regina King, Alfonso Cuaron.
And then the kind of famous people who have no specific reason to be at an Oscars party but just are because they're famous: Monica Lewinsky, Alex Rodriguez, Jack Dorsey and a ton of famous models such as Naomi Campbell, Kendall Jenner and Adriana Lima.
So, yeah. Celebrities are still into the Vanity Fair party. It's still cool. In fact, you know how cool it is? It's so cool that attendees are willing to subject themselves to a mortifying school pickup-esque car line.
Imagine Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Zoe, Tika Sumpter and Lupita Nyong'o all without jackets, teetering in heels on Santa Monica Boulevard. They're waiting for their chauffeured vehicles to arrive, huddled under heat lamps.
There are a lot of cars, so the traffic cop is trying to move things along. If a numbered vehicle shows up and its guest does not get into it within 30 seconds, that car is forced to move along. In the hopes of matching cars with guests, the traffic cop has obtained a megaphone: "Trevor Noah, your car is here!" he shouts. "Mark Hamill! Mark Hamill, for the third time, your car is here!"
That part wasn't cool, per se. But it was democratizing. Me and Mark Hamill, just sitting on a bus bench, scrolling through Twitter while waiting for our rides. Does it get more lustrous?

Is Marie Kondo’s 'Tidying Up' more than good TV? Utah’s psychology, design pros weigh in

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Marie Kondo is an author and organizing consultant — and now, thanks to her Netflix show “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,” a TV and pop culture star. It seems like everyone, including major media outlets like The Atlantic and The New York Times, have been talking about what NPR called “an organizational renaissance” sparked by Kondo's decluttering approach, the KonMari method.
On the show, Kondo takes people through the method, which helps them declutter their lives by only keeping items which “spark joy.”
The KonMari method has been around much longer than the Netflix series, and it may seem odd for the show to create this much buzz. But according to some experts who spoke to the Deseret News, aspects of the KonMari method may be exactly what people need today.
The helped becomes the helper
Dr. Jessica Louie was experiencing burnout in her career as a critical care pharmacist. She'd also been dealing with a death in her family, and coped with the stress by shopping. Then she discovered Kondo’s bestseller, “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.”
Louie said the KonMari method was transformative in her life. It affected her home, relationships and personal finances. It also helped her recognize what was making her happy and what she could do without.
After experiencing the KonMari method, Louie became one of many certified KonMari consultants and started her own business, Clarify Simplify Align. KonMari consultants work personally with clients to help them through their tidying process. Louie said she offers support and facilitation to her clients to help them finish the method in the timeline they want. Louie has seen her clients experience transformations in their own lives, just as she did.
“Some have ended relationships after going through the process,” Louie explained. “They realized that they were just not happy in them and that they were holding on to the past instead of thinking about the present moment and the future.”
The psychology of tidying
Christopher Davids, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, said the KonMari method could affect relationships just as Louie found in her clients.
“When we slow down and we're more present to things like the relationships that we have, that naturally gives us more opportunity for moments of connection, which helps us experience emotional intimacy,” Davids said. “It also helps us slow down and have gratitude for the people who are around us.”
Davids agreed with Louie on many of the benefits of the KonMari method, but gave the caveats that there is no psychological research specific to tidying, and the method would not work the same for everybody.
“Even in the show," Davids said, referring to Kondo's Netflix series, “there are certain principles that she follows. But then the people that use them, when they engage in the practice, they're creating their own rituals. They're finding their own ways of modifying those strategies to meet their needs and to work within their life's context."
Davids said there is scholarly research, however, about expressing gratitude as a daily practice for maintaining a positive outlook, and research on how mindfulness practices reduce anxiety and depression. A mindfulness practice can be anything that allows you to be in the present moment with a mindset of non-judgment, he said. The KonMari method has many aspects of mindful gratitude, including thanking your home and even thanking items you decide to throw out.
An article published by The Atlantic, “‘Tidying Up With Marie Kondo’ Isn’t Really a Makeover Show,” addressed this mindset of non-judgment. Author Sarah Archer says that although the Netflix series is outwardly about tidying up, it's really about empathy instead of judgment — an empathy for the things around us that naturally blossoms into appreciation for the people surrounding us.
Archer writes, “There’s no sense of competition, and the ostensible makeover at the heart of every episode simply involves regular people becoming happier and more at ease in their own home. Kondo doesn’t scold, shame or criticize. Things spark joy or they don’t, and it’s fine either way.”
According to Davids, the motives behind the method are probably more important than the specific process.
“I don't think the psychological benefit of that is literally the practice of folding something in a certain way or meticulously trying to organize a drawer in a certain way,” he said.
It just looks better
Beyond the mental and social benefits, tidying also has the obvious aesthetic appeal. In the past five years, designs have moved toward minimalism, according to LaMar Lisman, an interior designer and founder of Lisman Studios Interior Design in Midvale. Lisman said that in Utah specifically, he has seen more requests for clean interiors and less excess.
“We really have stepped away from all the clutter, and froufrou and overdone rooms,” Lisman said.
In “How to Choose Happiness,” an opinion piece for The New York Times, Kondo attempts to explain this more minimal trend.
“We live in a disorganized and chaotic world, much of it outside our control,” Kondo wrote. “As people’s buying habits shift and technology moves most everything to the cloud, people have been valuing experiences over material things. Some have even pointed out that we may have reached a critical point in terms of mass consumption — we’ve reached peak stuff.”
Lisman has seen this critical point and need for change in his clients.
“We're seeing our clients coming to us now and saying ‘I need to change, I need simplicity, I need uniformity, I need function, but I still want it to be beautiful,'” Lisman said.
Lisman has also seen a shift in why people buy furniture. In the past, he said, people bought furniture and housewares with the intention of passing them on to future generations. This mindset is going away as people focus more on what brings them joy in the present.
“It's more about fulfilling our own needs, which I think is good, very healthy,” he added. “It's OK to say, ‘That's not for me. I don't want these things. Thank you, I'm glad grandma loved it but I don't want it.’ … It all ties in with … getting rid of clutter in our lives, to just help us breathe and feel free and open to live in our space.”
Despite its simple premise, Kondo's show and accompanying ethos have struck a chord. It seems many have reached a point of overload — and if simplifying their lives starts with their closets, then they're willing to try.
As Davids put it, “Whether it's a physical clutter or mental clutter, those are things that can drag with us.”

‘Weavers’ make stronger social fabric

Texto completo: Eventually, someone who writes on public policy comes up against the limits of words. There are only so many times you can urge, condemn, cajole, wheedle, praise, remind, prod, propose and coax before your vocabulary and patience both give out. This is not to say that public argumentation makes no difference. But for a columnist, that influence consists mainly of throwing 750 words over a high wall and hoping they land with a pleasing thud on some doer or decider.
Having mastered the arts of opinion writing, cultural criticism and human decency, David Brooks of The New York Times is now undertaking a project at the Aspen Institute called "Weave," designed to recognize and help people directly involved in social repair.
Many people are involved in the unholy work of ripping and shredding our social fabric — through dehumanizing language, racial prejudice and other evidence of tribalism. The groups Brooks highlights are the weavers, laying down the warp and weft of communities. They promote community dialogue and deal with various categories of need from youth development to suicide prevention. But they share the goal of strengthening human ties, trust and reciprocity as alternatives to isolation, loneliness and despair.
In his manifesto, Brooks argues for what he calls "relationalism" as opposed to the "hyper-individualism" of a society based on the maximization of choice and self-actualization. A critic might respond that liberal individualism has done a pretty good job as the basis for democracy, capitalism and pain-free dentistry. But Brooks is diagnosing an excess of individualism leading to "social isolation, distrust, polarization, the breakdown of family, the loss of community, tribalism, rising suicide rates, rising mental health problems, [and] a spiritual crisis caused by a loss of common purpose."
In Brooks’ relationalism, the answer is not found in a political ideology, but in an alternative way of being human. In this view, success is not measured by the goods we accumulate but in the number and quality of the relationships we form. Such relationships tend to push our attention outward, toward the welfare of others. "The central journey of modern life," Brooks argues, "is moving self to service." And a rich relational life delivers a deeper more satisfying form of happiness than consumerism. We are actually liberated by the deep commitments we make in life.
Brooks’ message is likely to resonate precisely because it is not political. The atomizing tendency of American life does deepen and complicate problems such as drug addiction and suicide, in which isolation can contribute to a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior. But many Americans can identify with the broader challenge of loneliness, which seems to be the flip side of autonomy.
Brooks is making the case that there is already a movement of human connection in this country, among people who don’t yet recognize themselves as part of one. He has served this movement by giving it a compelling, non-sectarian, non-partisan frame, allowing diverse groups to consider themselves part of each other. In this case, the frame serves the picture well.

Texto completo: A Wright State and Centerville graduate has made Oscar history.
Hannah Beachler, a 2005 Wright State University graduate, is the first African-American woman to win an Academy Award in the category for Best Production Design for her work in creating Wakanda in Marvel’s “Black Panther.” She won the Oscar along with Jay Hart for set decoration.

“I stand here stronger than I was yesterday,” Beachler said during her acceptance speech. “I stand here with agency and self-worth because of (Black Panther director) Ryan Coogler — who not only made me a better designer, a better storyteller, a better person. I stand here because of this man who offered me a different perspective of life. Who offered me a safe space. Who is patient and gave me air, humanity, and brotherhood. Thank you, Ryan, I love you.”
“I give this strength to all of those who come next. To keep going and never give up, and when you think it’s impossible, just remember to say this piece of advice I got from a very wise woman: ‘I did my best, and my best is good enough.’”
In her speech, Beachler tearfully thanked her friend and mentor Carol Trevino, a Wilberforce resident and Wright State graduate who died in 2007 while working on the set of a movie in New Orleans.
A scholarship fund Beachler established for local film students in 2018 also is named in honor of the memory of Trevino.
Beachler and Hart won the Critics Choice Award in the Best Production Design on Jan. 13.
Beachler and Ruth E. Carter (costume design) both were honored for their work on “Black Panther.” They became the first African-American women to win Oscars in their categories, and the first to win in a non-acting category since Irene Cara in 1984, who won for best original song, “Flashdance...What A Feeling,” which she co-wrote.
“Black Panther” has seven total nominations including Best Picture, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Original Score, Original Song, Production Design and Costume Design.
“Black Panther” won the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design and Best Original Score.

BEACHLER’S WORK ON ‘BLACK PANTHER’
Beachler and Hart created the fictional world of Wakanda, the fictional setting of “Black Panther.”
Beachler managed a reported $30 million budget for “Black Panther” and was the first woman to work for Marvel as a production designer.
Beachler told the New York Times after her nomination that research has been key to success of all of her film projects, including “Black Panther.” That meant studying the ancient ruins of Mpumalanga in South Africa and bringing elements of its design into Wakanda.
The choice of colors you’ll see in a film is just one of Beachler’s responsibilities. She has a hand in designing the movie’s overall look and transporting theater audiences to the environment.
Beachler explained her role best during a visit with Wright State students last year.
“Production design is what everything else bounces off of — it’s architecture, it’s color palette and it’s everything in the room,” Beachler said. “I’m the first one hired after the director and first one on the job after the director. I work with producers, cinematographer, costume design and visual effects.”
Hannah Beachler created a 400-page book envisioning what the African nation of Wakanda might look like for the film, "Black Panther." It got her the job of production Designer for the film. Submitted photo.

This Oscar win makes Beachler the third person with Miami Valley roots in recent years recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Oakwood-raised actress Allison Janney earned the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role last year at the 90th annual Academy Awards for “I, Tonya.” Springfield native John Legend won the 2015 Oscar for Best Original Song for “Glory”.
Before that, Yellow Springs filmmaker Julia Reichert earned three Oscar nominations: Best Short Documentary (2010) for “The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant,” Best Documentary Feature (1984) for “Seeing Red” and Best Documentary Feature (1978) for “Union Maids.”

BEFORE ‘BLACK PANTHER’
In addition to “Black Panther,” Beachler has received mega praise for her work on “Fruitvale Station” “Moonlight,” “Miles Ahead,” “Creed” and Beyonce’s “Lemonade.”
Beachler went to great lengths to build her career and had more than a few setbacks and rejections along the way, starting with her studies at Wright State.
“I was a single mom. I worked two jobs, and I went to school full time. If it weren’t for help from others, I would not have been able to so that,” she told us during a recent podcast interview. “I was a commuter student. There was a lot of that at Wright State, where people have families and they are going back to school and you need all the help you can get, especially nowadays.”
After college, she still had a tough road to success.
For 2013 critically acclaimed independent film “Fruitville Station” — her first job with “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler — Beachler told us she drove alone from New Orleans to work on the film in California. Beachler took a pet-sitting job for a place to stay.

STRONG CONNECTIONS TO DAYTON
Beachler still has strong ties to Dayton.
Her father, the late Mark Beachler of Mark Beachler & Associates, lived in Kettering while her mother, Marsha, resides in Centerville.
Her sisters are also still in the area. She has given several talks at Wright State and the Neon movie theater in downtown Dayton, offering encouragement to local students, filmmakers and film fans.
Last summer, Hannah Beachler announced that she would establish a scholarship fund for Wright State University and Dayton-area high school students interested in careers in communications, media, film and entertainment fields.
In September 2018, Beachler was inducted into the Dayton Walk of Fame along with a class that included Oscar-nominated filmmaker Julia Reichert, one of Beachler’s professors at Wright State.
Beachler also was named the WSU Alumni Association’s “2018 Alumna of the Year.”
Beachler grew up in Centerville and studied fashion design at the University of Cincinnati before attending Wright State’s Motion Picture Program.

ANOTHER LOCAL CONNECTION
“A Star Is Born,” another film with multiple Oscar nominations, has connections to the Miami Valley.
Bradley Cooper screened the film at the Little Art Theatre in Yellow Springs in October.

The movie features Yellow Springs resident and Cooper’s real-life pal Dave Chappelle, who was also there and participated in a question-and-answer session with Cooper after the screening.
In the film Chappelle plays a character called Noodles, an old friend of Cooper’s character. Chappelle’s daughter Sanaa, also has a role in the film.
“I can’t wait for everyone to see this movie, man,” Chappelle told the Yellow Springs audience. “This movie is real powerful. People don’t know what it’s like to be in entertainment or step on a big stage. This movie really does capture the content of it. It’s gut wrenching up there.”
“A Star is Born” has been nominated for Best Picture, Lead Actor, Lead Actress, Supporting Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, and Original Song.
It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Cooper, which they performed together during the program.

'Merchants' casts grim eye on news business

Texto completo: One of the facts bemoaned by traditional journalists in the current state of the news business is that, with a growing banquet of news to offer on any given day, in any given hour, consumers are opting for boiled down listicles and scannable reads.
It's the antithesis in style to what The New York Times used to embody, particularly by its former senior editorial leader, Jill Abramson, the first woman to serve as the paper's Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor – the top job in American print journalism.
But as everyone knows , Abramson didn't last long at the top; just three years. In May 2014, she was fired for allegedly poor management and being too "difficult" for even hard-boiled Times journalists to handle.
Her account of what happened as laid out in her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," is absorbing and fair – and it's likely the first section many journalists will turn to.
"There was no simple reason I was fired. I was a less than stellar manager, but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders. Most of all, I became the first woman editor at a very bad time in journalism," she writes.
Now comes "Merchants," published Tuesday (Simon & Schuster, ).
Reviews have been generally positive, mixed with sharp criticism. There already has been a contretemps over whether she accused the Times of being biased against President Donald Trump in its coverage. She batted that away as an exaggeration of something taken out of context. A fair reading backs her up.
Now she and her publisher are dealing with more serious charges of factual errors and plagiarism lodged late Wednesday in a series of tweets on Twitter by a reporter for one of the four news organizations she examines in the book, Vice – which under her gaze does not come off as a journalistic paragon.
Simon & Schuster issued a statement Thursday promising revisions if warranted in the 534-page book. Abramson also issued a statement to USA TODAY that the passages in question involve facts that were imperfectly cited in her 70 pages of footnotes. "I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," she said.
Meanwhile, the book as published documents the crisis: Journalism may have not yet been annihilated but the barbarians are at the gate and banging hard. More news than ever is out there and more people than ever are in need of reliable information in order for democracy to function, Abramson observes.
At the same time, she reports, the journalism business model is stuttering and a steadier replacement is not yet obvious. Every news company struggles to produce a product for the digital age amid sharp staff cuts, while more consumers, marinated in "the internet is free!" assumptions, are unwilling to pay for it, Abramson says.
The author explores this grim state through the experiences of two legacy media titans, her former employer, the Times, and the Washington Post, fighting to retain their "values" in a maelstrom, and two digital titans, BuzzFeed and Vice, "improbable players" in an arena where social media drives large numbers of consumers to news.
"I was determined to capture this moment of wrenching transition – and to do it as a reporter, my first calling," Abramson writes.
She has her pet peeves: The sometimes dishonest nature of clickbait headlines, designed to capture attention but promising more than they deliver. Tedious business meetings watching PowerPoint presentations of eye-glazing data charts. The "ridiculously" few women in senior editing jobs at the Times, a deficit she is most proud of improving during her tenure.
She is alarmed about the chipping away of the traditional wall between the news side and the business side. When the new CEO of the Times told her he expected new "revenue-producing products" to come from the newsroom, she snapped, "If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor ... The truth had flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or tone."
Abramson doesn't see an entirely trouble-free future for any of her examined news organizations, despite their various successes. "All four are endangered," she warns. That even goes for the Post, which was rescued in 2013 by its "white knight," Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the family-owned paper for $250 million with the idea that "restoring its glory would be a contribution to democracy."
For legacy media survivors, following the trials and tribulations of two newspapers may involve equal measures of envy, dread and schadenfreude. BuzzFeed and Vice may seem like alien entities.
Abramson traces how BuzzFeed began with a steady diet viral cat videos, but founder and "virality" genius Jonah Peretti and his team figured out how to connect with a mostly disaffected young audience through their emotions – at the "beating heart of the internet." They pioneered a new business model – native advertising – and by the end of 2011, BuzzFeed had "pivoted" to original news reporting, beefing up its reporting staff with a goal of being taken seriously.
Vice started out as a print lads mag constantly pushing the bounds of bad taste in the quest to be "edgy," which led to such outrages as "The Racist Issue." In 2017, Vice's 18 hours of footage of the deadly Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right rally garnered a total of 50 million views and became the "defining image" of the violence, Abramson says.
Non-journalists may find "Merchants" dense and complicated, with something surprising or infuriating on every page. Journalists working today already know in their guts most of what Abramson is reporting, if not in the depressing detail she presents.
Abramson earns three stars for her thoroughness and insights, but this is not a beach read, and certainly not a happy read. Unless, of course, you believe journalists are the enemy of the people.
Jill Abramson and "Merchants of Truth" are facing charges plagiarism.

Do black oil sunflower seeds make a good mulch?

Texto completo: ask Ken ...
Q. I can't find good information on whether black oil sunflower seed hulls are toxic to grass and plants. I've had a bird feeder for years in my front yard hanging under a tree. I never bothered to clean up the hulls - just raked most of them into the flower border every now and then. But, the tall fescue died under the feeder, and the Lamium (deadnettle) in the border also.
When researching info on sunflower seed hull toxicity, I couldn't find much "official" information - just lots of anecdotal information from gardeners. Some say it's a good mulch, some say it makes good compost, some say it kills or inhibits growth on some plants, and some say it's toxic to all plants. Your thoughts on this? - Bob Hollowell, Nags Head
A. I've also been stymied in finding any scientific literature to substantiate. While I like to provide this type of reference, as you've noted, there is plenty of anecdotal information out there, and sources I'll assume credible, such as Maine Coop Extension and University of California Botanical Garden at Berkeley. And Kathy Van Mullekom, the former garden writer for the Daily Press, answered this question back in 2006 in the affirmative. Ditto for garden writers for the Chicago Tribune and The New York Times.
I did have a lead on some research done in the 1980s by Dr. Gerald R. Leather with the USDA ARS - a weeds guy - but I was unable to get into the journal to examine the paper.
My wife and I put the unhulled seeds out in our backyard feeder for years. It is pretty natural back there; we just put down pine straw and deal with the occasional weeds. I have about a 9-foot-square area of slate under the feeder to catch the hulls, but it still made a big mess. There are no issues with weeds and grass on the periphery of the slate, where unfortunately the hulls also tend to migrate and accumulate.
So, here are my thoughts - all of the aforementioned lead me to share your conclusion.
A couple years ago, we got tired of dealing with the clean-up and hulls and we started using "no-waste" bird seed. One hundred percent edible. A bit more expensive. Our bird friends deserve it. Sure made my life easier, but I'm not sure about the weeds.

A few more things ...
This time next month, anyway you slice and dice it, winter will be officially over. And by all accounts this one will be a rated as a mild winter and with above-average rainfall, a bonus for spring planting. So, don't procrastinate any longer on ordering and starting those seeds for spring.
Also, dust off your gardening tools, making sure they are in good working order. A good gardening trowel and pair of gloves are indispensable. So, if yours are past their prime, just go ahead, splurge, and get a new pair. Regarding gloves, I have a leather pair for heavy work and a 10-pack of those nitrile-coated gardening/work gloves for more delicate jobs.
And while you have your wallet open, add a good pair of pruners to that list. In the past, I've mentioned Felco's line of gardening pruners. They are top quality and will last a lifetime provided you take a little care with them. Don't lend them out!

Stories and Sensibility: Those Are Her Specialties

Texto completo: The writer-director Sofia Coppola, fortune's child, is blessed and cursed for reasons beyond her control. Is it an advantage or disadvantage to have a supportive, larger-than-life father who is a world-famous filmmaker?
While it's no stretch to rank Coppola alongside Kathryn Bigelow as the two women with the most longevity on the movie industry's A-list, it should be noted that on the basis of six features she's directed since 1999, she's also the most celebrated American filmmaker under 50. (Paul Thomas Anderson is the only other contender.)
She won an Oscar for writing "Lost in Translation" and a New York Film Critics Circle award for directing it. She received the Gold Lion award at the 2010 Venice Film Festival for "Somewhere" and was named best director at Cannes for her 2017 remake of "The Beguiled," the dark comedy of manners she fashioned from Don Siegel's overwrought male gothic.
Coppola is a true auteur -- a filmmaker with a distinct worldview and sensibility and a personal set of quasi-autobiographical interests. Where Bigelow works in genres that have up to now been dominated by men, Coppola's are, to use her own term, "girlie." Her protagonists are generally strong-willed women, whether as individuals ("Marie Antoinette") or in groups ("The Virgin Suicides," "The Bling Ring," "The Beguiled") or as part of an older man-younger woman pairing ("Lost in Translation," "Somewhere"). Drawn to father-daughter situations, she is at work on another -- her current project, "On the Rocks," is about a young mother (Rashida Jones, daughter of Quincy Jones) reconnecting with her playboy father (Bill Murray).
Her characters are typically and blithely privileged, often afflicted with ennui, if not affluenza. Her movies are usually set in protective, even rarefied surroundings: comfortable suburbs in "The Virgin Suicides" and "The Bling Ring," exclusive hotels in "Lost in Translation" and "Somewhere," a boarding school for young women in "The Beguiled," and Versailles in "Marie Antoinette."
Coppola's fondness for cosseted milieus is reinforced by a propensity to sanitize the past. "The Beguiled" not only evokes a bubble, it is one -- a movie set in Virginia during the Civil War that seems oblivious to the state's slave-driven economy. Similarly, "Marie Antoinette" shows as little interest in the social forces that ignited the French Revolution as it does in the hygienic practices of the royal court.
Having grown up as Hollywood royalty, Coppola, 47, takes these insular worlds for granted. The prologue to her oeuvre is the script she contributed to a short directed by her father in the 1989 anthology film "New York Stories"; its star, an adorable, doted-upon schoolgirl (Heather McComb), lives with her often-absent parents at the Sherry-Netherland hotel and rewards a homeless man with chocolate kisses. (The prevailing message, Janet Maslin wrote in her New York Times review, is "more or less Marie Antoinette's.")
On the other hand, no director has greater access, emotionally or physically, to the rich and famous. It's hard to say which is more remarkable, Coppola's ability to do extensive filming at Versailles for "Marie Antoinette" or Paris Hilton's mad narcissism in letting Coppola use her home as a major location for "The Bling Ring," a movie about the actual burglarizing of Hilton's home by a gang of well-off, star-struck teenagers who used online gossip sites to track the whereabouts of celebrities and plot their schemes.
Coppola's veteran male protagonists, Bill Murray in "Lost in Translation" and Stephen Dorff in "Somewhere," are sympathetically portrayed celebrities adrift in their own stardom. (Dorff's character, stricken with toxic superficiality, floats through a nervous breakdown.) But while "Lost in Translation" is Coppola's sweetest film and "Somewhere" the saddest, her strongest movies are those whose characters have stardom imposed upon them or set out to steal it: "Marie Antoinette," a costume movie whose worked-out choreography is the equivalent of an action extravaganza, and "The Bling Ring," a deadpan satire.
Scrumptious colors, magnificent sets and upbeat modern music aside, what's impressive about "Marie Antoinette" is Coppola's attitude -- a bold refusal to Frenchify or even periodize her knockout cast, which stars Kirsten Dunst in the title role and Jason Schwartzman as her husband, the future Louis XVI. As a parody of monarchist protocol, "Marie Antoinette" anticipates "The Favourite" but loses its edge once Marie and Louis become adults. (The falloff is as drastic as the last 45 minutes of dad's "Apocalypse Now" -- another attempt to make history.)
By contrast, "The Bling Ring," a deceptively blasé, both-sides-now view of celebrity, never breaks character. More of an exposé than a narrative, Coppola's account of the so-called Hollywood Hills Burglars is based on a true story (or rather its account in Vanity Fair). With everything refracted through the news media, "The Bling Ring" is both a critique and celebration. Strutting five abreast down Rodeo Drive, as though posing for an album cover, the members of the ring imagine themselves as stars in their own movie (too bad for them that a surveillance camera provided their onscreen debuts). "We don't know how (or if) they think, and we don't know quite what to think of them," A.O. Scott wrote in his Times review.
The two standout performances -- Leslie Mann's new-age airhead and, cast against type, Emma Watson as her bratty, stubbornly self-justifying daughter -- are gutsy portrayals of appalling characters one loves to hate (or simply hates). But any moral satisfaction derived when the kids are busted is transitory. Onscreen and off, most of the real-life kids were rewarded with friend requests and fan pages, as well as with Coppola's phlegmatic glamorizing film.
Had Andy Warhol lived to see "Marie Antoinette" or "The Bling Ring," he might have considered Coppola his favorite Hollywood director. (The significance paid to footwear in both films could not have failed to impress an artist who was, in his commercial phase, the acknowledged master of drawing shoes.) Coppola's blankly comic dialogue -- cascades of "Omigod!" punctuated by cries of "That's so ill!" -- are juxtaposed with pop images worthy of painters Ed Ruscha or David Hockney.
"The Bling Ring" is uncompromising in its portrayal of banality and shallowness. In a certain sense there hasn't been anything quite like it since Warhol filmed Edie Sedgwick in "Poor Little Rich Girl."
All six of Sofia Coppola's films, as well as "New York Stories," can be streamed via Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "The Virgin Suicides" is also available from Hulu and "Marie Antoinette" from Netflix.

Texto completo: Scott Van Pelt closed an episode of "SportsCenter" last month with a two-minute monologue about the 31st anniversary of his father's death. Strengthened by two friends who had recently lost their parents, Van Pelt spoke passionately about running from grief, and encouraged everyone to do the opposite -- to articulate their pain so they could overcome it.
The segment went viral. It embodied the essential traits of Van Pelt's version of ESPN's flagship show -- sensitivity, nuance and the courage to be vulnerable -- that help him connect with viewers.
"It's a great reminder of the power of the microphone we hold in our hands," Van Pelt said.
But that power is changing -- disappearing, even -- as television viewing habits change and sports media develop new ways to bring fans what they want when they want it. (Now!) That means what was once a premier placement in TV sports -- the anchor desk -- is not the high perch it used to be. It is not clear anymore what it is at all.
Not so long ago, sports fans operated on a schedule dictated by the programming that was available on TV. The sports highlight show, "SportsCenter" being the most popular one, was appointment viewing.
It was where sports fans went to see the highlights they could only read about in the newspaper. People came to know its anchors: Keith Olbermann, Linda Cohn, Stuart Scott, Robin Roberts, Dan Patrick, to name a few. They complemented the sports clips with their own personalities and, in the case of Scott, redefined the highlight show genre.
But today, highlights flood fans' Twitter timelines immediately: a buzzer beater on loop seconds after it drops through the net; a touchdown from multiple angles before referees have ruled it good. They flood our Instagram feeds thanks to users like House of Highlights, which delivers the day's most important sports highlights to more than 12 million followers.
"SportsCenter," even with six editions each weekday, can no longer dangle the carrot of providing clips unavailable anywhere else. On most nights, when the highlight package rolls, Van Pelt is telling a majority of the viewers about something they have already seen.
"Every person covering sports is trying to figure out the riddle," Van Pelt said. He asked how a program could deliver highlights "to you in a way that you will want it and convince yourself that you will need it."
Omar Raja, 24, is the founder of House of Highlights. He grew up watching sports highlights on the local news with his father every morning. When Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006, he did not find out about it until he turned on his TV the next morning.
"It's crazy to think 10 years ago, we had to wait until the next day to find out what happened the night before," Raja said.
Raja's team can now offer instant access to what everyone is talking about. But Raja thinks traditional and new-age highlights delivery systems can coexist. He still watches "SportsCenter," after all, especially Van Pelt's midnight edition.
"I don't really listen to him for the highlights," Raja said. "I just listen to him for his thoughts on things. He's a good personality, and he's charismatic."
When Van Pelt took over as anchor in 2015, he said, he decided to lean on his personality and trust the audience to connect with his curiosity about sports.
Per ESPN, Van Pelt has consistently generated higher ratings among 18-to 34-year-old men in his midnight time slot than late-night talk shows on broadcast or cable. Other sports anchors have tried a similar approach, to lesser degrees of success.
Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole's show on Fox Sports went through several iterations before pivoting toward a late-night show format; it was canceled in 2017. Jemele Hill and Michael Smith were chosen to overhaul the 6 p.m. "SportsCenter," but the reformatted show -- called "SC6" or "The Six" -- lasted a little more than a year before it was broken up in 2018. During its run, Hill was criticized for a post to her personal Twitter account about President Trump, and for another about the N.F.L., for which ESPN suspended her.
"To ignore the racial component and the climate that they faced would be completely dishonest," Van Pelt said of Hill and Smith, who are African-American. "They faced challenges that I didn't face. They also didn't have the benefits that I have."
Those benefits include a midnight slot that allows Van Pelt to experiment in front of a smaller potential audience, and stronger lead-ins from "Monday Night Football" during the N.F.L. season.
Onrait, who now hosts "Jay and Dan" on TSN in Canada at midnight, has adopted the sensibilities of a late-night talk-show host in this turn as a sports anchor.
"Personality is what's going to rule the next phase of television," Onrait said.
Others, such as Skip Bayless of Fox Sports, combine so-called "hot takes" with continuous criticism of high-profile athletes like LeBron James to connect with viewers.
"The only thing that really worked at Fox was Skip," Onrait said. "Nothing was working until Skip showed up. No one got ratings. I know lots of people have made a living out of crapping on the guy, but what he did was bring actual viewers to the network. He was the only one who did that."
In a statement to The New York Times, Norby Williamson, an ESPN executive who oversees "SportsCenter," pushed back against the idea that the show is becoming obsolete.
"We recognize that people have many options for viewing highlights now, but we continue to develop presentations that you're not going to see anywhere else," Williamson said. "We'll show you what happened but also how it happened and why."
While ESPN still sees its network and the "SportsCenter" franchise as vital to the fan's experience, what really matters is whether viewers will continue to see it this way.
Van Pelt knows that reckoning is coming soon.
"I keep thinking to myself this is a short window," Van Pelt said. "It won't go on forever."

New York's political machine gives Amazon buyer's remorse

Autor: Langford, James.

Texto completo: No matter how much they wanted to live in New York City before moving there, most newcomers find plenty to gripe about afterward, from standing-room-only subways to sky-high rents.

Being reminded a little too much of home seldom makes the list. It may, however, have been the deal-breaker for Amazon, the e-commerce giant that abandoned plans for a massive office complex in the Big Apple amid political pushback reminiscent of its existing Seattle headquarters.

Amazon executives touring the country during a yearlong corporate beauty pageant for the complex, billed as "HQ2," indicated to local officials that their employer had become a scapegoat for any and all of Seattle's problems, and they wanted to make sure the company — one of the richest in the U.S. — would be truly welcome in a new site, said Michael Mercatus, who studies the effects of government favoritism on businesses at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.

Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was looking for a place where his company "would have good public relations, and New York City was starting to look uncomfortably like an East Coast version of Seattle," said Mercatus, who questioned whether the entire HQ2 strategy was designed to give Amazon an exit from the Washington city if its relationships there continued to deteriorate.

Boeing, the Chicago-based planemaker whose manufacturing operations are centered in the Seattle area, employed a similar tactic when it decided to locate a second plant for its 787 Dreamliner in South Carolina in 2009, following contentious negotiations with its labor unions that included strikes by the machinists. A so-called right-to-work state, South Carolina has curbed the power of unions with a law that forbids requiring membership as a condition of employment.

"Companies will take only so much," said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.

Indeed, Amazon's decision to locate in Long Island City, near the border between the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan, came just months after a bruising fight with Seattle's government over a tax to help a growing population of homeless residents.

In June, the City Council repealed a yearly levy of $275 per worker on its largest employers, a hotly debated measure passed just weeks before and intended to raise $47 million a year to help house a burgeoning homeless population. Concern over the measure, similar to taxes in Los Angeles and Miami, had prompted Amazon to temporarily halt work on a 17-story office tower in the Denny Triangle neighborhood.

"We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here," Drew Herdener, a company vice president, said at the time. "We are highly uncertain whether the City Council’s anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better."

This month, when Amazon abandoned its plans for New York, half of a two-pronged initiative that would have split 50,000 new jobs between the metropolis and the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., the company blamed the decision on opposition from a vocal minority of state and local officials.

In the three months between the fanfare-filled site selection and its demise, critics in New York had fretted about the impact on the city's schools and its beleaguered subways and questioned why one of the world's richest companies needed the tax breaks Amazon was promised.

The New York City Council created a Twitter hashtag, #AmazonAnswersNYC, for its 8.6 million residents to ask questions and make comments on the deal, the subject of a number of public hearings.

"The city and the state made a deal with Amazon for HQ2 in Long Island City and agreed to give away at least $3 billion in subsidies before they did their due diligence," Council Speaker Corey Johnson said during one such hearing, before the finance committee in late January.

Citing earlier statements by Mayor Bill de Blasio on government's responsibility to "guard people from the enormous power of moneyed interests," he observed, "That's the essence of what we're here to do today."

Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents the neighborhood where Amazon planned to locate, vowed not to sign off on the deal and urged Amazon to stop sending fliers promoting its new campus to the residents of his district.

"We often hear that it's too much or we're going too far when it comes to giving poor or working-class people more and better healthcare; it would be too much of a burden for all workers to be unionized," he said. "But we never hear those same people say that Jeff Bezos and people worth tens of billions of dollars have too much damn money. This Amazon debacle must be an inflection point for our society where we rein in corporate welfare and the billionaire class."

Another high-profile critic was U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a freshman Democrat who had argued that Amazon shouldn't be given billions in incentives while many residents struggle to find affordable housing.

"Today was the day a group of dedicated everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation and the power of the richest man in the world," she said afterward on Twitter, referring to Bezos, who controls a fortune of more than $130 billion.

The 70 percent of New Yorkers who had cheered the company's arrival, and the jobs with an average salary of $150,000 it pledged to create, no doubt disagreed. Rather than blame other politicos for their actions, however, New York's mayor chided Amazon for failing to win opponents to its cause.

"Amazon seemed unwilling to bend or even to talk in earnest with the community about ways to shape their project," de Blasio wrote in a New York Times column pointing out that the company notified him of its decision only about an hour before it was announced. "They didn’t want to be in a city where they had to engage critics at all."

The behavior is part of a pattern for Amazon, he added, citing the Seattle homeless tax.

"Expansion in New York encountered opposition in no small part because of growing frustration with corporate America," de Blasio wrote. "Amazon’s capricious decision to take its ball and go home, in the face of protest, won’t diminish that anger."

If the decision empowers neighborhood activists frustrated by tax breaks they see as corporate giveaways, it also illustrates the limits of corporate tolerance for negative publicity and political gamesmanship.

"There’s a national lesson to be learned here, for all companies," Cooke said. "Before you negotiate confidential agreements with state and local authorities, be aware that when the menu, if you will, becomes public, you will be held to very tough scrutiny. That needs to be something that all parties have in mind."

For New York, the loss of Amazon will mean less than it might have for less-populous cities with a smaller economic base, he said, but there's still a cost.

"Nobody's coming in with 25,000 jobs tomorrow morning," he said. "If Amazon had successfully opened up in Long Island City, think of the other companies that would have jumped on the bandwagon and said, 'We want to be part of the parade.'"

Texto completo: JUPITER, Fla. -- Embattled New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has gone on the defensive, "categorically" denying he solicited sex at a South Florida day spa where police say he was videotaped twice in the act.

The 77-year-old billionaire -- whose team just brought home its sixth Super Bowl trophy -- faces two counts of soliciting sex from a prostitute. Kraft was one of two dozen men arrested in Jupiter where police said the alleged johns paid $59 for a half-hour and $79 for an hour at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa.

"We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity," a spokesman for Kraft said in a statement sent to the Herald. "Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further."

Kraft was one of 170-plus arrested in a South Florida human trafficking and prostitution sweep that police said Friday saw women forced to work long hours and engage in oral and manual sex acts, according to a Jupiter police affidavit obtained by the New York Times.

Jupiter police Chief Daniel Kerr said the misdemeanor charges filed against Kraft stem from two separate alleged visits to the day spa in a strip mall. Kerr said the alleged acts were recorded on convert surveillance video.

"Obviously, our concern in this investigation centers around the possibility of victims of human trafficking," Kerr said at a press conference Friday. He added his department is working with "advocacy groups" in the region to assist with the women -- some who came from China via New York and down to Florida.

Kerr said the spa was one of 10 shut down in the monthslong investigation.

The video, Jupiter police Detective Andrew Sharp said, is a key part of the probe.

"The question was, does the video contain Mr. Kraft inside receiving the alleged acts. The answer to that is yes," Sharp said at the press conference.

Kerr said a warrant for Kraft's arrest is with the state's attorney's office and will be sent to Kraft's home in Brookline.

"We have two," Kerr said of the two counts of soliciting against the Patriots owner. "Two different visits. ... We're as equally stunned as everybody else."

The NFL issued a brief statement, saying the league is "aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments."

Gov. Charlie Baker said he "finds these allegations deeply disturbing and condemns all acts of sexual exploitation." Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh's office declined to comment.

Martin County, Fla., Sheriff William Snyder said earlier this week the women working at the spa cooked on the back steps, slept in the massage parlors and on massage tables, and had no access to transportation.

"These women were brought here on planes.They had some paperwork. Some just responded to ads for massage spas. They are all Chinese," said Jupiter Police Officer O'Neil Anderson, spokesman for the department. He added the spa workers saw seven to eight johns a day.

"We have not found any juveniles," Anderson added. "Kraft was a shock. It was really just a shock to have a human trafficking ring working out of a store front in quiet Jupiter."

He said more arrests are expected. Those already charged range in age from the 30s to 80s.

Kraft bought the Patriots in 1994 for a record $175 million, keeping the team in Foxboro and growing his investment to an estimated $3.8 billion

Sally Apgar in Jupiter, Fla., contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Some of southwestern Connecticut’s largest companies have earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in recent weeks for the same target — their own stock.
Those moves reflect a nationwide surge in stock buybacks since the 2017 U.S. tax reform, which significantly cut the corporate tax rate. Executives said the share repurchases reflect their desire to use their gains to increase value for shareholders, but the practice has sparked criticism from some Congressional leaders who argue that the strategy exacerbates income inequality and undermines long-term economic growth.
“There is a clear connection between this peak in buybacks and the tax cut that the president signed in 2017,” said Chinmoy Ghosh, head of the finance department in the University of Connecticut’s business school. “It created a major cash inflow for many companies, and one of the resulting uses has been to buy back stock and give back some of the money to shareholders.”
Focus on shareholders
Many corporate bottom lines ballooned in the wake of the tax overhaul, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
U.S. companies responded last year by using their windfalls to repurchase a record $1 trillion of their own shares. The total exceeded the annual gross domestic product of all countries not among the world’s 16 largest national economies.
The proliferation of buybacks has extended into the new year.
Greenwich-based XPO Logistics announced last week it would repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock. A week earlier, the company completed repurchasing 18 million shares, for a total of about $1 billion.
Those buybacks represent a pivot for a firm that has forged its growth through buying other businesses. Between 2011 and 2015, the company made 17 acquisitions.
“M&A is in our corporate DNA, there’s no question about that,” XPO CEO Bradley Jacobs said on a Feb. 15 call with investment analysts. “We have a very good track record with creating significant shareholder value through M&A. But today… the best M&A target is acquiring our own stock. That’s where we’re going to deploy our resources for the foreseeable future.”
On Feb. 7, Stamford-based WWE announced a program to repurchase up to $500 million in stock.
“The stock-repurchase program underscores our commitment to the company’s shareholders,” WWE Co-President George Barrios said on a Feb. 7 call with investment analysts. “The decision was supported by WWE’s strong financial performance and demonstrates our confidence in the company’s future.”
Two days earlier, Stamford-based Pitney Bowes said it would repurchase $100 million of its shares.
Stamford-based United Rentals, another prolific buyer of other companies in recent years, is also focusing increasingly on buybacks. Last December, it announced that it would resume its $1.25 billion repurchase program.
The program started last July, with $210 million of shares purchased through last September. United then paused the program last November to focus on the integration of its $2.1 billion acquisition of equipment-rental firm BlueLine.
Companies are using a range of sources, including cash on hand and bonding, to pay for the buybacks. Pitney has reduced its stock dividend to finance its latest repurchases, although it said doing so would not change the amount of capital expected to be returned this year to shareholders.
Mixed results
Buybacks represents one of the main tools for boosting stock value. They reduce share supply, in turn raising share prices. They also entail less of a long-term commitment than increases in stock dividends, which companies are generally reluctant to reverse.
“We believe that Pitney Bowes (stock) is undervalued and that share repurchase is an attractive investment at this time,” Pitney CEO and President Marc Lautenbach said on a Feb. 5 call with investment analysts.
Pitney shares traded this week at around $7. The price lags a 52-week high of about $13.
But in a market that has dealt with sharp fluctuations in recent months, buybacks have not assured an immediate price spike.
United shares were trading Friday at about $136, compared with a 52-week high of about $190.
XPO’s shares dropped Feb. 15, by more than 10 percent, to about $51. The decrease came a day after the company missed its fourth-quarter earnings targets and announced reduced business from its largest customer, which is widely believed to be Amazon. Its stock was trading Friday at around $52.
The S&P 500 Buyback Index — which comprises the 100 companies within the main S&P 500 index with the highest buyback ratios — ended 2018 with an 8.7 percent annual decline in its value. The main S&P 500 finished last year with total returns down 4.4 percent year-over-year.
Growing debate
The proliferation of share buybacks has sparked concerns among some lawmakers on Capitol Hill that repurchases disproportionately benefit executives and affluent shareholders and come at the expense of companies’ rank-and-file workers.
In a New York Times op-ed earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Bernie Sanders from Vermont, who announced this week his second run for president, said they planned to introduce legislation that would prevent companies from buying back stock unless they first invested in workers and communities.
They advocate for initiatives including a $15-per-hour minimum wage, seven days of paid sick leave, “decent” pensions and “more reliable health benefits.”
“Why wouldn’t it be better for our national economy if, instead, of buying back stock, corporations paid all of their workers better wages and provided good benefits?” Schumer and Sanders wrote, in part, in the op-ed. “Why should a company whose pension program is underfunded be able to buy back stock before shoring up the pension fund?”
Companies buying back stock counter that they are still investing in their workers through wage increases and comprehensive benefits packages.
XPO announced last week a new program to support pregnant employees and their employees. Some critics of the company, such as U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said they were still skeptical of the company’s intentions, citing alleged worker mistreatment at an XPO warehouse in Memphis, Tenn.
In January 2018, Pitney Bowes said it would commit more than $18 million annually to raise wages of most of its U.S. hourly employees. But the company also said at the same time, that it planned to cut costs by $200 million during the next two years — 60 percent of which would be “people related.”
Pitney Bowes officials have since declined to comment further on the “people-related” savings.
“There is definitely some argument to be made that buybacks benefit a small portion of the population because not everybody owns stock,” said UConn’s Ghosh. “But it’s part of a bigger issue about how the wealth that is created in this country is distributed.”

For three years, Jesse Krimes mailed pieces of bedsheets out of prison while serving a 5-year sentence. The sheets were his art - he used hair gel and a plastic spoon to imprint images he found in the newspaper.
Six years later, his work, "Apokaluptein: 16389067" - 39 prison-issued sheets at 40 feet long and 15 feet tall - is on display in "The O.G. Experience," an art exhibit featuring the works of formerly incarcerated men and women, in conjunction with the release of a new HBO film, "O.G.," that debuts on Monday.
Krimes' piece hangs like a tapestry at the Studio 525 NYC gallery in Chelsea, depicting images of war amid advertisements featuring happy women culled from The New York Times between 2010 and 2013.
"I would make one section and mail it out and make another section and mail that out," he told amNewYork at the opening on Tuesday. "Obama was still president, Trump's advertisements were transferred in this. It was a way to mark time and keep my own sanity in the process."
The time capsule-like piece shows what Krimes says is a problematic view of the world because the images of women in the ads are all interspersed with death and destruction .... "and then there's an ad for Macy's and an ad for J. Crew," he said.
Krimes, who co-curated the exhibit, has two other works in the gallery, including a reproduction of a solitary jail cell and a collection of used prison playing cards and soap that he altered with print.
It's among the works of 14 other formerly incarcerated artists, which Krimes says is a first.
"It's never really been done before," he said. "A lot of times there are exhibitions that work through ideas or issues of incarceration, but they very seldom include people who have lived the experience. In many ways, this exhibition is designed to showcase the people who have lived that experience and are making incredibly critical and complex artwork. It pushes back against this narrative that people who have been in prison are underrepresented and misrepresented and continually spoken for when they can speak for themselves."
Mary Baxter's "Ain't I A Woman," is a triptych multimedia project with her own music that tells the story of her life before, during and after imprisonment. Her lyrics tell her truth and comment on the country's prison system: "It's not a school to prison pipeline, it's a prison to prison pipeline."
Artist and co-curator Russell Craig used ox blood to paint Rorschach-like portraits of black Americans who were killed in police-involved shootings in "E-Val," which hangs along an entire wall within the gallery. A few feet away, his self-portrait is displayed, but instead of a canvas, Craig used his own legal documents during his incarceration, including parole papers, statements of employment and prison resident schedule, among others.
Lucinda Martinez, HBO's senior vice president of multicultural and international marketing, says the exhibit picks up where "O.G." leaves off.
"It picks up on the hope part of it, the idea that prison can be restorative or spark the conversation about looking at justice not just as punitive, which is how our system currently works, mostly," she said. "It's about how can still be inspired and how there are programs of reform that could change the conversation. I think this exhibit forces you, through the art, to look past your first screen of judgment and see the humanity of people."

Google Scraps Forced Arbitration Policy

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Google said it would no longer force employees to settle disputes with the company in private arbitration, expanding on an earlier pledge to do away with the practice in cases of sexual harassment or assault.
Google informed its staff in an email on Thursday that the new policy would take effect globally on March 21 for current and future employees. Gina Scigliano, a Google spokeswoman, confirmed the changes.
In November, the company agreed to scrap forced arbitration in individual cases of sexual harassment or assault after 20,000 Google workers staged a walkout demanding changes to how it treats employees. The walkout was prompted by a New York Times article that revealed Google had given a senior executive, Andy Rubin, a $90 million exit package even after it found he had been credibly accused of sexual harassment.
The employee organizers behind the walkout demanded that Google also stop forcing employees into arbitration for other types of disputes. Google said it had decided to make the blanket change after comparing its policies with those of other companies. Employees who prefer to arbitrate privately will still have that option.
"This victory never would have happened if workers hadn't banded together, supported one another and walked out," Google Walkout for Real Change, the organizer behind last year's employee walkout, wrote on Twitter. "Collective action works. Worker power works. This is still just the beginning."
Google had 98,771 employees globally at the end of December.
For years, Google's employment contracts have included a clause requiring staff to hash out grievances behind closed doors instead of suing the company in the public court system.
Arbitration is a common practice among technology companies to resolve disputes outside the courts. It has been especially controversial in cases of sexual harassment because it tends to limit victims from speaking out about their experience.
But under growing pressure from employees, companies are eliminating forced arbitration. Over the last year, Uber, Lyft and Facebook have done away with the policy totally or in part.
Google said the policy change would not apply to former employees with unresolved disputes, although current Google workers with open disputes will not be forced into arbitration.
The company said it would also do away with the practice for temporary staff, contract workers and vendors it hires -- although it would not force third-party staffing companies that supply the vast majority of contractor staff used by the company to adhere to the policy.

We're told to expect hate crimes by Trump supporters; that's why Jussie Smollett would fake one

Texto completo: It beggars belief that anyone would be confused, least of all the news media, as to why Jussie Smollett might fake a hate crime and attempt to frame Trump supporters for it.

When Democrats, liberals, and the national media day in and day out, year after year, cast conservatives, and Trump supporters in particular, as intolerant, racist, homophobic, sexist monsters, why wouldn’t Smollett or anyone else believe they could get away with falsely claiming to have been brutally assaulted by two white men screaming, “This is MAGA country!”?

But after it was reported Wednesday night that Chicago police are charging Smollett for filing a false police report, journalists and fans of the actor were filled with existential questions about life.

“The question that every single person asks,” said anchor Don Lemon on CNN, “is why? Why?”

Popular journalist Yashar Ali wrote on Twitter, "People who are asking why he would do this. No answer to that question will make sense." Indeed.

Lemon's colleague Alisyn Camerota pondered the same thought Thursday morning. “There is that appetite for why would a successful actor on a great trajectory, talented guy, need to do something like this, that will eat at us,” she said.

On Twitter, Smollett’s believers and fans were in despair.

“Help me to make this make sense. Why? Why would he do this?”

“I am so disappointed. Why would he do this?”

“I’m hoping those guys are trying to frame @JussieSmollett for his own attack cause I’m so confused as to why he would do this? Just doesn’t make sense.”

If the worst version of what Smollett reportedly did is true, it would mean he and two others conspired to make it appear that he had been the victim of a violent racially, sexually, and politically motivated attack, inspired directly by the president.

The Smollett story was likely a hoax, but it’s the very stereotypical type of story that liberals, Democrats, and the media have been insisting we should expect and believe for more than three years, despite all evidence to the contrary.

In November, amid expectation that Trump might declare a national emergency at the southern border, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough said the threat was “not about anything other than scaring Americans and actually appealing to their most racist, base instincts.”

That same month, CNN commentator Kirsten Powers said of Trump supporters, “It actually makes you racist. If you support somebody who does racist things, that makes you racist.”

In October, when a Trump-hating lunatic shot up a synagogue in Pittsburgh, leaving 11 dead, journalists nonetheless immediately traced the massacre to the president.

In May, CNN guest Michaela Angela Davis said all Trump supporters are racist.

In August, New York Times columnist Charles Blow wrote, “Trump’s base itself [is] the enemy of the Republic.”

During his interview on ABC last week to defend himself, Smollett angrily blurted, “Who the fuck would make something up like this?!”

We may now know the answer and it should confuse no one as to why.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a Hackensack woman, who was the bride of an Islamic State fighter and now wants to come home will not be allowed back in the United States.
“I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Muthana traveled to Syria and married and had a child with an ISIS fighter and now wants to face the U. S. justice system.
But Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Muthana is not an American citizen and "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicting statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack in 1994.
Muthana, who was raised in Alabama, left the United States to join ISIS four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers. She is asking to be allowed to return to the U. S. to face due process.

"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, Muthana's lawyer.
"If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "

Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Pompeo subsequently issued the statement Wednesday in which he claimed that Muthana was not a U. S. citizen and would not be allowed back in.
Shibly, however, provided USA TODAY with a copy of Muthana's birth certificate, which lists her place of birth as Hackensack, New Jersey.
Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said that Pompeo can't just assert that someone born in the U. S. is not a U. S. citizen.
"I gather that the government's argument is that she was born to a diplomat who was in the United States on official business, and so was not entitled to birthright citizenship. That's correct as a matter of law if it's true, but it's not true just because the government says so," he said in a Twitter message to USA TODAY.
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute.
All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Ticket are now on sale for the Northwest Passages Book Club's evening with Jon Meacham, the presidential historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels."
The May 6 event, co-presented with Whitworth University, will be held at the Martin Woodson Theater at the Fox. Meacham will be in conversation with Whitworth President Beck A. Taylor.
Meacham's latest book explores the current moment in American politics and life by looking back at previous times in the nation's history when hope overcame division and fear. He decided to write the book in 2017 after watching the violent clashes at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
"He wants to remind us that the current political turmoil is not unprecedented, that as a nation we have survived times worse than this," writes Princeton history professor Sean Wilentz in a New York Times review. "And initially this sounds a little too reassuring. But Meacham quickly adds that America's survival has never been automatic."
Wilentz called Meacham "an appealing storyteller" who has seen how American politics work up close, "yet he has remained uncynical."
Meacham is the best-selling author of "Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Bush." He was asked to give a eulogy at Bush's December funeral, describing the former president as "a lion who not only led us, but who loved us."
In 2009, Meacham won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography for "American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House." He also is the author of "Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power," "Franklin and Winston: An Intimate Portrait of an Epic Friendship," and "American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation."
A contributing editor at Time magazine and contributing writer to the New York Times Book Review, Meacham is a distinguished visiting professor at Vanderbilt University. He's the former executive editor at Random House and served as editor of Newsweek. Meacham, who began his career at the Chattanooga Times, lives in Nashville, Tennessee.
Meacham's 2018 book, "Soul of America," will be the topic of discussion at the May 6 "Common Read" forum hosted by Northwest Passages, The Spokesman-Review's community book club.

COUNTDOWN TO THE OSCARS; FALLING 'STAR'; Why the award front-runner has fizzled and may flame out

Texto completo: Maybe those Oscar obituaries for "A Star Is Born" are premature. Maybe Bradley Cooper's smash-hit romantic remake will make good on more than one of its eight Oscar nominations. Maybe, to use the pitch in Warner Bros.' last-ditch campaign plea, academy members will vote for the movie that makes them feel instead of the movie they simply admire. (Cough. "Roma." Cough.)
If there's anything we've learned this awards season, it's that there could be 100 people in a room and 99 don't believe in you, but all it takes is just one.
Full disclosure: I am not that person.

Lady Gaga first trotted out that "all it takes is just one" talking point at the Venice Film Festival world premiere of "A Star Is Born." She then repeated the story -- about how Bradley Cooper, the film's star and director (and co-writer and producer and songwriter), took a chance in casting her -- at the Toronto Film Festival. Then she repeated it again and again (and again), telling it so many times that it became a meme.
It was kind of cute. At first. Everything about the movie was golden right out of the gate. "A Star Is Born" earned rapturous reviews at Venice and Toronto and crushed it at the box office, and its signature song, "Shallow," was playing everywhere. You could not escape it. Some awards pundits mused that the film could possibly sweep the Oscars' top five categories -- picture, director, lead actor and actress, screenplay. Everyone wanted to know what brand of beard oil Cooper was using.
But aside from some prizes from the nebulous National Board of Review, a couple of Grammys and a Golden Globe for "Shallow," "A Star Is Born" has been an awards season also-ran. When Cooper lost best director and best first-time director at the DGA Awards earlier this month, anguished fans wondered whether he could possibly win anything this year. (Shortly afterward, PETA gave him a prize for using his own dog in the movie.)
What happened? This being Hollywood, there's no shortage of theories -- and finger-pointing. Veteran Oscar consultants and academy members offered the following reasons why this "Star" hasn't shone.
Too bright too soon
The drumbeat for the movie began long before its Venice premiere, with people like Sean Penn calling it "one of the most beautiful, fantastic, it's the best, and most importantly, commercial film I have seen in so many years," adding, in a podcast interview with Marc Maron, that Cooper and Gaga were "miracles in it." Past "Star Is Born" star Barbra Streisand gave it her blessing in March, revealing that she had seen it and it was "very, very good."
Then came the festivals, the "just wanted to take another look at you" memes, the Oscar buzz and the $42-million opening weekend in October, leading to a coronation as the best picture front-runner, much to the dismay of those running its Oscar campaign.
"You never want to get out front that early," says an awards consultant, who, like others interviewed for this story, asked for anonymity to protect client relationships. "When you set up expectations that soon, it can only go south. And it did."
Another strategist notes that the publicity onslaught was also designed to promote the movie's theatrical opening -- which succeeded spectacularly, given the film's $210-million box office haul.
But that ubiquity also created expectations that, for some, could not be met.
"It's the third remake of this movie -- and that's not even counting 'The Artist,' which is basically 'A Star Is Born' without the guy killing himself at the end," one consultant says. "For a movie that felt that familiar, I think it did pretty well. I just think people went a little overboard with all that early ecstasy."
Short on humility
To win an Oscar, good work is a plus, but a strong story about the nominee is even better. Glenn Close, 71, is on her seventh nomination without ever winning. It's her time! Rami Malek overcame bad dentures to make Freddie Mercury come alive. Give him the Oscar!
Awards consultants say Cooper and Gaga never gave voters a reason to root for them. "Bradley Cooper Is Not Really Into This Profile," a September headline in the New York Times, captured what many observers saw as an aloofness on Cooper's part to engage in the season's niceties.
"There hasn't been a ton of graciousness on his part," complained one strategist. "I don't think there was ever a day when he marveled that he might get the kind of recognition Alfonso Cuaron might get."
Another consultant says Cooper should have talked about his acting more. "He wanted to be seen as this auteur and now, ironically, he's going to lose best actor to a guy ['Bohemian Rhapsody's' Rami Malek] who didn't even do his own singing, which Cooper did -- and did quite well."
Campaigners likewise say Gaga came off poorly in her messaging, citing the dramatic, Cinderella-style dress she wore to the Golden Globes and her admission that she slept through Oscar nominations morning because she was on "showbiz time."
"First of all, I don't believe she was asleep," a strategist says, "but even if she was, old people who have spent their whole lives waiting for an Oscar nomination don't want to hear something like that."
"Also," the strategist continues, "the choice to show up at the Golden Globes wearing a dress with a 20-foot train that requires three people to hold does nothing but 'other' yourself. She arrived as the unknowable megastar of the night, not the musician turned actress who's starring in her first real movie and is overwhelmed and touched to be there. She just played the wrong part constantly."
An academy voter in the producers branch didn't fault Gaga or Cooper or their publicists, saying that it's hard to create a sympathetic narrative around two people already incredibly famous.
"You were never going to turn them into underdogs," the producer says. "They're too beautiful for that."
Choose your friends
In the home stretch, awards campaigners love to solicit famous folks to lavish praise on their films. Sometimes it feels organic, as when Guillermo del Toro saluted "Roma" in a long Twitter thread, calling the film, made by his longtime friend Cuaron , one of his five all-time favorite movies.
And sometimes it feels ... awkward.
Just before final Oscar voting began, Penn turned up again to voice support for Cooper and his film in a piece published at Deadline Hollywood, an industry news website.
The article quickly became the talk of the town -- for all the wrong reasons. After gushing about the movie and noting the injustice of its many losses ("In a fair world, 'A Star Is Born' sweeps the awards"), Penn concluded with a preemptive Oscar toast.
"To spare myself potential disappointment, I'm raising a glass in advance to Bradley Cooper and 'A Star Is Born,' " Penn wrote. "Surely a raised glass is as legitimate as a globe of gilded gold or a male statuette minus a penis (also gold gilded). God forbid it have balls this year!"
"You wonder if anyone from the movie's team read that -- and if they did, why they didn't just tell Sean Penn to send it privately to Cooper," one strategist says. "Forget the clunky writing. To say that it should 'sweep the awards' is just obvious shilling. Praise the movie, but don't grovel for awards -- at least, not that openly."
Not everyone wins
Steven Spielberg's "The Color Purple" earned 11 Oscar nominations. It won nothing. Same with the 1977 ballet world drama "The Turning Point." Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" went 0 for 10, as did David O. Russell's "American Hustle," which many regarded, like "A Star Is Born," as a potential Oscar powerhouse.
"A lot of good movies have gone home empty-handed," notes one consultant. "And 'A Star Is Born' is likely to win at least one Oscar -- for song. Plus it grossed more than $400 million worldwide. And it established Bradley Cooper as a director and Gaga as an actress. I think people need to have a little perspective."
"Then again," he adds, "I still consider the Dodgers a failure because they lost the World Series again. So maybe I'm the wrong person to talk to."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether contamination of groundwater that seeps into rivers, lakes and oceans violates the Clean Water Act.
More inside
Ruth Bader
Ginsburg returns 60 days after surgery. 3A
The 47-year-old law prohibits dumping pollutants directly into navigable bodies of water, but it is less clear about indirect sources.
Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Hawaii's Maui County violated the law by injecting treated sewage from a wastewater treatment plant into the groundwater, some of which enters the Pacific Ocean.
The high court will hear the county's appeal next fall.
"If the Supreme Court reverses the lower courts' decisions, chemical plants, concentrated animal feeding operations, oil refineries and other industrial facilities would effectively have free rein to discharge pollutants indirectly into the nation's waterways without Clean Water Act permits," the environmental group Earthjustice warned Tuesday.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit came to a similar conclusion last year in a South Carolina case involving an underground pipeline that burst in 2014, spilling hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline.
Some of the fuel seeped into nearby rivers, lakes and wetlands, including the Savannah River.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit did not take the same view in a Kentucky case, in which pollutants from coal ash retention ponds seeped into groundwater that fed waterways. The court said only pollutants added directly to navigable bodies of water were regulated under the law.
About two months ago, the Trump administration announced it was rolling back an Obama-era regulation that has become a rallying cry for farmers and property rights activists opposed to federal overreach. Undoing a regulation President Donald Trump called "a massive power grab," the proposal would ease Washington's oversight of small bodies of water. It would replace an Obama administration regulation, known as the Waters of the United States rule, that expanded federal protections to smaller rivers and streams.
Andrew Wheeler, the Environmental Protection Agency's acting administrator, said states should oversee most ditches, land that fills with water when it rains, certain wetlands that have been used to grow crops, storm water control ponds and water and wastewater treatment systems.
Groundwater would not be federally protected, a category Wheeler said never should have been included.
Texas can't execute disabled man
Justices made several other decisions Tuesday on cases involving disabilities and the death penalty, fraud and celebrities.
The high court sided with a Texas convict who claimed his intellectual disability makes him ineligible for the death penalty. It reversed for the second time a Texas court's ruling that Bobby James Moore could be executed despite his cognitive deficits. A majority of justices said Texas relied on "lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled."
Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's unsigned opinion, which was opposed by conservative Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. The vote was 6-3, and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the majority.
The court ruled in 2017 that Texas – the nation's leader in executions – cannot use a decades-old definition of intellectual disability to determine who lives and who dies. The justices sent the case back to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, but that court refused to change its original ruling.
"The court repeated the same errors that this court previously condemned" by emphasizing Moore's adaptive strengths, rather than his deficits, Roberts said in the opinion released Tuesday. "That did not pass muster under this court's analysis last time. It still doesn't."
The three dissenters said Texas did its best to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling, which they said failed to set clear guidelines for judging intellectual disability.
Moore's case dates to 1980, when he shot and killed a grocery store clerk during a botched robbery. He was twice convicted, then found to be intellectually disabled, but Texas' highest criminal court overturned that finding, citing its own precedent, which is based on a 1992 definition of intellectual disability.
The Supreme Court has tightened sentencing rules for people with intellectual disabilities since its landmark ruling in Atkins v. Virginia in 2002. In 2014, it barred Florida from using a single, strict IQ standard to determine a prisoner's competency.
Texas claimed it met the relevant standards for judging intellectual disability, having looked at Moore's intellectual functioning, adaptive behaviors and age of onset.
Cliff Sloan, Moore's attorney, said the state used lay stereotypes – such as the character Lennie in John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
Ex-congressman's case rejected
A former congressman who resigned under pressure in 2015 after lavish spending that included remodeling his office in the style of the television series "Downton Abbey" failed to win a reprieve Tuesday at the Supreme Court.
Aaron Schock of Illinois, a former rising GOP star first elected to the House of Representatives at age 27, sought unsuccessfully for two years to have part of his fraud indictment dismissed.
The justices refused to hear his case after two lower federal courts denied his effort. Schock, 37, claimed his misdeeds can be considered only by the House, not the courts.
Schock was charged in 2016 with defrauding the government of more than $100,000 by falsifying reimbursement vouchers, as well as filing false tax returns. Federal investigators dug into allegations that he spent large amounts on personal air travel and office decor.
He ultimately reimbursed taxpayers $35,000.
Cosby accuser's lawsuit rejected
The justices refused Tuesday to consider a defamation lawsuit against convicted sexual predator Bill Cosby by one of his many accusers.
Thomas concurred in the decision but argued that the media case that established the rules controlling such disputes should be re-examined.
Kathrine Mae McKee contended that Cosby attorney Martin Singer defamed her in a letter and news release in December 2014 after she joined women alleging rape and assault at the hands of the entertainer once known as "America's Dad."
McKee, a casting director, said she was raped by Cosby, a friend of eight years, in 1974 in his Detroit hotel room when she arrived to pick him up to take him to a yacht party.
Singer called her a liar in a letter to the New York Daily News, and two lower federal courts concluded that didn't rise to the level of defamation because McKee had become a "limited purpose public figure." The justices apparently agreed with that assessment by refusing to hear her appeal.
McKee was disappointed she lost her case but said she still feels "justice has been served" because Cosby was convicted in a Pennsylvania criminal court last year and is in prison.
Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, emailed a statement to USA TODAY from Cosby dictated to his wife, Camille:
"I thank each of the Justices for their ruling, which gives me renewed hope that the fair and impartial courts in this country will go on to deliver justice," he said. "This is the very reason why I have no remorse, because I am innocent and will continue to channel the strength of the great political prisoners. Finally the truth is being allowed to be heard and read by the public."
Thomas wrote a 14-page concurrence with the court's decision, arguing that the court should review the issue of public vs. private figures in defamation and libel cases.
Under the landmark decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment barred public figures from recovering damages for defamation unless they can prove a statement was made with "actual malice," meaning it was made knowing it was untrue or with reckless disregard for whether it was true.
The lower courts concluded McKee was "a limited purpose public figure" because she had made a public accusation against Cosby and talked to reporters about it when more women were coming forward (they eventually totaled more than five dozen) to accuse Cosby of sexual misconduct in encounters dating back to the mid-1960s.
"If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we," Thomas wrote.
McKee's lawyer, whose firm has successfully represented Hulk Hogan in his dispute with Gawker that led to that website's demise, said his briefs in the McKee case never called for "a wholesale rewriting" of First Amendment law.
"We simply argued that Ms. McKee did not give up her right to sue and did not become a public figure by doing nothing more than identifying herself as a sexual assault survivor," he told USA TODAY.
After two trials, Cosby, 81, was convicted in April of three counts of aggravated indecent sexual assault.
He is serving three to 10 years in a Pennsylvania prison for drugging and molesting former Temple University administrator Andrea Constand in 2004. He is appealing his conviction in the case.

Texto completo: Justice Clarence Thomas filed a solo opinion Tuesday that should appeal to President Trump. He said the high court should make it easier for public figures to sue for libel.
Thomas said the court made a mistake in 1964 when it set a high barrier for public officials to sue the press for defaming them with a false story. That was later expanded to include famous individuals and people who inject themselves into big news stories.
In essence, public officials must show the publishers knew the report was false or otherwise displayed a "reckless disregard" for the truth.

Thomas argued that the framers of the Constitution did not intend such protection when they adopted the 1st Amendment, which forbids "abridging the freedom of speech or of the press."
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy-driven approach to the Constitution," he wrote in McKee vs. Cosby. At some time, "we should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area."
Trump has repeatedly called for such a change.
"Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness," he said early last year at the start of a Cabinet meeting.
He was upset then by a headline-making book by Michael Wolff called "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House."
The president called for change in the law. "We are going to take a strong look at our country's libel laws, so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts," he said.
Libel and defamation are claims that are brought under state law. But if the federal shield against such claims were relaxed, the impact could go far beyond the press. Critics have noted that Trump himself could be vulnerable because of his blunt postings on Twitter where he has called rivals "crooked," "dishonest" and "criminal."
Thomas is not the first justice to question the court's 1st Amendment standard. In the past, the late Justice Antonin Scalia had called for reconsidering the landmark New York Times vs. Sullivan decision in 1964, which sharply limited defamation claims in state court.
In that case, an Alabama county commissioner had sued the New York Times over an advertisement that sought funding for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his civil rights campaign. L.B. Sullivan, the county official, was not mentioned in the ad, but he said he was defamed nonetheless because it referred to police abuses and an "unprecedented wave of terror."
The Alabama courts awarded him $500,000 in damages, but the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the judgment.
The justices then believed the national press could not cover the civil rights movement in the South if newspapers, magazines and TV networks were subject to crippling libel verdicts in state courts.
None of the other justices signed on to Thomas' 14-page opinion.

Kaiser Permanente to open medical school in Pasadena, offer free tuition for first classes in 2020

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.
The New York Times contributed to this report.

The return of the dumbest genre within the media's presidential campaign coverage

Texto completo: By Paul Waldman

The Washington Post

If you decide to run for president, you will have to do many things, not all of them pleasant. You will have to call hundreds or even thousands of people and ask them for money. You will have to pretend to be overjoyed to meet every person you encounter, no matter how indifferent they are toward you. You will have to repeat the same speech over and over until you feel like a malfunctioning robot. You will have to put up with inane questions from reporters about your standing in the polls.

And you will have to eat.

Indeed, you will be expected to take any food item anyone puts in your hand, appetizing or not, and cram it down your gullet as though you'd been waiting years to get your mouth around a deep-fried Twinkie or squirrel-snout-on-a-stick or whatever is causing a stir at the state fair this year.

More than that, though, you will be watched while you eat by the eagle-eyed representatives of the elite press, who will scrutinize every move of your hand and twitch of your lip as though they were Soviet figure-skating judges searching for the most minute flaws in your performance.

Once the meal is consumed, they will ask: Was that sufficiently authentic? Did you order the local delicacy in this place you are not from and may never have visited with the proper words, and eat it with the proper implement? If you failed in this task, you are plainly unable to connect with the "real" Americans whose favor will determine your fate.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is the latest to fail the test. On a visit to South Carolina, she went to a meeting in a chicken & waffles restaurant and began eating her chicken with a fork, then noticed that others were using their hands, and politely asked the owner what was better. Upon being informed that she should use her hands, she did so. But it was too late; her true nature as an out-of-touch fraud had been revealed.

"Could this really be the first time in 50 years she ate fried chicken?" a New York Times reporter asked. "Is there anything Gillibrand has done that is not contrived and opportunistic?" said an esteemed New York Magazine writer.

Judgment: Inauthentic.

If nothing else, Gillibrand can take solace in having joined a long line of presidents and presidential aspirants who have fallen short in the culinary authenticity department. In 1976, Gerald Ford bit into a tamale without shucking it first, thereby proving that he would be an enemy of all Latino Americans. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ate pizza with a fork, like some kind of monster. But nobody was punished more harshly for a food faux pas than John Kerry, who in 2003 made the required pre-Pennsylvania primary pilgrimage to the corner of 9th and East Passyunk in Philadelphia, where Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's Steaks stare across the intersection in their eternal cheesesteak war.

Kerry made the horrific mistake of ordering his cheesesteak with that obscure, fancy-pants topping known as Swiss cheese, producing a chorus of contempt from reporters who explained that "real" Philadelphians order their cheesesteaks with Cheez Whiz. Which is itself not true; though many people get Whiz, the best choice is actually provolone (I speak as someone who lived in Philly for a decade).

But the point is that Cheez Whiz is, in the estimation of the Washington-based press corps, obviously the most authentic choice because they assume it's the one that blue-collar, down-home, reg'lar-fellas would choose. If a politician hasn't been properly briefed by their advance team to place the right order or eat in the proper way -- which almost always indicates nothing more than that they're not from this place or they haven't eaten this particular food -- the judgment is swift and harsh. Look at this phony, pretending to be an ordinary person when he's obviously some kind of effete swell who'd be more at home sitting in the Harvard Club sipping from a snifter of brandy while discussing the merits of the Gulfstream G500 with a guy named "Winthrop!" How could he possibly have the best interests of ordinary Americans at heart?

It works even better if reporters have already decided the candidate is inauthentic, as they had with Kerry -- and if the reporters themselves are making their own possibly ill-informed assumptions about regular people's food preferences. So a CNN reporter described how she knew Kerry couldn't connect with the masses when he asked for green tea in an Iowa restaurant, as though green tea is some kind of exotic concoction the simple folk of the heartland could not possibly have encountered in their charmingly rustic lives.

A good deal of campaign reporting is an attempt to take the repetitive events of the campaign trail and not only find something new in them but use the mundane goings-on of the moment as a symbol of something larger and more revealing. Which means that reporters are always on the lookout for screw-ups, especially those that offer an amusing visual. And if the reporter can condescendingly explain how "real" people are supposed to act -- meaning the reporter him or herself is authentic enough to know, while the politician isn't -- that's even better.

So the next time you encounter one of these stories, remember that there are foods every single one of us isn't sure how to eat, or how to eat in a certain context. It doesn't make us inauthentic, and it doesn't tell you anything about who should and shouldn't be president.

A Florida ‘dreamscape’

Texto completo: Snowy white cranes rise up from a field of tall grasses under a postcard blue sky. As they spread their shimmering wings to take flight, a Native American stands behind them, face set and bow taut, aiming to kill.
George de Forest Brush painted this Florida scene in 1887, perfectly capturing the dichotomy of a peninsula that is equal parts graceful beauty and bloody survival.
Brush’s gorgeous oil -- and how it makes you think about the plight of Florida’s original denizens -- is one of many discoveries in a first-rate exhibit developed by the Boca Raton Museum of Art. Three years in the making, “Imagining Florida: History and Myth In The Sunshine State” brings together more than 200 paintings, photographs and kitschy artifacts to show how artists have told -- and sold -- our story over three centuries.
For example, Brush probably never saw the scene he painted. He barely set foot in Florida.
No matter. Writer-professor Raymond Arsenault, in an introduction to the exhibit’s impressive catalog book, says the state’s identity is elastic enough to take on the shape of a “dreamscape,” a “repository for all manner of myths and images.” Or as co-curator Gary Monroe puts it: “Florida is as much an idea as a place.” And while many of these artistic ideas celebrate nature and traffic in nostalgia, they also tell harsher truths about our history.
The show, spread over most of the museum’s first floor, is divided between paintings and photography. The painting section ranges from detailed 18th century naturalist illustrations of flowers and animals to pre-statehood portraits of Seminoles to lots of gobsmacking landscapes, proving Florida was always Instagrammable. (In that vein, don’t miss Martin Johnson Heade’s reddish sunset oil from the late 1800s, a dazzler that you can’t recreate on your camera phone.)
Art lovers may be surprised to find out how many boldface brush-wielders paraded down, palette in hand, often on a reporting assignment to figure out Florida. (Some things never change.) Among them was frontier painter Frederic Remington, who inked an evocative illustration of U.S. troops marching through palmetto in 1898 during the Spanish-American War.
Everybody from Winslow Homer to Milton Avery to
Louis Comfort Tiffany produced landscapes. Thomas Moran painted the dawn-lit St. John’s River. And John Singer Sargent took a break from society portraiture for a striking watercolor of a sailor sitting on the docks outside Miami’s historic Vizcaya mansion, still being built in 1917. (As for other Florida scenes, he wryly noted: “Palmettos and alligators don’t make interesting pictures.”)
Among Florida landscape painters, the ‘50s African-American roadside art sellers known as the Highwaymen are represented by Alfred Hair’s vibrant scene of a Florida hurricane smacking a shoreline. Hair, who was killed in a Fort Pierce bar fight in 1970 at age 29, was recently included in the New York Times’ ongoing project of obituaries written for prominent black cultural figures who were overlooked when they died. (Hair was joined by ragtime king Scott Joplin, early filmmaker Oscar Micheaux and others.)
With some notable exceptions, such as Hugh McKean’s expressive portrait of an Orlando minister, most African-Americans and minorities in the exhibit are painted as anonymous migrant workers, chain gang prisoners or laborers building the Tamiami Trail. It tells you how they were viewed by white artists and marginalized in society. In fact, that 1938 George Snow Hill painting of Tamiami Trail workers was rejected for a Miami government mural because an art committee said black prison labor wasn’t an appropriate image, writes co-curator Jennifer Hardin. The irony: most of Hill’s paintings of minorities were crude, racist caricatures, including a St. Petersburg mural of a minstrel show that was finally removed during civil rights protests in 1966.
Photographers would get closer to humanizing their subjects.
Before he directed the ‘70s film “Shaft,” Gordon Parks was an activist photojournalist, looking for images of African Americans that counteracted the era’s stereotypes. This is evidenced by a 1943 series documenting black student life at Bethune-Cookman College. And the show features a bevy of Depression-era masters — Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Arthur Rothstein, Marion Post Wolcott. Through their focus on faces and living conditions, we see the brutal effects of financial deprivation and subsistence work — something that still undergirds Florida’s “gig” economy.
Witty tourist-related delights abound, from Bunny Yeager’s images of legendary pinup model Bettie Page at a Boca Raton animal park to Bruce Mozert’s hilarious photos at Silver Springs, where he was the theme park’s promotional photographer. Mozert irresistibly frames ‘50s domestic scenes of sunbathing, grilling, and mowing the lawn — and all underwater!
One surprise (to me, at least) were the panoramic, elegantly composed photos of Alfred M. Price, a part-time Palm Beacher who traveled the country at the turn of the century with a tripod and a $20 camera that only spit out five photos per roll. His works are a unique time capsule to study the clothes (we dressed better then), beaches, cars and planes of a lost era, including one image of now antique roadsters lined up outside the Palm Beach Polo Grounds.
And who knew that Henri-Cartier Bresson, the godfather of modern photography, shot the swells in Palm Beach and Miami? Or that documentary road photographer Robert Frank did too? Perhaps my favorite photo in the exhibit is Frank’s image of a bored Miami Beach elevator operator who watches the glittering 1 percenters glide by while she dreams of joining them.
Dreams — of endless sunshine vacations and real estate fantasias — percolate through the Florida experience captured here, right down to a small section of fun tourism promotional items, from alligator-head canes to citrus crate labels to a Silver Springs TV tray set. If it isn’t a little cheesy, it’s just not Florida, right?
“Imagining Florida” is an essential exhibit for anybody interested in the state’s history. By rounding up rarely seen pieces from a variety of museums and private collections, it provides a serious, smartly curated overview of how artists pictured the state, and often packaged it for mass consumption. As anybody who’s tried to find a parking space in season can attest, the hype has worked all too well.

Texto completo: They've survived a breakup and the broadcasting of his naked paddle-boarding pics. Now Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry are making their romance official.

Yahoo reports that the couple, who have dated on and off since 2016, appear to have enjoyed one epic Valentine's Day. On Friday, Perry posted a selfie that shows her and her British beau posing against a backdrop of red heart balloons. It's her ring finger, though, that's stealing the show, thanks to some dazzling new bling.

These will be the second nuptials for 34-year-old Perry, who was married to British comedian Russell Brand from 2010 to 2012. Bloom, 42, split in 2013 from supermodel Miranda Kerr, with whom he has an 8-year-old son.

Bloom and Perry split in 2017 but rekindled their relationship -- for good, it seems -- in the spring of 2018.

FBI reportedly considering charges against Ryan Adams

The FBI is opening an inquiry into whether alt-country rocker Ryan Adams committed a crime by engaging in sexually explicit communications with an underage fan, according to The New York Times.

On Wednesday, Yahoo reports, seven women and more than a dozen associates accused the 44-year-old singer-songwriter of sexual misconduct and/or emotional abuse in a Times report. One of the women who came forward was a girl named Ava, alleging she communicated with Adams when she was 15 and 16 and he was 39 and 40. The Times reviewed 3,217 text messages purportedly sent over the nine-month period. Although they never met, Adams allegedly sent Ava sexual messages and exposed himself during a Skype exchange. Ava admitted to lying about her age, and Ryan denied the allegations Wednesday.

A law-enforcement official revealed to the Times that FBI agents in the bureau's New York office took the first steps to open a criminal investigation on Thursday. Adams' attorney told the paper he had not been contacted by officials.

"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes," Adams said in a statement Wednesday. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. Period."

He continued, "As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly. I am resolved to work to be the best man I can be. And I wish everyone compassion, understanding and healing."

Adams's ex-wife, singer-actress Mandy Moore, was one of the women to go on record in the Times report. The day after it was published, Moore had no regrets about having done so.

"Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it's always worth it," the start of "This Is Us" wrote on Instagram. "My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard."

Chicago police: 2 questioned in attack on 'Emipire' actor are suspects

CHICAGO (AP) -- The investigation into "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett's account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took another turn Friday when Chicago police said two men who had been questioned about the attack had been arrested on suspicion of a crime.

Police did not say what crime they may have committed, and they have not been charged, but a spokesman said police consider them to be suspects in the attack.

The two men -- whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers -- were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria when police learned that at least one of the men worked on "Empire," according to Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man's job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi's comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea "patently ridiculous."

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was "no evidence to say that this is a hoax" and that Smollett "continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect."

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett's neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled "this is MAGA country," referencing President Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing "MAGA" hats were inaccurate.

"I didn't need to add anything like that," he said. "I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae."

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived "because I wanted them to see."

He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

Texto completo: When you work at The New York Times Book Review, you discover two things pretty quickly: 1) There are a lot of passionate readers out there, and 2) Most of them have no idea what to read next. We're happy to help! As the saying goes, if you teach a fish how to select its own books you've fed it for life, or something. With that in mind, here are some pointers for those of you who want to hone your reading habits but aren't ready to commit to a Proust book club just yet. Gregory Cowles
SET GOALS. A book a month, a book a week, whatever feels comfortable to you -- and keep a list to track your progress.
Carry your book with you. Now there's no excuse not to read during downtime: on the train, in the doctor's waiting room, at red lights (O.K., maybe not at red lights). I prefer books on paper for all kinds of reasons but particularly here, because they make a more insistent claim on your attention than e-books do. But I'll grant that it's easier to carry multiple books around on a device, so if you prefer that and won't get sucked into email or etc., then that's an option too.
Unplug your TV. Literally, unplug it. Or change your settings so you have to log in every time you want to watch something. If you force yourself to pause just a moment before watching a show you don't love anyway, you may realize you'd rather spend that same time with a book.
Check books out of the library. That way you'll have a deadline to return them, and will feel more pressure to get to the end.
Join a book club. Peer pressure, plus a built-in social angle that will have you all reading the same thing and talking about it over wine. If you can't find a group of like-minded friends in your town, ask at the library or bookstore, or look for programs like "One City One Book" or "Now Read This," the PBS NewsHour-New York Times Book Club.

Texto completo: OUR MOVIE RATINGS: * Skip it; **So-so; ***Good; **** Excellent
'Aquaman' **
PG-13 - 2:22 - Jason Momoa's charisma is as formidable as his brawn, but this movie about the long-haired, shirtless superhero is soggy with Atlantis mythology and drowns in special effects. Associated Press
'Bohemian Rhapsody' **½
PG-13 - 2:15 - As Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek delivers a committed, thoroughly inhabited performance, which winds up transcending the regrettably thin material at hand. Washington Post
'Bumblebee' ***
PG-13 - 1:53 - While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save "Transformers." This charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot flips the script on the tired, bloated franchise. Associated Press
'Capernaum' **½
R - 2:30 - Nadine Labaki's movie that starts with a boy suing his parents for bringing him into the world only gets more depressing. In Arabic with subtitles. Washington Post
'Cold Pursuit' *½
R - 1:58 - A beat-by-beat remake of the 2014 Norwegian thriller "In Order of Disappearance," director Hans Petter Moland puts Liam Neeson behind the wheel of a snowplow with vengeance on his mind. The movie delivers -- in its own soulless way. Chicago Tribune
'Cold War' ****
R - 1:28 - Writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski draws on his own parents' relationship for inspiration for his near-perfect film set in post-WWII Poland. In Polish, French, German, Russian, Italian and Croatian with subtitles. Washington Post
'Dr. Seuss'
The Grinch' **½
PG - 1:30 - Benedict Cumberbatch voices the green Christmas grouch in this adaptation (the third) of Dr. Seuss' 1957 children's book. This computer-animated version is beautiful to look at, but the new material doesn't resonate. Tribune News Service
'Escape Room'
PG-13 - 1:40 - Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and must use their wits to find the clues or die. Directed by Adam Robitel. Not reviewed.
'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' ***
PG-13 - 2:14 - The nifflers are cute. But there's something far less adorable that has also escaped in this Harry Potter prequel, which takes a turn for the dark side that will satisfy adult fans. Washington Post
'The Favourite' ***½
R - 2:01 - Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play a pair of women sucking up to England's Queen Anne in the 18th century. You'd swear they have paid staffs of comedy writers hidden beneath their voluminous skirts. Star Tribune
'Glass' **
PG-13 - 2:09 - Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan reminds us he is the ultimate mastermind, the king of the twists. But the true master at work is James McAvoy, who reprises his role from "Split." Tribune News Service
'Green Book' ***½
PG-13 - 2:10 - Movie based on a true story recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx-bred Italian-American (Viggo Mortensen) was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to concert engagements across the Deep South. Directed by Peter Farrelly. Associated Press
'The House
With a Clock in
Its Walls' Zero stars
PG - 1:39 - Supernatural thriller manages to find the perfect un-sweet spot -- it's too scary for little kids, not scary enough for older ones, not funny or clever enough for their parents, and too redundant for everyone. Associated Press
'If Beale Street Could Talk' ***½
R - 1:59 - Director Barry Jenkins ("Moonlight") delivers a heartbreaking story of obstacles and injustices in 1970s Harlem. Associated Press
'Instant Family' **½
PG-13 - 2:00 - Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a couple who are unable to conceive children of their own and who choose to adopt -- not just one child, but three siblings. Based on co-writer/director Sean Anders' own experience. Washington Post
'The Invisibles'
NR - 1:50 - Historical drama about Jews hiding in plain sight in WWII Berlin. With Max Mauff, Alice Dwyer. Written by Claus Rafle, Alejandra Lopez. Directed by Rafle. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'The Kid Who
Would Be King' ***
PG - 2:00 - The Arthurian legend gets a modern and more youthful spin in this surprisingly delightful film full of action, heart, a crazy-haired Patrick Stewart (as "old" Merlin) and a few genuinely good gags. Associated Press
'The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' ***
PG - 1:46 - The innocent-looking Lego Duplo characters introduced in the first movie turn into invading space aliens in the sequel. Featuring the voices of Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Tiffany Haddish, Charlie Day and more. Chicago Tribune
'Mary Poppins Returns' *½
PG - 1:11 - Disney's sequel starring Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda works hard to evoke the undeniable charms of the original 1964 film, but without the spoonful of sugar to help it all go down. Directed by Rob Marshall. Washington Post
'The Mule' *
R - 1:56 - The film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of a true story from the New York Times Magazine, but the racist cultural stereotypes and appalling treatment of women are all thanks to screenwriter Nick Schenk and director Clint Eastwood. Tribune News Service
'On the Basis of Sex' ***
PG-13 - 2:00 - Felicity Jones plays feminist icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg in an adoring biography that ends well before she's sworn in as a Supreme Court justice. The wonderful Armie Hammer plays her husband. Associated Press
'Oscar Nominated Short Films: Live Action, Animation, Documentary'
Live action: "Madre," Spain (19 minutes); "Fauve," Canada (17 minutes); "Marguerite," Canada (19 minutes); "Detainment," Ireland (30 minutes); "Skin," U.S. (20 minutes). Animation: "Bao," U.S. (8 minutes); "Late Afternoon," Ireland (10 minutes); "Animal Behaviour," Canada (14 minutes); "Weekends," U.S. (16 minutes); "One Small Step," U.S. (8 minutes). Documentary: "Black Sheep," U.K. (27 minutes); "End Game," U.S. (40 minutes); "Lifeboat," U.S. (40 minutes); "A Night at the Garden," U.S. (7 minutes); "Period. End of Sentence.," India (26 minutes). Not reviewed.
'Roma' ****
R - 2:15 - Masterful drama by Alfonso CuarÃ³n is based on his memories of growing up in a bourgeois Mexico City household in the 1970s, shot through with vivid sensory cues that pulse with delight, sensuality and sadness. Washington Post
'Second Act' **
PG-13 - 1:43 - In a mashup of "Working Girl" and "Maid in Manhattan," Jennifer Lopez plays a woman who's passed over for a promotion at a big-box store and lands an interview at a multinational cosmetics firm -- thanks to an impressive resume cooked up by her teenage godson. Good cast; nearly hopeless script. Chicago Tribune
'Smallfoot' **½
PG - 1:36 - In a reverse-Bigfoot tale, a happy-go-lucky Himalayan Yeti (voiced by Channing Tatum) finds evidence of humans. It's predictable, but the journey is worth watching. Tribune News Service
'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' ****
PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post
'Stan & Ollie' ***½
PG - 1:37 - Barely recognizable Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly star in a generous, warmhearted film about the comic duo of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Directed by Jon S. Baird. Washington Post
'A Star Is Born' ***½
R - 2:17 - Bradley Cooper makes his directorial debut with a lavishly delightful remake that stars Lady Gaga as an unknown singer who becomes a pop sensation. Washington Post
'They Shall Not Grow Old' ****
R - 1:39 - Director Peter Jackson's immersive, haunting and often transcendent film about World War I is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Made with restored, colorized footage from the Imperial War Museum. Associated Press
'The Upside' One-half star
PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'Vice' *½
R - 2:12 - Christian Bale nails it as Dick Cheney, plotting his rise from a misdirected young man in Wyoming to one of the most notorious gray eminences in American politics. But the rest of the movie, written and directed by Adam McKay, is an absurd mess. Washington Post
'What Men Want' *
R - 1:57 - Taraji P. Henson tries a little too hard in a predictable, gender-switching remake of the 2000 romantic comedy "What Women Want." This time, a woman unlocks the power to read men's minds. Associated Press

Texto completo: UPPER NYACK - Jefferson Crowther, the father of 9/11 hero Welles Crowther, known as "the man in the red bandanna," died Feb. 13. He was 73.
The cause was prostate cancer, said Alison Crowther, his wife of 47 years. He is also survived by his daughters, Honor Fagan and Paige Charbonneau, and their families.
Jeff and Alison Crowther repeatedly shared their son's story of heroism on Sept. 11, 2001 to inspire leadership and character development. They helped establish the Red Bandanna Project and a family foundation, the Welles Remy Crowther Charitable Trust, toward that mission.
"He was a great protector," Alison Crowther said. "He was always taking care of me and our family, a wonderful father and husband. He was a gentleman with a wonderful sense of humor, which is what attracted me to him. He was very funny."
A father's inspiration Jeff Crowther was his son's inspiration for joining the fire service that provided the training to save so many during the 2001 terrorist attacks, and for carrying the red bandanna that came to symbolize his heroism.
Welles had joined his father as a volunteer firefighter at Upper Nyack's Empire Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.
The kerchief tradition was established when Welles was just 7. One day before church, Welles asked if he could have a handkerchief like the one his father had, a white pocket square in his coat pocket.
The elder Crowther came back with a pocket square, but also with a red bandanna. He pointed to the white one: "That's for show," he said. Then, pointing to the red bandanna, he said: "This is for blow, to blow your nose."
From that day on, Welles was never without his red bandanna. (Jeff preferred a blue bandanna.)
On Sept. 11, as the World Trade Center's South Tower filled with smoke and fire, Welles, who worked as an equities trader on the 104th floor, covered his face with a red bandanna as he led others through smoke and fire, and down the only working stairwell. He is credited with saving the lives of at least 10 people. The last anyone saw of him, he was preparing to rush back up that staircase. His body was eventually found at the FDNY command center in the South Tower lobby, with the remains of other firefighters.
Jeff Crowther later said when he was going through Welles' belongings after his death, he found an application for the FDNY.
A bond ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi got to know Jeff and Alison Crowther when he wrote "The Man in the Red Bandanna," a 13-minute TV piece for ESPN about Welles. Rinaldi then expanded it into a 2016 book of the same name.
Rinaldi said Jeff Crowther and his son had "the bond we as fathers all hope for."
"We dream that two things happen: That, as they age, they make us proud, and that they grow from son to friend. And both those things happened between Jefferson and Welles," Rinaldi said.
Boston College, Welles' alma mater, would embrace his legacy with an annual Red Bandanna football game. Rinaldi said Jeff's locker room visits at those games meant the world to him.
"Seeing Jeff talking to those young men, there is such joy and pride in his voice," Rinaldi said. "I think those were some of the richest, greatest moments in his life, after having lost Welles, because I think he felt like he was looking at other young men that he hoped would be like his son, would embody his values, would be living, breathing reflections of his only son."
Show of strength Jeff Crowther did not hide his pain from the loss of his son. "He said things that people remember to this day, like: 'I still weep every day for my son. I just miss the pleasure of his company.' That hits everyone," Rinaldi said.
But Rinaldi said Crowther was by no means a broken man.
"He was a man who continued to be a great father to his daughters and then a grandfather to his grandchildren. He continued to embrace life. He had a tremendous sense of humor. He had great sports passions. He continued his life even though there was this enormous hole in his heart. If that's not strength, I don't know what is."
Early life Jefferson Crowther was born Aug. 30, 1945, weeks after the end of World War II.
He grew up in White Plains, the son of Florence and Bosley Crowther. His father was film critic for The New York Times from 1940 to 1967. His mother was influential in creating Ridgeway Elementary School in the growing suburb.
Crowther graduated from The George School, a Quaker prep school in Pennsylvania, and earned a business degree from New York University. He served in the U.S. Navy, and was later a member of American Legion Post 310 in Nyack.
He went into banking in Manhattan, where he worked for Chemical Bank, Bank of New York, US Trust and, finally, Sterling National. He retired July 31, 2018. He had been in struggling health for years, his wife said, from metastatic prostate cancer.
The couple, who met on a blind date on Sept. 11, 1968 — an anniversary that would come to mean something very different 33 years later — married on May 1, 1971. They first lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, where he became a Manhattan banker and she was a research assistant at Rockefeller University. They would eventually move to Chappaqua, Pomona and then to Upper Nyack.
A sense of duty Crowther joined Upper Nyack's Empire Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 in November 1985. He would serve as the company's treasurer and chaplain.
"He was the tillerman on the truck," his wife said, of the firefighter who steers the back of the long ladder truck. "It was a huge responsibility."
He had grown up around tillermen of a different sort, sailing the Long Island Sound and off Martha's Vineyard, where his family spent summers.
"He wanted to be buried in his Empire Hook and Ladder uniform," his wife said. "And his grandson, Beckett Jefferson Fagan, who is named for him, made a little friendship bracelet for his grandfather. He wore it till the moment he died."
A wake will be held from 4 to 8 p.m.Monday, Feb. 18, at Hannemann Funeral Home, 88 S. Broadway, Nyack. Empire Hook & Ladder will hold a firematic service at 7 p.m. at the funeral home. A memorial service takes place at 11 a.m. Friday, Feb. 22, at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave., Nyack.
The family is asking for donations in Jefferson Crowther's memory be made to the Welles Remy Crowther Charitable Trust, P.O. Box 780, Nyack, NY 10960.

DEMOCRATS, PLEASE STOP GROVELING TO TRIUMPH IN 2020, CARE LESS ABOUT PLEASING ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME

Texto completo: Kirsten Gillibrand confronted a piece of fried chicken in South Carolina over the weekend. She began to eat it with a fork, realized that others around her were using their hands, asked if she should do likewise and ditched the utensils. Reading the reports of this, you got the sense that she would have grabbed that chicken with her pinkie toes if she'd been told to; she would have sucked it through a very large straw if those were the cues. Anything to conform. Anything to please.
Cory Booker, in Iowa, fielded a question by a reporter representing a foreign news organization. "Puedes hablar español?" he responded, misidentifying the reporter's accent. The reporter corrected Mr. Booker: "No, Swiss radio." "Swiss!" Mr. Booker exulted. "I do not speak Swiss. I cannot even say Swiss cheese in Swiss." Vegan humor? Mr. Booker is a vegan. He's also pathetically eager to connect.
Memo to Democratic presidential candidates: Stop it. Just stop it. Lose the sycophancy. Reclaim your dignity. Eat chicken however you naturally would. Don't invent languages - there's no such tongue as Swiss - just to win points.
It's good to be relatable, and a little humor, if unforced, goes a long way. But there's a line between courting and groveling, between reaching out and rolling over. And in this early stage of the 2020 campaign, Ms. Gillibrand, Mr. Booker and too many other contenders for their party's presidential nomination may be losing sight of it.
Have they learned nothing from Donald Trump? I'm not suggesting that he's some shining model and sagacious tutor, but he did go farther in politics than he had any right to, and a few of the reasons are worth considering and maybe even emulating, if only out of pragmatism. One of those is the impression he gave - or maybe I should say the illusion he wove - of not caring too much about what people thought. If they were shocked, so be it. If they were offended, boohoo. He was his own gilded man, going his own grotesque way.
And a consequential percentage of voters respected that. They recast his obnoxiousness as authenticity, interpreted his infantilism as independence and gave him their support because he didn't seem to be prostrating himself for it (though, in many senses, he was).
Elizabeth Warren should take note. Actually, she should have taken note before that cringe-worthy Instagram Live video in which she decides - on the spur of the moment! - to grab a beer from her refrigerator and coos appreciatively when her husband pops by, as if his appearance in the kitchen of the home they share is some splendid surprise. She wants to show how cuddly and unpretentious she can be. But it comes across as a performance. So it communicates tentativeness rather than certainty, weakness instead of strength.
The rapidly growing field of Democratic candidates is packed with impressive talent. But right now it's also lousy with obsequiousness. The contenders are engaged in a frenzy of contrition for mistakes and insufficiently progressive positions past, and while there's laudable humility (along with plentiful calculation) in that, it sometimes has a desperate ring.
Social-media posts that are meant to convey accessibility, transparency and charm can come across as stagy and needy. And there's a rush to promise Democratic primary voters anything and everything they want.
No candidate has had a more successful rollout than that of Kamala Harris, who was terrific in a widely watched CNN town hall. But she got tangled in her statements and then clarifications about her position on Medicare for all. Yes, she was OK with the abolition of private insurance. No, wait, she saw no reason that it had to go away. She chose Door No. 1 and Door No. 2. Which isn't necessarily evasive: A politician can be amenable to several fixes and solutions, some grander than others. But still she seemed intent on not losing the love of even one voter.
Most of the Democratic candidates, including her, have rallied behind the Green New Deal, a profoundly progressive resolution with a set of environmental and economic goals so sweeping and idealistic as to be politically fantastical. It's an admirable way of recognizing the direness of climate change and of reaching so high that coming up short would still be meaningful improvement. But many of these candidates' quickness to embrace it without qualification has as much to do with indulgence as with leadership.
Democrats' willingness to search their souls, admit error and think expansively and inclusively is beyond refreshing. But too much self-flagellation and genuflection can look foolish and smack of fakery.
Watch the measure of saccharine; add several teaspoons of salt. Consider Nancy Pelosi. She's having a moment in part because she's speaking bluntly and not afraid to ruffle feathers. She helped lead the party to triumph last year. She can point the way to an even more important triumph in 2020.

Texto completo: XPO Logistics will close a Memphis warehouse where employees had complained about widespread discrimination and a number of pregnant workers had miscarriages.
The company said it would close the site because Verizon, whose cellphones and other products XPO ships from the warehouse, had decided to stop using the facility. The moves followed a New York Times report into working conditions there.
More than 400 XPO employees will lose their jobs. "Our presence in the Memphis community remains strong, and we have new jobs available for the majority of these employees in our 11 other local facilities," Lissa Perlman, an XPO spokeswoman, said in a statement on Thursday.
Rich Young, a Verizon spokesman, said the company would continue to work with XPO at other sites. "We're constantly evaluating the needs of our business and make adjustments accordingly," he said. "There is nothing unique about this transition."
The Teamsters union, which has been trying to organize workers at the warehouse, said the closing was retaliation against employees who publicized incidents of sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination. The group's organizing efforts there have been underway since 2017, when a worker collapsed and died of cardiac arrest on the warehouse floor.
In October, The Times reported that six women had miscarriages after lifting heavy boxes at the warehouse and being denied breaks from physically intense work. Some of the episodes occurred while the warehouse was operated by another company, New Breed Logistics, which XPO bought in 2014.
Workers at the site lift boxes weighing up to 45 pounds. The facility does not have air-conditioning, and indoor temperatures in the summer can rise past 100 degrees.
"They are just cutting and running and closing the place instead of addressing the problem of pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment," Jim Hoffa, the Teamsters president, said in an interview. Mr. Hoffa said the Teamsters were considering filing a formal complaint about the warehouse's closing with the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that handles labor disputes.
Lakeisha Nelson, an employee at the XPO facility, has been vocal about conditions there. "The warehouse is closing because management chose to run this place like it's their personal plantation, rather than running it like it's a company," she said Thursday.
After The Times published its article, nine senators wrote to XPO and Verizon demanding that the companies address the allegations. Two weeks later, nearly 100 members of the House called for an investigation by its Committee on Education and the Workforce into working conditions at the facility.
In a statement on Thursday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the senators who organized the letter to the companies, said the move "reeks of retaliation."
Federal law prohibits employers from firing workers or closing a facility to punish employees for organizing a union or for collectively complaining about workplace conditions.
XPO said previously that it had asked an independent law firm to look into the pregnancy accommodation issues, and it announced new policies for accommodating pregnant workers in addition to more generous parental leave.
In a letter sent to employees on Wednesday, XPO told workers that their "employment will terminate during a two-week period commencing on April 15, 2019."
XPO and Verizon said their decisions were unrelated to the Times article or efforts to organize workers.

El Chapo's New Home May Be the Notorious 'Supermax' in Colorado

Texto completo: In the coming months, as the infamous drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera is finally sentenced and put behind bars, his American jailers will confront a question that long bedeviled their counterparts in Mexico: Given Mr. Guzmán's Houdini-like talent for breaking out of prison -- a trick he pulled off twice -- where, and under what conditions, should he be incarcerated?
Ultimately, prison officials will make that decision, but lawyers for the kingpin known as El Chapo warned him after his conviction this week on drug conspiracy charges that he is likely to be sent to the country's most forbidding federal lockup, the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., often referred to as the ADX. More colloquially known as the Alcatraz of the Rockies, the ADX was meant to be both punitive and escape-proof, a penal fortress where inmates spend 23 hours a day inside their cells with little human contact and only one window, three feet high and four inches wide.
"This place is not designed for humanity," Robert Hood, a former warden, once told The New York Times. "It's not designed for rehabilitation. Period. End of story."
Opened in 1994 on a barren stretch of semiarid desert 40 miles south of Colorado Springs, the ADX for decades has served as the final destination for a roll call of prominent criminals.
Terry L. Nichols -- Inmate No. 08157-031 -- who acted as an accomplice in the Oklahoma City bombing is imprisoned there. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- No. 95079-038 -- is also at the prison, awaiting execution for his role in the Boston Marathon bombings. Other renowned offenders who were once in the headlines are held there, too: Theodore J. Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber; Robert P. Hanssen, an F.B.I. agent who spied for the Russians; and Ramzi Yousef, who attacked the World Trade Center in 1993.
Eric Robert Rudolph, who carried out a spate of bombings in the '90s, including one at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, wrote of the ADX in an essay in 2008 that even when its prisoners were let outside their cells, the surroundings were severe.
"No mountain, bush, tree or blade of grass is visible from the yard, just the sky," Mr. Rudolph wrote. "The cages have just enough room to do aerobic exercises. Other than the opportunity to breathe fresh air and feel the sunshine on your skin, the outside cages are just cells that are open to the sky."
Inside the prison, Mr. Rudolph and others familiar with the ADX have said, conditions were equally grim, with nearly every part of its 500 cells made of poured concrete. Religious services are broadcast on closed-circuit television, as are most educational programs. The showers are halting, the water flowing for a minute at a time and only after prisoners push a button.
"You may find it necessary to depress the On/Off button frequently during the duration of your shower," inmates are advised in their admission and orientation handbook.
Unpleasant as all this may sound, Mr. Guzmán has in a sense been prepared for the ordeal, having spent the two years since his extradition to New York housed in 10 South, the gloomy maximum security wing of the federal jail in Lower Manhattan. There, he has been kept in isolation and almost incommunicado, denied all visits except from his lawyers and his young twin daughters. The conditions are harsh enough that late last winter the kingpin sent a letter to Judge Brian M. Cogan complaining that he suffered daily headaches, regularly vomited and had persistent sinus problems because of the stifling air.
"The light in my cell is on all hours of the day," Mr. Guzmán added, "and it is difficult for me to sleep."
Mr. Guzmán's lawyers agree that life at 10 South, where the kingpin will stay at least until his sentencing on June 25, may be worse than at the ADX (which is also called the supermax.) One of the lawyers, A. Eduardo Balarezo, said this week that the food in Colorado would be better and that Mr. Guzmán would have more things to do there "besides stare at the walls."
Jeffrey Lichtman, another lawyer for the kingpin, said that the Manhattan jail has "the most extreme conditions I've ever seen and that any criminal defendant in America has faced."
"While the supermax is onerous," Mr. Lichtman added, "I know it's not worse than what he's already experienced."
Some defense lawyers in death penalty cases have used the conditions at the ADX to reassure jurors that defendants who were spared execution would not serve their life sentences in luxury.
"It's very antiseptic and silent compared to what you expect in a prison," said David I. Bruck, who defended Mr. Tsarnaev. "People are just locked away behind these solid steel doors, and there's very little going on, very little movement, very little activity. It's a lot of nothing."
Officials at the ADX count prisoners seven times a day -- at 12:01 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 11 a.m., 4 p.m., 8 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. -- even though the inmates are rarely moved between counts. The inmates are allowed to spend $285 a month at the commissary, where pepperoni slices coast $2.40 and Cheetos can be had for $1.90. Weight-lifting gloves are available for $10.40. Meals, mail and medicine are all delivered.
"Everything the inmate needs comes and goes through the door slot," Mr. Rudolph wrote, adding that "the basic setup is for long-term solitary confinement."
"The purpose," he maintained, "is to gradually tear a person down mentally and physically, through environmental and physical deprivation."

Texto completo: The Baltimore Ravens agreed to trade veteran quarterback Joe Flacco to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a fourth-round pick in this year's NFL Draft, a person with knowledge of the agreement told the Associated Press. Flacco, the MVP of the 2013 Super Bowl following a miraculous win at top-seeded Denver, became expendable in Baltimore with the emergence of rookie Lamar Jackson , the former Louisville star who led the Ravens into the playoffs after Flacco got hurt . . . The Houston Texans released veteran wide receiver Demaryius Thomas , whose 2018 season ended prematurely when he tore his left Achilles' tendon.
. . . Place kicker Josh Lambo signed a four-year contract extension with the Jacksonville Jaguars, keeping him from hitting free agency next month . . .
AAF ratings solid in debut
The Alliance of American Football was a ratings winner in its inaugural weekend. The games Saturday on CBS averaged 3.25 million viewers, which was more than ABC's broadcast of the Houston Rockets against the Oklahoma City Thunder (2.67 million), according to Nielsen.
However, the broadcasts Saturday from San Antonio and Orlando will be the only games on CBS until the championship game on April 27 in Las Vegas.
Emmitt Thomas announced his retirement Tuesday as the defensive backs coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, ending an NFL career that began as a Hall of Fame player and wound up spanning five decades.
Basketball
BC no match for Notre Dame
Arike Ogunbowale scored 23 points to move into second place on Notre Dame's all-time scoring list, and the sixth-ranked Fighting Irish women's team (23-3, 10-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) coasted to a 97-47 victory over Boston College at Conte Forum. Taylor Soule led BC (14-11, 3-9) with 11 points . . . The Boston University women (12-10, 8-4 Patriot League) earned their fourth straight win on the road, beating Colgate (9-13, 5-7), 61-53, in Hamilton, N.Y. Payton Hauck scored 22 points for the Terriers . . . Led by sophomore Javante McCoy's game-high 19 points, the Boston University men's team (11-15, 4-9 Patriot League) cut a double-digit deficit to one possession on multiple occasions in the second half but was unable to get past Army (12-4, 7-6) in a 71-61 loss at West Point, N.Y. It was a season sweep (2-0) of the Terriers for the Black Knights, who were led by Tommy Funk's 17 points . . . NBA center Enes Kanter joined the Portland Trail Blazers. Kanter was waived by the New York Knicks along with Wesley Matthews following the trade deadline last week.
. . . Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said he had “no knowledge" of a woman's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by a former Blue Devils player. He believes the school should and will investigate. Lawyer Nancy Erika Smith has said her client, Meredith Watson, was raped by a player while she was a student at Duke. The New York Times and other publications have identified the player as Corey Maggette , who has denied the allegation. Watson also has said that Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her when they were students at Duke.
Baseball
Nola gets $45m from Phillies
Pitcher Aaron Nola and the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to a $45 million, four-year contract, avoiding salary arbitration. The 25-year-old righthander set career bests last season when he was a first-time All-Star, going 17-6 with a 2.37 ERA . . . Shohei Ohtani wouldn't change how he handled his elbow injury late last year, continuing to hit for the Los Angeles Angels until season's end even if it meant delaying reconstructive surgery and his ability to pitch again until 2020. The reigning AL Rookie of the Year is recovering from an Oct. 1 Tommy John surgery with the hope he will be able to bat in the Los Angeles lineup as early as May if all stays on schedule . . . Trevor Bauer , Gerrit Cole and Alex Wood won their salary arbitration cases, giving players a 6-3 advantage over teams to ensure a winning record in consecutive years for the first time since 1989-90. Bauer won his hearing for the second straight year and was awarded $13 million instead of the Indians' $11 million offer. Cole was given a $13.5 million salary rather than the Astros' offer of $11.4 million. Wood will get $9.65 million instead of the Reds' $8.7 million offer . . . Doug Fister , a reliable righthander for the Detriot Tigers' dominant rotations in the early years of this decade, is retiring. Fister pitched 18 games and started 15 for the Red Sox in 2017, going 5-9 with a 4.88 ERA.
. . . Catcher Caleb Joseph and the Arizona Diamondbacks agreed to a one-year contract that calls for a $1.1 million salary in the major leagues and a $250,000 salary in the minors.

Garcia apologizes for damage
Sergio Garcia apologized in a statement and in person to the players in his group when he damaged five greens at the Saudi International tournament. "I'm sure I'm going to hear it throughout the year," Garcia said in his first interview since he was disqualified Feb. 2 for the damage he did to five greens out of frustration early in the third round. Garcia is playing in the PGA's Genesis Open this week.

HOW THE LEFT EMBRACED ELITISM GREEN-NEW-DEAL-STYLE CENTRALIZATION OF POWER ISN'T THE WAY TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS

Texto completo: Over the past generation, global capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in human poverty in history. Over the past 10 years, American capitalism has produced 20 million new jobs. The productive dynamism of capitalism is truly a wonder to behold.
But economic growth alone is not enough. Growth alone does not translate into economic security for the middle class and the less skilled. Growth alone does nothing to reverse the social decay afflicting communities across America.
This reality is transforming the political debate - and shifting everything leftward. Among conservatives, there is now a bevy of thinkers who are trying to find ways to use government to reduce inequality, promote work and restore community.
For example, in the lead essay of the conservative journal National Affairs, Abby M. McCloskey notes that the family you are born into and the neighborhood you live in have a much stronger influence on your socioeconomic outcome than any other factors. Her essay is an outstanding group of proposals designed to strengthen family and neighborhood.
Pell grants could be used to pay for vocational and apprenticeship training and not just for college. The federal government could support a voluntary national service program by paying people, once in their lifetime, to work for a year at a local nonprofit. The tax code could be tweaked so that people with no income tax liability could receive a cash credit for making charitable donations.
These proposals are activist but humble. It's not the federal government centrally deciding how to remake your community. It's giving communities and people the resources to take responsibility and assume power for themselves.
As many conservatives have shifted leftward, so have progressives. From Bill Clinton through Barack Obama, Democrats respected market forces but tried to use tax credits and regulations to steer them in more humane ways. Obamacare was an effort to expand and reform private health insurance markets.
That Democratic Party is ending. Today, Democrats are much more likely to want government to take direct control. This is the true importance of the Green New Deal, which is becoming the litmus test of progressive seriousness. I don't know if it is socialism or not socialism - that's a semantic game - but it would definitely represent the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.
The resolution is unabashed about this, celebrating and calling for more "federal government-led mobilizations." Under the Green New Deal, the government would provide a job to any person who wanted one. The government would oversee the renovation of every building in America. The government would put sector after sector under partial or complete federal control: the energy sector, the transportation system, the farm economy, capital markets, the health care system.
The authors liken their plan to the New Deal, but the real parallel is to World War II. It is the state mobilizing as many of society's resources as possible to wage a war on global warming and other ills. The document is notably coy about how all this would be implemented. Exactly which agency would inspect and oversee the renovation of every building in America? Exactly which agency would hire every worker?
But the underlying faith of the Green New Deal is a faith in the guiding wisdom of the political elite. The authors of the Green New Deal assume that technocratic planners can master the movements of 328 million Americans and design a transportation system so that "air travel stops becoming necessary." (This is from people who couldn't even organize the successful release of their own background document.)
They assume that congressional leaders have the ability to direct what in effect would be gigantic energy firms and gigantic investment houses without giving sweetheart deals to vested interests, without getting corrupted by this newfound power, without letting the whole thing get swallowed up by incompetence. (This is a Congress that can't pass a budget.)
If this were ever put into practice, there would have to be several new Pentagons built to house the hundreds of thousands of new social planners. The elite universities would have to be transformed into technocratic academies in which the children of the rich were trained so they could be dirigistes for the state.
The authors of this fantasy are right that we need to do something about global warming and inequality. But simple attempts to realign incentives, like a carbon tax, would be more effective and more realistic than government efforts to reorganize vast industries.In an alienated America, efforts to decentralize power are more effective and realistic than efforts to concentrate it in the Washington elite. The great paradox of progressive populism is that it leads to elitism.
The impulse to create a highly centralized superstate recurs throughout American history. There were people writing such grand master plans in the 1880s, the 1910s, the 1930s. They never work out. As Richard Weaver once put it, the problem with the next generation is that it hasn't read the minutes of the last meeting.

The interracial love story that stunned Washington society - twice! - in 1867

Texto completo: The wedding was a shock before it even began. In 1867, the nation's capital learned that Minnie Sackett, the daughter of a prominent Civil War colonel, was engaged. Sackett was considered to be "one of the most beautiful women in the District," according to the New York Tribune, with her high-neck lace collars and brunette ringlets piled atop her head.
Her soon-to-be husband, 39-year-old Ely S. Parker, had served in the Union Army as the private secretary to then-Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. It was Parker who drafted the terms of surrender that ended the war in 1865. So close was their friendship that Grant himself planned to escort the bride, whose father had died, down the aisle at Washington's Episcopal Church of the Epiphany.
Why was their betrothal controversial? "It may not be generally known that Col. Parker is a full-blooded Indian," the Tribune reported. "A near relative to the famous Red Jacket and of the present Chief of the six nations Cherokees."
One hundred years before the Supreme Court would make interracial marriage legal throughout the country, a white woman was marrying an Indian man.
In other places south of the Mason-Dixon Line, the news might have sparked riots. In Washington, it was high-society gossip.
Parker was already a well-known figure in the capital because of his role in the war and connection to Grant. He was born a Seneca Indian on the Tonawanda Reservation in western New York, where he was called Hasanoanda, or "Leading Name." Hasanoanda grew up to become "an American Indian who chose to live his life in the white man's world," biographer William Armstrong wrote. Hasanoanda preferred to go by Ely Parker. He trained in engineering and the law - though the New York Bar wouldn't admit him - and always dressed himself in "a fine frock coat."
This earned Parker a level of respect that was not granted to others of his heritage at the time. Newspapers referred to him as the "honorable" or "gallant" Col. Parker. But a few paragraphs later, they would call him "the red man."
"Parker may have looked like an Indian, but to the viewing public, he certainly did not act like what they expected from one," historian Joseph Genetin-Pilawa once wrote in the Journal of Women's History. "While the reporters would continue to romanticize his Indian identity, the tone of their rhetoric was such that it was clear he posed no real threat to the racial hierarchy."
It is unclear where Parker met Sackett, who was two decades younger. The New York Tribune reported that the couple had been dating for months and "would have been married long ago had it not been for the objections of Miss Sackett's friends." The content of those objections was obvious to any reader.
Washington was not content only to gossip about the wedding. Its residents came to see it for themselves. On Dec. 17, the Church of the Epiphany was crammed with onlookers. Sackett donned her wedding gown, and Grant arrived.
But the groom never showed.
"The great topic of conversation in Washington tonight," reported the New York Tribune, "to the exclusion of everything else in politics, finance, reconstruction or impeachment, is the disappointment of a fashionable young lady who was to have been wedded this morning in the presence of the crème de la crème of Washington society."
"The scene which ensued when it became known that Col. Parker could not be found, can be faintly imagined, but the pen fails to describe it fitly," the New York Times proclaimed. "Messengers were dispatched to the usual resorts of the missing one, and when the report came that all search was in vain, the audience quietly dispersed with many heartfelt prayers for the lady so cruelly deserted. All search to-day has proved fruitless, but up to a late hour to-night no tidings of Col. Parker have been received."
Rumors abounded: Parker had been found beneath the ice on the Potomac, or maybe he had fled back to New York to marry someone else. A fellow Union Army officer suggested Parker had just gotten too drunk to show up. The Washington Evening Star reported he had simply caught a bad cold. "He is very much indisposed, and on Sunday was unable to leave his bed," the paper said.
But other reports revealed a more sinister story. The night before the wedding, Parker went on a walk. "In the course of it, he met an Indian," the New York Tribune claimed, "The Indian took him to a room, gave him a glass of wine, and sat down to converse upon the important business which he wished to see him about. In a short time Col. Parker began to feel drowsy, and concluded he would lie down on the bed a moment. He did so, and fell into a deep sleep."
The story offered an explanation of why another Indian had come to drug the groom: "Col. Parker's friends think the Six Nations are opposed to his marrying a white lady, and that they sent an envoy to take care that the wedding should not take place."
Genetin-Pilawa studied the news coverage of the wedding that wasn't. He concluded the newspaper reporter may have been projecting his own "notions of racial difference."
"He could have applied the potential anxieties of the Washington elite onto the Seneca leaders to fabricate this story," Genetin-Pilawa wrote in 2008 .
A few days later, Parker reemerged. The true reason for his disappearance has never been confirmed. But the explanation he provided must have been satisfactory for his fiancee. To many's surprise, the couple rescheduled the wedding. The Evening Star reported that the ceremony was set to take place on the morning of Christmas Eve.
The church, which remains open in Washington, was once again overflowing. "The scene was ludicrous in the extreme," the New York Herald reported. "Outside thee Epiphany church, on G street, a very promiscuous and very silly looking assemblage was gathered."
Men and women arrived so early to jostle for front-row pews that, when they sat down, the wedding decorations were still being hung, or so they thought. The crowd was soon informed that the decorations were in fact for Christmas Mass. The Parker-Sackett nuptials had already happened - in a quiet, private ceremony the night before.

Texto completo: Childish Gambino's "This Is America" became the first rap song to win Record of the Year at the prestigious Grammy Awards held in Los Angeles last Sunday.
The artist whose legal name is Donald Glover wasn't even at the Grammys to accept his award, which also included three more on the evening.
The multi-hyphenate artist was nominated for five Grammy awards and won four of them. Not just any four plough, the rapper won awards for Best Music Video, Song of the Year, Best Rap/Sung Performance and Record of the Year, for "This Is America." According to Billboard, it was the first rap song to win
Record of the Year and Song of the Year.
It was a huge history-making night for Glover, and everyone was there to witness it except for the man of the hour himself.
The 35-year-old rapper, who is also a comedian, was nowhere to be found on Grammy Sunday even though he was spotted just a couple days prior at Ludwig Göransson's pre-Grammy party days before. He was even pictured debuting his new blond beard. Maybe this was all a joke? Or a statement like the one he made with the "This is America" video?
Glover declined a performance spot for the Grammys, producer Ken Ehrlich told The New York Times.

Texto completo: Last month, BuzzFeed laid off more than 220 employees, or 15 percent of its work force. On Tuesday, employees at the company's news division responded with the announcement that they planned to form a union.
"It's not all fun and memes," the organizing committee said in a statement. "Our staff has been organizing for several months, and we have legitimate grievances about unfair pay disparities, mismanaged pivots and layoffs, weak benefits, skyrocketing health insurance costs, diversity and more."
More than 40 of those who lost their jobs in the recent layoffs worked in the company's bureaus in New York, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The cuts included all seven members of the BuzzFeed News national desk and six members of its nine-person national security team
BuzzFeed's revenue grew by more than 15 percent in 2018, but that gain wasn't enough to stave off the decision by its founder, Jonah Peretti, to reduce the number of employees. In an email to the staff before the firings, Mr. Peretti wrote, "Unfortunately, revenue growth by itself isn't enough to be successful in the long run."
Murmurs of a union started among company employees in 2015, when a group of staff members met with the NewsGuild of New York to discuss the issue of pay disparity, particularly in regards to women and employees of color. The group continued the effort last fall, when more than 50 employees participated in a meeting at the NewsGuild office.
The job losses have further motivated the organizers, according to Dominic Holden, a politics reporter at BuzzFeed News and a member of the organizing committee. Davey Alba, a senior technology reporter, said, by her own estimation, "about 90 percent" of eligible BuzzFeed employees supported the idea.
A BuzzFeed spokesman did not immediately comment on the organizing effort. Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement: "We look forward to meeting with the organizers to discuss a way toward voluntarily recognizing their union."
BuzzFeed workers have already had some success in challenging management. Days after the layoff, roughly 600 current and former employees signed an open letter posted on Medium that pushed Mr. Peretti and other executives to compensate the laid-off staff members for unused vacation and comp days as part of their exit packages.
It worked. Hours after the letter was published, Mr. Peretti notified the staff that he would grant the request.
So far, the union effort involves only employees at BuzzFeed News, the division of the company led by the editor Ben Smith.
If the company recognizes the union, a certification with the NewsGuild would follow, along with a negotiation of who would be covered under any contract.
If BuzzFeed doesn't recognize the union, the organizers said they would hold a union election with an official from the National Labor Relations Board present to facilitate a secret ballot.
"I am confident in management," Ms. Alba said. "I think that they will voluntarily recognize it."
Workers at BuzzFeed News are the latest digital media employees to pursue a union effort. So far this year, Vice Media, affiliated with the Writers Guild of America, East, has expanded the number of employees counted as union members, and employees at Refinery29 organized a union, also under the Writers Guild banner.
Last year, employees at The New Yorker and New York magazine formed unions with the NewsGuild of New York. In both cases, management voluntarily recognized the organizing efforts.
According to a report in the Harvard Business Review, 30 digital news sites and newspapers have recognized unions since 2015. "In total, the number of unionized workers in internet publishing has risen 20-fold since 2010," the report said.
Mr. Peretti is on the record opposing the idea. In 2015, he said, "I don't think a union is right for BuzzFeed."
In an interview with The New York Times in November, Mr. Peretti floated a solution to the volatile economic landscape now affecting digital media companies: a series of mergers among the top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine Media and Refinery29. Mr. Peretti reasoned that, if BuzzFeed and those companies were to unite, they would put themselves in a better position to negotiate favorable terms with powerful tech platforms like Facebook.
"He clearly understands the value of collective bargaining," Mr. Holden said. "And we agree with him that collective action is critical to securing an equitable agreement."

Texto completo: Tomi Ungerer, an award-winning artist and trilingual writer who leaped between genres and mediums, crafting works that included anti-Vietnam War posters, darkly comic children's books, a mischievous reworking of "The Joy of Sex" and a cat-shaped kindergarten building in Germany, died Feb. 8 at his daughter's home in Cork, Ireland. He was 87.
His daughter Aria Ungerer confirmed the death and said the precise date and cause were not known.
"He was in absolutely brilliant form in the past few days," she said, and was writing a collection of short stories "about his alter ego, Mr. Malparti."
Working primarily as a satirist, Mr. Ungerer published more than 140 books in German, French and English, including works of children's literature and a collection titled "Guardian Angels of Hell" (1986), featuring interviews with sex workers at a Hamburg bordello. He was also a sculptor, printmaker, painter, caricaturist and antique toy collector, an ad man for the Ice Capades and a onetime food editor for Playboy magazine.
For the New York State Lottery in the late 1960s, he devised a slogan, "Expect the Unexpected," that echoed a saying by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus and was later used by the paper Village Voice. For the German city of Karlsruhe, four decades later, he designed a kindergarten in the shape of a white cat, with a whiskered nose, windows for eyes, a door for a mouth and a slide for a tail.
"No one, I dare say, no one was as original," his friend Maurice Sendak, author of "Where the Wild Things Are," told the New York Times in 2008. "Tomi influenced everybody."
Raised in the Alsace region of France, Mr. Ungerer lived under Nazi occupation and hitchhiked across Europe before moving to New York City in 1956. He found work as an illustrator for publications including the New York Times, Life and Harper's Bazaar, while creating posters for movies such as Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" (1964) and briefly sharing an apartment with novelist Philip Roth.
But he became best known for his children's books, including the illustrations for Jeff Brown's 1964 classic, "Flat Stanley," about a boy who is crushed flat by a bulletin board, slips inside envelopes to travel by mail, and restores himself to proper size with the aid of a bicycle pump.
Writing about outcast characters such as Emile the octopus and Crictor the boa constrictor, he received the Hans Christian Andersen Award, one of the highest honors in children's literature, in 1998. A biography prepared for the prize described Mr. Ungerer's picture books as "simple, wry and grotesque," adding: "You can go exploring in his pictures, bursting with color, with surprising details, silhouette effects, soft yet precise outlines, and changing, plastic forms."
Among his most celebrated works were "The Three Robbers" (1961), a moody, blue-hued tale of highway bandits who terrorize the countryside, and "Moon Man" (1966), in which the title character falls to Earth, enjoys its flowering landscapes, and is promptly thrown in prison, only to slip through the bars as he grows smaller as part of the lunar cycle.
While writing the children's books that made him famous, Mr. Ungerer began working on erotic art and designing political posters, including pieces that protested segregation and the Vietnam War. One 1967 image, titled "Eat," showed a disembodied hand force-feeding the Statue of Liberty to a yellow-skinned man; another, "Choice Not Chance," showed a pilot decorating the nose of his plane with images of crying children.
Mr. Ungerer's social life included poker games with the Cuban representative to the United Nations, and his political views seemed to catch the attention of federal investigators, particularly after he requested (and was denied) a permit to visit China.
In interviews, he often recalled being picked up by three FBI agents - or perhaps they were part of some other federal agency; he was never quite sure - and taken in for questioning after returning from a trip to France in 1960. He said they later tapped his phone and opened his mail.
For the most part, however, his political work was eclipsed by his erotic drawings, particularly those in "Fornicon," a self-published 1969 book that Times journalist Randy Kennedy described as "a nightmare vision of mechanized pleasure."
When Mr. Ungerer appeared at an American Library Association conference that year, according to one account in the New Yorker, he was inundated with questions from angry librarians, who asked how an illustrator of whimsical children's books could also depict graphic sex acts. Recalling the incident, Mr. Ungerer said he replied with an expletive, saying, "If people didn't [have sex], you wouldn't have any children, and without children, you would be out of work."
He was then effectively blacklisted in the United States, with many of his books removed from libraries and lost to American readers until about a decade ago, when Phaidon Press began reissuing his work. In Europe, his popularity soared; he sold millions of books in Germany and France. In 2007, a museum dedicated to his life and work opened in Strasbourg, France. The Council of Europe named him ambassador for childhood and education that same year.
He had, he told the Times, always espoused a belief that children had to be "respected" and more or less treated as adults.
"They understand the world, in their way. They understand adult language," he said. "There should not be a limit of vocabulary. In 'The Three Robbers' I don't use the word 'gun.' I say 'blunderbuss.' My goodness, isn't it more poetic?"
The youngest of four children, Jean-Thomas Ungerer was born in Strasbourg on Nov. 28, 1931. His father was an artist, engineer and designer of astronomical clocks who died when Tomi was 3; his mother moved the family to Logelbach, near the Alsatian city of Colmar. During the war years, he said, he was forced to join the Hitler Youth and dig trenches for the German army, and he filled his notebooks with battlefield scenes.
Mr. Ungerer failed his high school graduation exams - his headmaster was said to have described him in a school report as a "willfully perverse and subversive individualist" - and subsequently traveled to northern Finland. He served with the French camel cavalry in Algeria and slowly made his way to New York, with $60 in his pocket and a "trunk full of drawings and manuscripts."
A meeting with editor Ursula Nordstrom, of what was then Harper & Brothers, led to his first children's book, "The Mellops Go Flying" (1957), about a family of acrobatic French pigs. The book became a hit and spawned several sequels.
Mr. Ungerer moved to Nova Scotia after his spat with the librarians and settled in Ireland in 1976. His later books included "The Joy of Frogs" (1985), a comic sex manual for amphibians, and children's tales such as "Otto: The Autobiography of a Teddy Bear" (1999), about a stuffed bear in 1930s Germany.
His first two marriages ended in divorce. In 1971, he married Yvonne Wright. In addition to his wife, survivors include a daughter, Phoebe Ungerer, from an earlier marriage to Miriam Lancaster; three children from his third marriage, Aria Ungerer, Pascal Ungerer and Lukas Ungerer; a sister; and two grandchildren.
Mr. Ungerer was the subject of a 2012 documentary, "Far Out Isn't Far Enough," that took its title from a 1983 illustrated memoir about his years in Canada. The phrase, he said, referred to an artistic desire - even a necessity - to push ever further into the unknown.
"That's what's really fantastic about death; that's why death has to be welcomed," he said in a film clip published to his Twitter account after he died. "And when I die, I'll find out what's behind the far out. Maybe there's nothing, but nothing is fantastic, too. Because if you're faced with nothing, you can fill it up with your mind."

If necessary, Mark Whipple can perform almost any task on a football field [Derived Headline]

Texto completo: If necessary, Mark Whipple can perform almost any task on a football field.
You need chalk lines drawn on the field before a game? He's done that as a small-college coach.
How about something a little more challenging, such as winning a national championship? Did that at UMass in 1998.
Prepare a quarterback to go to and win the Super Bowl in his second season? That, too, when he mentored Ben Roethlisberger with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2005.
Finally, this one: Build relationships with his players and their families that last a lifetime? He saw that come to fruition when that championship UMass team returned last season for a 20-year reunion.
"I saw the kids come back married with children," said Whipple, who was back for his second coaching stint at UMass."But what really struck me is their parents came back. The effect you can have on a family, that was really broadening to me. We're going to try and do the same thing here."
The 'here' of which Whipple speaks is Pitt where he was recently hired to be coach Pat Narduzzi's fourth offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in five seasons.
His next undertaking: Perfect the game of junior-to-be quarterback Kenny Pickett.
In his first two seasons at Pitt, Pickett was partially crafted by Shawn Watson, who was fired at the end of last season when the passing game hit a dead end.
Narduzzi has high hopes for what Whipple can do with Pickett, who completed only 43.3 percent of his passes (29 of 67) for 274 yards, one interception and no touchdowns in the final three games against Miami, Clemson and Stanford. Total points: 26.
"I've always had the utmost respect on who he is, how he did his business, the relationships he had with his players," said Narduzzi, who played and coached against Whipple when he was at Rhode Island. "That guy turns quarterbacks to gold. It's his style. He brings a passing game that we definitely needed."
His secret to coaching quarterbacks? Whipple laughed and said, "Well, they have talent."
Whipple, 61, is an Ivy Leaguer with a degree in political science from Brown, but that's only part of what caught Narduzzi's attention.
He has worked for and along side some of biggest names in the NFL, including Bill Cowher and Dick LeBeau with Steelers, Andy Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles and George Allen and Roman Gabriel with the Arizona Wranglers of the USFL in 1984. Whipple said Gabriel was "a mentor to me."
Whipple was hired by the Steelers before the 2004 NFL Draft as their quarterbacks coach - after Brown classmate Chris Berman put in a good word - and said he got lucky when the Steelers drafted Roethlisberger.
The rookie quarterback started the season behind veteran Tommy Maddox, who was injured in the second game against the Baltimore Ravens. It was Whipple's responsibility to get his protégé ready immediately.
"We never expected Ben to play until Tommy got hurt," Whipple said last week. "I wasn't really ready for it. Thank, God, Ben was more ready than I was."
Roethlisberger took the Steelers to the AFC Championship Game that season and the Super Bowl in '05. There, Roethlisberger, who has not always had warm relationships with Steelers assistants, told the New York Times what Whipple meant to his early development.
"Coach Whip has been awesome with me," Roethlisberger said before Super Bowl XL. "He's not a big yeller, a ranting and raving guy, which is good for me. I like to just be able to talk to my coach, and he's been able to help me grow as a quarterback."
Roethlisberger said Whipple told him, "'I'm not going to try to change anything you do; just go out and play football.'"
Coaching quarterbacks seems to come naturally to Whipple.
"I played it in college, I called the plays in college, I called the plays a lot in high school," he said.
"I've been doing it for a long time. You get to know people and learn a lot. That's the great thing about this game. I've learned a lot just in the two weeks I've been (at Pitt). "
Maybe he does have a secret: "You try to individualize each quarterback and don't put those guys into a cookie cutter."
Whipple was with the Steelers until Cowher retired after the '06 season. He moved to the Eagles in 2008 and the Miami Hurricanes for the next two seasons, leading the offense to a total of 5,483 yards, third-most in program history.
After two years as the Cleveland Browns' quarterbacks coach, the Tarrytown, N.Y., native went back to UMass where he hoped to revive the program like he did in 1998.
The first time, he took a program that was 2-9 in 1997 and had won 19 games in four seasons and turned into a national champion in one year. The second time, from 2014-18, he had less success and parted ways after last season in a mutual agreement with the university.
Still, he won more games at UMass than any coach (65), setting the record, fittingly, in a 2017 victory against Maine at Fenway Park. Whipple, the Arizona high school player of the year in 1975, not only played quarterback at Brown, but some shortstop for the baseball team.
"I want to thank Mark for his commitment to our football program for 11 years,'' UMass athletic director Ryan Bamford said in a statement. "He came back to UMass when this program needed a strong leader and respected mentor.
"Mark provided the steady hand we needed in our early years as an FBS program and leaves our program in much better standing than when he came back in 2014."
But when he left UMass, he knew he wasn't ready to quit.
"My wife told me I have a lot more to give," he said. "I got into coaching because I want to help people. It wasn't I want to win a Super Bowl, I wanted to win a national championship. It was about helping people."
Finally, he accepted Narduzzi's job offer after spending, perhaps, too much time on the golf course.
"I was in Arizona, played enough golf," he said. "(Golf pro) Gary McCord told me, 'You're not good enough to play this game, get coaching.'
"So, that's what we're doing."

Texto completo: A lawyer for National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. 's CEO defended the company's correspondence with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, saying AMI did nothing illegal.
"It absolutely is not extortion and not blackmail," Elkan Abramowitz, attorney for AMI CEO David Pecker, said Sunday on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "
His comments came after Bezos published a blog post Thursday accusing AMI of attempting to blackmail him with threats to publish a trove of embarrassing photos, including some of a sexual nature.
The clash followed the Enquirer's previous publication of a report on Bezos' breakup with his wife and his romantic relationship with former Los Angeles news anchor Lauren Sanchez.
Bezos on Thursday posted emails in which AMI representatives offered to withhold publication of the embarrassing photos in exchange for Bezos acknowledging that the tabloid owner had no political motivation for publishing its original expose. Pecker has supported Donald Trump, and Trump has repeatedly criticized Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.
"That is not extortion because all that AMI wanted was the truth," Abramowitz told "This Week," adding that the company was making a "news decision" and that the Bezos correspondence "was part of a legitimate negotiation. "
AMI representatives declined to comment further Sunday on Abramowitz's remarks.
Among the accusations Bezos made was that Pecker and AMI have murky ties to the Saudi Arabian government, potentially through a pro-Saudi publication released in 2018.
More: Jeff Bezos accuses National Enquirer parent of 'extortion and blackmail' attempt
More: Feds investigating Jeff Bezos' claims, examining agreement that shielded AMI from criminal charges
More: National Enquirer owner responds to Bezos post, says it 'acted lawfully' in its reporting
More: Could Amazon's Bezos wreck AMI, owner of National Enquirer, with blackmail charges?
"The Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve," Bezos wrote.
The Bezos allegations came after AMI signed a non-prosecution agreement with the U. S. attorneys in connection with the government's investigation into Trump's presidential campaign.
If AMI is found to have committed a crime, the company would not be immune to prosecution, said Michael Conway, a lawyer who has represented media organizations such as the New York Times and ABC, and now teaches at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.
Conway said the AMI correspondence "certainly has the elements of blackmail," which would "blow up" the company's deal with the government.
Abramowitz said he's "absolutely not" concerned that the Bezos revelations could affect that agreement.
Stuart Karle, a former Dow Jones attorney and Reuters executive who teaches media law at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, said the situation is fraught with peril for American Media. But he said “it seems unlikely to me that whatever happened here” would “destroy” the company.
“There are a lot of steps between this kind of correspondence and a formal criminal charge,” he said.
However, “corporations can be destroyed by criminal charges” or can be forced into a sale to pay off liabilities in civil cases, he added.

Texto completo: But steadily, the nation began to liberalize. By 2018, 66 percent of U.S. residents offered their approval, transforming marijuana legalization from a libertarian fantasy into a mainstream cause. Many state laws have changed as well. Over the last quarter-century, 10 states have legalized recreational marijuana, while 22 states have legalized medical marijuana.
So why has public opinion changed dramatically in favor of legalization? In a study published this month, we examined a range of possible reasons, finding that the media likely had the greatest influence.
It's not about use, geography or demographics
Our study ruled out a few obvious possibilities.
For one, it's not about marijuana use. Yes, marijuana use has increased. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that, in 2002, about 10 percent of adults reported using marijuana the previous year. By 2015, 13.5 percent reported using. But that increase is too small to have had much of an impact on attitudes.
And it's not about older, more conservative Americans being replaced by younger generations who are more familiar with marijuana. Both younger and older people developed more liberal views about the legalization of marijuana at a similar pace over the last 30 years. In this way, changes in attitudes about marijuana legalization mirror recent increases in support for LGBTQ individuals.
We looked to see if people who lived in states where it was illegal, but resided next to ones where it became legal, were more likely to have changed their views. But the rate of change has been no different in states that legalized marijuana than in others.
Likewise, the pace of change has been similar across political parties, religions, educational levels, racial and ethnic groups and gender. As politically polarized as the country may seem, when it comes to marijuana, Americans have been changing their attitudes together, as a nation.
We did find that a small part of the increase in support was related to more people disaffiliating with religion. The proportion of people who do not identify with a religion has increased some, by about 7 percent between 2007 and 2014. People who do not have a religion tend to be more liberal than others. However, this factor accounts for only a small proportion of the change.
Media medical framing
So what's going on? What has likely made the biggest difference is how the media has portrayed marijuana. Support for legalization began to increase shortly after the news media began to frame marijuana as a medical issue.
We took The New York Times as a case study, looking at the number of published articles from 1983 to 2015 about marijuana. Just before the number of Americans supporting legalization began to increase, we found a sharp increase in the proportion of articles about marijuana that discussed its medical uses.
In the 1980s, the vast majority of New York Times stories about marijuana were about drug trafficking and abuse or other Schedule I drugs. At that time, The New York Times was more likely to lump marijuana together in a kind of unholy trinity with cocaine and heroin in discussions about drug smuggling, drug dealers and the like.
During the 1990s, stories discussing marijuana in criminal terms became less prevalent. Meanwhile, the number of articles discussing the medical uses of marijuana slowly increased. By the late 1990s, marijuana was rarely discussed in the context of drug trafficking and drug abuse. And marijuana had lost its association with other Schedule I drugs like cocaine and heroin in the New York Times. Gradually, the stereotypical persona of the marijuana user shifted from the stoned slacker wanting to get high to the aging boomer seeking pain relief.
Once attitudes begin to change, it is difficult to know what keeps the momentum moving. Whatever the initial impetus, attitudes today are drastically more supportive, and legalization is increasing fast.

Texto completo: I wanted to write for the local press an appreciation of the life of American humorist Russell Baker, who died a few weeks ago at age 93. But I didn't have a local angle.
A local angle, as anyone knows who has tried getting a letter to the editor published, makes all the difference to editors trying to decide what news and opinion gets published and what doesn't. Editors are universally ingrained with the notion that the closer to home, the more appealing the story. Maine readers of a Maine newspaper, for example, are far less likely to read a story headlined "50,000 Bangladeshis swept away by tidal wave" than one headlined "Wiscasset man escapes injury in Bangladesh."
That's called "news judgment," and I wasn't about to ignore it - not if I wanted to do right by Russell Baker. So, I scoured a half-dozen of his books and the internet for a Maine connection. No luck. He seemed to parcel out his time over the years in haunts like Virginia, Maryland, New York, Washington, D.C., and even London, but seemed uncannily absent from Maine.
I'd have to figure out another local angle, so I read randomly from his oeuvre - a word he'd have left alone - and found places where he seemed to be talking directly to Mainers. I found this introduction to winter from his classic "Poor Russell's Almanac":
"One snow in a winter is happiness. Two snows are too many. Three snows are a penance visited upon cities that are unjust. Wise is the man who goes to Yucatan after the first snow for he shall escape the ravages of dipsomania, self-pity and misanthropy, and his shoes shall not be ruined."
Baker's local angle, inferentially, is that most Mainers are either wise snowbirds in Yucatan or nasty drunks with ruined shoes.
Maybe that's stretching too far for a local angle, and, I confess, maybe he wasn't talking about Maine at all. Here's another insight for February from the "Almanac" that might, or might not, be applicable to Maine: "WHAT! Both Monday and February can occur on the same day?"
Such inspired nonsense is best enjoyed sitting up in bed reading Baker aloud over a pitcher of martinis, a drink that recurs in his journalism career from his early days covering cops in Baltimore. It's also a colorless drink that lends itself to snorting out your nostrils when you get to the funny parts.
But it wasn't all funny parts. His "Observer" columns for The New York Times could be acerbic in describing the political machinations of his day, prompting him famously to remark that he'd grown tired of covering Washington by waiting for politicians to emerge from meeting rooms to lie to him.
He also did his bit to subvert the sacred cult of "objective journalism" by introducing his own judgments in his news writing rather than slavishly recording the bloviations of the mighty. He said in his second memoir, "The Good Times": "No matter how dull, stupid, unfair, vicious, or mendacious they might be, the utterances of the great were to be reported deadpan, with nary a hint that the speaker might be a bore, a dunce, a brute, or a habitual liar."
And this was decades before Donald Trump's ascent to power.
Baker's manner was disarming. Despite his hardscrabble boyhood and youth, his two Pulitzers and other accolades, he always came across as approachable, kind and ever-civilized. I'm convinced his well-modulated public delivery and lack of pomposity got him his job introducing "Masterpiece Theater" for more than a decade, succeeding Alistair Cooke.
He wrote and talked in simple and direct English, and he didn't lie, probably not much anyway. We need more of him.
He was a writer's writer. He started with the notion that he would follow the Hemingway route: Do journalism for a few years and then write great novels thereafter. But he stayed in journalism because he concluded it was more difficult to write a novel than to write 30 columns. And, after all, the journalist gets paid every week, maybe, and it's still writing.
Lots of people in Maine write or want to write. Perhaps they are the best local angle for a piece on Russell Baker.

Into the great wide open at the Grammys

Texto completo: The GRAMMY Awards
On CBS, Sunday at 8 p.m.
Even in the age of Peak TV and Netflix-documentary glut, music is the popular art form on which it's most difficult to get a complete handle — the weekly new-release reserves topped the 100-album mark last year quite a few times, and that's not even counting the myriad reissues released by catalog-stuffed labels. So the Grammy Awards, in theory meant to represent the “best" popular music, will always have more naysayers than satisfied observers when they announce their nominees, let alone their winners.
This year's ceremony — the 61st, which airs Sunday night at 8 on CBS — is a culmination of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' first attempt to change that. Following the lead of the Academy Awards, which widened the best picture nomination field from five nominees to 10 in 2009, the Grammys have welcomed more members into the running for certain categories, including the four awards with cross-genre nomination slates: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, and best new artist. In addition, the recording academy added more than 900 women and people of color to the Grammys' voting ranks last October.
This widening is welcome, long overdue, and, given the slate of nominees for those categories in particular this year, probably not dramatic enough. This year's top-four categories all boast critical favorites like Brandi Carlile and Janelle Monáe, commercial leviathans like Drake and Cardi B, and head-scratchers like Greta Van Fleet and Post Malone. But they also feel somewhat incomplete, and only partially representative of what music looked like between Oct. 1, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2018.
This year, Pulitzer-winning MC Kendrick Lamar and cross-continental mogul Drake led the nominations, with eight and seven respectively. Lamar's nominations stem mostly from the soundtrack for “Black Panther"; he co-executive produced “Black Panther the Album," and rapped on the brooding SZA collaboration “All the Stars," which is nominated for song and record of the year. Drake's nominations come from his lengthy, sensitive “Scorpion," which broke streaming records and spawned a slew of singles, including the watery, determined “God's Plan," also nominated for song and record of the year. This tracks with the way hip-hop in general — and Drake, specifically — dominated music in 2018.
Hip-hop is well-represented in this year's Big Four categories thanks to Drake and Lamar, as well as Bronx-born supernova Cardi B, chill-bro exemplar Post Malone, and multi-hyphenate Childish Gambino (a.k.a. “Atlanta" creator and former “Community" star Donald Glover). Dropping below those four categories, though, shows that the recording academy's push for greater representation has had ripple effects, although they're not all evenly spread out.
Hip-hop and R&B are at the nexus of energy for pop music right now, and the nominees in those genres' respective categories are probably the best-realized of this year. Take the competition for best urban contemporary album: Jay-Z and Beyoncé's joint effort as the Carters, “Everything Is Love," leads the pack in Q rating, but its competitors are varied and great. Chloe x Halle's 21st-century update of the blood-harmonies ideal, Chris Dave & the Drumhedz' multi-headed soul music hydra, Miguel's sun-baked dystopia, and Meshell Ndegeocello's reimagination of the late 20th-century's soul-pop smashes are all worthy of winning, but more importantly, they're worthy of being elevated to “important album" status.
If only the winner of that category was able to appear on TV. The producers of the Grammy telecast have a problem similar to the academy's voting members: Too much to include in a 24-hour telecast, let alone a three-hours-and-change one. This year's Grammys have 84 categories; last year's telecast showed nine presentations, with the rest shunted off to the afternoon-long Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony. Online video has, at least, made that ceremony more accessible to viewers. (It streams live at www.grammy.com on Sunday beginning at 3:30 p.m.)
The rest of the show is made up of performances, which, if years past and the current trickle of announcements are anything to go by, will consist largely of sometimes-understandable, sometimes yikes-inducing pairings of artists from past and present generations — country titan Dolly Parton with spiritual descendants Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris, moany alt-rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers with moany sorta-rapper Post Malone. A few big names will be missing — Lamar, Drake, and Glover all turned down offers to perform, according to a New York Times interview with producer Ken Ehrlich, while the music trade pub Hits reported that Ariana Grande, whose new album “thank u, next" comes out Friday, dropped out after clashing with the show's producers over song choice.
But even with those absences, there's enough talent in music right now that there will probably be at least one performance that wows observers in the moment. My money's on Carlile, whose starkly felt songs got “Grey's Anatomy" and Olympic-ad pickup, and who has enough in-the-biz fans to inspire a tribute album featuring Parton, Pearl Jam, and Adele — but who has yet to win a Grammy. A sweeter comeback story couldn't be told.

Celebrating Lunar New Year And The Diversity Of The World’s Calendars

Texto completo: Lunar New Year kicked off Tuesday as one of the most important holidays in Vietnam, South Korea, China and other Asian countries. Typically, it starts on the second new moon after winter solstice.
On the Gregorian calendar, the civil calendar used in most countries, including the United States, the Lunar New Year changes every year, as do the dates of holidays like Rosh Hashana, Diwali and Ramadan.
It can be easy to think of a calendar as a scientific given, or a reflection of the laws of the universe. In fact, as these holidays remind us, there are as many ways to track time as there are cultures and languages. Each calendar reveals something about how the people who created it relate to the world around them while also preserving rich cultural identities and memories.
Most timekeeping traditions track the movement of the sun, moon and stars. Others consider seasonal events, like the autumnal swarming of sea worms, used to orient each year in the Trobriand Islands off New Guinea, or the flowering of immortelle trees into hundreds of tiny vermilion flames, which marks the start of the dry season in Trinidad.
With any calendar, the basic question is which of thousands, if not millions, of cycles in the world to follow, said Kevin Birth, an anthropology professor at Queens College. Calendars “always come down to this cultural choice,” he said, so using one system over another is ultimately a social contract, regardless of how scientifically accurate or sophisticated a calendar is.
A solar year - the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun - lasts around 365 days, while a lunar year, or 12 full cycles of the moon, is roughly 354 days. Because of this discrepancy, a purely lunar calendar - like the Islamic, or Hijri, calendar - doesn’t stay aligned with the seasons. Islam’s holy month of Ramadan may fall in summer one year and winter a number of years later.
To correct for seasonal drift, the Chinese, Hindu, Jewish and many other calendars are lunisolar. In these calendars, a month is still defined by the moon, but an extra month is added periodically to stay close to the solar year.
A solar calendar is useful for farming, fishing and foraging societies that need to plan ahead for particular times of the year. But a purely solar calendar, like the Gregorian, tells you nothing about the phases of the moon.
The traditional Hijri calendar requires an observation of the early crescent moon to start a new month, and thus encourages paying attention to the cosmos. The Gregorian calendar can’t be tracked in the sky, which might be why many Westerners have less awareness of the moon and other natural phenomena, said Sacha Stern, a professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at University College London.
Major events on the calendar shape cultural identity. When Jews around the world celebrate Sukkot, a harvest festival, they are observing the timing of the harvest in Israel, and preserving a connection throughout the diaspora, Birth said.
Holidays also structure personal and historical narratives. Some secular holidays in the United States center on legacies of war, which fits “when you think that the United States also has the largest military budget in the world,” Birth said. Chinese holidays usually emphasize family union and honoring ancestors, Yuan said, which aligns with the importance of filial piety.
Many ancient calendars, like the Chinese and Mesoamerican ones, build in fortunetelling, with prescriptions for when to build a house, get married, have a funeral and other life events. Similar calendars provide structure and comfort to people today. Britt Hart, an astrologer based in Philadelphia, said she thinks people can be drawn to horoscope-based calendars because they’re seeking a grander sense of time and order in the universe.
In the context of history, staying connected to an alternative calendar can also be a form of resisting the mainstream, or maintaining an identity outside of it. When a calendar is imposed on a society, it usually has to do with politics and power. The ability “to say when the year will start, or decide that a religious festival should be celebrated at a particular time, can be quite useful for a politician,” Stern said.
The Gregorian calendar has been used as a global standard for only about a century, and is “very much a reflection of European commerce and colonialism,” Birth said. It has now been built into computer architecture, but that doesn’t mean another calendar couldn’t one day become dominant.
A Hijri calendar from the Gregorian year 2014 hangs in Birth’s office. On it, Christmas falls on 3 Rabi al-Awwal, the third day of the third month.
He loves the reminder that “holidays you think are stationary actually move, and those you think move are actually stationary.” It shows “how cultural these things are, rather than natural,” he said.

Texto completo: Albert Finney, a British actor who found worldwide acclaim in 1963 as the raffish 18th-century roustabout Tom Jones and who carved an independent path in the theater and in films, portraying Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, a Southern lawyer in "Erin Brockovich" and an Irish mob boss in "Miller's Crossing," died Feb. 7 at a London hospital. He was 82.
His family announced the death. He reportedly had an infection and had been treated several years earlier for kidney cancer.
Trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Mr. Finney first gained notice on-screen in 1960 in "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning," a gritty study of alienation and anger in which he played a factory worker juggling relationships with two women.
Throughout his career, in roles ranging from playboy to pope, from Hamlet to Winston Churchill, he had a way of dominating any scene in which he appeared. Early on, Time magazine lauded him as "the most brilliant actor of his age in the English-speaking world."
Mr. Finney was sometimes proclaimed the heir to British actor Laurence Olivier or even Marlon Brando. He had a deep voice, expressive blue eyes and a brooding, steely focus that, in some scenes, erupted into fury.
"Concentration is the secret," he told Britain's Independent newspaper in 1997. "You try and 'be there.' When you do a scene, you're there and nothing else is going on."
His most exuberant role, which vaulted him to stardom, came in "Tom Jones," based on Henry Fielding's picaresque novel. Mr. Finney stepped with gusto into his role as an adventurous, high-spirited rogue, "of whom the opinion of all was that he was born to be hanged."
Handsome, charismatic and given to mischief, Mr. Finney's character is more of a lover than a fighter but adept at both. He exudes a powerful charm and sex appeal, particularly during a tour de force dinner-table scene with actress Joyce Redman. Without saying a word, the two actors gaze at each other while devouring lobster, oysters, chicken and an assortment of fruits, before stealing away to a bedroom. It remains one of the most memorable seduction scenes in film history.
"Tom Jones" won four Academy Awards, including best picture. Mr. Finney was nominated for an Oscar as best actor but went home empty-handed. He was nominated three more times for best actor: for playing Poirot, the Belgian detective in "Murder on the Orient Express" (1974); for his role as an aging Shakespearean actor losing his grip on reality in "The Dresser" (1983); and for playing an alcoholic British diplomat in "Under the Volcano" (1984). Mr. Finney also was nominated once for supporting actor, playing a lawyer who hires Julia Roberts in "Erin Brockovich" (2000). He was sometimes called the greatest actor never to win an Oscar.
He was cast as Tom Jones only because he turned down the starring role in "Lawrence of Arabia," which made a star of Peter O'Toole - who was in the same acting class as Mr. Finney and a frequent drinking companion.
The offer was tied to a long-term contract with the film's producer, which Mr. Finney rejected. "I didn't know where I want to be in five years' time," he later said, "or tomorrow for that matter."
Because "Tom Jones" was not expected to be a major hit, Mr. Finney took a small salary and a percentage of the film's profits - which turned out to be enormous. He became a millionaire at 27, enabling him to resist the commercial lures of Hollywood.
He appeared in the stylish "Two for the Road" (1967) with Audrey Hepburn - with whom he had a torrid romance - but preferred to practice his craft on the stage. His 1975 performance of "Hamlet" at London's National Theatre was praised in the New York Times by critic Benedict Nightingale as "passionate and powerful, full of scalding humor and savage contempt. Here, for once, is a Hamlet who is what he accuses himself, 'very proud, revengeful and ambitious.' "
During the early 1980s, Mr. Finney appeared regularly in productions of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Co. During the same years, he had roles as Pope John Paul II in a TV movie, as a shaven-headed Daddy Warbucks in a screen version of "Annie" and as a California writer whose marriage is collapsing in "Shoot the Moon." Alan Parker, who directed the 1982 film, co-starring Diane Keaton, struggled to get the best performance he could from Mr. Finney.
Somehow, Mr. Finney found an inner fire for a scene in which he drives a car over his family's tennis court, enraged that his wife and children are moving on without him.
The role "reminded me of times when my own behavior has been monstrous," Mr. Finney - who was married three times and had countless affairs - said. "Well, one of the things you obviously use as an actor in a quite ruthless way sometimes is your personal life."
In later years, Mr. Finney found new acclaim after appearing in "Miller's Crossing" (1990), directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Playing an Irish American crime boss, he was suave and malevolent at the same time.
"You haven't bought any license to kill bookies," he says in one scene, "and today I ain't sellin' any. Now take your flunkie and dangle."
In 2002, Mr. Finney portrayed Churchill in BBC-produced television film, "The Gathering Storm" (2002) for which he received an Emmy Award. He played Billy Crudup's dying father in "Big Fish," a well-received 2003 film directed by Tim Burton. In 2007, he had another role as a father in Sidney Lumet's crime drama "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," playing the father of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke.
Mr. Finney's final film role was in the 2012 James Bond film "Skyfall," in which he played a Scottish gamekeeper who had been an early mentor and father figure to a young Bond, played by Daniel Craig. In one scene, Mr. Finney dispatches a couple of villains with a double-barreled shotgun, ending the encounter with a laconic, "Welcome to Scotland."
Albert Finney was born May 9, 1936, in Salford, England, near Manchester. His father was a bookie, taking illegal bets on horse races.
Except for sports and acting, Mr. Finney did poorly in school. A teacher recommended him for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and he found early encouragement from actor Charles Laughton and Olivier, to whom he was an understudy in Shakespeare's "Coriolanus."
Mr. Finney's marriages to actresses Jane Wenham and Anouk Aimee ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife since 2006, Pene Delmage; a son from his first marriage; and two grandchildren.
Mr. Finney recalled that when he first gained renown in 1960 with "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning," a theater put his name on the marquee. When his parents came to see him in London, his father - whose name was also Albert Finney - lingered in the street, looking at the marquee.
"I went back and said 'Come on Dad, I've got to get back,' " Mr. Finney said. "But he stayed there, gazing. 'I never thought I'd see my name in lights,' he said."

Texto completo: California’s housing crisis was bad enough last year, when Gov. Gavin Newsom – then a mere candidate – called for building 350,000 new units every year for the next decade.
The crunch is worse this year, with some of those who lost their homes to last fall’s disastrous wildfires now added to the tens of thousands already homeless and living on streets around the state and hundreds of thousands more who are housed, but overcrowded beyond the limits of many local codes.
This scene last year led San Francisco’s Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener to push a proposed law allowing builders to override local zoning ordinances and place high-rise apartment buildings with a plenitude of “affordable” units near light rail stations or heavily used bus routes.
This proposal didn’t last long in the Legislature last year, shot down by a coalition of local governments, homeowner groups and lack of enthusiasm by former Gov. Jerry Brown, an advocate of local government controls since his years as mayor of Oakland.
But there is more pressure now to override local controls on development, and Wiener is back with a slightly redone version of his building plan, which would reverse a century of California urban sprawl by concentrating development in areas long believed to be built out.
Wiener has touted the changes he’s made to his proposal for the last couple of months, stressing ways the newer version panders to the desires of left-wing “progressives” dissatisfied with the previous version.
Now known as SB 50, the measure would let cities delay building in areas where longstanding apartment tenants might be at risk of eviction to make way for newly-mandated high rises. If a tenant has been in a building more than seven years, for example, that building couldn’t be demolished to make way for a new, far taller one.
This is meant to appease tenant groups that dominate politics in cities like Santa Monica, San Francisco and other currently dense places.
But the essence of Wiener’s original plan remains: It allows new buildings of six to eight stories in all areas within half a mile of any light-rail station or within one-quarter mile of a frequently used bus route. Preferences of local voters, city or county governments and nearby homeowners or apartment dwellers wouldn’t matter.
As Wiener says, such development could probably never occur unless the state mandated it. Few local officials could survive politically if they okayed high-rises overlooking the yards of thousands of single-family homes or caused the teardowns of expensive condominiums.
But Wiener claims many elected officials tell him they want dense development, but can’t publicly admit it. He told the New York Times that “City councils, mayors, county supervisors have (told) me ‘We can’t say this, but we need help. We need to be able to tell our constituents ‘We have to approve this project because the state requires it.’”
But just as the state’s high-speed rail project has seen years of delay and opposition over attempts to take land by eminent domain, forced new development could also run into legal buzz saws. Especially new development with virtually no new parking spaces required.
For example, Wiener’s plan is founded on the notion that denser housing won’t worsen gridlocked traffic because new residents will ride nearby trains and buses. Figures from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Southern California suggest that’s pie in the sky.
The bus and light rail agency reported last year that bus ridership shrank in the region by 15 percent in 2017 from levels of five years earlier, while rail ridership was up 4 million – less than the drop in bus ridership. Translation: there’s been some switching from buses to trains, but little net increase in mass transit riders despite creation of several new lines costing billions of dollars.
So the logic behind Wiener’s plan remains false and would worsen existing gridlock in cities he wants to densify. It ignores many thousands of homeowners who invested their life savings in residences Wiener’s plan could radically downgrade.
The bottom line: Some other solution must be sought, because it accomplishes little to begin solving one serious problem while making other problems far worse.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A judge confirmed in a court filing Thursday that federal prosecutors in New York are still investigating campaign finance crimes committed when President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump.
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III made the disclosure as he agreed to release in several weeks some court documents related to the search warrant that authorized last April's FBI raids on Cohen's home and office. Media organizations had requested access to the records.
Pauley said some documents should stay secret because making them public could jeopardize aspects of its investigation, "including those pertaining to or arising from Cohen's campaign finance crimes.
In December, Pauley sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for crimes including tax evasion, fraud, lying to congress and campaign finance violations that occurred when two women were paid to stay silent about affairs they claimed to have had with Trump.
The judge authorized disclosure of portions of materials related to Cohen's tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen's conduct that did not result in criminal charges.
Nine media organizations had cited high public interest and a right to access in requesting the records.
The judge gave prosecutors until the end of the month to identify portions of the documents that should stay secret.
Prosecutors through a spokesman declined comment.
In his decision, Pauley made revelations about the search warrants as he explained his reasoning on why only some search warrant materials can be released and only with redactions.
The judge said prosecutors had opposed the media requests, saying disclosure "would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties. He said they provided the search warrant materials for the judge to privately review.
He said the search warrant applications and affidavits supporting them "catalogue an assortment of uncharged individuals and detail their involvement in communications and transactions connected to the campaign finance charges to which Cohen pled guilty.
Pauley said prosecutors revealed to him that "these individuals include those cooperating with the Government, those who have provided information to the Government, and other subjects of the investigation.
He said the search warrants do not detail the Government's ongoing investigation as much as other documents including affidavits, but they "enumerate topics of inquiry relating to the campaign finance charges.
The judge added: "At this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the Government's ongoing investigation. It would also unveil subjects of the investigation and the potential conduct under scrutiny, the full volume and nature of the evidence gathered thus far, and the sources of information provided to the Government.
Cohen pleaded in August to two campaign violations and other crimes.
One charge described a $150,000 payment to former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and another concerned a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels using a sham home equity loan before he was reimbursed through the Trump Organization using false invoices, court papers said.
Cohen, in his plea, said that it was all done with the knowledge and at the direction of a "candidate for federal office - meaning Trump. But whether Trump or anyone else involved with those transactions broke the law remained an open question.
News organizations in the legal action to unseal the documents included The New York Times, The Associated Press, and the parent companies of ABC and CBS News, CNN, the Daily News, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday and the New York Post.
David E. McCraw, vice president and deputy general counsel for The New York Times, said: "We are pleased that the court has rejected the Government's position that the public has no right to see these important and newsworthy materials. While we don't know how extensive the court-approved redactions will be, we are confident that the release of materials will shed light on the investigations involving Mr. Cohen.
In a statement, The Wall Street Journal said Pauley's ruling was "particularly gratifying for The Wall Street Journal, considering our exclusive efforts dating to before the 2016 presidential election at revealing the hush payments that were the basis of Mr. Cohen's campaign-finance guilty plea.
Pauley called the public's right to access the materials substantial and said the materials are "entitled to a strong presumption of public access.

Ford to invest $1B in high-profit SUV

Texto completo: Ford Motor Co. is investing $1 billion in two Chicago factories and hiring 500 workers to expand its ability to crank out high-profit sport utility vehicles, including its new Explorer.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of global operations, made the announcement Thursday at the Chicago Auto Show. The investment in the assembly and stamping plants fulfills an obligation the company made in its 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers. Ford is set to bargain a new pact with the union later this year.
Ford is killing off its slow-selling sedans in the U.S. and betting big on the SUVs and trucks that generate most of its profit. Other American manufacturers also are closing plants and cutting shifts at auto factories as consumers - driven by cheap gas and a love of the large - are shunning traditional cars. Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett is trying to capitalize on this trend as he engineers an $11 billion overhaul.
"We're playing to our strengths. Kumar Galhotra, head of Ford's North American operations, told reporters in Detroit last week. "That means we're allocating our capital differently. Ninety percent of our capital is now going into trucks and utilities.
Ford's 95-year-old Chicago assembly plant and 63-year-old stamping plant - which also will build the Lincoln Aviator and Police Interceptor Utility - are being updated with advanced manufacturing technology. The company's investment also includes training at the factories that employ 5,800 workers.
Ford is spending $40 million to upgrade lighting and add security at the plants, where some employees have experienced a history of sexual and racial harassment. In August 2017, the company agreed to pay as much as $10.1 million to settle claims following an investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company faced similar charges at the factories that led to a $17.5 million settlement in 1999.
Ford also will improve bathrooms and cafeterias and add new break areas at the aged facilities.
Hackett wrote an open letter apologizing to employees in December 2017 after the New York Times published a report about the long history of sexual and racial complaints at the two factories.
"There is absolutely no room for harassment at Ford Motor Company, Hackett wrote, adding for perpetrators: "We don't want you here, and we will move you out for engaging in any behavior like this.

The Grinch' **½

'The House With a Clock in Its Walls' Zero stars

PG - 2:00 - The Arthurian legend gets a modern and more youthful spin in this surprisingly delightful film full of action, heart, a crazy-haired Patrick Stewart (as "old" Merlin) and a few genuinely good gags. Associated Press
'Mary Poppins Returns' *½

PG-13 - 1:51 - Kevin Hart is funny as a night-school student in a class led by a shockingly violent teacher (Tiffany Haddish). But it's the group of beloved comic character actors surrounding them who carry the movie through its bumpy patches. Tribune News Service

PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post

PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'Vice' *½
R - 2:12 - Christian Bale nails it as Dick Cheney, plotting his rise from a misdirected young man in Wyoming to one of the most notorious gray eminences in American politics. But the rest of the movie, written and directed by Adam McKay, is an absurd mess. Washington Post

Texto completo: Happy families are all alike; unhappy families sue one another from California to New York.
So might Tolstoy begin the saga of the family of Joel S. Marcus, the real estate tycoon credited with helping to turn Cambridge into one of the world's biggest biotech hubs.
Marcus, 71, cofounded Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a publicly traded real estate investment trust that builds commercial properties and leases them to life science companies. It owns and manages more than 22 million square feet of lab and office space across the country, including 4.8 million in Cambridge.
He's also embroiled in a spectacular legal battle with his 40-year-old son. The eldest of three children, Steven Marcus lives in London and has started a rival British real estate company that also plans to house life science firms.
Alexandria Real Estate sued Steven Marcus and his startup, RUNLABS, in December for alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition. The suit says he misused Alexandria's name and logo, an image of the Alexandria lighthouse in ancient Egypt, in fund-raising pitches to venture capitalists.
Steven Marcus also falsely claimed the startup evolved from Alexandria, according to the suit.
“Steven Marcus has never been an employee or had any formal business relationship with Alexandria, nor has he had any other interest in Alexandria aside from his familial relationship with Joel Marcus," says the complaint filed in US District Court in San Francisco. Joel Marcus lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., not far from his Pasadena-based company.
The younger Marcus is firing back with legal salvos of his own. He has asked the US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to take Alexandria's registered trademarks off the books. He says he came up with the Alexandria name and logo as an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and that they belong to him.
On Thursday, he sued his father and Alexandria in New York state court. The suit alleges Alexandria owes him more than $12 million for devising a new financing strategy for the company in 2013, work he says his father took credit for.
“I didn't believe that you sue your family, but when he sued me, we decided to pursue this vigorously," Steven Marcus said in an interview. He contends his father is waging a personal crusade against him and wants to torpedo an up-and-coming rival. Of the family feud, he says, “I recognize it has a Shakespearean touch."
In another twist, a cousin of Steven Marcus's appears to be siding with Joel Marcus.
The ugly disagreement came up during a conference call Tuesday when Joel Marcus, executive chairman of Alexandria, spoke with investment analysts about the firm's fourth-quarter performance.
“Can you comment a little bit about what's happening with your eldest son?" an analyst asked.
Joel Marcus replied, “If you look at anyone who is trying to bring any discredit or any cloud to the company, I think you can assume that that is a meaningless approach."
Without naming his son, he said, “The kinds of things that are going on are clearly illegal and they're immoral and they will be dealt with in a very severe fashion."
Joel Marcus declined to discuss the controversy with the Globe. But lawyers for Alexandria said Thursday that the company is doing what any firm would do if someone infringed on its trademarks.
“This was a business dispute, pure and simple," said Patrick Gunn, a San Francisco lawyer.
Trademark disagreements are common in the corporate world. But this dispute is unusual because it's so personal, exposing a bitter rift in the family of Joel Marcus, a prominent developer who helped found Alexandria and has run the company since 1997.
With a market value of about $14 billion, Alexandria has played a key role in the sprouting of biotech clusters from San Diego to New York to Cambridge. The company first started leasing properties to biotechs in California in the 1990s. Joel Marcus, a lawyer, had been representing firms that wanted laboratory space near major academic institutions.
In the early 2000s, Alexandria turned its focus to Cambridge, especially the then-gritty neighborhood of Kendall Square near MIT. Today, after spending millions to construct gleaming buildings for biotech startups and Big Pharma firms, Alexandria says it's the biggest owner of lab space in Cambridge.
Steven Marcus said he grew up in Southern California and earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia University in New York in 2004. He was never close to his father, he said in an interview.
“We didn't have an adversarial relationship, but it's hard for me to recall having a good relationship either," he said.
Nonetheless, he says he played a pivotal role in his father's business.
In 1997, the company was called Health Science Properties, a name his father wanted to dump, according to Steven Marcus's filing with the trademark board. Steven Marcus said he came up with the Alexandria name and symbol as a freshman at Penn. He said he was inspired by a goblet-shaped doumbek drum from Alexandria owned by a college chum.
Joel Marcus credited his son for the concept in a 2014 interview with The New York Times.
“My oldest son, who was at Wharton, came up with the name," he said.
More than two decades later, in November, Alexandria executives learned that RUNLABS was using the trademarks in written fund-raising pitches, according to Alexandria's suit. The pitches said RUNLABS had evolved from Alexandria, featured photographs of Alexandria properties, and mentioned the startup's “pedigree from Alexandria," according to the suit.
RUNLABS plans to provide offices and shared laboratory space to life science firms, and is starting in Europe, with a 150,000-square-foot building that will open in Paris late this year, said Steven Marcus.
After Alexandria executives saw RUNLAB'S pitches, the company complained to Steven Marcus. On Dec. 12, he wrote to Alexandria's board of director that RUNLABS would stop using the name and logo to “remove any further unwanted confusion."
But Alexandria sued him the next day. Gunn, the lawyer for Alexandria, said Steven Marcus's letter was a “transparent dodge" that contained none of the legal assurances his client had sought.
In late January, Steven Marcus asked the trademark board to cancel the trademarks, saying they belong to him.
In his suit filed Thursday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Steven Marcus says that although he was never a paid Alexandria employee, he and an investment firm he founded, Bugsby Property LLC, played a pivotal role in 2013 by helping to develop a new financing strategy for his father's firm.
Rather than issue more common stock, he said, he recommended Alexandria fund growth through a joint venture, ultimately with TIAA, the financial services organization. The new approach lifted Alexandria's sagging stock price and saved his father's job, Steven Marcus said, but he says the elder Marcus took credit for it and “cheated" his son out of payment.
One of Alexandria's lawyers, Randy Mastro, said Steven Marcus signed an agreement in 2013 that said he would not receive money from the firm for the financing plan.
Steven Marcus's effort to get paid now is a “publicity stunt to try to pressure parties to give him something to go away," Mastro said.
Steven Marcus says the agreement was obtained under fraudulent circumstances.
At least one family member appears to side with the elder Marcus.
Brandon Werber, a 33-year-old Los Angeles entrepreneur and cousin of Steve Marcus's, said he knows both men well. He isn't surprised by what's happened.
“I had my own professional experience with Steven that ultimately unfolded into what, in my opinion, is quite similar to what Joel and Alexandria are facing with Steven now," Werber said.
He declined to elaborate, but said his uncle is a “genuine role model" with an “unwavering moral compass."
Steven Marcus, for his part, said his cousin is a “complete liar" who has spent little or no time alone with Joel Marcus. The younger Marcus also said he introduced Werber to a high school friend with whom Werber started Lootsie, a loyalty platform for mobile apps.
“He never once thanked me," said Steven Marcus.

Abramson responds to plagiarism accusations

Texto completo: Responding to critics who say her new book contains plagiarized material, former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson acknowledged Thursday that the “language is too close in some cases" and changes will be made. Abramson had initially rebutted the accusations involving “Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," tweeting that she “endeavored to accurately and properly give attribution to the hundreds of sources that were part of my research." Abramson and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, did promise to review the passages in question.
Thursday's reversal was only the latest in what has been a rocky launch for Abramson's examination of disruption in the news industry over the past decade. Last month, current and former Vice journalists got their hands on a galley and said it contained multiple inaccuracies. Some of those concerns were addressed in the final version of the book, which arrived in stores this week.
On Thursday afternoon, Abramson, now a senior lecturer at Harvard, issued a statement saying: “I was up all night going through my book because I take these claims of plagiarism so seriously. . . . I tried above all to accurately and properly give attribution to the many hundreds of sources that were part of my research. My book has 70 pages of footnotes, and nearly 100 source citations in the Vice chapters alone. . . . The notes don't match up with the right pages in a few cases, and this was unintentional and will be promptly corrected. The language is too close in some cases and should have been cited as quotations in the text. This, too, will be fixed. I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested."
The plagiarism allegations were leveled on Twitter Wednesday by Vice News's Michael Moynihan , who compared sections from Abramson's book with passages from other publications, including Ryerson Review of Journalism, The New Yorker, Time Out, and Columbia Journalism Review. Writer Ian Frisch , the former editor of Relapse Magazine, also tweeted that Abramson's book included, without proper attribution, material from a 2014 profile he wrote about Vice's Thomas Morton .
During an appearance Wednesday on Fox News, Abramson didn't respond to individual claims, saying “All I can tell you is I certainly didn't plagiarize in my book, and there's 70 pages of footnotes showing where I got the information."
But some in publishing said footnotes are sometimes not enough.
“The real problem," says literary agent and lawyer John Taylor “Ike" Williams , “is that if you're quoting or very closely summarizing someone's work and don't put it in quotes to show it's not your work, or identify the creator of the work on the page it appears, all the footnotes or endnotes in the world won't protect you from charges of plagiarism even if your use of others' work is too insubstantial to amount to copyright infringement."
In her statement Thursday, Abramson, who'll be at Harvard Book Store Feb. 19, said she stands by the substance of her book, which looks at the various paths taken by legacy media organizations The New York Times and The Washington Post and digital newcomers Vice News and BuzzFeed.
“All of the ideas in the book are original, all the opinions are mine," she said. “The passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren't." MARK SHANAHAN

Texto completo: Today, the casting would be the subject of blog posts, tweet storms and op-eds. But 35 years ago, when Peter Weir embraced the spirit of the title "The Year of Living Dangerously" and hired an American woman to play a Chinese-Australian man in that political drama, his gamble paid off: Linda Hunt became the only person to win an Academy Award for playing a cisgender character of the opposite sex.
It wasn't an easy decision. The filmmaker had asked a fellow Australian, David Atkins, to take the role of the dwarf Billy Kwan in the drama about expats in Indonesia during the 1965 coup attempt. But Atkins didn't click with the movie's star, Mel Gibson, during rehearsals. "Sets were being constructed in Manila, and the clock was ticking," Weir recalled in a recent email. "The casting agent said he had a possible Billy Kwan called L. Hunt. He then revealed he was a she. We were desperate and gave her a try, and she was great."
But Hunt, a stage actress whose sole film credit was a part in Robert Altman's "Popeye," wasn't sure she could pull off the role of a male photographer who facilitates a romance between an Australian journalist (Gibson) and a British diplomat (Sigourney Weaver). "She said, 'Could you rewrite it for a woman?"' Weir remembered. "I said it would change the whole story. Silence. 'Could you play a man?' Now a really long silence. 'Only if you believe in me,' she said. So we took the plunge."
During the early stages of production, Hunt still doubted herself. "I thought, oh my God, I'm going to have to go somewhere when this film opens, just away, as far as I could get," she told The Daily Beast in 2011. She said she thought her performance "was so awful. It got better and better as we went on." Hunt declined to be interviewed for this article.
Critics agreed after "The Year of Living Dangerously" opened in January 1983. "This is what great acting is," Roger Ebert wrote in The Chicago Sun-Times. "A magical transformation of one person into another." The New York Times's Vincent Canby said the crossgender casting "works to the film's advantage. It's Billy's fate to play God, and gods are, if not androgynous, then not necessarily condemned to a single sexual identity."
A year later, Hunt won best supporting actress from critics' associations in New York and Los Angeles. Her Oscar nomination pitted her against another woman with little big-screen experience -- Cher in "Silkwood" -- as well as Amy Irving ("Yentl"), Alfre Woodard ("Cross Creek") and Glenn Close ("The Big Chill"). It would be the second of six losses for Close, who received her seventh nomination last month, for best actress for "The Wife."
After Hunt's name was announced, she told the academy members, "There was an Indonesian phrase in the film, which translates into English as 'water from the moon,' and it means that which is unattainable, the impossible, that which one can never have or know. Making 'The Year of Living Dangerously' for me was water from the moon."
Hunt thanked her parents, who were in the audience. At 4-foot-9, Hunt seemed unlikely to succeed as an actress, and her father, an oil company president, had urged her to study teaching. (Her mother was a piano teacher.)
"He lived though the Academy Awards and died about 18 months later of a stroke," Hunt said in 2011. "It now means a great deal that he got to be there. My father was so relieved when I won that award. He was like, 'You know what? I guess she's right. She's going to be O.K."'
That she has been. Hunt has gone on to play memorable parts in "Silverado," "Stranger Than Fiction" and other movies, and has co-starred on "NCIS: Los Angeles" since 2009.
Nontraditional gender roles have attracted the attention of Oscar voters over the years, with Jack Lemmon earning a best actor nomination for the cross-dressing comedy "Some Like It Hot" and William Hurt taking home the same award for his gay prisoner who identifies as a woman in "Kiss of the Spider Woman." More recently, playing transgender characters has won Oscars for Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry" and Jared Leto in "Dallas Buyers Club." Cate Blanchett received a nomination for her turn as Bob Dylan in "I'm Not There," but Hunt's win remains the only time the academy has honored a woman for playing a cisgender man.
As the Turner Classic Movies host Dave Karger said in a recent phone interview, "It seemed crazy, but it totally worked, and that's why she won."
In the wake of the whitewashing charges that have been leveled against the casting of white actors like Emma Stone ("Aloha") as characters of Asian heritage, Hunt might prove an even more controversial choice today as the half-Asian Kwan. (Advocates for little people might also object.) But Weir indicated he would do it again: "Casting is critical and should not be influenced by any fashionable trends."
Hunt's work remains audacious more than three decades later. In a recent phone interview, Pete Hammond, a film critic and awards columnist for Deadline, called it "a dominating performance. She totally immersed herself in that character. It was impossible to ignore."
The academy didn't, and Weir could not have been more pleased. "I was thrilled to see her win the award for this extraordinary gamble," he said. "So well-deserved."

Texto completo: Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of The New York Times, responded on Thursday to accusations that her latest book, "Merchants of Truth," contains passages that were plagiarized or not properly attributed to the original source material.
"I was up all night going through my book because I take these claims of plagiarism so seriously," she said in a statement issued by the book's publisher, Simon & Schuster. "I tried above all to accurately and properly give attribution to the many hundreds of sources that were part of my research."
She added: "The notes don't match up with the right pages in a few cases and this was unintentional and will be promptly corrected. The language is too close in some cases and should have been cited as quotations in the text. This, too, will be fixed."
A Simon & Schuster spokesman said the company would work with Ms. Abramson to make corrections and clarify the sourcing in future print editions and in the e-book.
On Wednesday evening, a reporter for Vice News, one of the four news organizations Ms. Abramson chronicles in her book, alerted readers to passages that appear to have been lifted from other sources, in some cases word for word. The reporter, Michael Moynihan, revealed the similarities in a series of tweets.
In one instance, he cited a 2005 article from Ryerson Review, a news site run by journalism students, in which a paragraph describing Gavin McInnes, a founder of Vice News, reads: "McInnes wrote a column in 'The American Conservative,' a magazine run by Pat Buchanan. In the magazine, he called young people a bunch of knee-jerk liberals (a phrase McInnes and his cronies use often) who'll believe anyone with dark skin over anyone with light skin."
The similar passage from Ms. Abramson's book reads: "He wrote a column in 'The American Conservative,' a magazine run by Pat Buchanan, calling young people a bunch of knee-jerk liberals (a phrase McInnes and his ilk often used) who would believe anyone with dark skin over anyone with light skin."
Nicolle Weeks, the author of the 2005 article, said in an interview, "I'm concerned that she's written a book about truth and journalism, and she has done something dishonest."
Other examples cited by Mr. Moynihan include sentences or paragraphs that appear similar to those from articles published by The New Yorker and the Columbia Journalism Review.
Ms. Abramson, who was fired from The Times in the spring of 2014, after less than three years in its top job on the editorial side, sold the book to Simon & Schuster in 2015 after an auction with multiple publishers. Reviews for "Merchants of Truth," a 500-page examination of how newsrooms, both new and established, are grappling with the changes brought on by the rise of digital media, were largely positive, including in The Times.
Vice is one of the media companies that Ms. Abramson focused on, and when galleys of the book circulated last month, many of its staff members pointed out inaccuracies on social media. In response to those complaints, Ms. Abramson made corrections in time for the final version.
The inaccuracies and apparently cut-and-pasted lines were surprising, given the subject of her book, which came with the subtitle "The Business of News and the Fight for Facts." In the parts of "Merchants of Truth" focused on her tenure as executive editor of The Times, Ms. Abramson described her concern that the line between the business and news departments was starting to blur.
The majority of the book is not memoir, but a work of deep reporting driven by the thesis that the new breed of digital outlets -- specifically, Vice and BuzzFeed -- are somewhat lacking in their commitment to traditional journalistic values.
"The irony is, it's the people who didn't have a culture of fact-checking who are the ones fact-checking her work," Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, said in an interview.
Plagiarism is a cardinal, and sometimes career-ending, sin in journalism, but the practice of approving borrowed phrases gets a pass in the book world, except in egregious instances. Several prominent authors who stood accused of plagiarism, including the poet and memoirist Jill Bialosky and the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, have emerged relatively unscathed, their mistakes chalked up to haste or sloppiness rather than intellectual dishonesty.
"Book publishing has almost adopted the role of that of a Facebook, saying, 'We're just a platform,"' Mr. Pope said. "Which I think is wrong."
Jane Mayer, a writer for The New Yorker who collaborated with Ms. Abramson on "Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas," defended the author. "I'd be hard pressed to find a more honest and hardworking reporter," she said in an email. "Anyone can make a few mistakes, but it's a distortion to devalue a lifetime of outstanding work because of this."
Mr. Moynihan, the Vice correspondent, said he uncovered evidence of apparent plagiarism when he started looking closely at the book to determine whether Ms. Abramson had gotten facts about Vice wrong because she had come upon them elsewhere.
Thomas Morton, a reporter for Vice, said he was surprised to read a chapter about himself that included incorrect details about his high school years that he did not recall discussing with Ms. Abramson during their phone interview.
She described him as a teenager who wore skinny pants and ironic T-shirts and listened to Southern gangster rap, none of which were true, he said in an interview. In another section included in the book's first printing (but not in the current e-book version), Ms. Abramson described how Mr. Morton traveled to the mountains outside Cartagena to report on a tribe that has a tradition of having sex with donkeys.
The problem, Mr. Morton said, is that he was not the correspondent of the donkey story. It was covered by another correspondent.
Ms. Abramson did not respond to requests for comment.

Time to lower the standard?

Texto completo: MLB reduced the height
of the mound after 1968, and a similar move may loom
During Bob Gibson's record-setting 1968 season, he hung a sign above his locker that read, "Here comes the judge." He felt untouchable, he said. The St. Louis Cardinals pitcher knew he owned the inside half of the plate, and he would stare down opponents who feared stepping into the batter's box.
Gibson had 34 starts that season and posted a complete game in 28 of them. He had 13 shutouts and 268 strikeouts. In one stretch from June 6 to July 30, he won 11 straight starts - all of them complete games - and allowed only three runs.
"No one wanted to face me," he told the Associated Press in 2008.
But Gibson was only the tip of the spear in baseball's first "Year of the Pitcher." Twenty-two pitchers had sub-2.00 ERAs. Gibson's was a stunning 1.12, the lowest in modern baseball history.
"Defense now dominates offense to the point of extinction," wrote Rex Lardner in the New York Times, speculating that by 1971 no-hitters would be common and fans would celebrate the occasional foul ball. "With the batter being as helpless as he is," Lardner wrote, "the game has become largely one of pitcher throwing to catcher and catcher throwing back."
That should sound familiar. Pitchers again have the clear upper hand - there were more strikeouts than hits in 2018 for the first time in Major League Baseball's 147-year history - and the game's leaders this week floated the idea of again lowering the pitcher's mound, as they did after the 1968 season.
Pitchers in that era had a distinct advantage. The strike zone was much larger, measuring from the shoulders to the bottom of the knees, rather than today's armpits to the top of the knees. Regulations also allowed for a mound 15 inches high, though actual heights varied by ballpark.
"It felt like every pitcher was right on top of you that year," Ken Harrelson, an all-star right fielder in 1968, told ESPN's Tim Kurkjian in 2011. "It felt like they weren't 60 feet 6 inches away. It felt like they were 40 feet away."
Pitchers had hacked the game. Top hurlers slung fastballs nearly as hard as modern greats toward a larger strike zone with more lenient officials. Umpires rarely cracked down on illegal pitches such as spitballs or curveballs coated in Vaseline or pine tar.
The resulting lack of offense threw baseball into crisis. Seven teams hit .230 or lower. The New York Yankees as a team batted .214. The big league average ERA that season was 2.98, more than a run below 2018's mark. Teams combined to score 6.8 runs per game in 1968. (Last year, they averaged 8.8.)
"There is ample evidence that the public is getting a wee bit tired of all these 'pitchers' duels' " The Washington Post's Bob Addie wrote in late 1968.
So, after the season, MLB officials lowered the mound to 10 inches and shrank the strike zone to its modern size. The changes were made, according to one wire service, "to add more enjoyment for the fans and more offense in the games which the pitchers dominated in both the National and American leagues this past season."
Baseball also asked umpires to better enforce rules about illegal pitches. A pitcher who brought his hand to his mouth while standing on the mound would have his next pitch called a ball. A pitcher found to have thrown an illegal pitch or with an illegal substance on the mound would be ejected.
Big league players and managers weren't convinced that the rule changes would have the desired effect - or that their game even had a problem.
"I wouldn't change the rules," the Cardinals' Lou Brock told the New York Times before the alterations were approved. "Things have a tendency to go in cycles."
"Good pitching can dominate good hitting on any given day," St. Louis's Roger Maris said, also telling the Times that "you can't move the mound back or lower it" and that "when a good hitter is swinging freely, he'll hit anybody and anything."
But the rule changes did what they were meant to do. The leaguewide ERA jumped nearly a run in 1969. Average scoring increased by 1.2 runs per game. RBI, hits and walks had gradual increases, too.
ESPN reported this week that MLB "is interested in studying mound height, with the potential for [Commissioner Rob] Manfred to implement a lowering of the mound in 2020." That's among a slew of new ideas discussed by Manfred and the players' union to give batters a boost, increase scoring and improve the pace of play. Other proposals included a 20-second pitch clock, a universal designated hitter and a three-batter minimum for pitchers.
Those proposals are likely to be assailed by pitchers, just as Gibson continues to revile the 1968 changes sparked by his historic season. He joked in 2008 that he ought to take legal action against MLB over the mound height.
"Why should they take away the pitcher's livelihood because he becomes proficient at it?" he asked. "That, to me, seems like what they did. The hitters weren't doing very well against you, so they say, 'Well, we're going to fix that.'
"I still might sue baseball for that."

Cosby moved to 'general population' at Pa. prison; 'He's happy to be out socializing,' official says

Texto completo: Bill Cosby has been moved to "general population" at his state prison in Pennsylvania and is being treated the same as all inmates, a prison official told the New York Daily News on Thursday.
The move was made Jan. 28 after Cosby spent his first few months in "administrative segregation" at the maximum-security SCI Phoenix facility outside Philadelphia, said Amy Worden, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.
"From what I understand from prison officials, the transition has been smooth and he's happy to be out socializing with folks," she said.
She said Cosby - like other famous inmates including rapper Meek Mill and disgraced coach Jerry Sandusky - was "given the chance to acclimate" before staff determined he was ready to move into general population.
Now Cosby is in a single-person cell next to other inmates, must be present for daily counts and eats his meals in the dining hall associated with his particular unit, she said.
He also has access to the day room, the yard, the libraries and settings for religious activities, she said.
Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt disputed the claims in a statement to The News following a story in The New York Times that first reported the move.
"I spent time with Mr. Cosby Thursday and Friday of last week, we knew he was going to be moved to a Veteran's facility on the campus (of SCI Phoenix). He made it clear that he's not in general population but has contact with a trustee that guides him around," Wyatt said.
"He does not eat in the area with other residents; he does not have a cellmate; and he does not exercise with other residents," Wyatt said. "Mr. Cosby is not in general population because that would be detrimental to his safety and security, due to his blindness."
Wyatt then criticized prison officials for releasing information about Cosby's move, despite that such information is public record.
"It's not a matter of debate," Worden told The News when asked to respond to Wyatt's statement. "He misunderstands what general population is. You're either in it or not."
She said Cosby is most certainly classified as general population.
She declined to say if he's being housed in a facility serving veterans but said such a facility exists on the campus and serves inmates classified as general population.
"He's in a specialized unit, but I'm not going to say which one," she said.
Worden said such units include the "honor" unit and units for inmates with special needs.
Beyond their specialized housing assignments, these inmates are "otherwise indistinguishable," she said, with the same routines.
She said Wyatt's claim that Cosby has a "trusty" guiding him around is misleading.
" 'Trusty' is not even a word we use. We don't have trusties; they're inmate assistants who help the disabled," Worden said.
"In his case, it's public knowledge he's visually impaired, so they would help guide him around," she said. "From what I understand from prison staff, he is going to the dining room," she said.
Cosby, 81, was convicted last April on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
A jury found him guilty of giving former Temple University staffer Andrea Constand a mystery medication and sexually assaulting her while she was incapacitated at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004.
The comedian claimed the encounter was consensual, but the judge allowed several of the more than 60 women now accusing Cosby of sexual assault to testify as so-called prior bad act witnesses.
Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison at a hearing in September.

House Democrats consider bills to protect Obamacare. The Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday, Feb. 13, to consider legislation aimed at protecting Obamacare and pushing back against the Trump administration’s actions. The bills would prevent the sale of short-term health insurance, boost funding for marketing Obamacare’s open enrollment, and undo the Trump administration’s list of ideas for ways that states could make changes to the law, according to the office of Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who chairs the subcommittee. “Health care was the single most important issue to voters in the 2018 election, yet the Affordable Care Act is still under attack nearly ten years after the landmark bill was signed into law,” Eshoo said in a statement.


Democrats are going after the Trump administration’s plans in another way, too. Democrats are asking the Government Accountability Office to determine whether the Trump administration’s proposals for ways that states could make changes to Obamacare are subject to the Congressional Review Act. If they do, then Congress would be able to overrule the regulations through an expedited legislative process. The guidance the administration put out involves 1332 waivers, which give states the option to make changes to Obamacare in ways that make coverage cheaper and extend it to more people. The Trump administration put out proposals that Democrats disagree with because certain parts could lead to the sale of health insurance that has fewer benefits and protections than Obamacare. The request to GAO came from House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr., D-N.J. and Senate Finance Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

Five of seven drug companies agree to appear at Senate hearing. Five of the seven pharmaceutical companies who were invited to testify about the price hikes of their products have voluntarily agreed to appear before the Senate Finance Committee on Feb. 26. The companies who agreed are Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Sanofi, Merck & Co., Pfizer, and Janssen. AbbVie and AstraZeneca haven’t committed yet. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., and the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, have both blasted drug companies for initially declining to testify.  


Durbin bill would shorten drug exclusivity in reaction to price hikes. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is planning to formally unveil a bill next week that would shorten pharmaceutical companies’ exclusivity on drugs when they hike them by more than 10 percent in one year. Shortening the amount of time that drugs have exclusivity on a drug will allow less expensive generics to come to market faster. Companies are granted a monopoly on drugs by the Food and Drug Administration that is anywhere between five to 12 years, and during that period the prices of drugs can go up. While that’s going on the FDA does not review applications for generic drugs, which are copies of the brand name medication that tend to be less expensive when they come to market. Durbin’s bill, the Forcing Limits on Abusive and Tumultuous Drug Prices Act, would require companies to report their increases to the Department of Health and Human Services and could provide an appeal if they believe the price hike was justifiable.  “Whether it’s the overnight price hikes by greedy Wall Street executives, or the year-over-year increases for decades-old medications like insulin, these price-gouging practices must end,” Durbin said in a statement.


Trump administration sues to block supervised injection site in Philadelphia. Federal authorities announced Wednesday that they are suing a nonprofit organization that wants to build a facility in Philadelphia where drug users could inject heroin and illicit fentanyl under medical supervision to be protected from overdosing. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday against the nonprofit Safehouse and its executive director Jen Bowles, is the first of its kind. The lawsuit could set a precedent on whether other cities can set up similar facilities, known as supervised injection sites.  The filing by U.S. Attorney William McSwain, an appointee of President Trump, asked a judge in a civil lawsuit to declare the facility illegal under federal law. The lawsuit specifically states that it violates a portion of the Controlled Substances Act in the 1980s, dubbed the "crack house statute." The law makes it illegal to have a place that is used to to make, store, or distribute illegal drugs. The case will be heard by U.S. District Judge Gerald McHugh, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.


More adults who get coverage through work are underinsured: Study. Twenty-eight percent of U.S. adults who have health insurance through their employer were underinsured in 2018, up from 20 percent just four years earlier, according to a study out Thursday from the liberal Commonwealth Fund. People who are "underinsured" have high deductibles and other out-of-pocket medical expenses relative to their income, and therefore are more likely to have a hard time paying medical bills or to skip care because of cost. People who bought plans on their own, either directly from an insurer or through the exchanges, were the most likely to be underinsured, with 42 percent reporting a lack of adequate coverage in 2018.


Massachusetts Democrats push bill to allow more third-trimester abortions. Massachusetts Democrats are pushing a sweeping bill to allow more third-trimester abortions, meaning the commonwealth would join New York in having some of the loosest restrictions in the country. Massachusetts law currently bans abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy except if a woman's pregnancy endangers her life, or if continuing the pregnancy would risk “grave impairment of her physical or mental health.” The Remove Obstacles and Expand Abortion Access Act, or "ROE Act," would loosen those restrictions by dropping the "grave impairment" language and allowing abortions after 24 weeks to protect the mother’s “physical or mental health, or in cases of lethal fetal anomalies, or where the fetus is incompatible with sustained life outside the womb.” The bill would give doctors much more latitude in deciding to conduct abortions and would delete the section in current Massachusetts law that requires doctors to “take all reasonable steps … to preserve the life and health of the aborted child,” including having life-supporting equipment in the room. It would also repeal existing law that requires a minor to get her parents’ consent before an abortion. “The ROE Act breaks down barriers to ensure that women are able to receive appropriate medical care, according to a physician’s best judgment, in tragic circumstances when there are lethal abnormalities or a risk to the woman’s life during the course of a pregnancy,” state Sen. Harriette Chandler, the bill’s sponsor in the Senate, told the Washington Examiner . “The law should reflect that these are very difficult decisions that should be made between a woman and her doctor.”

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump addresses a joint Congress in his State of the Union Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be seen holding papers in front of her face during the president's speech.
Pelosi's reading quickly caught the attention of some on social media, and many wondered what she could be reviewing as the address continued.
Pelosi was looking over her copy of Trump's speech, a spokesperson confirmed to The New York Times.
Even though there was an explanation, images from cable news quickly tuned into memes, joking that Pelosi had brought reading material and guessing that it could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Good News in Los Angeles: A Revived Food Section

Texto completo: The Los Angeles Times said Tuesday that it would resume publishing a stand-alone print section dedicated to food, and that it had added new staff members to fill its pages. The moves come as a rare bright spot in a season of layoffs and consolidation in American journalism.
The newspaper ceased printing a food section in 2012, and folded its food coverage into the Saturday paper as part of a painful decline that has persisted through much of this century.
Last year, Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire surgeon and medical entrepreneur, bought the paper and installed the veteran newsman Norman Pearlstine as its executive editor.
"We view Los Angeles as the nation's food capital, and the print section, which will serve as a weekly digest of our daily coverage, is an expression of our determination to provide the world's best, most authoritative and comprehensive coverage of it," Mr. Pearlstine said in a statement on Tuesday.
Changes to the newspaper in the past year have been rapid and remarkable, including rebuilding a food section that Ruth Reichl, a former New York Times restaurant critic, once edited and where Jonathan Gold, the Pulitzer Prize-winning critic, reviewed restaurants.
Mr. Gold died of pancreatic cancer in July at age 57. His legacy will guide the new food section, said Peter Meehan, the New York writer and editor who is now the newspaper's food editor.
"If you look at the way he was celebrated in his passing, it was more suited to that of a civic leader than a restaurant critic," Mr. Meehan said in an interview on Tuesday. "Writing about restaurants was the way he taught people who their neighbors were."
The new section will appear in April, and be delivered in the printed paper each Thursday, when the circulation is 474,129, according to a spokeswoman. (The Sunday newspaper's circulation is 665,738.) The section is part of a larger push to increase food coverage on all platforms, including the web.
New and reassigned editors and writers will help fill its pages. Andrea Chang is the deputy food editor for Mr. Meehan, who will divide his time between Los Angeles and New York. Ben Mims has been hired as a cooking columnist, and Genevieve Ko as cooking editor. Mr. Mims was the test-kitchen director at Lucky Peach, the food journal started by Mr. Meehan, Chris Ying and the chef David Chang. (It ceased publication in 2017.) Ms. Ko has long been a stalwart of food media, writing cookbooks with several notable chefs and producing recipes and editing for almost all the nation's major food publications, including The New York Times.
The Food section will also publish work by Gustavo Arellano, the author of the column ¡Ask a Mexican! and a features writer at the paper.
In November, the newspaper named as its new restaurant critics Bill Addison, who had been the national critic for the website Eater, and Patricia Escárcega, a food reporter for The Arizona Republic who had reviewed restaurants for The Phoenix New Times.
The paper has also hired an audience-engagement editor and is building a new test kitchen at its headquarters in El Segundo, Calif.
Mr. Meehan said he has been given wide leeway to cover the Los Angeles food scene the way he sees fit.
"I want it to be as good and as weird and as interesting as I can," he said. "My mandate is, let's rebuild this as a civic institution and hold a mirror up to the city and show it itself."

Dear reporters: Please, for the love of God, do not take advice from Jill Abramson

Texto completo: People are rarely as talented as they think they are.

Newspaper editors are no exception.

Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson, who has been dining out on that credential ever since she was fired abruptly in 2014, has authored a newsroom tell-all titled, Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts .

In an effort to promote her new book, she agreed to do an interview with New York magazine’s blog the Cut.

The interview, which was published this week, is filled with the exact sort of eye-rolling moments of high self-regard that one would expect from the type of person whose book title would include the phrase “the fight for facts.” (“When I was executive editor of the Times," she writes, "I had a yoga teacher who came to my apartment who was actually my classmate at Harvard and that was a very pleasant experience.”)

In a single sentence, Abramson manages to work in the fact that she worked at the Times, that she went to Harvard, that she had a personal yoga instructor, that her personal yoga instructor did house calls, and that her personal yoga instructor is Harvard-educated. Lord have mercy.

But there’s one paragraph in the Abramson interview that stands out above all others in terms of breathtaking self-admiration, and it’s the one where the former newspaper editor brags about her interviewing skills or, rather, the lack thereof:

"I do not record. I’ve never recorded. I’m a very fast note-taker. When someone kind of says the 'it' thing that I have really wanted, I don’t start scribbling right away. I have an almost photographic memory and so I wait a beat or two while they’re onto something else, and then I write down the previous thing they said. Because you don’t want your subject to get nervous about what they just said."

Reporters: I cannot stress enough that this is a terrible way to conduct interviews. Everything Abramson just said — do the exact opposite. For the sake of the Times’ credibility, I hope its reporters ignored her outright when it came to interviewing tips and techniques. My God.

First, if you say you have an “almost photographic memory,” you do not have a photographic memory. You have an undeserved amount of confidence in your definitely fallible ability to recall things. Good for Abramson and her apparently boundless faith in her abilities, but a pretty good memory is no substitute for a verbatim recording.

Secondly, how are you supposed to capture the whole of what a person tells you if you’re always a step behind? What happens when the interview subject is providing important context for the thing he just said, but you’re not writing it down or really even listening because you’re “a beat or two” late?

Lastly, this is a great way to open yourself up to a libel complaint or, at the very least, destroy your credibility. If your memory fails — and it will — good luck defending yourself from the inevitable and well-deserved criticism, especially if the other guy was smart enough to record the conversation (see: Katie Couric's smear of Virginia guns rights activists). Your “almost photographic memory” won't mean a damn thing when put up next to an actual recording.

If you’re a reporter, and you employ the techniques Abramson brags about in her interview, you are doing your readers and your interview subjects a major disservice. If your version of taking notes involves waiting “a beat or two,” and then relying on an “almost photographic memory,” you are begging for sloppy and irresponsible copy.

Avoid the Abramson school of interview like it’s a bad disease. There’s a reason why her book is getting raked over the coals right now for containing an astounding number of inaccuracies and falsehoods. Perhaps when the dust settles, and the final angry fact-check has been written about her book, she'll then understand the upside to owning a tape recorder.

Texto completo: People love to hate weather forecasts, though it's getting a lot harder to find fault. Forecasts gave plenty of advance warning that Chicago would see a bitter high of around 14 below zero on Wednesday and lows Wednesday night comparable to a day in Antarctica. Public officials closed schools and issued warnings, and police saved lives by combing the streets for homeless people before the worst hit.
Today, a five-day forecast is just as accurate as a one-day forecast was in 1980, giving us more time to prepare -- or overreact and panic. Weather watchers in the Northeast saw the past week's cold snap coming for days. Storms are now forecast within a range of 50-some miles and timed to within a couple of hours. An icy storm that hit the Northeast on Jan. 20 was in the forecast before it even existed anywhere, said Richard Alley, a geosciences professor at Penn State University and co-author of a new paper in Science on weather prediction.
There's even more room to improve, he said. Better forecasts save money -- on plows and road salt, on crops, and on making sun and wind energy more predictable. Sometimes forecasts can have even bigger consequences.
Historians say D-Day might have gone very differently if weather had followed the German forecast for storms rather than the Allies' more accurate forecast of fair skies and calm seas. Bad weather thwarted Napoleon and later Hitler in attempts to defeat Russia. Lost explorers over the ages might have planned differently. Ernest Shackleton might have avoided getting his ship locked into the Antarctic ice.
A century later, I take advantage of forecasts those early explorers couldn't have dreamed of. I plan many of my weekends around sailboat races, and here in Rhode Island, there are at least four venues where people race all winter. Even a week ahead of time I can get a reasonable estimate of temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction. We don't go out if the forecast shows anything life-threatening.
It makes sense that weather is inherently more predictable than, say, the economy. Ultimately, weather does reduce down to basic laws of physics -- Newton's laws, the Coriolis effect and the like, said Alley. The limiting factor is the complexity of the system: To build a good model you have to take into consideration where there's ocean, where all the mountains are and even where cornfields grow in the Midwest.
And even then, there's a problem, which was laid out in James Gleick's 1987 book "Chaos." Mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz discovered that while the physical world is in principle deterministic, in reality minuscule changes in initial conditions can lead to big differences in weather. Consider Lorenz's famously titled 1972 talk: "Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"
Alley said that indeed there's a limit on the accuracy and range of weather forecasting, but since the 1970s, it went from mediocre to amazing. He chalks up the improvements to additional satellites and other data collecting devices, more powerful computers to crunch the data, and improved models.
He uses the game show "Wheel of Fortune" to show how forecasts work in the face of the butterfly effect. The wheel is divided unevenly into segments, so right off you can calculate how often over many spins it will hit, say, the skinny million-dollar-jackpot segment. That's why long-term climate patterns are easier to forecast than the weather on any given day.
A single spin, or a single day, is hard to predict, but as the wheel starts to slow down, you can start to guesstimate where it will land -- just as the weather forecasts for a particular race day are more accurate as the day comes closer. The models are so good, he said, that once you figure in all the topography, the atmospheric density and Earth's rotation, you don't have to add in the gulf stream. The laws of physics predict there will be a gulf stream. They also predict there will be a semi-periodic current pattern called El Nino, as well as long-term global warming. (Alley also sings about the concepts in a music video.)
In his book "The Signal and the Noise," Nate Silver discusses the same idea using a coin toss, which is essentially a deterministic physical phenomenon. If a machine flips a coin exactly the same way it will can get a dependable outcome. But when we humans toss a coin it behaves randomly because the outcome depends on tiny variations in its trajectory. His weather chapter was excerpted in a New York Times Magazine story called "The Weatherman Is Not a Moron."
That was back in 2012, but already there were huge improvements. Silver attributed this to better computers and more data as well as better estimates of uncertainty. Sometimes the weather people are sure, sometimes not so sure. But saying so, he laments, has its cost:
"In a time when forecasters of all types make overconfident proclamations about political, economic or natural events, uncertainty is a tough sell. It's much easier to hawk overconfidence, no matter if it's any good."
That's a longstanding problem for many kinds of scientists. People might wrongly equate honesty about uncertainty with being wishy-washy. But there are objective tests of predictions. So-called superforecasters (who win forecasting tournaments) say that understanding their own uncertainty is critical.
People probably won't stop complaining about the weather forecasts, said Alley, because even missing the mark by a degree or so can mean the difference between snow and rain. It's also improved so slowly that it's been hard to see. What's all this worth in dollars and cents? Alley cited several papers, listing the benefits of weather forecasting and estimating that spending on weather forecasting technology can deliver a much greater return on investment. But to get specific there, you've got to factor in humans and the economy, which are not nearly so predictable.

CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ALSO TWISTING IN THE WIND WITH NORTHAM: Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam ’s recent scandal threatens Virginia’s potential participation in a regional cap-and-trade program.


The governor has been trying to get Virginia to join the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI. He’s faced pushback from the GOP legislature, but has eyed a potential regulatory workaround in order to help expand the cap-and-trade program.


Northam has found himself plunged into scandal after the discovery of his 35-year-old medical school yearbook page, which included a photo of an individual in a KKK outfit and another in blackface. The governor has denied that he appeared in the photo.


The governor held a meeting on Monday morning with key staff advisers to go over options, including his resignation, the Washington Post reported.


What about his deputy? Deputy Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax , who holds strong environmental views, and would likely continue the RGGI effort if Northam resigns, has also found himself embroiled in controversy over an alleged sexual assault. Fairfax denied the allegations on Monday.


RGGI officials in New York did not respond to a request for comment on how the matter would influence the future of the greenhouse gas initiative, deferring instead to the state’s representatives.


New Jersey’s in better position to join the agreement: Meanwhile, New Jersey is also looking to join the cap-and-trade program, after exiting during the administration of Republican Gov. Chris Christie. Democratic Gov. Philip Murphy has vowed to re-enter the agreement.


The greenhouse gas initiative held a member meeting last week to mull New Jersey’s official proposal to re-join the multi-state climate change market.


Both New Jersey and Virginia were anticipated to join RGGI by 2020, pending any delays or the speed of state environmental regulators.


Murphy’s “committed to restoring environmental programs, including re-entering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and focusing on environmental justice concerns,” he said in the governor’s fiscal budget for 2019.

DEEP FREEZE PROMPTS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RE-UP BID TO BOLSTER COAL: The Trump administration is relitigating its support for coal after the fading fuel source was used more frequently last week to help meet surging power demand during the deep freeze that overtook the Midwest and East Coast.


Steven Winberg , the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for fossil energy, touted early data Friday showing coal and nuclear generated a higher percentage of power during the cold surge than usual.


"Those are power sources that have fuel on the ground, and that's absolutely important. If we didn't have that, it would have been a much worse situation,” Winberg said, noting that coal and nuclear plants can store fuel on-site.


Coal’s numbers go up: Coal provided 37 percent of electricity last week (as of Thursday) in the nation’s largest power market run by PJM Interconnection, which includes 13 states from Illinois to the District of Columbia.


But PJM reported no reliability issues on its grid and has previously said its electricity supply would hold up against a range of threats, including extreme weather.


Also last week, coal served 51 percent of power in the Midcontinent ISO, representing 15 Midwest states, more than the roughly 33 percent that is the norm.


Counterarguments: Critics of the Trump administration’s bid to help coal and nuclear argue those energy sources do not protect the grid during extreme events, and most disruptions occur from fallen power lines, not supply shortages.


In addition, despite record demand for natural gas during the cold stretch, prices stayed low.


“There is no feasible constraint to the amount of natural gas available in the market," Dean Foreman , chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, told Josh. "That has taken the air out of arguments against gas’ resilience.”

OIL REFINERS GET BEHIND UN FUEL RULES THAT ANALYSTS SAY WILL DRIVE UP PRICES IN 2020: Oil refiners are defending new United Nations environmental rules against private consultants' forecasts that they will hurt consumers in the run-up to the 2020 election, rather than aiding President Trump's energy dominance agenda.


The refinery industry supports the impending new 2020 International Maritime Organization rules, which call for the use of cleaner, low-sulfur fuels in all seagoing vessels and could drive up costs by diverting millions of gallons of diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil to the maritime sector.


The American Fuels and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refining industry's main trade group in Washington, says the environmental rules will likely be a boon for the U.S. energy industry, which has been meeting federal low-sulfur fuel standards for years.


The 2020 U.N. rules require a massive cut in the amount of sulfur allowed in conventional fuels used in large commercial tankers and cargo ships. The rules go into effect Jan. 1, 2020.


“We think that cost impacts, if they occur, will be short-lived and minimal,” said Derrick Morgan , the refinery group’s senior vice president for federal and regulatory affairs.


But there have been a number of consulting firms in Washington and elsewhere that have projected the implementation of the rules as potentially catastrophic.

BUDWEISER TOUTS COMMITMENT TO WIND ENERGY WITH SUPER BOWL AD: Budweiser touted it clean energy commitments with a Super Bowl ad featuring a team of Clydesdales pulling a wagon with two drivers and a Dalmatian through fields and mountains, with wind turbines visible in the background.


“Wind never felt better,” a message reads. “Now brewed with wind power for a better tomorrow.”


Anheuser-Busch, which produces Budweiser, announced in 2017 that it seeks to obtain 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025 to power its brewing operations.

SENATE DEMOCRATS URGE EPA TO EXTEND COMMENT PERIODS FOR RULES AFFECTED BY SHUTDOWN: Senate Democrats urged EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Friday to extend public comment periods for pending regulatory decisions that were affected by last month’s government shutdown.


“According to past precedent and EPA’s own public health mission, a government shutdown cannot be allowed to obstruct public participation in our regulatory process,” wrote Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Tammy Duckworth , D-Ill., Bernie Sanders , I-Vt,, Ben Cardin , D-Md., and others.


DEMOCRATS ALSO SEEK INFORMATION ON EPA’S DROP IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS: House Democrats demanded Monday that the EPA explain why it is penalizing fewer polluters.


EPA documents and press reports have shown a decline in the number of enforcement actions taken against polluters; a reduction in enforcement staff; and a delegation of more oversight authority to states. Civil penalties for polluters under the Trump Administration have fallen to the lowest average level since 1994, according to an analysis by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.


“We are deeply concerned that these actions undermine key enforcement programs and severely limit EPA’s ability to address climate change and protect public health and the environment,” Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a letter he wrote with other Democrats to Wheeler.


Democrats first sought information from EPA in December, but the agency has not cooperated with lawmakers’ requests, they said.

Texto completo: Before the post-shutdown negotiations started, we already knew the outcome.
Why? Because the Democrats absolutely refuse to acknowledge that their stand has nothing to do with border security. Their stand is meant to defy President Donald Trump and embarrass him by denying him the wall he promised as a presidential candidate.
How do we know this? When it comes to the benefit of border walls, the truth comes from the mouths of the Democrat leaders themselves.
Former President Barack Obama, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for a fence on our southern border in 2006. Now, Schumer joins U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who has vowed not to give Trump more than “one dollar” for his wall — in opposition to the very idea of a border wall.
One dollar — that appears to be Pelosi’s starting point on negotiations. The hypocrisy simply screams out loud. Everyone hears it but the Democrats no longer listen or remember what was said in the past.
The question Democrats refuse to answer is, simply, why are you opposed to border wall financing now? What intervening variable has influenced your thinking? Of course, Trump’s election is the answer but this truthful answer would be embarrassing. My challenge to Democrats is to prove this conclusion wrong by identifying any other variable that would explain their flip-flop on border wall financing.
The negotiations should take place with the understanding that Trump’s request is supported by the professionals who are responsible for our border security. They include Mark Morgan, an FBI official who served as chief of U.S. Border Patrol for the last six months of the Obama administration. Referring to the wall, Morgan told The Washington Post last month, “I’m begging the president to stay the course.”
Underneath this political mess are real facts being ignored and false facts being spread to undermine the president’s position. You have to go no further than the Jan. 12 New York Times in which White House correspondent Michael D. Shear writes that Trump wants “to erect a massive, concrete or steel barrier across the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico.”
This was a false statement that seemed designed to agitate and incite Trump opponents. Beyond belief, this false statement appeared just inches below the Times’ famous slogan: “All the News That’s Fit to Print.”
Remember, Trump seeks $5.7 million to build about 200 miles of a wall with appropriate technologies — not a 2,000-mile barrier.
The headline on Shear’s analysis further muddies the water by proclaiming, “Trump’s Wall Stance Upends Washington’s Usual Border Bargaining” — reflecting Shear’s point that “Trump has transformed what used to be a complicated, nuanced negotiation into a take-it-or-leave-it demand.”
There is not a word about Pelosi’s insistence that she won’t give more than a dollar to Trump for a wall.
The New York Times motto should apparently be, “Half the News That’s Fit to Print.”
Meanwhile the headline on a column by Frank Bruni read: “Will the Media Be Trump’s Accomplice Again in 2020?”
Bruni criticized the media for failing to deal with important national issues while continuously emphasizing the coverage of Trump’s tweets (“We just have to wean ourselves from his Twitter expectorations,” Bruni wrote).
Hooray, maybe there are adults in the national media. Bruni further mentions the media’s “appetite for antics versus substance,” and he forthrightly declares that with the upcoming presidential race, “we have a chance to do things differently than we did the last time around — to redeem ourselves.”
I am sorry that Shear did not read Bruni’s piece before he wrote his own. I found the juxtaposition of the two articles appearing on the same day quite amusing but very informative. Yes, the nation’s reading, listening and watching citizens deserve better from the national media. More mea culpas are needed and would be appreciated.
In the meantime, I hope the current immigration and border negotiations will receive full and balanced reporting.

MATCHMAKING CHEF TARGETS IMMIGRANTS, U.S. CITIZENS DINNER SERIES KICKS OFF FIRST DATES

Texto completo: A Nigerian chef-activist based in New Orleans - who gets people talking with projects like his "Blackness in America" series - is hosting Pittsburgh-based matchmaking dinners that pair immigrants with U.S. citizens for first dates.
The "Marriage Trumps All" dinner series will take place Friday and Saturday, just before Valentine's Day, when Tunde Wey will cook for eight to 10 couples matched specifically for the event in the City of Asylum's Pittsburgh-Burma House on the North Side.
The first couple to marry within 90 days after the dinner will be given money toward their new life together. The gift reinforces the power of love to effect change, he said.
"We want to celebrate the power of love marriages as a rebuttal to current anti-immigration sentiment and policy," Mr. Wey wrote on the event website.
He emphasizes that the project is not about securing green card status.
"We are ONLY interested in matchmaking between individuals looking for LOVE with a strong interest in marriage," he wrote. "This is expressly not about obtaining immigration benefit - the immigration benefit is incidental, not the reason for the union. THIS IS ABOUT LOVE AND NO LOVE SHOULD BE ILLEGAL."
Pittsburgh is the only city scheduled for the project so far. It's part of an August Wilson Cultural Center exhibition, "Familiar Boundaries. Infinite Possibilities," in conjunction with City of Asylum.
Following the dinners, Mr. Wey is giving a talk at the August Wilson Cultural Center at 3 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free to the public, with an RSVP required to intern@aacc-awc.org.
Anyone who wants to go to one of the dinners must be single and willing to address whether he or she is a U.S. citizen, along with questions about gender identity, sexual orientation, level of education, employment status, income, political affiliation and more.
Once profiles are submitted, reviewed and approved, attendees will confirm reservations. Then they're interviewed in person or over the phone before attending the dinner. The process has so many detailed questions and procedures to mimic the experiences immigrants must go through to marry U.S. citizens.
On the event website, Mr. Wey addresses the many ways technology is helping people find partners: Tinder, Match.com and TV shows like "The Bachelor."
"This dinner series is even more serious than all these routes, because it doubles down on love," he wrote, "by offering something even more fundamental maybe, FREEDOM."
Once applicants are approved, the cost is $120 per couple. The U.S. citizens pay the cost for both people.
"It mimics current immigration policy regarding marriage which requires U.S. citizens to prove, by filing an Affidavit of Support, they are financially capable of sponsoring their spouse. The U.S. government insists verifying the financial viability of U.S. citizens to ensure that the immigrant spouse will not rely on government assistance," Mr. Wey wrote.
For the dinners, he'll cook Nigerian dishes like akara, similar to a bean- or a black-eyed-pea fritter; pepper soup; and ekpang nkukwo - a stew of greens, seafood and meats.
It is not known how much money will be given to the first couple to marry.
Over at the August Wilson Cultural Center, the title of the project points to President Donald Trump.
"Under the current administration," Mr. Wey's statement reads on a wall at the exhibit, "a new hierarchy of value has been established, creating another marginalized and maligned group: immigrants."
On one wall of the exhibit, "transnational artifacts" are aligned - documents required by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
"Love marriages have spurred considerable social shifts by challenging the notions of which class of people is allowed this privilege," the exhibit reads. "From the Loving case [Loving v. Virginia in 1958], which struck down laws banning interracial marriages, to the more recent same-sex ruling that legalized same-sex marriage [Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015]. It has been used as a tool to simultaneously reinforce and undermine discrimination."
The dinners happen to align with the latest face-off between Democrats and Mr. Trump for over $5 billion in funding for a border wall along Mexico that the president believes is essential for keeping illegal immigrants out. Mr. Trump's opponents assert that the wall is a waste of money and immoral.
Since Mr. Trump was elected, the administration also has cut back on the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and has implemented controversial policies that separate migrant children from family members at the southern border and detain them.
"Marriage Trumps All" has been a work in progress for more than a year, Mr. Wey said. He had been working with Kilolo Luckett, the consulting curator for the "Familiar Boundaries. Infinite Possibilities" exhibit at the August Wilson Cultural Center, which runs through March 24.
It features 12 regional, national and international artists who present works that question "society's obsession with tradition, policing, consumption and indulgence."
As Mr. Wey has set up projects around the country, they have been featured in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Food & Wine, San Francisco Chronicle and other news sites.
Hearing about his work led Ms. Luckett to Mr. Wey in New Orleans in 2016 during his "Blackness in America" series. There, he and guest speakers facilitated conversations about race and what it's like to be a black person in America in a year when more than 150 black people had been shot and killed by police, The Washington Post reported.
Mr. Wey also has spearheaded a project called Saartj last year, where he served Nigerian dishes at a lunch counter that was part of the Roux Carre food court in New Orleans. When customers went to pay, he discussed with them racial disparity when it comes to wealth.
After the talk, which included statistics illuminating that disparity, black and white customers were presented with two options: White customers could pay $12 for lunch - or the suggested price of $30. Black customers were charged $12 and also could collect $18 paid by a white patron. Black patrons also could opt in to receive cash back, he said, from the net revenue of the project, which was about $1,000, split evenly between a handful of customers. Mr. Wey also finished a project in Nashville, Tenn., to help reverse gentrification through the sale of hot chicken.
"My personal experiences, hosting public dinners on race and immigration, over the last year and a half in communities across the country," he wrote in Civil Eats in 2017, "[have] taught me that the tensions inherent in these sorts of conversations are reconcilable only through a substantive transformation of the individual and the system."
That transformation, he said, involves moving toward being less reliant on material goods and more emotionally vulnerable, "where we can admit to being corrupted without seeing ourselves as irredeemable."

Texto completo: After her debut novel, "The Hate U Give," shot to the top of the New York Times bestseller list -- where it has remained for almost two years -- and landed a movie deal, Angie Thomas faced a high bar for her next book.
Her sophomore novel, "On the Come Up," returns to fictional Garden Heights, but it tells a grittier tale that highlights the narrow path that many in the neighborhood face trying to climb out of poverty.
Sixteen-year-old Bri has just won her debut rap battle at a local hip-hop venue, the Ring. The daughter of an underground hip-hop star, Lawless, who was killed in a gang shooting, she hopes her breakout moment will lead to a recording contract.
At home, bills are piling up after her mom, Jay, a recovering drug addict, loses her job as a church secretary. Older brother Trey has graduated from college -- gotten out of Garden Heights -- but is back home working a minimum-wage job.
As the family spirals deeper into debt, with a landlord threatening eviction, and a visit to a food shelf, Jay wants Bri to focus on school over rapping or finding a job.
But tensions have reached a tipping point at school, where Bri and other black and Latino students feel targeted by the white staff and school security guards.
After a violent encounter with a guard, Bri pours out her frustration in a rap clapback that quickly goes viral. It draws cheers from her neighbors who are hungry for someone from "the Garden" to make good; fresh attention from Supreme, who used to manage Bri's dad; and an online petition by a white mom to take the song down.
This tension, between black communities struggling with poverty, music that reflects their lives and attempts to silence that message, lies at the heart of "On the Come Up."
"Folks love to blame hip-hop," Supreme tells Bri, reminding her of earlier hip-hop legends, such as Tupac Shakur and N.W.A., who sparked censorship battles with their lyrics. "Guess that's easier than looking at the real problems … Anyone who's ever had something to say on the mic, they've come at them 'bout how they said it."
Despite her love of hip-hop, Thomas doesn't give a free pass to the music industry. Supreme, who lives in the suburbs, wants Bri to ride her growing reputation as a "ratchet hood rat" to land a deal. A DJ who could make Bri's reputation, and the recording executive who dangle a deal, both assume she'll play along.
And Bri's lyrics draw attention from gang members who aren't interested in reading between the lines.
Thomas is a rich chronicler of the love that binds and the poverty that frays black communities. She slows down the story to detail the skills it takes to be a battle rapper, the judgmental nature of black congregations and even a stretch of trash-talking over a game of Uno when the power goes out at Bri's home.
While Bri struggles between standing up for herself and the narrow bandwidth she's given by the larger, white world, she also teeters between hope for her future and the even deeper poverty she sees when she meets kids in the neighborhood where her lesbian Aunt Pooh, a drug dealer, lives.
Readers hoping for the truth-bomb impact of "The Hate U Give" won't find the same scope here. "On the Come Up" is a more individual, and personal, tale.
The story gains momentum, and emotional depth, as students take their frustrations to a public forum about school policing, and Bri begins to see how her words ripple through the young people around her.
"Auntie Pooh introduced me to hip-hop, Nas told me the world was mine, and I believed it could be," she reflects toward the end of the book.
Laced with a deep love of hip-hop and community, "On the Come Up," lets one poetry-loving teenager find her path.

Texto completo: Conjure up an image of a writer in the popular imagination, and you might get an expat struggling in a grubby garret in Paris or a certain movie character weeping as she types "The End."
The reality is that writers have always worked to find buyers for their books, but how that happens has changed with dizzying speed. A more accurate image might be that of a CEO who's a creator in the morning, a marketer in the afternoon and a social media butterfly at night as writers become experts in branding, advertising and the business of publishing.
"Technology has made it possible to put a book anywhere. Anyone in the world can be reading your words, and that's very powerful," says Damon Suede, author of "Verbalize: Bring Stories to Life and Life to Stories" and co-author of "Your A Game: Winning Promo for Genre Fiction." The New York writer is one of the speakers at an all-day conference Saturday at the Space Coast Convention Center in Cocoa, a master class for writers of all genres called "Smart Marketing To Sell More Books."
"The problem is," Suede says, "there's a lot of crap."
There are still great books, but they can get lost in a sea of stories. What the flood of titles means for indie or traditional authors — Suede says that line has blurred to the point of near invisibility — is that it's a lot harder for a book to find readers.
"It is far easier to make a living as a writer if you know how to market than it is to make a living as a writer if you know how to write, which is a sad truth," says Jamie Farrell. She writes under her own name and recently adopted a pen name that's a consistent bestseller on Amazon.
"The biggest struggle is finding visibility," says Farrell, who recently taught a two-part workshop on writing and newsletters for Spacecoast Authors of Romance, which is sponsoring Saturday's conference. "It's almost more important to know how to market than it is to know how to write a good book these days."
Farrell, who lives in Ohio with her family, shopped her books to traditional publishers for four or five years. "Then I realized you can't sell quirky rom-coms in a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' world."
So, like many writers, she embarked on a self-publishing journey. Her indie romantic comedies were well-reviewed before she started also writing under the pen name, which she keeps a secret. A starred review in Publishers Weekly was "one of the highlights of my career," she says. But having great books wasn't enough. She wanted to stand out and sell more, so she created a highly branded identity, mastered Facebook ads and launched a newsletter fans love.
"Now it's even more important that you know how to market, how to brand yourself, how to be a businessperson. It's not just about the writing anymore," Farrell says. "Writers struggle with that, because we're creatives first."
You don't have to be a businessperson when you write that first book, but you have to be willing to learn, says Maria Connor, whose My Author Concierge business helps authors publish and market their books. Her clients include New York Times and USA Today bestsellers, and Saturday, she'll explain how to "Put Your Money Where Your Readers Are."
"You can learn the industry," says Connor, who's based in Jacksonville and also writes fiction under the name EmKay Connor. "I think you need to know it simply so you can make educated decisions. Do you know what a good cover looks like? Because a bad cover can really damage your sales and your credibility. Do you know how to screen an editor? And those are all things that you can learn."
Fortunately, there are a lot of resources available to help writers keep up with trends and tech, including podcasts, books and workshops.
Less glamour, more grit Is there anything left of the fantasy of champagne and book tours if a writer gets an agent and a traditional publisher?
Maybe for the bestsellers who are at the top of the pyramid and getting the biggest advances. Those are the authors whom traditional publishers support the most, says Maria Geraci, a Melbourne author and two-time finalist for the RITA, the top award in romance fiction. She'll appear on a panel Saturday that will discuss paths to publishing.
"Traditional publishing didn't really work for me," says Geraci, who was a labor and delivery nurse when she got her publishing deal. "I had four books published with Penguin-Berkley. They were all published a little differently. None of them really took off."
Then she saw the success her friends were having as indie publishers.
"They could write the kind of stories they wanted to write," Geraci says. "They were on their own timelines. They could market them the way that they wanted. They could respond very quickly to the way the industry was changing, and that was a really exciting thing to see, and I felt like I could make more money eventually and I could write the kind of stories that I wanted to."
She took her Whispering Bay romance series indie, and now she's also writing and publishing funny "chick-lit mysteries," as she calls them.
"I think it's important for writers to have options," says USA Today bestseller Eliza Knight.
Knight writes historical romances, as well as historical women's fiction under the name E. Knight. She's a hybrid author: She built her fan base with indie publishing, but she's writing romances for Sourcebooks and has a French revolution novel pending from William Morrow. Saturday, she'll talk about "How To Use Market Analysis To Sell More Books."
"You have to know your audience, and you have to know the kind of market you're dealing with," says Knight, who lives in Maryland.
She doesn't encourage authors to copycat others' work. Instead, she suggests they analyze successful books and dig deep into what readers are looking for — what excites them and what they want to learn, feel and connect with in a book.
Changing indie landscape While some authors make crazy money as indies, the gold rush of the early days is over, Connor says, and the market is changing all the time.
Authors "have to work a little bit harder," she says. "And people who have invested several years in writing now have an extensive backlist. They've got a great inventory, but the challenge from that side is how do you get in front of new readers? The other challenge is that a lot of the tried and true strategies no longer work."
Among the challenges, Knight says, are scammers exploiting Amazon's Kindle Unlimited subscription program. (Books must be exclusive to Amazon to participate, and authors are paid from a pool of money according to how many pages of their books are read.) Amazon owns 72 percent of the retail book market, according to a Codex survey, so whatever Amazon does affects most authors' income.
A quarter of the authors who responded to a recent Authors Guild survey earned zero book-related income in 2017, and median income for all respondents — traditional, indie, hybrid, part-time and full-time authors — was $6,080, down 3 percent from four years ago.
Full-time U.S. authors' median income rose slightly to $20,300, according to the survey, which had just over 5,000 respondents. The modest sample size and the fact that many people did not finish the survey, partly due to privacy concerns over its invasive financial questions, prompted some in the indie community to question the results. But it's hard to question the notion that there's a lot of competition out there.
More than a million books were published in the United States in 2017, more than triple the number in 2009 — and those are only the books tracked by Bowker, which sells ISBNs, unique identifier numbers for books. Not all book retailers require ISBNs, so the number is likely much higher.
Preparing for luck "There are as many ways to get published as there are books to be written, and it's terrifying," Suede says.
Still, he focuses on positivity. "My idea with marketing is, we are not all the same, but we can all help each other."
The indie world offers opportunities for niche genres like gay romance, which he writes. But the indie explosion means visibility might be even more challenging. He calls it the "eyeball problem."
"We deserve to have our voices heard. Books deserve to find their audiences," says Suede, who also has written for stage and screen and is on the national board of Romance Writers of America. "The trouble now is, it's not hard to write a book. It's not hard to publish a book. It's hard to have an audience for a book."
As his mom used to tell him, luck is opportunity plus preparation, and he always asks authors what they've done today to be ready for exposure. "Most authors don't even have the basics in place, like the most basic branding things," he says, and the idea of being "discovered" and elevated from nothing is just a myth.
"If you want it, you'll do the work. And if you don't, you won't. And most people don't want to earn success. They want to be given success without any effort."
The dream, Suede says, is writing the breakout bestseller that draws in new readers, that reinvents the world — that doesn't just imitate what's sold before. Every once in a while, an author does just that.
You can start small with advertising and ramp up, Farrell says. "Market, market, market in addition to writing a really solid book that's worth being talked about."
"If you hook a reader, they're going to look for the next book," Knight says.
"Study your craft, because we can always learn. I still learn things every day. But basically, it's 'Don't give up.' I even have it tattooed on my arm," she says with a chuckle. She and a group of her writer friends all got tattoos as a reminder to persist.
"You've got to put in the work and not to be scared of the work, because it's going to be a lot of work no matter what you decide to do. But if it's something you really love and you enjoy, then you should do it."

Texto completo: In 1957, The New York Times published a profile of President Dwight Eisenhower's first assistant for national security affairs, a position that would eventually become known as national security adviser. "No man in the Government, with the possible exception of the President, knows so many of the nation's strategic secrets," the Times declared of Robert "Bobby" Cutler. The paper then employed a mess of contradictions to describe this Massachusetts Republican. "A proper Bostonian" who is also a "Rabelaisian with a salty vocabulary," "an earnest Episcopalian" and "a man who can move so quickly from ribaldry to piety and back to ribaldry again," "a 'slave driver' who can force his staff to work as hard as he works himself" but also "a charming and generous friend," Cutler was "a bachelor's bachelor ... who has had a lifelong love affair" not with any person but with his hometown, Boston.
To add another paradox, barely hinted at by the Times: Cutler was a gay man who sat atop the national security bureaucracy at a time when people like him were being purged from government service.
This we know thanks to a new biography, "Ike's Mystery Man: The Secret Lives of Robert Cutler." Written by Cutler's great-nephew, Peter Shinkle, it is based largely upon a set of secret diaries that Cutler wrote during his time in the Eisenhower administration and that he never intended anyone, except the (human) object of his affection, to see. While the interests of America's historical record - long bereft of gay history, which is often elusive by nature - may be served by revealing the intimate details of Cutler's interior life, whether he merits a full-length biography is another matter.
Born into a Boston Brahmin family, Cutler was a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. After working as a lawyer, banker and political fixer, he got to know Eisenhower personally as an aide on his 1952 national whistle-stop campaign train tour. As much as Cutler's bloodline made him a natural fit for the WASP aristocracy leading the new Eisenhower administration, his sexual orientation threatened his privileged position.
Shortly after swearing the oath of office, Eisenhower began weeding "subversives" out of the federal government. Elected amid the Red Scare, Ike had won the presidency partly because of a sense that the long-reigning Democrats were soft on communism, which in the public mind had become linked with homosexuality. A whisper campaign, abetted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, tarred the recently divorced Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as a homosexual; Sen. Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., associated Stevenson with "the lavender lads of the State Department." Ike's campaign slogan, "Let's Clean House," alluded not only to corruption but sedition and sexual impropriety.
On Inauguration Day, Attorney General Herbert Brownell submitted a draft executive order to the new president mandating security background checks for all new federal employees. The following day, Cutler suggested a more sweeping policy, one that had been proposed by a government commission during the previous Truman administration but never implemented. Under the proposed regulations, sexual perversion" should be a factor in determining whether an employee posed a security risk, alongside the more conventional menace of communist sympathies. While "sexual perversion" was undefined, its intended target was obvious: homosexuals.
As a result of Executive Order 10450, signed by the president on April 27, 1953, thousands of patriotic gay men and women lost their jobs in what later became known as the "Lavender Scare," far more than would ever fall victim to the Red Scare. Shinkle's contribution to history is his revelation that a gay man played an important bureaucratic role in this tragedy by advocating a policy that lowered the threshold for dismissal from disloyalty to homosexuality.
There are not many more such previously undisclosed moments in this book, however, much of which treads familiar Cold War history. Cutler emerges as a bystander to far more significant figures like Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA Director Allen Dulles and Hoover.
Following a leave of absence Cutler took during the "politically sensitive" period around the 1956 re-election campaign, which may have been prompted by rumormongering about his sexuality, Hoover wrote the returning administration official a letter. "Dear Bobbie," the FBI director - himself a bachelor dogged by gay rumors - began, conspicuously using the feminine form. Cutler, no less catty in his reply, used letterhead from the bank at which he was working, embellished with the image of a Puritan and the motto, "Worthy of Your Trust."
"Ike's Mystery Man" becomes a genuinely engrossing read in its final third, when Cutler develops a romantic interest in a National Security Council staffer half his age. Thus begins, by his own description, "the greatest adventure of my life," an adventure that is by turns pathetic and illuminating. Pathetic, as the romance is unrequited yet strung along by the younger man, who at most admits to platonic love for Cutler. Illuminating, because it resembles the experiences of countless men and women who, forced for so long to mask their true selves, appeared to the world as mysteries.
James Kirchick, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of "The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues and the Coming Dark Age." He is writing a history of gay Washington.

Texto completo: On the very day that Roger Stone was charged with lying about a momentous set of leaks that originated with Russian hackers, a feisty band of transparency activists led by a Boston woman posted a voluminous collection of leaks from inside Russia.
It was less a coincidence than a trend, a consequence of technology and a defining feature of our time. We live in an age of leaks, for better or worse.
The better part is easy: We get access to information powerful people and institutions want to keep secret. The worse part is more complicated, and requires more thoughtful consideration than it gets: Leaks often violate laws against hacking or theft and invade people's privacy, not always with any higher purpose. They can be powerful, unpredictable, unfair weapons. They can allow one country to meddle, from a safe distance, in the affairs of another.
To wit: The Democratic Party emails and documents, hacked by Russian intelligence and broadcast by WikiLeaks with the veteran political trickster Mr. Stone as cheerleader, may have allowed a foreign power to help elect an American president in 2016. Yet the new, sprawling archive of Russian leaks, ranging from government ties to the Russian Orthodox Church to the Kremlin's management of its invasion of Ukraine, showed that the Russian state is a target of leaks these days as often as it is a leaker.
Mass leaks, on a scale inconceivable back in the paper-only era, have become so routine globally that only the most extraordinary get extended attention. In South Africa, a Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture is fueled by "Gupta Leaks," leaked emails detailing corrupt ties between government officials and the Gupta family's business empire. In Hungary, a Portuguese man was just arrested and admitted to playing a central role in "Football Leaks," which exposed unsavory financial dealings in international soccer. In Singapore, an American and his Singaporean physician boyfriend were accused of leaking the names of more than 14,000 people with an H.I.V. diagnosis.
Leaks, an ancient metaphor, are a venerable human institution. "A talebearer revealeth secrets," says Proverbs in an early complaint, "but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter." Thomas Paine, the revolutionary pamphleteer, has been described as the first American to be fired for leaking classified information -- in 1779.
But only in recent years have leaks attained industrial scale. A terabyte of data -- 100 million pages or 1,000 hours of video -- can now be slipped into your pocket on a thumb drive and carried off with your keys and chewing gum. If information is power, that is a lot of power in a small package. It is being wielded daily for many purposes.
The same technological change has made information vulnerable to hacking, which means that insiders are no longer the only people capable of leaking it. On a regular basis, companies announce cyberthefts of customer data, causing bureaucratic hassles for millions of people. At the other end of the scale, leaks occasionally target individuals for embarrassment or extortion.
But the most consequential leaks -- many of them more like floods -- are those that wield political power. The diplomatic cables Chelsea Manning gave to WikiLeaks in 2010 shed light on the hidden world of diplomacy. Edward Snowden's National Security Agency documents, shared with journalists in 2013, prompted the White House, and then Congress, to set new limits on the surveillance of Americans. The Panama Papers, leaked to a German newspaper in 2015, prompted investigations of tax evasion and money laundering around the world.
On balance, those gargantuan disclosures seem largely beneficial -- even if not all diplomats, intelligence officers and tax lawyers would join the applause. But the big leaks of the current era are not all about war and peace, government oversight or financial equity. For journalists, the catnip appeal of scoops can overwhelm careful judgment about the value of the disclosures and problematic questions about sources.
What about the Sony Pictures leaks -- an act of vengeance by the North Korean leader for an insulting movie -- which exposed mostly gossip, business secrets and employee Social Security numbers? What of the leaks of personal information from AshleyMadison.com, which helps facilitate extramarital affairs?
What, for that matter, about the 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails and 20,000 more pages of emails to and from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, that Mr. Stone is accused of lying about? That breach, weaponized by Russia in the midst of a presidential contest, illustrates well the ambiguous nature of such intrusions.
The leaks were, after all, not disinformation, even if they were obtained by criminal means. The emails were real, which was why they drew so much media attention. "Four of the Juiciest Leaked Podesta Emails," USA Today trumpeted a month before the 2016 election. The New York Times was only a little more demure: "Highlights From the Clinton Campaign Emails."
The leaks gave Mrs. Clinton cause to regret that she had not released the speeches she had delivered to private companies, which were now made public under the worst possible circumstances. It was agony for top Democrats whose private, sometimes snarky comments were aired.
For Donald Trump and his supporters, including his old friend Mr. Stone, the emails were a campaign boon, a justified public airing of hidden Clinton truths. For future political historians, they may offer a few meaningful tidbits of insight into the Clinton campaign.
Yet the leaks cannot be separated from those who made them happen: A foreign intelligence service intervened with significant impact on behalf of one side in an American election. Imagine that Russian officials had ignored Mrs. Clinton and instead hacked and published documents exposing Mr. Trump's epic tax dodges and secret payments to paramours. Even die-hard Trump partisans might recognize that the race could have come out the other way.
A different thought experiment, however, may be more timely. How would the leaks of Democratic emails be viewed had the data been hacked or leaked by a disgruntled American -- a false story that Russia and Trump supporters pushed in 2016 -- with no taint of foreign meddling? More Americans might accept the leaks as regrettable but inevitable political roughhousing.
Such a scenario may be worth pondering. American political operatives, we recently learned, have begun to imitate Russia's 2016 operations on social media, with two experiments in the 2017 Alabama Senate election.
So it is almost certainly only a matter of time before Americans try out the hack-and-leak technique as well, as any student of old-school campaign dirty tricks can tell you. Just ask Roger Stone, who wrote in his book "Stone's Rules": "To win you must do everything."

The Church and the Abortion Capital

Texto completo: In a sense it's not surprising that a renewed debate about abortion would begin in New York State, which passed a law last week -- since imitated, to more controversy, by Virginia Democrats -- ratifying the right to kill human beings in utero in the third trimester.
Almost 50 years ago, in 1970, New York passed the nation's most liberal abortion law, a template for the Roe v. Wade decision two years later. And the state has a justifiable reputation as (to quote a 2005 New York magazine story) "the abortion capital of America" -- with a strong pro-choice consensus and high abortion rates.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
But there is a forgotten chapter to this story. In 1972, New York's Assembly and Senate both voted narrowly to repeal the two-year-old abortion law. The only thing preventing repeal was the veto of the Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller -- and, of course, the intervention of the Supreme Court the following January.
This almost-successful repeal was not an isolated case. As Russell Hittinger pointed out in a 2010 essay for First Things, prior to Roe v. Wade the anti-abortion side was regularly winning political victories in places that we think of as liberal bastions today. The division on abortion that runs between red and blue states today ran through both political parties and every U.S. state two generations ago -- the "abortion capital" very much included.
This changed because of polarization and political tribalism, because currents in elite opinion reshaped liberal politics and backlash reshaped the G.O.P. But if you delve into this paper's coverage of those long-gone abortion debates, you'll be reminded that it also changed because the Catholic Church -- in New York, especially -- used to be an effective pro-life political force straddling partisan divides, instead of an institution devastated by attrition, internal division and the sex abuse disaster.
That declining influence is neatly distilled in the story of Mario and Andrew Cuomo. The father felt constrained by his Catholicism to at least agonize publicly over abortion, to insist that he could be pro-choice and "personally opposed." His son, a Catholic politician with a "First Girlfriend" who lit the Freedom Tower pink to celebrate late-term abortion, plainly fears neither God nor Cardinal Timothy Dolan.
In the case of Dolan, Cuomo's right to be blasé. New York State still has millions of baptized Catholics, but the faithful are divided and adrift and accustomed to tuning out messages from their bishops that don't fit their partisan preconceptions. (This goes for messages that criticize Donald Trump as well.) Dolan has tried to answer secularization with gregarious good cheer, but a bingo-hall winsomeness would be no match for cold indifference even without the church's scandals.
And yet it remains the case that deep inside the ransacked, decaying basilica that is American Catholicism, you can find the only vision that might transform the abortion debate, so that we don't end up with a permanent red-blue divide, in which the Supreme Court allows conservative states to pass restrictions but liberal states are radicalized toward eugenics and infanticide.
That vision isn't the "seamless garment of life" beloved of certain liberal Catholics, which effectively makes every issue a "life" issue, downgrading abortion to salve uneasy consciences. Rather, it's a more tailored seamless garment, one that would put the goal of outlawing abortion at the center of a web of pro-family policies -- adoption support, child allowances, wage subsidies for breadwinners. The goal would be to make the end of abortion seem less utopian by making the burdens of motherhood less daunting, and to link the pro-life cause to a larger revolt against sterility.
Maybe someday this vision will be embraced by one of our political parties -- after the G.O.P. nominates Tucker Carlson for president in 2024, perhaps. But for the time being, the leaders of the Catholic Church should act as though this vision, their vision, is more than a wouldn't-it-be-nice synthesis in bureaucratic documents, a generic humanitarianism that informs the smorgasbord of charitable programs mentioned in annual appeals.
Suppose that tomorrow Cardinal Dolan made two conjoined announcements. First, that Andrew Cuomo is excommunicated. Second, that a specific collection would henceforth be taken up at every Catholic Mass, every day, all year, to fund an annual family allowance administered by the Sisters of Life, available to any parent in the state who asked the church for help bearing and raising their child.
I have no idea how much money this would raise, no confidence in how effective it would be. But the church needs leaders who act as though they have confidence, not only in the church's teachings, but in its capacity to vindicate those teachings on its own, rather than through supplication to indifferent or hostile politicians.
Confidence alone cannot arrest decline. But it is a precondition for rebirth. And the church's vision will not matter in American politics until Catholicism becomes a power unto itself again -- one that does not need the favor of an Andrew Cuomo to promote the common good.

Texto completo: Margaret Garner, who was born as an enslaved girl, almost certainly did not plan to kill her child when she grew up and became an enslaved mother.
But she also couldn't yet know that the physical, emotional and psychological violence of slavery, relentless and horrific, would one day conspire to force her maternal judgment in a moment already fraught with grave imperative.
In January 1856, when Garner, known as Peggy, was 22 and pregnant, she decided to flee the plantation where she was enslaved, in Boone County, Ky. She escaped with her husband and his parents, as well as their four children, and crossed over the frozen Ohio River to the safe house of Elijah Kite, Garner's cousin, a free black man living in the free state of Ohio. Like hundreds of other enslaved black men, women and children, Garner and her family planned to use the Underground Railroad, which was then at its peak of operation, as the pathway to freedom.
Motherhood, across race, language, country and culture, is understood to be complicated and powerful: a tsunami of gut and joy and fear and heartache. Garner found herself in that fleeting, lightless instant of a mother's incongruous love on a frigid night, when slave catchers surrounded her cousins' home and when she made the decision, in one soul-chilling moment, to slit the throat of her 2-year-old daughter rather than return her to slavery.
Garner had already started on her three other children -- she intended to kill them all, and then herself -- when the federal marshals stormed the house to enforce the legal fact that she was not a mother or a wife, but the property of the man who owned her. She was immediately placed in prison.
Garner's story has been preserved in history as both sensational and singular. It writ large a question that had been unanswered in the homes and hearts of whites in pre-Civil War America: Was slavery a fate worse than death? Garner, with knife in hand, gave an answer that was impossible to ignore.
Scholars have written books examining the series of events that led up to that fateful night. For more than 150 years, poets and painters have mythologized her in their work. Most notably, Garner's case was the basis for Toni Morrison's 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "Beloved," which was made into a movie starring Oprah Winfrey and later became the inspiration for the 2005 opera "Margaret Garner," composed by Richard Danielpour, with a libretto by Morrison and starring the renowned mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves as Garner.
Only in these fictionalized versions of Garner are we given an idea of who she might have been as a black woman with an interior life, not just a runaway slave who committed a heinous crime.
She continues to be measured not by infamy, but by the shadows of her fortitude. As Morrison told NPR in 2010 while talking about the opera "Margaret Garner": "The interest is not the fact of slavery, the interest is what happens internally, emotionally, psychologically, when you are in fact enslaved and what you do in order to transcend that circumstance. That really is what 'Margaret Garner' reveals."
Born on June 4, 1833, Garner was the product of the rape of her black slave mother by a white slave master, characterized as a "mulatto" at the time.
Garner worked as a house slave for her owner, Archibald K. Gaines, and his family. She was gifted to Gaines's wife, as was the case for many young light-skinned girls born into slavery. They were wet nurses and personal servants, faux friends and perverse doppelgängers. Historians speculate that at least two of Garner's four children, also characterized as mulatto, were fathered by Gaines.
A story syndicated in The New York Times in 1856 about Garner and her family said "cruel treatment on the part of their master," was most likely what drove them to attempt an escape.
Garner's case eventually went to trial. It lasted more than two weeks -- one of the longest fugitive slave cases in history.
Newspaper coverage often described her physical appearance, and noted that she gave her testimony while holding her youngest child. The Cincinnati Gazette reported: "The babe, with its little hands, was continually fondling her face but she rarely noticed it, and her general expression was one of extreme sadness. Only once, when it put its hand to her mouth, we observed her smile upon it, and playfully bite its little fingers with her lips."
The abolitionist and lawyer John Jolliffe asked that Garner be tried for murder, which would have set a civil rights precedent; instead Garner was indicted on charges of damage of property.
Garner, her children and her husband were all shipped to Louisiana and sold off to a brother of Gaines, their former slave master.
Garner never hurt any of her remaining children -- one of whom drowned when the steamship transporting them to Louisiana crashed into another boat and threw her overboard.
She died in 1858 of typhoid fever.
1834-1858
Margaret Garner
In one soul-chilling moment, she killed her own daughter rather than return her to the horrors of slavery. Her life inspired a Toni Morrison novel.

Texto completo: In 1958, Danny and the Juniors crooned "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay," and they've yet to be proved wrong. Rock music has been part of the American pop-culture bedrock from the 1960s heyday of the Beach Boys and the Beatles through the arch '70s punk of the Ramones and Patti Smith, on through the '90s alternative rock of Pavement and Liz Phair. Today, thoughtful artists like Mitski, St. Vincent and the Arctic Monkeys
keep the torch lit. As long as there have been rock stars, though, there have been misconceptions about the genre. We dispel five of them as a prelude to next weekend's Grammy Awards.
Myth No. 1 Only teenagers embraced early rock-and-roll.
It's integral to the romance of rock-and-roll - the idea that in the early '50s, the nascent genre was too radical for grown-ups, leaving kids as its most fervent proponents. Rolling Stone credited a major part of the music's appeal to the name "rock-and-roll" itself. It was slang for sex, "a secret shared by the disc jockeys, the performers and the kids" at the expense of "responsible adults."
Time magazine noted in a 2015 article that the Senate was so wary of rock that it established a subcommittee to investigate whether the music encouraged juvenile delinquency. Summarizing the Beatles' early popularity in an article looking back at the era, the Week wrote, "Teenage girls were most susceptible to the pandemic, and side effects included stamping, weeping, fainting, and screaming."
But while teenagers were certainly screaming, they weren't the only ones hip to the sound. When Time covered rock in 1965, it reported that more than 40 percent of the so-called "teen beat" records sold in the United States were bought by people over 20. Time wrote: "The sudden public acceptance of rock 'n' roll by so many people who supposedly should know better came as no surprise to the record and radio industries. Their surveys have long shown the existence of a vast underground of adult rock 'n' roll fans." For example, when a rock radio station asked listeners to rate records, it was deluged with 18,000 calls, "all but a few from housewives."
Myth No. 2 Grunge was the province of white guys from Seattle.
When it comes to the rock subgenre grunge, certain bands pop up in the discussion as often as plaid flannel: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. The Washington Post has described them as the scene's "Big Four," and they share numerous qualities. In the late 1980s and early '90s, these bands entwined elements of punk and metal into their scrappy, boisterous rock. They were seen as an antidote to the flamboyant hair metal and new wave dominating MTV. Oh, and they were all men from Seattle and nearby cities, and almost entirely white. Every band mentioned in the introduction to Stereogum's 2018 list of "essential" grunge songs fit these descriptors, too. The New Republic looked back on grunge in 2017, suggesting, "Perhaps grunge was always the exclusive domain of a certain kind of man, one who is now out of date." The messy, masculine archetype of the grunge musician is so firmly established by now that Party City sells a "grunge wig" of shaggy, shoulder-length blond locks for $16.99.
But grunge, a catchall term that gobbled up many strains of alternative rock, was hardly homogenous. The scene was also a wellspring of female empowerment, with borders far beyond Washington and many strong feminists at the fore alongside Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Many women-led bands were integral to the scene, including L7 (from Los Angeles), Lunachicks (from New York) and Babes in Toyland (from Minneapolis). Karen Schoemer, writing in the New York Times in 1992, described Kat Bjelland, vocalist and guitarist of Babes in Toyland, as having "the kind of voice that would be more suited to a hoary, string-haired death-metal dude than to a cute 28-year-old blonde. Her voice is loud, brutal and vitriolic. It's not very ladylike, and it's not at all pretty." Hole (from Los Angeles), led by Courtney Love, sold more than 3 million albums, according to Billboard. The grunge scene was also meshed with riot grrrl, the feminist punk movement that championed autonomy and resistance to patriarchy and that continues to influence artists today.
Myth No. 3 Woodstock was a joyful bohemian paradise.
Rose-colored glasses are still our go-to for remembering the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair.
Fifty years after the festival was held on Max Yasgur's dairy farm in Bethel, N.Y. - featuring Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Janis Joplin with the Kozmic Blues Band, and Sly and the Family Stone - it is still celebrated as pop culture's most iconic weekend of peace and love. Rolling Stone swooned over its "hippie utopian dream" in 2017, and Salon called the free weekend "musical heaven on a hillside" in 2018. The documentary "Woodstock," released in 1970 and edited in part by a young Martin Scorsese, won an Academy Award for its beatific crowd shots of the swaying, fringed counterculture.
It's true that Woodstock offered a kind of drug-addled commune for the estimated 400,000 bohemians in attendance, but they thrived despite the conditions around them. Woodstock was so disastrously organized, it was nearly the Fyre Festival of its day. As Rolling Stone initially reported, food and water shortages, fields of mud, and day-long traffic jams created a landscape that resembled "a ravaged refugee camp," and a 17-year-old boy died after he was run over by a tractor. Entertainment Weekly pointed out that an estimated 5,000 people were treated for medical issues, including heatstroke and drug overdoses. As the Times reported, the site of the "sometimes excruciating, sometimes ecstatic" weekend was even declared a state disaster area. That the music could still transfix the crowd, and the weekend went as peacefully as it did, speaks to the generosity of spirit in its attendees, not any utopia.
Myth No. 4 A disproportionate number of rockers die at 27.
Rolling Stone points to "the 27 Club" as "one of the most elusive and remarkably tragic coincidences in rock & roll history" - the idea that more famous, self-destructive musicians die at that age than at any other. Cobain, Joplin, Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, Brian Jones and Jim Morrison are the most cited examples. When the Swedish DJ Avicii died in 2018, at age 28, Newsweek opened his obituary by noting that he was "barely older than the members of the notorious '27 club.' " When Cobain committed suicide in 1994, his mother, Wendy O'Connor, told reporters: "Now he's gone and joined that stupid club. I told him not to join that stupid club."
While many talented musicians were lost at 27, the age is meaningless - and focusing on it
irresponsibly mythologizes mental illness and the "tortured artist" stereotype. In truth, the most common age for musicians to die is 56, according to the Independent and the Conversation. Also, as many notable musicians have died at ages 26 (Gram Parsons, Otis Redding, Mac Miller, Nick Drake) and 28 (Tim Buckley, Shannon Hoon, Bradley Nowell, Big Pun). And some of the most famous rockers of their time are thriving to this day: Mick Jagger, Debbie Harry, Paul McCartney and Tina Turner are still vital performers well into their eighth decades.
Myth No. 5 Men invented rock-and-roll.
Rock-and-roll was built on cultural appropriation; early white artists did borrow, modify and outright steal from Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters and other black male R&B musicians. Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and the Rolling Stones incorporated R&B songs heavily into their sets and springboarded off them into new directions. The Beatles combined R&B with skiffle, a jazzy folk form. The Beach Boys' "Surfin' USA" is set to the music of Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen" but did not originally credit him. There is no shortage of articles that insist Berry, Waters and other black R&B bluesmen are the true, undersung creators of rock; when Berry died in 2017, he was feted as the "inventor" of the genre in Billboard, the Boston Globe and many other publications.
In fact, black women predated Berry in influencing the music we know today as rock-and-roll. Willie Mae "Big Mama" Thornton, a singer-songwriter from Alabama, first recorded "Hound Dog" in 1952, scoring a No. 1 hit - three years before Berry released his first single, "Maybellene." Sister Rosetta Tharpe from Arkansas combined guitar with gospel in the 1930s, bringing the previously pious form a fresh, fingerpicked style and secular audiences. Presley was an avowed fan of Tharpe's, as were Berry, Bob Dylan and other rockers. Called the "first guitar heroine of rock" by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Tharpe was finally nominated for induction in 2018.

Texto completo: For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded that the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied that he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on the conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. . . . Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
"My father knew nothing of the meeting or of these events," he said in a statement at the time of his testimony.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who now chairs the House Intelligence Committee, were openly skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to the New York Times, Trump Jr. said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show that Trump Jr. called back Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a phone number that was blocked in records.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
"They didn't want to know whether he had informed his father and sought his permission to take that meeting with the Russians," Schiff said in a 2018 interview with The Washington Post.
On Thursday night, Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad,'' he added.

When a poet shows he is jealous

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

Texto completo: Marriage is one of the biggest decisions you'll ever make, so the last thing you want to do is go in unprepared.
Money is the number-one issue couples fight about. In fact, Ramsey Solutions released a study that shows money fights are the second leading cause of divorce, behind infidelity. So, making sure you're on the same page about your finances with your future spouse is extremely important. When you sit down and talk with your partner about your finances, it builds a different level of trust in your relationship. You'll wind up growing closer to each other as a result.
Talking about money can be uncomfortable at first, but it's so worth it. Before you say "I do," here are a few questions you should ask yourself as you get ready to have the money talk with your future spouse.
Where are you currently with your finances? Both of you should answer this question and get it out on the table. How much debt do you have — including student loans, car loans, mortgages, credit cards and even personal loans? What's your annual income? How much do you have in savings?
Once you both have that information, you can make a plan to attack your debt. That leads us to a very important question — do you want debt to be a part of your marriage? I hope the answer is no, but you need to have this discussion. If you're determined to get out of debt and your spouse continues to pile up credit card debt, then you're headed toward a lot of marital stress.
Debt is a thief. It steals your money and your joy. The last thing you want to do is delay all of those dreams you have with your future spouse. Being debt-free will allow you to turn your dreams into a reality. So, make a plan to get out of debt together, and don't let it be an option ever again.
Am I a spender or a saver? You probably know the answer to this question immediately, right? Would you rather spend your time shopping at the mall or updating your budget in Excel?
The spender and the saver are total opposites, but it's true what they say — opposites attract. Often in marriage, one person is a spender and one is a saver. And that's OK. Just because one likes to spend and one the other likes to save doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. You balance each other out.
The problems start when you go through life without understanding each other's natural tendencies. You have to start by embracing one another's differences. There is no right or wrong here. The key is to communicate and make a plan for your money together. Spenders shouldn't let all of the budgeting fall to the saver and vice versa. You are one now.
Do I understand how a budget works? If you don't know how to make a budget, stop what you're doing and learn how to create one. I know what you may be thinking... "Budgets are the worst." or "You can't have fun when you're on a budget." Budgeting might seem restrictive but telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went actually gives you permission to spend. It's also a great way to deepen communication with your spouse because you're planning for your future together.
Your budget is your game plan. With a zero-based budget, you list your monthly income at the top of the page. Then list all your monthly expenses — gas, food, rent, debt payments and so on — below that. The income minus the outgo should equal zero. Every dollar should have a "name." Give yourself grace. It will take a few months to get used to budgeting, but you'll get there.
What are your fears? This might not be a fun question, but it's an important one. Fear can make us do crazy things, especially when it comes to your money. Fear is what leads to people hiding purchases from their spouse or getting a secret credit card. Both of which are bad ideas, by the way.
Maybe you're afraid because you don't have the security that comes with savings or maybe you're scared because you're living paycheck to paycheck, like most Americans. Whatever they are, share them with your fiancé. Getting your fears out on the table will help you to get on the same page when it comes to your values and money.
What are your dreams? Where do you picture yourself (and your spouse) years from now? Where do you picture yourself (and your spouse) years from now? What type of lifestyle are living? You probably already know the answer, and these are things you should be sharing with each other, too.
Talking about money with your partner binds you on an intimate level unlike anything else. You wind up sharing your hopes and dreams together, and who doesn't want that? The honeymoon doesn't have to end when your wedding is over. Dream together, and make a plan for your money together. I promise, you'll add a sense of peace in your marriage that could not exist with debt.

Does Colorado need a new way to pick presidents?

Texto completo: Colorado is on track to join 11 other states and the District of Columbia in attempting to decree that the winner of the popular vote nationally — not the candidate who captures the Electoral College — will be the victor in future presidential races.
Senate Bill 42, proposed by Sen. Mike Foote, D-Lafayette, would change how Colorado’s electors, the people who choose our presidents, cast their votes every four years.
While Republican lawmakers might oppose the change, they are in the minority in the state House and Senate. And, with a Democratic governor, passage seems assured.
Colorado’s electors now cast their votes for the presidential candidate who receives the most votes in the state. Under SB 42, the state’s electoral votes would be cast for whichever presidential candidate wins the national popular vote, regardless of who wins Colorado’s popular vote.
In 1996, for example, Colorado electors voted for Republican Bob Dole because he won the state’s popular vote over Democrat Bill Clinton. But Clinton won the national, as well as the Electoral College, vote that year. Under SB 42, Colorado electoral voters would have gone to Clinton.
The move to change how the nation elects presidents comes in the wake of the 2016 election, in which Democrat Hillary Clinton received nearly 2.9 million more votes nationwide than Republican Donald Trump. But the Electoral College — the traditional name for the electors of all states — made Trump president because he won more state electoral votes.
While Hillary Clinton won large popular-vote majorities in big states such as California, New York and Illinois, Trump won majorities in more states, giving him 306 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232.
“If you change the system to a national popular vote election, candidates will campaign nationwide and not just focus on a few slivers of a few states,” Foote said. “Each voter will be recognized as important and it will lead to the winner actually governing with the entire country in mind.”
The Senate in late January approved Foote’s bill, voting along party lines, sending the measure to the House, where it is sponsored by Reps. Jeni Arndt, D-Fort Collins, and Emily Sirota, D-Denver.
Gov. Jared Polis supports the bill, a spokeswoman said.
An identical bill failed in a Republican-controlled Senate committee two years ago. A similar attempt fell flat about a decade ago.
Now that Democrats hold the majority in the statehouse and the governorship, they plan to use it, Arndt said.
“The Democrats are in charge because there was an election. We didn’t trick anybody,” Arndt said. “That’s not sneaky. That’s not underhanded. That’s responding to what the voters said.”
Revenge, or close to it
There have been five presidents elected despite losing the popular vote , but many see the growing national movement as a reaction to Trump’s 2016 election. Republican George W. Bush also won in 2000 despite Democrat Al Gore’s narrow national popular vote victory.
If the bill isn’t revenge, it’s not far off, said Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, who voted against the measure in committee and again on the Senate floor, strongly denouncing it both times.
“It looks like there are ill feelings on the presidential election a couple years ago and a few years previous to that,” Sonnenberg said. “And this is the way for some folks to think they can rectify it.”
Sonnenberg and Sen. Bob Gardner, R-Colorado Springs, who also opposed the bill, said Colorado would be ceding its voice in presidential elections to liberal urban centers such as New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Foote said the idea arose in the 1960s, preceding Trump’s and Bush’s victories. In the past, he said, it had support from Republicans.
“The fact that Trump was elected the way that he was in 2016 has turned it into more of a partisan issue than it was before,” he said.
Sirota said the measure will likely be heard by a House committee in February. In the meantime, Democrats will try to drum up support from across the aisle, she said.
At least three electors
The system of electors was established in Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1789, and revised by the 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804. (See the accompanying box.)
The system was tied to the debate over how states should be represented in Congress.
“The small states said they would not join the union unless they had equal representation in Congress,” said Robert Hardaway, a law professor at the University of Denver, who has written several books on the topic.
“The big states thought it should be based on population alone. The compromise between those two factions, known as The Grand Compromise, was to do both. Have a Senate and a House.
“The Electoral College, in turn, is based on the numbers of representatives in the House and the number of senators (states) have,” he said.
Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia employ a winner-take-all system for presidential elections. This means whichever candidate wins the popular vote within the state wins all of that state’s electoral votes.
Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes by whichever candidate wins each respective district within the state. The Constitution leaves that choice up to the states.
In all, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A presidential candidate must win a majority of 270 votes to win the presidency.
California boasts the most electoral votes in the country at 55. North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Delaware and Alaska have the least with three electoral votes each.
Some claim the Electoral College was created to maintain the rights of slave owners, Hardaway said. But he dismissed that as “urban legend.”
The Electoral College system’s net effect is to give smaller states more of a say in who becomes president than would be the case otherwise. Each state has at least three electors no matter how small it is.
For example, California has 68.5 times more residents than Wyoming. But in the Electoral College, California has only 18.3 times more electors than Wyoming.
For all its faults, the Electoral College facilitates a two-party system in the country’s elections, Hardaway said. It brings stability to presidential elections that have become the envy of the world, he said.
On average, about once a century a presidential candidate wins the Electoral College without also winning the national popular vote. But, even so, he said, the margins usually are relatively close and the winning candidate still has the support of a large percentage of the country.
Colorado Democratic lawmakers, on the other hand, say each vote should count equally and the majority should win.
In SB 42, they’re proposing to use the national popular vote by combining the electoral votes of all states that join the pact and commit them to the candidate that earns the most votes nationally.
“One person, one vote,” Foote said. “Let’s elect our president together.”
‘It couldn’t get any worse’
The pact would only take effect if enough states join to add up to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
Each of the states in the pact — among them New York, California, Maryland, Vermont and Washington — voted for Democratic candidates in the last five presidential elections.
Even so, Foote said about a third of the lawmakers who supported the change in those states were Republicans.
The measure preserves the Electoral College, which would take a constitutional amendment to abolish. It just changes the way the votes are allocated, proponents have said.
And each state can still back out of the pact if its legislature wishes to do so, though there are restrictions on how close to an election that would be allowed.
Under the current system, presidential candidates typically only visit and focus their efforts on battleground states, Foote said. States that typically vote either red or blue fall by the wayside.
If votes are combined on the national scale, candidates will have a greater incentive to travel across the country, appealing to more voters and better understanding their concerns, Foote said.
But Republicans such as Sonnenberg fear that with the change rural areas will be further ignored and candidates will gravitate toward major urban population centers.
Hardaway agreed.
“Candidates would go where the votes are,” he said. “The votes are in the big cities.”
Potential for a challenge
The measure would also boost voter participation, Arndt said. Republicans in blue states like California and Democrats in red states like Texas would be more likely to cast their ballot if they knew they could influence the outcome nationally.
Governors, senators and representatives are elected by popular vote, Foote noted. “I don’t see why that would be such a foreign idea (with presidential elections).”
Arndt mused that there would be an outcry if presidents were elected by the national popular vote, and politicians tried to impose an Electoral College.
But Hardaway said the countries that use the national popular vote, which he calls the “Russian-style” direct election, sometimes face problems.
France has that system, Hardaway said, and in the country’s April 2017 election, there were so many candidates that the candidate with the most votes got about 24 percent.
Ultimately the election went to a runoff between Emmanuel Macron, who ran as the candidate of a newly formed party, and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
“They got two people that, in the country, 65 percent of the people didn’t want either,” Hardaway said.
Ultimately, Macron won the election, but voters were so dismayed at their choices that a record number — about 600,000 people — cast blank ballots in protest, Hardaway said.
The pact to have electors follow the national popular vote is, on its face, unconstitutional, Sonnenberg says.
“After doing a little more research and reading, it appears that states cannot make compacts among each other,” he said. “So there indeed is potential for a constitutional challenge.”
Foote disagreed, saying the Constitution allows each state to allocate electoral votes however the legislature chooses.
But the measure is also likely to be challenged in court nationally because if just enough states join to amount to 270 electoral votes, the other states would be disenfranchised, Hardaway said.
Arndt sees the issue differently.
It’s not that those other states would be disenfranchised, it’s that the majority would have spoken, she said.
“It’s just beating them,” she said. “(A losing vote isn’t) squelched. It’s heard. It just didn’t prevail.”
Then there’s the matter of finding universal agreement on the national popular vote, Hardaway said. There is no unified system — the states each count their votes — and the popular vote is calculated not by the federal government, but by national news agencies like the New York Times, Fox News and MSNBC.
That’s not a huge hurdle, Arndt said.
“How hard is it?” she said. “Each state has their election returns and they’re all certified by the secretary of state (of each state). If the New York Times can add it up, couldn’t the federal government?”
Perhaps the biggest sticking point, according to Gardner and Sonnenberg, is that it’s possible for the majority of Coloradans to vote for one candidate, but the state’s electoral votes to go to the other.
“We’re essentially erasing state boundaries in a way,” Gardner said. “Making it less important to be a state.”






‘Just the latest scheme’
The proposal is so riddled with flaws and holes that Hardaway said it can’t be a genuine effort. Instead, it’s likely meant to cause enough of a stir to shift the national conversation toward amending the U.S. Constitution, he said.
“This is just the latest scheme. And there have been all kinds of schemes, but none have been worth anything, and this is the worst of them all,” he said. “Every time somebody does this, all they want to do is change the Constitution so they can make sure their guy wins next time.”
But Foote said that sounds more like a conspiracy than reality.
“If that’s the master plan, then I’m certainly not aware of it,” he said.
Sonnenberg and Gardner acknowledge that the bill is more than likely to be signed into law, given that Polis has signaled his support.
Sirota and Arndt expressed confidence in Democratic support within the House. House Minority Leader Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, did not return a message seeking comment.
Even if the bill is signed into law, the pact doesn’t become effective until enough states join and that’s unlikely to happen this year, Foote said. It’s unlikely the measure would affect the 2020 presidential election.
If it does pass, Democrats will continue to press their agenda nationwide and support other states that might enter the pact. Foote noted that Republican legislatures will eventually have to pass the measure as well for it to go into effect.
Gardner said opponents can try and dissuade additional states from joining or eventually file a lawsuit, which would likely make its way quickly to the Supreme Court.

Texto completo: Narrated by Tom Hanks, message stresses value of newsgathering to society
The Washington Post will debut its first Super Bowl commercial - a message underscoring the importance of newsgathering and the dangers journalists can face - during Sunday's game between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. The 60-second spot, narrated by actor Tom Hanks, will air in the fourth quarter of the game, shortly before the two-minute warning.
The commercial, produced in partnership with Mark Woollen and Associates, shows scenes from major news events from World War II through the present day. Hanks's narration describes the role of journalists as eyewitnesses and gatherers of fact as well as the profession's larger importance to society. The commercial ends with The Post's logo and its slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness."
"The Super Bowl is a remarkable moment to recognize the courage and commitment of journalists around the world that is so essential to our democracy," said Fred Ryan, publisher and CEO of The Washington Post. "We decided to seize the opportunity to make this a milestone moment in our ongoing campaign."
The advertisement will briefly show several slain and missing journalists affiliated with The Post and other publications. They include freelance reporter Austin Tice, who has been missing in Syria for more than six years. Tice is believed to be alive, though his whereabouts are unknown. Another freelance journalist, columnist Jamal Khashoggi, was killed at the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The CIA determined, with high confidence, that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's killing.
A third journalist shown in the commercial, Marie Colvin, was an American war correspondent for the Sunday Times in London. She was killed in 2012 by Syrian forces while reporting in Homs, Syria. Colvin is the subject of the 2018 film "A Private War," and on Wednesday, a U.S. court ordered the Syrian government to pay $302 million in damages to Colvin's family.
Ryan said The Post purchased the spot when it became available last week. A Post spokeswoman declined to say how much the advertisement cost to produce, or how much money The Post paid for the slot. CNBC reported that CBS is charging a record $5.25 million for a 30-second slot.
Some advertisers begin planning their ads months before the big game, but The Post's commercial was produced in one week. Choosing Hanks as the narrator was a nod to his role as former Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee in the 2017 Steven Spielberg film "The Post," about the paper's decision to publish the Pentagon Papers.
Previous Post advertisements that ran on TV were used to sell subscriptions. But this commercial has a different goal.
"This was a chance for a broader message about the role journalists play in our everyday lives and the risks they take to bring us the facts," Ryan said.
During the 2017 Academy Awards, the New York Times debuted its first ad campaign in more than a decade. Agency Droga5 created a commercial that hinges on the phrase "The truth is," presenting a series of conflicting statements and ending with bold type that reads: "The truth is more important now than ever." It, too, did not include any information about buying a subscription.
An ongoing ad campaign for CNN carries the tagline "Facts first."
After the game, The Post's commercial will be published on its website and social media channels.

Senate investigators: Trump Jr.'s mystery phone calls weren't with his father

Texto completo: For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded that the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied that he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on the conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. . . . Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
"My father knew nothing of the meeting or of these events," he said in a statement at the time of his testimony.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who now chairs the House Intelligence Committee, were openly skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to the New York Times, Trump Jr. said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show that Trump Jr. called back Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a phone number that was blocked in records.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
"They didn't want to know whether he had informed his father and sought his permission to take that meeting with the Russians," Schiff said in a 2018 interview with The Washington Post.
On Thursday night, Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad,'' he added.

'They are wrong!' Donald Trump crosses swords with intel chief Dan Coats – again

Resumen: President Donald Trump's clashes with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats have become familiar. So have Trump's tortured attempts to retreat.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – When Dan Coats was tapped by President Donald Trump to be his intelligence director, some of the Indiana Republican's former Senate colleagues wondered if he was too nice for the job.
“I’m not sure likeability and affability are the qualities I want in this position,” Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told Coats at his confirmation hearing. "You’re going to be reporting to a president who may or may not want to hear what you have to say. ”
That turned out to be an understatement.
"They are wrong!" Trump tweeted Wednesday, after Coats and other leaders of the intelligence services backed differing views of the president's on Iran and North Korea when testifying before Congress this week.
Trump backtracked Thursday, accusing the news media of incorrectly describing the testimony, after initially telling reporters that time will prove him right and his intelligence leaders wrong.
That's become a familiar pattern.
Here's a recap of the clashes between Trump and his director of national intelligence.
Trump sides with Putin
At a news conference in last July, Trump appeared to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's denial of interference in the 2016 elections over what Coats and others had said are undisputed facts.
"My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me, some others, they said they think it's Russia," Trump said as he stood next to Putin at a joint news conference between the two leaders following their talks in Helsinki. "I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be. "
In response, Coats issued a statement saying the intelligence community has been "clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy. "
"We will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security," Coats also said.
The next day, Trump said he had misspoken, and that he meant to say he saw no reason why it "wouldn't" be Russia that interfered.
Another reversal
The day after walking back those comments in July, Trump was asked by reporters whether Russia is still targeting the U. S.
"No," he said, again contradicting statements Coats had made.
After another public furor, the White House said Trump's response was misunderstood.
Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump was “saying ‘no’ to answering questions" from the reporters, not "no" to the question itself.
Coats' candid reaction
While some commentators urged Coats to resign to protect his honor and the honor of the intelligence community, he appeared unruffled.
"As long as I'm able to have the ability to seek the truth and speak the truth, I'm on board," Coats said when asked that week in July if he'd ever considered quitting.
But he couldn't keep his composure when, during the live interview with NBC's Andrea Mitchell at the Aspen Security Forum, news broke that Trump had invited Putin to Washington.
Coats grimaced.
"OK . . . ," he said, while laughing. "That's going to be special. "
Coats also said he had not known in advance of Trump's 2017 White House meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, at which Trump revealed highly classified information. The meeting, Coats said, was "probably not the best thing to do. "
Was Coats "Anonymous"?
Because of Coats' candor, he was immediately among those speculated to be the author of a September New York Times essay that offered blistering criticism of Trump. The anonymous writer, described by the Times as a "senior official in the Trump administration," described the president as erratic and amoral.
Coats called the speculation that his office penned the letter "patently false. "
"We did not," Coats said in a statement. "From the beginning of our tenure, we have insisted that the entire (intelligence community) remain focused on our mission to provide the president and policymakers with the best intelligence possible. "
Coats' increases transparency
In January, Coats issued publicly his agency's 2019 report on major threats, a departure from past years when the office generates both a public report and a separate classified version. The Washington Post described the change as "an effort by Coats to be more transparent in the face of sustained attacks from the president and his allies on the right against what they've taken to calling the Deep State. "
In the reports' introduction, Coats said he is fortunate to lead an intelligence community "composed of the best and brightest professionals. "
Contradicting Trump
Trump had a different description of that community Wednesday.
"The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran," Trump tweeted. "Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!"
While Trump defended his decision to withdraw the United States from the Iranian nuclear deal – in which the U. S. and allies eased sanctions on Tehran as it gave up the means to make nuclear weapons – the intelligence community said the country continues to live up to its end of the bargain.
"We do not believe Iran is currently undertaking activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device,” Coats told senators Tuesday.
Trump continues to plan a second summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – date and location to be determined – and expresses confidence that Kim is committed to junking his nuclear weapons programs.
But Coats also testified Tuesday that North Korea is "unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons. "
In tweets, Trump said the U. S. relationship with North Korea is "the best it has ever been. " He said they have stopped nuclear testing, and claimed a "decent chance of Denuclearization. "
Blaming the media
Asked by reporters Thursday if he still has confidence in Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel to give him good advice, Trump responded, "No, I disagree with certain things that they have said. "
"I think I'm right, but time will prove that," Truimp added. "Time will prove me right, probably. "
But, in later remarks to reporters and in a tweet, Trump said there was no difference in views between him and his intelligence leaders.
"Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media," Trump tweeted. "We are all on the same page!"
What's next?
Hours after that tweet, the New York Times released excerpts from a Thursday interview with Trump in which he was asked about Coats.
"I’m happy with Dan Coats. I am," Trump responded, before adding: "That doesn’t mean . . . . "
Asked if that's a change, Trump remained cryptic.
"Well, no, everybody changes," he said. "You know, this business, other than me, everybody changes. "

Hogan 2020?; Our view: The sudden presidential buzz around our moderate Republican governor is well and good - unless he starts trying to appeal to GOP primary voters

Texto completo: We agree with Rep. Andy Harris so rarely that we feel compelled to point to a very sensible thing he said last weekend about the presidential buzz that's suddenly attached itself to Gov. Larry Hogan. "I believe Larry Hogan is exactly the kind of Republican who can be elected in Maryland," Dr. Harris said at a Saturday conference of Maryland conservatives, according to the website Maryland Matters. "I don't know if he's the kind of Republican who can be elected nationwide." And there's the rub: Mr. Hogan's willingness to compromise with Democrats on issues like health care, government spending and the environment have made him popular in Maryland but would make him a pariah among base Republican voters who typically vote in presidential primaries. Yet that isn't stopping the idea of Hogan 2020 from getting heaps of buzz in The New York Times, Washington Post, Politico, fivethirtyeight.com and more. Mr. Hogan is clearly intrigued. He's reportedly meeting with some of those asking to him run and is planning to do some waters-testing in the first caucus state of Iowa when he's there as head of the National Governors Association in March.
Maybe Mr. Hogan is enjoying the moment and soaking up some attention while he can. But maybe he really will run - and that could be bad news. We say that not because he's unqualified to be president - in what may be the faintest praise we've ever uttered, he is manifestly more so than the actual president. We're not worried that a campaign would divert his attention from running the state - his has often been a light hand on the tiller while the General Assembly drives policy, and that's worked out pretty well. We aren't scared of retaliation against Maryland by President Trump. He certainly might try, but the Democratic House, led by the former Nancy D'Alesandro, would presumably have our back. Nor is our concern that he would lose, and badly, to a president with a lock on the Republican base and a way of eviscerating opponents on the campaign trail. Losing in a campaign that stands for a sane conservative alternative to Trumpism (and weakens the president's general election prospects in the bargain) would be a worthwhile pursuit.
No, our worry is that Governor Hogan might actually try to do what it takes to win caucuses and primaries in crucial states like Iowa and South Carolina. Adopting policies and politics to appeal to those electorates would amount to a historic bait-and-switch for Maryland voters.
Remember last year, when Governor Hogan backed post-Parkland gun control measures in the General Assembly; worked with Democrats to enact a temporary state-level health insurance premium tax to fund an effort to save Maryland's Obamacare exchange; pocketed another de facto tax increase as a down payment on increased education funding; joined an alliance of governors to oppose the president's policies on climate change; and pulled Maryland National Guard troops from the border in protest of the Trump administration's family separation policy? If he's trying to make a play for traditional Republican presidential primary voters, you can kiss that Larry Hogan goodbye. How about the Larry Hogan who steers clear of divisive social issues like abortion and gay marriage? It was nice knowing that guy.
Of course, neither the president nor his surrogates would be apt to let primary voters forget Mr. Hogan's various apostasies to conservative doctrine. And that's where things could get dicey for Marylanders who thought they were getting four more years of the moderate, not-too-partisan Larry Hogan. It wouldn't be sufficient for the governor to start talking like a far-right conservative; he would have to start acting like one, too, and that would mean conflict in Annapolis the likes of which we haven't seen. (We got a little worried about that this week when, during an appearance on PBS' NewsHour, he promised to announce a major tax cut during his State of the State, but fortunately, he offered up some decidedly modest ideas instead.)
Taking a sudden right turn wouldn't work anyway. We have no doubt that Mr. Hogan can throw red meat to the base like the best of them, but he has at this point spent too much time and effort cementing his brand as a pragmatic centrist to credibly present himself as anything else. If he's going to run, better to stay true to himself and lose than to play politics and still lose.

Texto completo: The Massachusetts attorney general's office on Thursday made public a full copy of its lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, which it accuses of igniting the opioid epidemic through the deceptive marketing of its painkillers, including OxyContin.
The court filing details how the company considered expanding into addiction treatment, how much the Sackler family that controls Purdue and company executives were paid, and how the company was advised by McKinsey & Co. to improve its image in the face of concerns about addiction and overdoses.
STAT and ProPublica on Wednesday reported most of the still-secret contents of the suit, which were officially sealed until Thursday afternoon, at Purdue's request.
The document was released after a group of media organizations, including STAT and The Boston Globe, filed a motion in a Massachusetts court asking for it to be made fully public. A state judge on Monday ruled that it should be released, and an appellate judge on Thursday denied Purdue's request to halt its publication.
The lawsuit also names current and former Purdue executives and members of the Sackler family, which controls the privately held company, as defendants.
Since 2007, the Sackler family has received more than $4 billion from Purdue, according to the newly public portions of the lawsuit. The filing also says that since 2007, Purdue has paid out more than $25 million to former CEO John Stewart; more than $27 million to former CEO Mark Timney; and more than $8.6 million to current CEO Craig Landau. All three are named as defendants. Landau's salary is estimated to be $5 million a year.
Overall, the lawsuit depicts Purdue pushing its sales representatives to get more of the company's drugs prescribed to more people, for longer periods of time, and at higher doses, even as warnings about the addictive properties of the drugs and the risk of overdose they posed were brought to the company's attention. It also alleges that members of the Sackler family tightly steered the company.
One newly released section describes the intense day-to-day involvement of Dr. Richard Sackler, a son of one of the company's founders and a past president of Purdue. The complaint says he “interrupted sales staff many times a day": “I had hoped you would have updated this," “Will I have it by noon?" “get to this ASAP," he told staff in e-mails in 2012. “Staff advised each other," the complaint continues, “avoid as much e-mail with dr. r as you can."
Sales vice president Russell Gasdia wrote to the then-CEO “in exasperation," the document says: “I'm not sure what we can do about Dr. Richard."
Another newly public section alleges that Richard Sackler suggested in 2017 that Purdue drop Cigna as the company's health insurer after Cigna announced that it was eliminating OxyContin from its list of covered drugs, part of an effort that the insurer framed as endorsing safer prescribing practices.
In a statement, a Purdue spokesman said that Massachusetts, with its lawsuit, “seeks to publicly vilify Purdue, its executives, employees, and directors by taking out of context snippets from tens of millions of documents and grossly distorting their meaning. The complaint is riddled with demonstrably inaccurate allegations." It said the state “offers little evidence to support its sweeping legal claims."
The other media organizations that joined STAT and the Globe in filing the motion to release the full lawsuit were Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, WBUR, and The New York Times.
In the document released Thursday, there was one paragraph missing that had been mostly redacted in an earlier version of the lawsuit. Defense attorneys argued that it contained private medical information, so a judge recommended it be deleted before the filing was made public. The only clue to its contents was the last line, which was unredacted in the earlier complaint: “Purdue staff knew that people would bend the rules when Richard Sackler wanted something."

Knicks Trade Porzingis, Betting They Can Draw 2 Star Free Agents

Texto completo: The Knicks shook the N.B.A. on Thursday by abruptly cutting ties with Kristaps Porzingis, sending the player long billed as their 7-foot 3-inch savior to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster trade that could make New York a major player in free agency this July.
The deal, which was first disclosed by The New York Times, came one week before the N.B.A.'s trading deadline and changes the course of the Knicks' franchise. Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke have all been shipped to Dallas in exchange for the promising guard Dennis Smith Jr., who was a first-round draft pick in 2017, two future first-round picks and the expiring contracts of the veterans DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews.
Porzingis, who was increasingly unhappy about the Knicks' constant losing and is scheduled to become a restricted free agent July 1, asked to be traded on Thursday, according to both a team statement and subsequent comments that Knicks President Steve Mills and General Manager Scott Perry made on a conference call Thursday evening.
But the Knicks and the Mavericks were already far along in trade talks before Porzingis lodged that request, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
"As is standard for this time of year, we were exploring various options on potential trades," Perry said in a statement. "Considering the uncertainty regarding Kristaps's free-agent status and his request today to be traded, we made a trade that we are confident improves the franchise."
On the conference call, Mills described Porzingis as a player "that no longer wanted to be part of our group."
In a farewell Twitter post Thursday night, Porzingis said: "New York will always have a special place in my heart. Grateful for everybody who made this journey so special for my family and I."
Dallas's willingness to acquire the contracts of Hardaway and Lee in order to land Porzingis clinched the deal and will position the Knicks to create nearly $75 million in salary-cap space this summer -- enough to offer maximum contracts to two of the top players expected to be free agents. Golden State's Kevin Durant and Boston's Kyrie Irving are frequently mentioned as Knicks targets.
Porzingis established himself as an All-Star last season but tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a game early last February. He has not played since and never regained his trust in the organization, which has been waning since the final days of Phil Jackson's ill-fated tenure as team president and could not be repaired by Mills, Perry and David Fizdale, who is in his first season as the Knicks' coach.
Even though Porzingis has been sidelined for nearly a year, Dallas was sufficiently motivated to surrender prized assets such as Smith and the two first-round picks (likely to be conveyed in 2021 and 2023) to get the deal done.
The Mavericks now hope to win over Porzingis, 23, keep him in Dallas and make him the team's co-star alongside the 6-7 Luka Doncic, who is only 19 but has already emerged as a standout in his first season in the N.B.A. In Dallas's dream scenario, Porzingis, who is from Latvia, and Doncic, who is from Slovenia, will form a partnership reminiscent of the retired Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki, who, at 40 and in his 21st season with the Mavericks, may be playing his final N.B.A. campaign.
"We obviously think Porzingis is a great young talent, similar in many ways to Dirk," Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle told 103.3 FM radio in Dallas before his team played Thursday night in Detroit. "This is kind of a Dirk-and-Nash type of situation, only these guys are taller."
For the Knicks, being able to shed the contracts of both Hardaway and Lee had become a priority before next week's trade deadline, as The Times reported last week. So they jumped at the opportunity to do the deal with Dallas rather than spend the next week seeing what other teams might offer for Porzingis.
The Knicks have been regarded in league circles for some time as the foremost threat to sign Durant away from the Warriors in July. The deal with Dallas means they will have the financial wherewithal to do so -- and likewise to pursue Irving.
The Knicks, with a league-worst record of 10-40, are also on course to have a 14 percent chance at securing the top pick in the June draft, which would enable them to select Zion Williamson, the highly coveted Duke forward.
Smith was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2017 draft, passed over by the Knicks and Jackson, who drafted a different backcourt player: Frank Ntilikina of France. Dallas has been trying to trade Smith for weeks, having quickly concluded that the ball-dominant guard, despite his robust athleticism, is not an ideal fit with Doncic.
In a timely sales job to his new employers, Smith posted a career-high 15 assists, along with 13 points and 10 rebounds, in the Mavericks' 114-90 victory over the Knicks on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden.
Jordan and Matthews are on expiring contracts that the Knicks can try to trade before next Thursday's 3 p.m. deadline. It is widely expected that both players will seek contract buyouts from the Knicks if they are not traded again before the deadline so they can seek roster spots with playoff-bound teams for the remainder of the season. Yet it should be noted that Jordan is one of Durant's closest friends, which might factor into where he wants to be in the months ahead.
Porzingis, whose selection at No. 4 over all by the Knicks in the 2015 draft was initially panned by critics, made steady progress in his first two and a half seasons and was averaging 22.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game at the time of his injury. Perhaps as impressively, when healthy, Porzingis consistently gave the impression that he had the fortitude to thrive in the intense, media-driven atmosphere that surrounds the Knicks in New York.
There will now be immense pressure on the Knicks to land players at the Durant/Irving level to justify the trade -- assuming Porzingis recovers fully from his A.C.L. tear. Kemba Walker, the Charlotte Hornets' All-Star guard, is another free agent known to interest the Knicks.
No matter what happens in the free-agent market this summer, Dallas has furnished the Knicks with two attractive draft assets. The Mavericks surrendered their first available first-round pick (2021 at the earliest) that has no protections and a pick protected only through the first 10 choices (as early as the 2023 draft). Dallas was not permitted to trade its top pick in the draft this June because it already traded that selection to Atlanta in the deal last June to acquire the draft rights to Doncic. Regardless, the Knicks are already looking ahead.
"We're extremely confident in the direction that we're headed," Perry said.

For decades, the sign atop the Marcal Paper Mills plant had been a landmark for New Jersey drivers, its red neon light a beacon to weary travelers that told them how close they were to home.
But on Wednesday night, roads near the iconic sign in Elmwood Park were illuminated by something else: a raging blaze that felled the sign and consumed the 1940s building that supported it.
The conflagration was one of three major fires that area firefighters battled amid frigid temperatures and harsh, blustering winds brought on by a polar vortex.
At Newark Liberty International Airport, about 30 minutes south of Elmwood Park, more than a dozen cars caught fire Thursday morning on the rooftop of a parking garage, sending a huge plume of smoke into the air.
In New York, firefighters were at the scene of a five-alarm fire hours after it broke out at 3:45 a.m. Thursday at a commercial building near the boundary of the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick neighborhoods in Brooklyn.
"These were very challenging conditions for our firefighters," the Fire Department of New York's acting chief of department, John Sudnik, said of the Brooklyn blaze. "However we are well-prepared."
No injuries were reported at any of the three fires, officials said. The causes of all three fires were still under investigation.
Elmwood Park, N.J.: A paper plant in flames
By Thursday morning, ice had covered some of the ruins of buildings destroyed when the 45,000-square-foot Marcal warehouse caught fire the night before.
Smoke continued to rise from the site as firefighters worked to control the flames and hot spots that remained.
At the eight-alarm fire's peak, more than 300 firefighters and emergency responders were battling the blaze, New Jersey's governor, Philip D. Murphy, said on Thursday.
The low temperatures made extinguishing the fire a challenge.
"The fire trucks were freezing. The water in the hose was actually freezing. The ladder trucks that were up in the air -- some of them couldn't be lowered because they were freezing," Bergen County's executive, James J. Tedesco III, said.
Elmwood Park residents and people traveling nearby said they could see the smoke from miles away. Courtney Gilmore, a 30-year-old Elmwood Park resident, said she could see the smoke as she commuted home Wednesday night.
While driving through the area, Ms. Gilmore said her eyes started to burn, and she had trouble breathing. Even with her car's windows closed, the acrid smell "was awful," she said.
In and around Elmwood Park, a community of nearly 20,000 people in northern New Jersey, the Marcal plant was known for providing working class jobs.
About 500 people were employed at the facility, Rob Baron, the chief executive of Soundview Paper Company, which now runs the plant, said. Nearly 200 employees were on site when the fire began, Mr. Baron said.
None of those workers were injured, officials said. But all 500 Marcal employees are now without work, Mr. Baron said. His company is planning to work with federal, state and local officials to provide assistance to the workers who were displaced.
The Marcal plant was built as part of a manufacturing business started in 1932 by Nicholas Marcalus, who came to the United States from Sicily, according to an obituary published in The New York Times in 1979.
The plant continued to operate for decades, and the warehouse held large paper rolls that were used to make paper towels, toilet paper and tissues.
"Marcal was not only the economic lifeblood of the surrounding communities, it was an icon for North Jersey," State Senator Nellie Pou, who represents the area, said in a statement.
The sign was also a symbol, of Elmwood Park, to drivers on Interstate 80.
"When you're a kid, you don't know directions," Ms. Gilmore said. "But you know the sign."
Newark: Cars catch fire at a garage
Travelers coming and going from the Newark airport were greeted by a thick cloud of smoke billowing from the top level of a parking garage on Thursday morning.
Seventeen cars were damaged or destroyed when a fire broke out around 6:40 a.m. on the rooftop of a parking deck at the airport's Terminal C, according to Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.
Video from television news helicopters showed firefighters trying to extinguish the flames, but the fire did not appear to spread.
The fire was mostly under control by 7:40 a.m., Mr. Coleman said, but emergency responders from the Newark Fire Department were still at the parking garage fighting hot spots.
The fire did not cause any airport delays, Mr. Coleman said. The parking deck at Terminal C, which exclusively serves travelers flying on United Airlines, was closed.
Brooklyn: A five-alarm warehouse fire
Temperatures were close to zero when firefighters got the call around 3:45 a.m. Thursday about a fire at a Brooklyn warehouse.
Given the weather, firefighters tried to fight the flames from inside the building, Fire Department officials said. But they were later pulled from the building for safety reasons, forcing them outside in the bitter cold.
Nearly 200 firefighters and emergency medical personnel responded to the blaze, the Fire Department said.
Buses were brought in to help keep firefighters warm, ABC 7 reported.
The fire was under control by 10:30 a.m. Photos posted on Twitter by the Fire Department showed icicles hanging off fire trucks and hydrants that were being used to get the fire under control.
The Fire Department said it anticipated that firefighters would remain at the site of the building for much of the day on Thursday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- After two months spent scorching the earth in Washington and complaining about being cooped up in the White House, President Trump is planning to return this weekend to the one place where he knows he will receive a hero's welcome for his troubles: Mar-a-Lago, his gilded club by the sea in Palm Beach.
"You would have to be insensitive not to be touched by how he has stayed there working," said Toni Holt Kramer, the founder of Trumpettes USA, a booster group that is planning to welcome him. "I think people will have tears in their eyes because they're so grateful that he's come back to his home away from home."
Mr. Trump made a point of staying in Washington over the Christmas holidays -- waiting, he said, for Democrats to negotiate with him on funding for a border wall -- so it will be the president's first visit to Mar-a-Lago since Thanksgiving.
It will not be a complete escape -- he still has no deal on the wall and a State of the Union address to give on Tuesday. But after his arrival on Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump is expected to do many of the things he always does when he is at Mar-a-Lago: dining at the owner's table on the patio; spending the afternoon at Trump International Golf Club, about a 15-minute motorcade drive away; and never venturing anywhere in Palm Beach outside his own two properties.
The first lady, Melania Trump, will travel there with him this weekend, her spokeswoman said, though Mrs. Trump tends to keep a low profile while at the resort.
In the Mar-a-Lago cocoon, the president is in his most comfortable mode, friends and allies say: playing the jocular host in front of an adoring crowd.
On Saturday, P.J. Schrantz, who founded Veleve, a charity that provides support for veterans, is betting on Mr. Trump to make an appearance at a $600-a-plate fund-raiser his organization is hosting in one of the club's ballrooms. And plans for Mr. Trump's annual Super Bowl viewing party at his golf club on Sunday evening, complete with a steak and lobster buffet, are still on.
"I chose to have it there because I've attended galas there," Mr. Schrantz said of his event, which will feature a George Michael tribute artist donating his time, as well as honor the astronaut Buzz Aldrin. "The members are such giving people that we could raise a couple of million dollars in an evening."
Some Mar-a-Lago members say they are already wistful about the blissful weeks without tangled traffic and increased security -- a seven-minute drive from home to the club takes at least 30 minutes when Mr. Trump is in town, one said -- but many will brave the roads for the chance to participate in a presidential selfie or a similar show of support.
Laurence Leamer, a longtime Palm Beach resident who has known Mr. Trump since the 1990s and is the author of "Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump's Presidential Palace," said in an interview that even if people had an issue with the president's policymaking, the meatloaf recipe or anything in between, they tended to keep it to themselves.
"People have been trained to have like a Pavlovian reaction or something," Mr. Leamer said. "You're supposed to say things are great. When he asks you, 'How are things?' you're not supposed to complain."
Just as the Trump International Hotel in Washington has become a safe space for the president and his supporters, Mar-a-Lago is a 20-acre oasis for those who adore all things Trump, from his zero-tolerance immigration policies to the menu items named after his children.
The focus on Mr. Trump has grown to the point where some Democratic members, who have loved the club's amenities for decades, have recently rescinded their memberships because they do not feel comfortable there anymore.
"There's a political angle to being a member now," said Cynthia Friedman, a Democratic fund-raiser who joined the club 24 years ago and recalls playing tennis on Saturdays with Marla Maples, Mr. Trump's second wife. "There are a lot of people who I don't recognize. They're not the people I used to play tennis with. Things change, and it's time to move on."
In December, instead of sending her $1,600 in monthly dues, she joined the Beach Club, a rival members-only club, on the other side of town.
But Ms. Friedman is still in the minority. Many Mar-a-Lago members book reservations weeks in advance to be in the same room with the president. And Trumpworld celebrities, like Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director; the president's son Donald Trump Jr.; and Antonio Sabato Jr., the Trump-loving model-turned-politician, have been spotted at social events and fund-raisers in Palm Beach, serving as something of a warm-up act to the main event.
Karyn Turk, a business owner and the 2016 winner of the Mrs. Florida beauty pageant, said if the walls looked like they were caving in on the president in Washington, there were only blue skies in Palm Beach.
"It's a lot of hype," she said of the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III. "I feel like in a lot of ways, it's still just a witch hunt."
If the "Winter White House" is a boon for the members of Mr. Trump's exclusive club, and a respite not only for the president but also for the staff members who relocate with him, the annual decampment still raises ethical concerns.
The White House has refused to release a list of those who visit the president there. And elsewhere in the Trump Organization orbit, the company said it would introduce new procedures to screen for undocumented immigrants after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump's flagship New Jersey golf club employed people who had entered the country illegally.
And ProPublica reported last summer that three Mar-a-Lago members had amassed an unusual amount of influence in the Department of Veterans Affairs, meddling in agency initiatives and participating in the review of a contract worth some $10 billion.
"It certainly seems unprecedented," said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of the ethics watchdog CREW, "and highly troubling for people to be given significant authority over government matters seemingly primarily on the basis of being paying customers of the president."
The White House has taken at least one informal step to block people who have access to the president's properties from asking for anything that seems to go too far. Aides have long been on the alert to intercept any notes or policy proposals from overeager supporters -- including one from a guest who once helpfully tried to show the president an executive order he had drafted. Mr. Trump has at times directed his aides to give those people ample listening time even if he cannot, according to someone familiar with the process and his thinking.
Security around the president may have tightened since 2017, when Mr. Trump sat on the open patio, in front of hundreds of eyeballs and iPhones pointed in his direction, discussing a response to North Korea's missile test with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. But in many ways, Mr. Trump himself has not changed from the involved club owner he has always been.
He has always kept close watch over who comes and goes, and pays close attention to those in the latter category.
Jeff Greene, the Palm Beach billionaire who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor of Florida, joined the club when he moved to Palm Beach in 2010. But he quit because, he said, "I have my own tennis court. I never loved going there."
Mr. Trump, he said, took his resignation personally. Sitting next to him at a charity event at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Greene recalled being confronted. "He went right at me, saying, 'I can't believe you quit the club.' He's figuring someone with plenty of money, why would they care about paying dues for a club?"

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
On Dec. 12, 1975, Paul Delaney, then the only black reporter in The New York Times's Chicago bureau, sat in a smoke-filled room at Washington's Sheraton Park Hotel at a meeting of nearly 100 black journalists and media professionals.
They had all come to the hotel to cover a convention honoring black leaders held by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies; Mr. Delaney and the others had to squeeze their own meeting in between listening to speeches about increasing diversity in politics. After all, they had their own goal in mind: collecting signatures for the founding document of the National Association of Black Journalists.
In 1967 and early 1968, black journalists represented fewer than five percent of newsroom staff members in the United States, according to the Kerner Commission on Race. At the founding meeting, many people were afraid to sign. "The other members of the group were afraid of drawing attention to themselves and the organizations they worked for," said Leon Dash, another founder and a reporter for The Washington Post at the time. "They felt their careers would be hampered. Or they would be put in line to be fired."
Yet Mr. Delaney, the only Times reporter at the meeting, had been gauging other black reporters' interest in a national advocacy organization since the 1960s and was feeling optimistic.
"There was momentum already, and we picked up on that momentum," said Mr. Delaney, who went on to become one of the first black editors at The Times. "We joined the fight, joined the push to further integrate."
Throughout his career, Mr. Delaney, now 86, made a point of lifting up other young journalists, especially journalists of color. But he had to find his own path.
Mr. Delaney was born in Montgomery, Ala., in 1933. His first exposure to the news business came early -- as a teenage paperboy, he handed out copies of The Alabama Journal, and he later started the first news publication at his high school. Mr. Delaney began an English degree at Alabama State University in the '50s and was drafted after a year and a half. In the United States Army, he became a radio operator; while stationed in France, he communicated news -- including the results of Brown v. Board of Education -- between different bases.
When Mr. Delaney ultimately graduated from Ohio State University's journalism school in 1958, he was the only black student out of 15. His first job was at The Atlanta Daily World. Fifty other daily newspapers rejected him.
"At that time, in the late 1950s, I knew things were changing and that I would eventually land a job on a daily somewhere," he said over email. "I firmly believed that."
Eventually Mr. Delaney moved to The Washington Star, where he covered local government. In 1969, he was poached by Max Frankel, the head of The Times's Washington bureau who later became the executive editor, to cover national urban news -- from people moving out of inner cities to the oil industry in Houston.
"Bureau chief Max Frankel hired me to be part of four-man 'urban cluster,' responsible for covering the rapidly changing American urban landscape," Mr. Delaney said.
In 1973, Mr. Delaney transferred to the Chicago bureau to cover Midwestern social issues and politics, including those of the city's notorious mayor, Richard J. Daley.
From the time he had been a reporter in Washington, Mr. Delaney kept a list of names of journalists of color he would unofficially recommend for jobs at The Times. Some he met through the N.A.B.J.
But it was when he was promoted to an assistant editor on the national desk in 1977, and then to deputy national editor in 1980, that he began his most comprehensive mentorship and recruiting efforts. As the paper's first black editor, "it was difficult, being the only black face in the room in a lot of meetings where major decisions were being made," he said. "That's a lot of pressure."
In response, he focused on the young people in the room, pulling them aside to provide career advice.
Lena Williams, who worked at The Times as a reporter in various subject areas from 1974 until 2005, said she first met Mr. Delaney as a young reporter on the metro desk in the late '70s.
"But I was still, for a very long time, in awe of him and sort of kept my distance," she said. "Because this was Paul Delaney. I was just Lena Williams, a young aspiring journalist."
Ms. Williams had always dreamed of covering the N.F.L., but Mr. Delaney urged her to first gain reporting skills through more general reporting in New York and in the suburbs in Westchester, then on government in Albany.
Ms. Williams said she was frustrated at the time but now realizes the value of his advice. "I tell him now, I say, 'Damn, you're good,"' she said.
But, often, mentorship simply meant being a listening ear. "It was a matter of keeping their spirits up when they were down," Mr. Delaney said.
Mireya "Mia" Navarro, who came to The Times as a reporter in 1989, was recruited by Mr. Delaney through the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which was founded in 1984. Ms. Navarro, who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice, said she has become a mentor to young journalists of color in her own career thanks to their support at The Times. "They made me feel like they had a stake in my success," she said.
People who had worked at The Times for a while began calling him simply "Delaney." "A lot of times, we would just say, 'Talk to Delaney,' 'What does Delaney have to say?"' Ms. Williams said.
Mr. Delaney left his role as a then senior editor at The Times in 1992 to become the first African-American chairman of the University of Alabama's journalism department, which he said was an honor because, at the time he attended college, black students could not even attend the university. He was honored with a lifetime achievement award by the N.A.B.J. in 2010. He lives in Washington and has written on and off for various publications, including The Columbia Journalism Review, where his columns address the plateauing of diversity in media after years of progress.
"We knew it wouldn't be easy," he added. "But we didn't think it would be this hard."
He doesn't regret the difficulties, though, given the successes: Today, the N.A.B.J., with more than 4,000 members, is the largest organization of journalists of color in the United States. This year it will celebrate the holding of its 44th convention, where it will commemorate its 44 founders -- the 44 people who signed the piece of paper establishing the organization, Mr. Delaney among them.
"I knew it was what I was made to do," Mr. Delaney said. "I knew it was totally necessary -- that what I was doing was vital to The New York Times and to the profession."

Texto completo: A brother-sister duo from Louisville premiered a feature film at the prestigious 2019 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah this past weekend.
Jen Tullock co-stars in the film "Before You Know It," alongside Judith Light, Alec Baldwin, Mandy Patinkin, Mike Colter and Tim Daley. The film, which she co-wrote, tells the story of two sisters who discover their mother (Light), who they thought was dead, is very much alive and starring in a soap opera.
Jen Tullock's brother, Ryan Tullock, scored the film.
"He's a true jack-of-all-trades and in addition to being a gifted composer, plays in a band called 'Tennis," Jen Tullock said of her brother. "Hannah Utt (the co-writer and director of the film) and I made a series for Turner Broadcasting in 2016 called 'Disengaged' that Ryan also scored. The man plays every instrument on the score! I'm bragging but I love him very much and am so proud of his work.
Getting to collaborate has been really meaningful to both of us."
The Tullock siblings grew up in the Jeffersontown and Crescent Hill neighborhoods. Jen Tullock attended Christian Academy and both she and Ryan graduated from Eastern High School.
Jen Tullock says she got her first taste of theater as a teenager in a production of "Fiddler on the Roof" at Clarksville Little Theater
"I was 15 and had a full mouth of braces and got to wear jazz shoes and I was thrilled. I thought I'd died and found nirvana," she said.
Today, she looks back on the experience with fondness and gratitude.
While her brother has pursued a music career, Jen Tullock has appeared in television and film including — "Casual," "Cameron Crowe's Roadies," "Curb Your Enthusiasm," "SMILF," and Amazon original "Budding Prospects." She can currently be seen alongside Abbi Jacobson and Dave Franco in the Netflix original drama "6 Balloons" and the Hulu original "Door No. 1."
She is also an award-winning narrator of several New York Times best-selling audiobooks and the voice of the title character in the Emmy award-winning short "Henry."

Furor follows best-picture nominees

Texto completo: Outcry over Oscar-nominated movies isn't unusual, especially in the competitive Hollywood arena where one movie's disaster is another movie's gain. Just look at modern history: Last year's best picture contender "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" was castigated by critics for letting its racist cop (played by Sam Rockwell) off the hook by the time the credits rolled. "Selma" played with the facts around President Johnson's support of Martin Luther King Jr. "Zero Dark Thirty," about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was famously embroiled in scandal, with some claiming it glorified torture.
And "The Birth of a Nation" never made it into the 2017 Oscar race after being hobbled by filmmaker Nate Parker's personal history.
But in the social media-drenched climate of 2019, the fires have been particularly quick to burst out. Here's a guide to the best-picture nominees that are dealing with contentious debates leading up to the Academy Awards on Feb. 24 (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT).
'Green Book' is called out for lack of accuracy
For an ultimately uplifting story of the real-life relationship between black pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American chauffeur Tony "Lip" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), "Green Book" has been polarizing, with some critics chastising its portrayal of race relations, told predominately from the white character's point of view.
Shirley's family has called into question the veracity of key details, calling "Green Book" a "symphony of lies," and asserting they were never consulted for the project. The filmmakers have stood by the story and Shirley backs up many plot points in newly released interview tapes. "I think people need to go back and hear what Dr. Shirley has to say for himself," Ali said Sunday after winning a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.
The filmmakers have dealt with personal tumult as well. In January, reports from 1998 resurfaced, chronicling director Peter Farrelly's old habit of flashing his penis as a prank on movie sets. Farrelly said he was "deeply sorry" for his past behavior.
Screenwriter Nick Vallelonga, Tony's son, came under fire for a 2015 tweet in which he supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's discredited claim that Muslims in New Jersey were seen on TV cheering the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Vallelonga has vowed "to do better."
Fire danger level: Moderate. Though getting hit from all directions, "Green Book" still has a lot of love in Hollywood, as seen in wins at the Golden Globes and Producers Guild Awards.
'Bohemian Rhapsody' has a Bryan Singer problem
Although everyone agrees Rami Malek crushes it as Freddie Mercury, the fan-favorite Queen film arrives in the best-picture race laden with controversy. The biggest issue? Singer, the biopic's original (and still credited) director. He was fired toward the end of production, which is messy enough. But in January, The Atlantic published a lengthy report detailing allegations of Singer's sexual misconduct, in some instances with minors. The 53-year-old director has denied any wrongdoing, calling the report "a homophobic smear piece." Queen guitarist Brian May has apologized for previously defending Singer.
Meanwhile, a chorus of LGBTQ voices have accused "Bohemian Rhapsody" of botching its portrayal of Freddie Mercury's sexuality and suggesting that being gay was the frontman's downfall. Producer Graham King has insisted that the intention wasn't to equate "being gay means being dark."
Fire danger level: High. In the #MeToo era, Singer's sullied name remains an albatross around the neck of "Bohemian Rhapsody" in the Oscar race, especially given that the film centers on a gay icon.
'Vice' pits Hollywood against Republicans (again)
The gonzo biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney always was going to be a flash point for political controversy, depicting him with ruthless ambition and cunning. Time wrote that "Vice" turned Cheney (Christian Bale) into a "cartoon villain," while the National Review called it "conservative vitriol" and "bad history."
"We really did our best to be accurate with the historic timeline," McKay told USA TODAY, calling "Vice" an incredible story, "regardless of your political leanings."
Piling on: While accepting the Golden Globe for best actor, Bale said, "Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration." Cheney's daughter, Wyoming U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, fired back, tweeting a 2008 article from The Independent about Bale's arrest for allegedly assaulting his mother and sister. "Satan probably inspired him to do this, too," she wrote. (Bale was never charged for assault)
Fire danger level: Low. There's too much blowback directed at other movies to really knock "Vice" too hard at this stage in the game.
Does 'A Star Is Born' have issues with agency?
Ally and Jackson's love story has powered this Oscar season, despite an anemic showing at awards shows of late. While the re-imagining of the classic Hollywood tale has avoided major cultural missteps, some have found the film's change of focus from Ally to Jackson in the second hour problematic.
Vox took issue with Ally's lack of agency in the script, while also calling out "A Star Is Born" for failing to present an "alternative representation of women excelling in a career independent of a man's actions, direction, success, or reaction to her success."
The New York Times weighed the film's agenda around gender, noting that "for all its romanticism, the movie reads as a pessimistic take on heterosexual romantic relationships. lasting equality between a man and a woman in love – artists in the same field – isn't just difficult, it actually kills the guy."
So is Bradley Cooper's version a modern enough retelling? it won't matter much come Oscar night, as such squabbling has been drowned out by the film's die-hard fans.
Fire danger level: Low. Love trumps nitpicking.
Could 'Roma' dethrone the theater experience?
Critics have lavished praise on Alfonso Cuaron's epic tale of life in 1970s Mexico, but theater geeks have taken issue with how Netflix rolled it out, putting the film in a handful of theaters before it arrived on the streaming service. Critics have called this a cosmetic release and maintain that Netflix's distribution plan, placing movies online at the same time as in theaters, threatens moviegoing at large.
A best picture win for Netflix could resurface the question: Are movie theaters still relevant?
Even after winning two Golden Globes, Cuaron was asked about Netflix backstage in a testy exchange. "A Mexican film in black and white , in Spanish and Mixtec , without stars – how big did you think it would be as a conventional theatrical release?" he replied.
Fire danger level: Moderate. Academy voters are still largely composed of older film purists, and "Roma" remains a threat to their filmmaking status quo.

Texto completo: Since I first wrote in June about our printing operation moving to Concord, staff members have been asked numerous questions. Those questions have included:
Are you losing your job? Are you moving to Concord? Is the entire operation moving to Concord? Has the Valley News been sold?
I hope that all of these questions have been previously answered, but I learned long ago not to make assumptions. As reported on these pages on Sunday, we are moving our printing to a refurbished, offset printing facility in Penacook, N.H., a section of Concord. The press operation will be a joint venture with our sister newspaper, the Concord Monitor.
This is a sad but exciting time. It is distressing to lose jobs in our community, but it is invigorating to see what our staff is doing to implement these changes in the best way possible. The hard work and collaboration is energizing.
I want to summarize what the changes mean to you, the reader, when you pick up your copy of the Valley News on Friday morning, the first edition printed on the new press:
The width of the printed paper will be reduced to 11.75 inches. This is the same size as The New York Times and The Boston Globe, and is now the industry standard.
The paper will feature a new design, meant to make articles easier to read.
The newsroom’s deadline will be earlier, and the delivery deadline to home delivery subscribers will be 6:30 a.m. weekdays and 7:30 a.m. weekends. Due to our earlier deadlines, we will no longer run lottery numbers.
In summary, new size, new design, same newspaper — the same quality journalism you count on and deserve in your local newspaper.
So the answers to the often heard questions above are:
Yes, about 30 people are losing their jobs; six staff members accepted transfers. Only the printing is moving to Concord. The Valley News has not been sold, nor is it being marketed for sale.
The Valley News will continue to be the Upper Valley’s main source for news and advertising in print and online. I invite and welcome your feedback as you process these changes. I can be reached at dmcclory@vnews.com or 603-727-3203.
On behalf of everyone associated with the Valley News, I thank you for your support.

Ugly trend of demonizing white men

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh’s December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights — with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas — the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them." Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy." Teen Vogue, a magazine targeting teenage girls, wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization." Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. James Livingston, a Rutgers history professor: "OK, officially, I now hate white people. ... I hereby resign from my race." Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind." Stony Brook University sociology professor Michael Kimmel explained, "White men’s anger comes from the potent fusion of two sentiments: entitlement and a sense of victimization."
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC’s "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men — old, by the way — are not protecting women. They’re protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y’all, for everyone. We’re all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What’s wrong with them?"
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he’d be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat — for now.

Chief of GM's Maven service is out

Texto completo: Julia Steyn, who joined General Motors in her 30s as head of mergers and acquisitions and has been the only leader of its Maven car-sharing program, has left the company for unspecified reasons.
Automotive News was first to report that Steyn was no longer with the company. The departure is not thought to be part of the carmaker's 15 percent reduction in its white-collar workforce.
Steyn has been a corporate wunderkind. She's a former Goldman Sachs and Alcoa vice president before joining GM in 2012, according to her LinkedIn profile.
She became GM's vice president of urban mobility in 2015 and has been head of Maven since its launch in January 2016.
GM declined to comment on her departure, and Steyn could not be reached.
Maven is GM's app-based car-sharing program that enables users to rent cars by the hour. It is focused on urban dwellers, offered in 24 cities in the United States, Canada and Australia. In Michigan, it is available in Detroit and Ann Arbor, the latter being a test site that is much smaller than other Maven markets.
Costs can be as low as $9 an hour for a Chevrolet Cruze compact.
The service last year expanded to include so-called Maven Peer vehicles — cars not owned by GM but by individuals, who get a share of the revenue from a rental. Maven spokeswoman Annalisa Bluhm said earlier this month that Maven's plans for 2019 included expanding the Peer service, noting that some car owners have earned as much as $800 a month by making their vehicles available for others to rent.
Maven also offers a Gig service, enabling users to rent Mavens for such side jobs as Uber, Lyft or meal delivery. Steyn's departure will not change Maven's business plan, sources said.
Steyn was born in Russia and trained as a concert pianist.
She told Family Circle, which ranked her among the 20 most influential moms of 2017, that, "When I was a Russian teenage piano prodigy, a benefactor made an offer to sponsor me at a prestigious music academy in Michigan. With $15 in my pocket, I said yes. I had no idea if I'd ever see my family again."
Her Facebook page says she attended Interlochen Arts Academy, 15 miles southwest of Traverse City. The New York Times said in 2018 that she came to the United States for a youth tour promoted by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and that led to the Interlochen study.
She has undergraduate degrees in music and economics from Oberlin College in Ohio and an MBA from the University of Chicago.
She had to learn to dress down for the new GM, telling WWD.com (Women's Wear Daily) in 2017, that "Frankly, before taking this job I never owned a pair of jeans."
She told another website, swaay.com, that joining GM was a big shift for her.
"I was very skeptical," Steyn said, having no background in the auto industry. "I was like, 'Well, cars, Detroit ... I don't know how I really feel about it.'"
She kept a home in New York while she led Maven and spent some time in Detroit, past stories say.

Baltimore bans pot possession charges

Texto completo: By big margins, police in Louisville and Baltimore cite black people more than white people for possession of marijuana. But now Baltimore has decided to do something about it.
Citing, in part, that more than 90 percent of the citations for low-level pot possession in Maryland's largest city between 2015 and 2017 were issued to African-Americans, the top prosecutor there Tuesday announced she would stop prosecuting the offense within city limits and seek to vacate nearly 5,000 convictions.
The Courier Journal reported Sunday that black people were six times more likely than white people to be cited for pot possession in 2017, even as the total number of such citations has declined.
Responding to the Courier Journal's study, Louisville Metro Councilwoman Barbara Sexton Smith, whose district spans from downtown to West 24th Street, said that the disparity is unacceptable and that the offense should be decriminalized.
Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell, whose office prosecutes marijuana possession, did not respond Tuesday to the news that Baltimore has ended the practice.
He previously said in an email that the disparate charging of blacks is "disturbing and compels actions," including assessing "future policy options."
Even though possession of marijuana is illegal in Maryland, as it is in Kentucky, Marilyn Mosby, state's attorney in Baltimore, announced her office would no longer prosecute marijuana possession, regardless of the amount involved or the defendant's criminal record because "prosecuting these cases has no public safety value, disproportionately impacts communities of color and erodes public trust."
The move follows similar announcements in other cities, including Philadelphia and New York, in which prosecutors have renounced the prosecution of marijuana offenses.
"We need to get serious about prioritizing what actually makes us safe ... and no one who is serious about public safety can honestly say that spending resources to jail people for marijuana use is a smart way to use our limited time and money," Mosby said in a statement on her office's website.
Baltimore has the nation's highest murder rate among big cities, but in an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, Mosby said declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases will help make it safer.
"If you ask that mom whose son was killed where she would rather us spend our time and our attention — on solving that murder or prosecuting marijuana laws — it's a no-brainer," she said.
She also asked: "How are we going to expect folks to want to cooperate with us ... when you're stopping, you're frisking, you're arresting folks for marijuana possession?"
Louisville Police Chief Steve Conrad declined last month to discuss the racial disparity in marijuana charges. Spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said that LMPD "does not target individuals based on race," but that the department "directs our resources to places where most crime is being committed."
She said last month that the department plans no immediate changes like the ones adopted elsewhere.
"It would be premature to say whether or not any particular policies or procedures might change," she said, adding, "We are bound by the state statutes and have an obligation to enforce the law when violations are discovered."
The Courier Journal reported that even though black people make up less than one-fourth of Louisville's population, they accounted for two-thirds of those charged with marijuana possession. Many were stopped for minor traffic offenses in predominantly black neighborhoods.
Ten states and the District of Columbia have made recreational marijuana legal, while it may be used for medical purposes in those states and 23 others.

STONE-COLD LOSER BEING ROGER STONE FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANYTHING-GOES POLITICAL FIXER

Texto completo: Roger Stone has always lived in a dog-eat-dog world. So it was apt that he was charged with skulduggery in part for threatening to kidnap a therapy dog, a fluffy, sweet-faced Coton de Tuléar, belonging to Randy Credico, a New York radio host.
Robert Mueller believes that Mr. Credico, a pal of Julian Assange, served as an intermediary with WikiLeaks for Mr. Stone. Mr. Mueller's indictment charges that Mr. Stone called Mr. Credico "a rat" and "a stoolie" because he believed that the radio host was not going to back up what the special counsel says is Mr. Stone's false story about contacts with WikiLeaks, which disseminated Russia's hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.
Mr. Stone emailed Mr. Credico that he would "take that dog away from you," the indictment says, later adding: "I am so ready. Let's get it on. Prepare to die (expletive)."
As the owner of two Yorkies, Mr. Stone clearly knows how scary it is when a beloved dog is in harm's way. When he emerged from court Friday, he immediately complained that FBI agents had "terrorized" his dogs when they came to arrest him at dawn at his home in Fort Lauderdale.
As the master of darkness who had been captured in darkness stepped into the bright Florida light, he was his usual flamboyant, unapologetic self. He proclaimed his innocence, flashed the Nixon victory sign and reiterated the old saw from his mentor, Roy Cohn, that any attention is good attention. But it fell flat. Being Roger Stone had finally caught up with him.
He has always said Florida suited him because "it was a sunny place for shady people," borrowing a Somerset Maugham line. But now the cat's cradle of lies and dirty tricks had tripped up the putative dognapper. And it went down on the very same day that Paul Manafort - his former associate in a seamy lobbying firm with rancid dictators as clients, and then later his pal in the seamy campaign of Donald Trump - was also in federal court on charges related to the Mueller probe. Manafort's hair is now almost completely white.
One of Mr. Stone's rules is "Deny, deny, deny." But his arrest for lying, obstructing and witness tampering raised the inevitable question about his on-and-off friend in the White House, the man who is the last jigsaw-puzzle piece in the investigation of Trumpworld's alleged coordination with Russia: Is being Donald Trump finally about to catch up with Donald Trump?
Mr. Stone, who famously has Richard Nixon's face tattooed on his back, is the agent provocateur who is the through line from the Nixon impeachment articles to the articles about Mr. Trump's possible impeachment.
In 1999, when I went on a trip to Miami to watch Mr. Trump test the presidential waters, Mr. Stone orchestrated Mr. Trump's Castro-bashing speech to Cuban-Americans. The bodybuilding strategist, christened "the state-of-the-art sleazeball" by The New Republic in the '80s, said he was "a jockey looking for a horse."
Mr. Stone, who was mixed up in Watergate at the tender age of 19, "made the transition from the Stone Age of dirty tricks to today," as David Axelrod puts it.
He watched Nixon rally the silent majority with a law-and-order message and racial dog whistling. He helped Ronald Reagan create Reagan Democrats.
For decades, believing "past is prologue," Mr. Stone urged Mr. Trump to be the successor to those pols, revving up angry, white working-class voters who felt belittled or scared of "the other." It would be so easy to divide and stoke resentment, as Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump proved when they inflamed the birther controversy against Barack Obama. "Hate is a stronger motivator than love," Mr. Stone told the documentarians. "Human nature has never changed."
The tribal tensions in America made Mr. Stone's favorite tricks easier than ever; he didn't have to operate in the shadows. He wore a T-shirt with Bill Clinton and the word "Rape" at 2016 campaign rallies. As Mr. Stone boasted in the documentary, his "slash-and-burn" tactics "are now in vogue."
Mr. Trump has had periods of estrangement with Mr. Stone. In 2008, in an interview with The New Yorker, he called the strategist "a stone-cold loser," a state Mr. Trump himself has been relegated to this past couple of weeks, courtesy of Nancy Pelosi.
Mr. Stone will not go gently. When he is asked about the tattoo of Nixon, he says he got it to remind himself, "A man is not finished when he is defeated; he is only finished when he quits." Yesterday, he pleaded not guilty to all charges

Texto completo: Scientists have long known what causes sickle-cell disease and its devastating effects: a single mutation in one errant gene. But for decades, there has been only modest progress against an inherited condition that mainly afflicts people of African descent.
With advances in gene therapy, that is quickly changing - so much so that scientists have begun to talk of a cure.
In a half-dozen clinical trials planned or underway, researchers are testing strategies for correcting the problem at the genetic level. Already a handful of the enrolled patients, who have endured an illness that causes excruciating bouts of pain, strokes and early death, no longer show signs of the disease.
Among them is Brandon Williams, 21, who lives with his mother in Chicago. Because of his sickle-cell disease, he had suffered four strokes by age 18. The damage makes it hard for him to speak. His older sister died of the disease.
Following an experimental gene therapy, his symptoms have vanished. Life has taken a sharp turn for the better: no more transfusions, no more pain, no more fear.
“He said, ‘Mom, I think I want to get me a job,’ ” said his mother, Leuteresa Roberts.
It is still early in the course of these experimental treatments, and it is likely to be at least three years before one is approved. Researchers hope the effects will last, but they cannot be certain.
“We are in uncharted territory,” said Dr. David A. Williams, chief scientific officer at Boston Children’s Hospital.
At the moment, the only remedy for sickle-cell disease is a dangerous and expensive bone marrow transplant, an option rarely used. An effective gene therapy would not be simple or inexpensive, but it could change the lives of tens of thousands of people.
“This would be the first genetic cure of a common genetic disease,” said Dr. Edward Benz, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
It also would mark a turning point for a large community of underserved patients. Most of them have African ancestry, but Hispanics and those with southern European, Middle Eastern or Asian backgrounds are also affected.
Minority bias
Experts have long maintained that advances in treatment have been limited partly because sickle-cell disease is concentrated in less affluent minority communities.
“Having tried for a number of years to raise philanthropic money, I can tell you it’s really hard,” said David Williams.
An estimated 100,000 people in the United States have sickle cell disease. Worldwide, about 300,000 infants are born with the condition each year, a figure projected to grow to more than 400,000 by 2050.
The disorder is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 70 percent of children with it die before adulthood.
The shape of disease
In sickle-cell disease, blood cells stuffed with hemoglobin are distorted into sickle shapes. The misshapen cells get stuck in blood vessels, causing strokes, organ damage and episodes of agonizing pain - called crises - as muscles are starved of oxygen. Children usually return to normal between crises, but teenagers and adults may suffer chronic pain.
The misshapen cells don’t survive long in the blood - 10 to 20 days, compared to the usual 120 days. Patients may be severely anemic and prone to infections.
Daily life can be a challenge. Many adults with sickle-cell disease have no health insurance, especially in states that did not expand Medicaid, noted Dr. John Tisdale, a senior investigator at the National Institutes of Health.
Employment can be difficult because the disease is debilitating. Yet many who apply for Social Security disability are denied, Tisdale said. They end up at emergency rooms when they are in crisis.
And treating the disease, with its complications, is expensive: annual costs per patient are estimated at $10,000 a year for children and $30,000 for adults. Those with the disorder go in and out of hospitals.
Roberts knows this cycle all too well.
Her daughter, Britney Williams, had sickle-cell disease. At 22, she went into the hospital during a crisis and died, leaving behind a baby daughter.
Roberts’ son, Brandon Williams, was devastated and terrified. He told her he had suffered too much, and his big sister’s death brought home to him the fact that his life, too, could end at any moment. He wanted to stop the monthly blood transfusions that were easing his symptoms. He wanted to go ahead and die.
Then Dr. Alexis Thompson, a sickle-cell specialist at Northwestern University, told Williams that he could join a new study of gene therapy that might help. There were no guarantees, and there was a chance Williams could die from the treatment.
Williams was enthusiastic, but his mother was filled with trepidation. In the end, she decided “we’ve got to try something,” she recalled.
Williams was among the first to get one of the experimental gene therapies, in which researchers attempted to give his immature blood cells a new and functional gene.
“I was so overwhelmed,” Roberts recalled. “I cried tears of joy.”
In the new trials, subjects must have immature blood cells - stem cells - removed from their bone marrow. The stem cells are genetically modified, and then infused back into the patient’s bloodstream. The goal is for the modified cells to take up residence in the bone marrow and form healthy red blood cells.

Los Angeles to charge drivers by the mile

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - For years, Southern California lawmakers have tried to steer clear of decisions that make driving more expensive or miserable, afraid of angering one of their largest groups of constituents.
But now, transportation officials say, congestion has become so bad in Los Angeles County that politicians have no choice but to contemplate charging motorists more to drive - a strategy that has stirred controversy but helped cities in other parts of the world tame their own traffic.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is pushing to study how what's commonly referred to as congestion pricing could work in L.A., including converting carpool lanes to toll lanes, taxing drivers based on the number of miles they travel, or charging a fee to enter certain neighborhoods and business districts.
Imposing more tolls would offer a smoother drive for those who choose to pay. Getting more drivers off the road could free space to speed up bus service, while the billions of dollars in revenue could fund a vast expansion of the transit network, Metro said.
But a shift from mostly free driving in Southern California, where 75 percent of commuters drive alone to work, would require courageous politicians who are willing to champion the policy, explain it to outraged motorists and stand by it if the implementation gets rocky, experts say.
"It challenges what Angelenos see as their God-given right to drive anywhere they want," said Manuel Pastor, director of the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at the University of Southern California. "It would be a challenging shift in a city that's very much a car culture and an individual culture."
Next month, Metro's board of directors will be asked to approve a study and assemble a panel of experts to examine how congestion pricing would work. The process would take about two years, Metro said.
It's one of many strategies transportation officials are considering to pay for the construction of 28 transit and highway projects before the 2028 Summer Olympic Games.
Twenty of the projects are scheduled to be finished within the decade. Metro would need an additional $26.2 billion to build the other eight projects by then.
Using congestion pricing would by far be the most lucrative strategy. According to agency estimates, a per-mile tax on driving could raise $102 billion over a decade, while a fee to enter downtown could raise $12 billion.
"This is the eradication of congestion," said Metro Chief Executive Phil Washington, who said the benefits would reach beyond 2028. "This is sending out a message to the world that Los Angeles County is doing something about its traffic."
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the Olympics transit and highway projects should be "disentangled" from the question of congestion pricing.
He said Metro can close the $26.2 billion gap by pursuing federal funds and other financing strategies to build on the money raised through Measure M, the sales tax increase voters approved in 2016.
"I don't yet support any particular proposal or congestion pricing as a philosophy," Garcetti said. "But if it can work and if it can help us achieve our goals. ... I think it's a conversation worth starting. I'm going to push very strongly to do that."
A modest form of congestion pricing is already in place on the 110 and 10 freeways, where drivers who are alone in their cars can pay by the mile to use carpool lanes. As congestion in the lanes rises, so do the tolls, to a maximum of more than $20 for a one-way trip.
Expanding those lanes to other freeways would be a good first step toward a more complete pricing system, said Martin Wachs, a professor emeritus of urban planning at UCLA. That change would help regulate traffic flow and let some drivers pay to get places faster, he said.
Similar strategies have relieved congestion in every city where they have been tried, including Singapore, Stockholm and London.
In 2003, officials imposed a toll to enter London's city center between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Over a decade, the change - fought by auto interest groups and business owners - reduced congestion by 10 percent and raised the equivalent of $3 billion.
In the United States, the idea has been a nonstarter. In New York City, the idea has died and been resurrected so often since the 1970s that the New York Times called it "the Lazarus of congestion plans."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Has President Trump ever heard of the Berlin Wall? It is hard to think so from his explanation of his decision to stop the government shutdown to give congressional leaders a chance to provide funding for a wall between the United States and Mexico ("Shutdown Ends With No Funding for Wall," front page, Jan. 26).
Part of his speech was a paean to walls:
"They do work. No matter where you go, they work. Israel built a wall, 99.9 percent successful. Won't be any different for us. They keep criminals out. They save good people from attempting a very dangerous journey from other countries, thousands of miles, because they think they have a glimmer of hope of coming through. With a wall, they don't have that hope."
No, and people living in East Germany didn't have that hope for almost three decades after the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. Every American president from John F. Kennedy to George H.W. Bush denounced the cruelty of that wall. Its demise in 1989 led to the reunification of Germany, a great victory for democracy and a fatal defeat for the Communist dictatorships in East Berlin and Moscow that had erected it.
Now, Vladimir Putin has second thoughts about all that; has Donald Trump ever had a first thought about the Berlin Wall?

Texto completo: Illustration Michael Gerson Washington Post

WASHINGTON — The news that Donald Trump's approval rating is near historical lows brings some relief that the laws of political gravity still apply. When the president is doing a spectacularly bad job, a majority of our fellow citizens — or at least a clear majority of people contacted for the Washington Post-ABC News poll — think Trump is doing badly.
Compared with polling from when Trump took office, perceptions of the president's performance have plummeted on the federal budget deficit, on improving the health care system and on the economy.
Perhaps the greatest danger to Trump's political future is the cost of these negative perceptions to his brand. The president was elected, in part, by giving his supporters an impression of business acumen. This was, in fact, the image carefully cultivated by book publishers and TV producers. And by Trump himself as a presidential candidate, who claimed to be a peerless negotiator, an unrivaled businessman and an excellent manager.
These claims can now only be believed by the ideologically addled.
The problem for Trump is not only that he lost the most visible and important confrontation of his presidency — in negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the government shutdown. It is that his methods are so blunt and transparent. His typical tactic is to raise the stakes of a negotiation impossibly high — a government shutdown or nuclear war — then to make a maximal demand and trust in the triumph of his stronger will. It is a form of negotiation ended by someone saying "uncle." That Trump ended up in abject humiliation was perhaps fated by biology: You can only angrily hold your breath for so long.
If, in the next stage, the loser acts unilaterally under the pretense of a border security crisis, it will merely prove that Trump is a dangerously sore loser. For the MBAs taking notes, this complex negotiating strategy is known as: Throwing the game off the table if you can't win.
Meanwhile, in a variety of global negotiations, American opponents need only master one method: flattery. In Trump's words, "I know people, because deals are people ... If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin respects me, and if Putin wants to call me brilliant, and other things that he said which were, frankly, very nice, I'll accept that." Taken at face value, Trump is arguing: Deals are people. People who praise me have good judgment. Thus, people who praise me make good deals. Hearing these sentiments from an American president is enough to gag a historian. It is pathetic gullibility elevated into the realm of theory. It should concern us that the American president is a source of global derision and national shame.
The other branding claims made by Trump have become equally incredible. His reputation as a self-made billionaire lies in ruins. An extensive New York Times story on Trump's wealth found a bassinet millionaire, consistently bailed out of bad bets, who dodged gift taxes, milked his empire for cash and cultivated a deceptive image of business brilliance. And special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may reveal serious corruption and perjury in cataloguing Trump's 30-year panting desire to sell his brand in Russia.
And who can take Trump seriously as a manager? He has a talent for weeding out the talented and responsible. He is a world-class nepotist. He is incapable of delegation or of taking conflicting advice. He is unreliable in dealing with his allies. He is capable of taking several conflicting policy views on the same topic — be it health care, or the Dreamers, or gun control — in a matter of days or hours. He often has no clear goals. He has no attention span and is consistently ignorant of details. He is prone to vicious and public abuse of rivals and of employees. Try to put that profile up on LinkedIn.
Those 37 percent who approve of Trump's performance may point to the state of the economy or the composition of the Supreme Court. They may be impressed by his destruction of norms or enthused by his promotion of exclusion. They may want a president who speaks his mind, even when it is hateful gibberish. They may want a president who is an institutional arsonist, even if the result is mere destruction.
But no one can reasonably claim to believe in Trump's brand as it was sold in 2016. We have plumbed the shallows of his boasts. They are refuted lies. And whatever else the president may be, he is a fraud.

Texto completo: Dear Earthtalk: What is the so-called Green New Deal proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and is Congress likely to go for it? - Mark Talarico, Brooklyn, NY
The concept of a "Green New Deal (GND), first called for in a 2007 New York Times op-ed by Thomas Friedman, has been in the news lately thanks to a protest outside of Nancy Pelosi's office in mid-November a week after the 2018 mid-term elections when Democrats took back the House. The goal of the GND is to put America at the forefront of green technologies to meet or exceed our Paris climate treaty commitments while boosting the economy and reducing economic inequality.
Think of it as like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's original "New Deal that helped get Americans back on their feet economically after the Great Depression through the creation of millions of federally-funded jobs that not only employed people but boosted U.S. economic productivity. The GND aims to give Americans a leg up in profiting off the transition to greener energy sources while simultaneously reducing the divide between the haves and have-nots.
At that November protest, hundreds of activists affiliated with the so-called Sunrise Movement showed up to call on Pelosi to back omnibus economic stimulus legislation that would put millions of Americans to work on facilitating the transition to an economy powered by 100 percent renewable, emissions-free energy. Later that day incoming Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez showed her support by proposing the creation of a new House Select Committee on a Green New Deal tasked with detailing a "national, industrial, economic mobilization plan capable of making the U.S. economy carbon neutral' while promoting economic and environmental justice and equality'.
"There are so many different progressive issues that are important, and climate change and addressing renewable energy always gets to the bottom of the barrel, Ocasio-Cortez told The Intercept. "That can gets kicked from session to session and so what this just needs to do is create a momentum and an energy to make sure that that it becomes a priority for leadership.
At least 45 House members have expressed support for the GND, while eight likely Democratic presidential candidates (including Jay Inslee, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) are also behind it. And with the majority of Americans favoring taking strong action against climate change even if it means higher taxes, implementing some of kind of GND seems like a no-brainer.
But environmentalists might not want to hold their breath. For starters, Ocasio-Cortez's proposal for the creation of a new House Select Committee on a Green New Deal won't be ready for a full House vote until 2020. Also, just because 40 members of Congress are supportive now doesn't say anything about where the other 395 Congresspersons stand, let alone the 100 members of the still-Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, conservative critics point out that a Green New Deal could actually hurt the economy more than help it given how reliant we are on abundant and cheap fossil fuels. Even some liberals worry that the GND is trying to bite off more than we can chew. Only time will tell if something like the GND will become the law of the land - and many greens are keeping their fingers crossed.

Texto completo: Within living memory, political polarization had at least something to do with issues, but in the age of social media it's almost entirely about social type. It's about finding and spreading the viral soap operas that are supposed to reveal the dark hearts of those who are the opposite social type from your own.
It's about finding images that confirm your negative stereotypes about people you don't know. It's about reducing a complex human life into one viral moment and then banishing him or her to oblivion.
You don't have to read social theory on this phenomenon; just look at the fracas surrounding the Covington Catholic High School boys.
For those of you vacationing on Mars over the past 10 days, a video went viral showing a group of boys, many of them in MAGA hats, surrounding an older Native American man who was banging a drum.
The man, Nathan Phillips, told two different versions of what happened. He told The Washington Post that he was singing a traditional song when the teenagers swarmed around him, some chanting, "Build that wall, build that wall." He decided the right thing to do was to get away. "I've got to find myself an exit out of this situation."
He told The Detroit Free Press that the incident started when the boys started attacking four African-Americans. So he decided to intervene. "There was that moment when I realized I've put myself between beast and prey. These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey."
Many news organizations ran one of these accounts. Before you judge the reporters too harshly, it's important to remember that these days the social media tail wags the mainstream media dog. If you want your story to be well placed and if you want to be professionally rewarded, you have to generate page views - you have to incite social media. The way to do that is to reinforce the prejudices of your readers.
In this one episode, you had a gentle, 64-year-old Native American man being swarmed by white (boo!), male (boo!), preppy (double boo!) Trump supporters (infinite boo!). If you are trying to rub the pleasure centers of a liberal audience, this is truly a story too good to check.
Saturday was a day of liberal vindication. See! This is what those people do! This is who they really are. Reza Aslan, the religious scholar, tweeted a photo of the main Covington boy and asked, "Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?" The filmmaker Michael Green showed the same image and tweeted: "A face like that never changes. This image will define his life. No one need ever forgive him."
The institutions in charge of serving the boys did what institutions always do in the face of a social media mob. They cratered. The school and archdiocese apologized. The mayor of Covington denounced them.
Then several longer videos emerged showing that most of what Mr. Phillips had told the media was inaccurate. The incident actually started when members of the hate cult - the Black Hebrew Israelites - started hurling racist and homophobic slurs at the boys.
The Covington boys eventually asked their chaperone if they could do their school cheers. As they were doing that Mr. Phillips walked into the middle of their circle and banged his drum in the face of one of the boys. Everybody was suddenly confused. Students shouted, "What is going on?" Then there was confusion and discomfort, smirking and verbal jousting.
Everybody involved in the incident was operating in an emotional and moral context that has been set by the viciousness of the Black Hebrew Israelites. Of the major players, the boys' behavior is probably the least egregious.
So Sunday was a day of conservative vindication. See? This is what those liberals do! They rush to judgment, dehumanize and seek to expunge us from national life. The main boy wrote a public letter that was consistent with the visual evidence and that was actually quite humane.
In this case the facts happened to support the right-wing tribe. But that's not the point. The crucial thing is that the nation's culture is now enmeshed in a new technology that we don't yet know how to control.
In this technology, stereotype is more salient than persons. In this technology, a single moment is more important than a life story. In this technology, a main activity is proving to the world that your type is morally superior to the other type.
The Covington case was such a blatant rush to judgment - it was powered by such crude prejudice and social stereotyping - I'm hoping it will be an important pivot point. I'm hoping that at least a few people start thinking about norms of how decent people should behave on these platforms.
It's hard to believe that people are going to continue forever on platforms where they are so cruel to one another. It's hard to believe that people are going to be content, year after year, to distort their own personalities in service to a platform, making themselves humorless, semi-blind, joyless and grim.

Texto completo: Wall no match for drones
The speed of technology may be the death knell of the wall. Drones are controlled remotely, and they are increasing in size and how much weight they can carry. So imagine a 20-foot-high wall and a drone that could clear that and be under radar. Drop drugs or people on the other side and return without a pilot. Second-century defense against 21st-century technology. If you are a betting person, you know that outcome.
-- Ed Washak, Yorkville

BuzzFeed guilty of 'fake news'?
I hate to admit it, but President Donald Trump may have it half right when he accuses the media of producing fake news. With the questioning of the veracity of BuzzFeed's news report that Trump directed his attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress in 2017 about a Moscow real estate deal, and special counsel Robert Mueller's office deeming it "not accurate," perhaps it's time to take a closer look at the new media outlets and determine whether they are truly dependable news sources. After all, even longtime news icons like The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and Fox News have had their fair share of egg applied to their faces over the years.
BuzzFeed reporter Anthony Cormier defended his story's accuracy and told CNN that they are confident in their reporting. But, you have to wonder when a man like Mueller, who is known for his honesty and candor, says it ain't so, it probably is not. Stay tuned.
-- Michael Oakes, Chicago

Give our veterans flexibility
Your call for allowing military veterans access to private medical care providers ("The VA solution: Expanding medical care choices for veterans," Jan. 21) is most welcome. Care for veterans is not public welfare but a well-earned acknowledgment of their military service. Veterans must be free to receive medical care where it is available if the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot provide it. That care is simple justice in fulfillment of a moral obligation.
-- Richard E. Ralston,
Executive director, Americans for Free Choice in Medicine, Newport Beach, Calif.

Don't privatize veterans' care
The Tribune Editorial Board supports the Trump administration's plan to replace the Veterans Choice program. Which it admits is very popular among us veterans. This plan would continue right-wing efforts to privatize veterans' health care. The editorial cites Concerned Veterans of America, a Koch brothers-funded group, to support its argument. The American Legion has characterized the CVA as a mouthpiece group for the Koch brothers. Veterans Service Organizations, which include Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Paralyzed Veterans of America and represent millions of veterans, oppose privatization and fully support the VA. The Tribune would do well to include all groups before it throws its support to this terrible plan.
-- Paul Breit, Tinley Park

'Culture' of noise afflicts games
Reader Dietrich Miller's description of a "culture" of noise goes beyond restaurants and into sports venues throughout Chicago. For example, at the United Center, Blackhawks management somehow thinks that playing ear-splitting music during every stoppage of play, if only for a few seconds, enhances the "game experience" at Hawks games. Sitting in the 300 level the other night, I had to shout to hold a conversation with the person sitting next to me while the Foo Fighters blasted through the United Center speakers before the next faceoff.
And this starts with the moment the teams come on the ice for pregame warmups. Fans used to be able to hear skate blades on the ice and pucks hitting sticks during warmup. Now it's one snippet of music after another played at headache-inducing decibel levels. Kiss cams and scoreboard shots of fans who've had a few too many beers can be ignored. But it's hard to ignore loud music played throughout the evening other than when the game is actually underway.
-- Michael Pajonk, Oak Park

Pritzker laughable regarding fair taxes
Had a great laugh listening to Gov. J.B. Pritzker talk about fair taxes. All this coming from the richest politician in the nation who got a more than $300,000 property-tax cut by removing five toilets in one of his mansions in Cook County.
Once again, Illinois votes for stingy people who don't want to pay their fair share of taxes.
-- Steven Durfey, Bartlett

KNICKS' TEARDOWN BEGINS BUILDUP

Texto completo: It has become increasingly clear in recent days that Enes Kanter and the Knicks will part ways soon, whether it is by trade, a buyout agreement or simply waiting out the clock for the end of the season.
But as the Feb. 7 trade deadline looms, Kanter certainly is not the only member of the roster whom the team is seeking to move.
At 10-37 with eight straight losses, 16 in their last 17 games and 21 in the last 23, the Knicks are in a free fall toward the NBA Draft Lottery, the place that was the goal all along in what the team readily admitted is a rebuilding season. But rebuilding might not be an accurate term, because the Knicks are in the teardown phase.
When The New York Times reported this past week that Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee are being shopped, it hardly came as a surprise. With Joakim Noah already bought out earlier this season, Kanter, Hardaway and Lee have the top salaries on the payroll and, more important, Hardaway and Lee have deals that extend beyond this season.
The Knicks are intent on being players in the free- agent market in July. Moving Hardaway or Lee without taking back a contract that goes beyond this season would allow them to pay a veteran max contract to the likes of Kevin Durant ... and maybe even move into the realm of chasing two top free agents.
In their dreams, adding a pair of stars to a returning Kristaps Porzingis, 2018 lottery pick Kevin Knox and - as long as they're dreaming - the top pick in the 2019 draft is the next step of the rebuild.
So which Knicks are available? Well, almost everyone.
Kanter: Despite averaging a double-double, the center has not played a minute in the last two games, and his benching might make sense. As coach David Fizdale explained Friday, "We're fighting for a certain style of play to start building for our future. I want to be able to play a very versatile style in the future and I don't want to wait to start working at that and start building that out." But it also has led to the first open mutiny in the locker room this season, with Kanter and Fizdale playing out a less-star-powered version of the recent Carmelo Anthony vs. Phil Jackson Knicks wars. The image- conscious Knicks would like Kanter to take his public persona elsewhere as soon as possible. He certainly can help a team with his scoring and offensive rebounding, even if he is an old-school center. However, because of a hefty salary that is hard to match, a buyout may be the way out.
Hardaway: The Knicks' leading scorer didn't exactly get a vote of confidence when Fizdale explained his 39 minutes on the floor and why he isn't also being pushed aside to let the kids play. He pointed out, "Tim Hardaway is making $18 million for two more years with us. He's a part of our future from that standpoint." A streaky scorer who has endured too many nights like Friday, when he shot 2-for-14 as the primary threat, Hardaway has played hard throughout the mounting losses.
Lee: A classic "3 and D" player, able to shoot from the perimeter and defend on the wing, he also is a locker-room dream, well-liked at every one of his many stops in the NBA. A perfect bench piece for a contending team.
The kids: Of the young-and-under-control homegrown pieces, Frank Ntilikina is the mystery, a player who has never seemed to fit in the Knicks' plans - even if he would be a nice complementary piece on an offensively potent group if the Knicks' plans come to fruition. He still is well-regarded by many NBA teams with his defensive skills and length. Like Lee, Damyean Dotson is seen as a useful two-way player. Knox, the first lottery pick of the current front office, isn't going anywhere.
The one-and-dones: During the last year, the Knicks have stocked the roster with reclamation projects Noah Vonleh, Mario Hezonja, Emmanuel Mudiay and Trey Burke. According to one Eastern Conference executive, all hold little value on the trade market. Vonleh, with a low cost and an expanding skill set, could be attractive to a team looking for an additional playoff piece.
In the meantime . . .
While the Knicks pile up losses, Fizdale insisted that the struggles are not going to destroy the locker-room culture.
"No. I think everybody likes Philly's team right now. I think everybody likes Denver's team right now,'' he said. "All these young teams that went through hell for the last three years. I think everybody likes Brooklyn's team right now. So no, the early losing just gets you hard. You got to get steeled up.
"You're not just going to walk in here as a young team and come in and win. I think that's where the misconception comes. Like oh, you say, 'a winning culture.' Most winning cultures start with getting your butt kicked first. Unless you're walking into a gym full of stars.
"You got to go through the lumps. A lot of examples I can point at that are starting to rise out of that. And they've added a couple pieces here and there. But they really developed their young core and those guys are starting to play like veterans."
Parting shots
The Rockets are firing up 44.36 attempts per game from beyond the arc, which would top the record set by last year's Houston squad. Asked about his efforts to change the game, coach Mike D'Antoni insisted he has been working toward this for years and through his coaching stops.
"It's evolved, like everything. Analytics has really helped me," the former Knicks coach said.
"When I was in Phoenix, we'd come back and we'd lose taking 30 threes and everybody would be saying, 'That's too much, you can't do that, it's wrong.' Then players would start believing it and you'd have problems. But it's evolved, and probably my biggest mistake in Phoenix was not shooting enough.
"Definitely in New York, we didn't shoot enough of them, although they'd have probably run me out of town earlier. But so be it. If you're not as good as the other people, you have to play the odds even more. And you'll get beat sometimes.
"In Phoenix, we had a saying: 'You can't out-Shaq Shaq, so we've got to figure out something else.' That's not going to work. We can trot people out and he's going to kill us. We started shooting threes and spreading the floor."

Texto completo: PRIMGHAR, Iowa - Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted 424-1 to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
Addressing what he called "the elephant in the room" in his opening remarks at Saturday's event, King expressed frustration that his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy in The New York Times interview led to even his fellow Republicans disowning him.
"It is stunning and astonishing to me that four words in a New York Times quote can outweigh 20-some years of public service, 20-some years of giving you my word every day," King said.
Trudeau fires envoy to China over U.S. extradition remarks
TORONTO - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired Canada's ambassador to China after the envoy said it would be "great" if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for a Chinese tech executive arrested in Canada. Trudeau said Saturday he had asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation Friday night.
McCallum made the remark Friday to the Toronto Star. That came a day after he issued a statement saying he misspoke about the case earlier and regretted saying Meng Wanzhou has a strong case against extradition.
The arrest of the daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Ltd. at Vancouver's airport Dec. 1 damaged relations between China and Canada. The U.S. wants her extradited to face charges that she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
U.S. envoy points to 'significant progress' in talks with Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan said Saturday that "significant progress" was made during lengthy talks with the Taliban in Qatar and that he was traveling to Afghanistan for more discussions aimed at ending the country's 17-year war.
Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that he wants to build on six days of meetings in Doha.
Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have reached an understanding on the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops and that Afghan soil will not be used for attacks or threats against other countries.
There was also no indication that the Taliban would agree to a cease-fireor when the Taliban would hold direct talks with the Afghan government, something they have continued to reject.
Manhunt underway for suspect in 5 related killings in Louisiana
NEW ORLEANS - Authorities in Louisiana say separate but related shootings Saturday in two parishes have left five people dead, and they're searching for a 21-year-old man they say is "armed and dangerous."
Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said Dakota Theriot is the "prime suspect" in the deaths of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot of Gonzales, his parents.
The sheriff said three other shooting deaths occurred Saturday in neighboring Livingston Parish, about 70 miles west of New Orleans.
"We feel that they are related," Webre said.
Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard identified the victims as Billy Ernest, 43, Summer Ernest, 20, and Tanner Ernest, 17. Two children fled. A neighbor said Theriot was the older daughter's boyfriend.
Merkel calls on each citizen to fight anti-Semitism
BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on every citizen to help fight anti-Semitism ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Merkel said Saturday in her weekly podcast: "Today we are seeing a very different kind of anti-Semitism: there's the hatred of Jews by our local people, but also by Muslim migrants."
In recent years, Germany has seen a rising number of attacks against Jews that led the government to appoint a commissioner against anti-Semitism. It's also funding the creation of a national registration office for anti-Semitic hate crimes.
On Sunday, Germany and other countries will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day - 75 years after the Soviet army liberated the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland. Some 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
Death toll rises to 40
in collapse at Brazil mine
BRUMADINHO, Brazil - The death toll from the collapse of a dam holding back mine waste in southeastern Brazil rose to 40 Saturday as searchers in helicopters and rescuers laboring in deep mud uncovered more bodies. More than 200 people were still missing and authorities expected the death toll to rise.
Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais, warned that those responsible "would be punished."
Daily Folha de S.Paulo reported Saturday that the dam's mining complex, owned and operated by Brazilian mining company Vale, was issued an expedited license to expand in December due to "decreased risk."
Preservation groups in the area say the approval was unlawful.
In addition to the 40 bodies recovered, 23 people were hospitalized.
In Mexico: The death toll from a pipeline explosion last week in Tlahuelilpan, a town in central Mexico, has risen to 114, while 33 people remain hospitalized. Hundreds of people were in the vicinity of an illegal pipeline tap that spewed gasoline in the town Jan. 18 when the liquid caught fire and exploded into a fireball.
In France: The yellow vest movement kept pressure on President Emmanuel Macron with mainly peaceful marches and scattered skirmishes Saturday, its 11th straight weekend. Protests took place in Paris and other cities, centered on Macron policies seen as favoring the rich. France deployed 80,000 police officers.

Texto completo: Ronnie Eldridge picks up the phone in her Upper West Side apartment on the second ring, then reflexively anticipates the caller's first question.
"The house," she says, laughing, "is very quiet."  
The former New York City councilwoman, currently host of CUNY TV's "Eldridge & Co." knows from quiet. In 1982, she married a world-famous columnist for the Daily News, later for Newsday, who - it seemed - had never once lapsed into silence over a distinguished if clamorous career. After they were married, Jimmy Breslin moved into her apartment, with his six children joining Eldridge and her three. (Breslin's first wife, Rosemary, died in 1981, Eldridge's husband, Lawrence, in 1970).
The kids have long since moved out. Breslin died of pneumonia on March 19, 2017, leaving Eldridge with memories of an association that began over half a century ago. They're all good memories, she says, and calls that marriage "thirty-five great years."  
Meanwhile, Japanese journalist and author Fukiko Aoki -   wife of veteran columnist Pete Hamill - says matter-of-factly in another phone interview, "I'm tired."
She works from the Prospect Heights apartment she and Hamill moved into a couple of years ago. In addition to caring for her ailing husband, she's been promoting the upcoming HBO film, "Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists," which premieres Monday at 8 p.m.
"I'm tired," she repeats. "That's the truth. Every day I can't think of the future, but tomorrow I will be OK."
Deadline artists, but also lions of New York journalism, Breslin and Hamill are silenced now and the city they covered with so much brio inevitably quieter, too. But their absence from the scene is most keenly felt by two people.
Aoki says Hamill, 83, is doing much better, after nearly dying five years ago. He's still on a walker and undergoes dialysis three times a week for kidney failure. She says he requires 24-hour care.
Eldridge, who just turned 88, says she's gone back to working on a book because "Jimmy always thought. everyone should write [one]." The problem, she says, is "no one wants to read about me."
Both Aoki and Eldridge appear in "Deadline Artists," along with some 45 other admirers, family members and celebrities like Spike Lee and Robert De Niro. Over several especially poignant scenes taped a few years ago, Hamill and Breslin are also together on-screen. 
Elegiac, often moving, "Deadline Artists" is a requiem for a pair of heavyweights as well as the type of print journalism they once practiced. It was produced by three veteran television journalists, Jonathan Alter, John Block and Steve McCarthy. Block, a former NBC News producer and native Chicagoan, came to New York in 1974 when he fell under Breslin's considerable spell.
In person, he found his onetime idol both "receptive" to the film and "agreeable. Any excuse to see Pete was a good day for Jimmy. Until the end, they had that kind of affection."
"Deadline Artists" tracks the paths of two opposite but equal forces, one of them a poet, the other a howitzer. "Deadline's" Hamill is melancholy, ruminative, nostalgic, its Breslin a propulsive champion of New Yorkers in need of one. (His 1986 Pulitzer cited columns  that "consistently champion ordinary citizens.")   
Its New York is bygone. "Once there was another city here and now it is gone," Hamill reads from a long-ago New York magazine article. "The lost city of New York."
In that lost city, there were once a dozen newspapers, then a handful. Both Queens-born Breslin and Brooklyn-born Hamill drifted among a few of them. Over half a century they covered both Kennedy assassinations, the Bernhard Goetz case and Son of Sam killings, the AIDS crisis, the Crown Heights and Central Park Jogger cases, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Their voices diverged, but their crusades were one. Hamill blasted those who leapt to judgment with the Central Park Five. Breslin rose up against Goetz and the NYPD. Their battles were lonely and ultimately vindicated.  
Breslin revolutionized the hardscrabble city column, Hamill perfected it, and together they created a type of literature. As "Deadline" suggests, Hamill also had a long view of their trade, or, as he puts it, "journalism is tomorrow's history." Nevertheless, journalism - in the parlance of their era - was also fishwrap by the end of the day. The way they practiced it is now largely extinct, while their New York - a fractured city of racial divisions with a Bronx-is-burning national profile - is a relic too.
It's hard to imagine how these two might function in today's world of new media, with its influencers, social media barons and politicized cable networks. Wisely, "Deadline Artists" doesn't try.
"Patrick Kavanagh, an Irish poet of the mid-20th century, had a saying that the standing army of Irish poetsnever falls below 20,000, and at one point you could have said the same for Irish American columnists," said Jim Dwyer, a Pulitzer Prize winner for New York Newsday, now a writer for The New York Times, in a phone interview. "Their ranks have clearly dwindled and I think there's very little appetite or platform for the specific kind of city column that those guys did."
What they did, however, was vitally important. "New York was very broken, and Hamill was the clarion voice that said do not mistake the wreckage for the people. He was standing up for a place that was under siege."
In a phone interview, Aoki says "it was a good part of New York history that we had such great journalists and it's remarkable we're losing that kind of journalism. It's so sad. Will there be others? I hope, I hope, but it's very hard."
Meanwhile, Eldridge, too, keeps "trying to imagine what [Breslin] would be doing today."
"He could never get the computer. Can you imagine Jimmy on social media? He didn't even understand email."
Eldridge also wants to believe that her husband - who raged at presidents and impostors for  60 years - would remain an optimist.  
"He would have to be," she says. "He always thought things would get better. But now I don't really know. I can't fi

Texto completo: In 1911, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen became the first person to reach the South Pole. When he got back, he sent the story of his adventures to The New York Times. More than 100 years later, in November and December 2018, a new Antarctic adventure appeared in The Times: the race between two men, Colin O'Brady, 33, and Louis Rudd, 49, to be the first person to ski from one side of Antarctica to the other alone and without help. When Amundsen reached the South Pole, readers had to wait months to hear his story. This time, though, reporters and Times readers could follow O'Brady and Rudd almost in real time as they journeyed over 920 miles of ice. NOV. 3, 2018 A plane -- with skis instead of wheels -- dropped O'Brady and Rudd off in Antarctica about a mile apart from each other. They took sleds, called pulks, full of their supplies: a tent, extra skis, food and more. At the beginning, each pulk weighed about 375 pounds. NOV. 9 O'Brady took the lead in the race after skiing behind Rudd during the first week. NOV. 22 Rudd decided to split his heavy load in half so it didn't weigh so much, carrying some of his supplies two miles forward, then going back for the rest. While he was gone, snow buried the supplies he left behind. Losing this kit would have been a disaster, but he found it just in time. EARLY DECEMBER Both men reached the polar plateau, a large, high area in the middle of Antarctica. The temperatures dropped as they went higher, reaching 30 degrees or more below zero. The two men's expedition teams let them know the GPS coordinates of the other, so they always knew who was ahead and by how much. DEC. 12-13 O'Brady reached the South Pole first, followed by Rudd a day later. There is a research station there that has warm food, showers and beds, but neither man was allowed to accept any help. The scientists came out to cheer them on, the first people they had seen in almost six weeks. DEC. 20-21 Rudd had his best day yet, covering 27 miles and narrowing the gap with O'Brady, who went 20. The next day, though, O'Brady picked up his pace: He went 33 miles, to Rudd's 26, with about 150 miles to go. The historic race got a lot of attention from Times readers, especially as the two men drew closer to the finish. "If there's a cooler thing going on right now than two guys ski-racing across Antarctica, I'd like to see it," Matt Futterman, a deputy sports editor, said. DEC. 25-28 Instead of stopping to sleep, O'Brady kept going for 32 hours. In Antarctica, the sun never sets in December, so it's easy to see at night. He skied almost 80 miles and reached the finish line first, on Dec. 26. Two days later Rudd finished, too. Skolnick spoke to both after they finished: Win or lose, they were excited by what they had accomplished, and happy that neither had been hurt. ◊
Daily Habits
Every night, each man made dinner and checked in with his expedition team to plan the next day of skiing. They also hung their clothes up to dry -- they didn't carry extra ones, to save weight. REPORTING: Interviews
Before the two men set out, the journalist Adam Skolnick, who writes about extreme athletes, spent about a week with them and their teams in Punta Arenas, Chile, to observe their preparations. Times History
Amundsen wasn't the only polar explorer to have ties to The New York Times. In 1929 Richard Byrd became the first person to fly to the South Pole. He was a friend of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who became The Times's publisher, and named several Antarctic landmarks after members of the Sulzberger family.
REPORTING: Phones
Normal phones don't work in Antarctica, so once they were on the ice, Skolnick spoke to the adventurers on special phones that sent signals through a satellite. He could also exchange text messages with O'Brady. Each explorer had enough bandwidth to upload one photograph of his journey each day, which often took hours to transmit. REPORTING: Tracker
Each man had a GPS tracker that used satellites to send his exact location to a team monitoring his progress. The New York Times used the locations to update a map every day, so readers could follow along with the race, too.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Our Reporter Found $90 in the Subway. Is It Yours?

Texto completo: As I got off a train in Manhattan on Wednesday, I paid little attention to a flutter out of the corner of my eye on the subway. Then another passenger told me that I had dropped some money.
"That isn't mine," I told her as I glanced at what turned out to be $90 on the ground.
I realized the flutter had been the money falling out of the coat of a man standing near me who had just stepped off the train.
The doors were about to close, and no one was acting, so I grabbed the cash and left the train. But I was too late. The man had disappeared into the crowd. I waited a few minutes to see if he would return, but he was long gone. I tried to find a transit employee or police officer, but none were in sight.
I was running late, so I left. But now what? What are you supposed to do with money that isn't yours?
Note: Are you the mystery man? If so, email me at niraj.chokshi@nytimes.com with as many corroborating details as you can, including 1) the subway line 2) the stop 3) the time 4) the denominations of the bills and 5) your general appearance, including your coat and its color.
The philosophical take
Ethicists generally approach moral questions like this in one of three ways, according to Andrew L. McFarland, a professor of philosophy at LaGuardia Community College in Queens.
One approach, credited to Immanuel Kant, is focused on motive: I should return the money because it's my moral duty to do so, period.
"Kant says, 'Look, it seems to be that what makes this the right thing to do is doing it because it's the right thing to do, not because you're worried about the possible repercussions,"' Mr. McFarland said.
That contrasts with the second approach, which is concerned with the consequences. What will happen if I return the money? What if I donate it to a charity instead? Under that approach, I might act in a way that I believe will produce the most good and alleviate suffering.
The third and final approach, whose intellectual forebears include Aristotle and Confucius, focuses on virtue. Under that approach, I would act neither out of duty nor fear of consequences, but by my sense of what is right. I might seek out the advice of my most moral friend: What would a person who is virtuous do?
In the end, though, Mr. McFarland told me what he tells his students: These approaches only offer guidance on how to think about a problem.
"Ultimately, you've got to figure out what you're going to do on your own," he said.
What the law says
The law is more prescriptive, even if most have no clue what it says, according to Bruce Green, a professor and director of the Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics at Fordham Law School.
"The question is, 'Does the law accord with people's ordinary moral and societal intuitions?"' said Mr. Green, who is also the chairman of the New York City Bar Association's Professional Ethics Committee.
"Because nobody's going to know to look up the law unless somebody gets a call from a reporter," he added.
Mr. Green was gracious enough to do just that and here's what he found: Under Section 252 of New York personal property law, any person who finds an item worth $20 or more has 10 days to return it to the owner or report it to the authorities. Fail to do so, and you face a maximum fine of $100 and up to six months in prison. (Yikes!)
"I don't think anyone's going to prosecute you," Mr. Green assured me. He also offered a recommendation in case I wanted to keep the cash: "Don't write a piece about it because that's pretty inculpatory." Noted.
[Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day.]
Time to act
I want to return the money, so that leaves me with a few options as the deadline approaches.
One of them should be obvious by now. As a reporter at The New York Times, I have access to a huge platform through which I can spread the news. Hey, guy, I have your money!
For most people in this situation, though, the best option is to turn the money over to a transit official or a police officer.
Station agents, train conductors or bus drivers who receive lost items or money typically collect as much information about the item as possible and provide a receipt to the person turning it in, according to Sarah Meyer, the chief customer officer for New York City Transit.
The lost item is then taken to the New York City Transit Lost Property Unit at Penn Station.
"It's carried by the same system that collects money out of vending machines, so it's very secure and always accompanied by armed personnel," Ms. Meyer said.
The transit agency keeps the items for anywhere from six months to three years, depending on their value. After that, the items are auctioned off with proceeds going to the transit agency's coffers. Last year, the agency returned about $127,000 in lost cash to owners.
The New York Police Department follows a similar procedure for lost items, though the person who turns in money or a valuable item may be able to keep it if it goes unclaimed.
Ideally, this article will mean a happy conclusion for the man who lost the money. If I don't find him within 10 days, I'll turn the cash over to the authorities.

Texto completo: Like so many who became addicted to painkillers and later overdosed and died, Cheryl Juaire's son was a good kid, a jokester and a people person, his mother says.
Corey J. Merrill started on OxyContin, the potent opioid made by Purdue Pharma. When addiction took hold, he turned to heroin, his mother said. He died in 2011 at age 23.
Juaire, of Marlborough, was among dozens of parents who have lost children to addiction who protested outside Suffolk Superior Court on Friday as lawyers for Purdue argued to keep concealed many pages of a lawsuit against the company brought by the Massachusetts attorney general's office. Purdue is accused of helping to spawn the opioid epidemic by aggressively marketing its powerful painkiller, OxyContin.
“They're criminals who did this all for greed and profit," Juaire said.
The parents stood in the cold for hours, clutching posters and photographs of their children. Some wore T-shirts emblazoned with a son or daughter's smiling face. They said they want Purdue and its executives held accountable for their critical role in the opioid crisis.
“I believe the Sackler family is the reason why we have this opioid epidemic," said Tony LaGreca of Duxbury, referring to the family that controls Purdue. “They've made billions of dollars killing our kids."
LaGreca said his son, Matthew, became addicted to opioids after a football injury resulted in a prescription for 100 pills of oxycodone. He died from an overdose years later, in 2014.
Carol Lorento of Boston said Purdue deserves blame for irresponsible marketing — and “lies, greed, and poor judgment" — that led to the opioid crisis. Her son, Derek, received a prescription for OxyContin after an arm fracture in high school and later used heroin. He died in 2016.
Now, Lorento is responsible for raising her 6-year-old grandson. “He knows that his dada's in heaven," she said.
Officials at Purdue, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said in a statement Friday that the company is working on several efforts to combat drug abuse and addiction, including initiatives to teach teenagers about the dangers of opioids.
“We share the protesters' concern about the opioid crisis, and respect their right to peacefully express themselves," spokesman Bob Josephson said. “Purdue is committed to working collaboratively with those affected by this public health crisis on meaningful solutions to help stem the tide of opioid-related overdose deaths."
The state Department of Public Health said there were 1,518 opioid-related overdose deaths in Massachusetts in the first nine months of 2018. That figure includes both confirmed and estimated deaths.
Attorney General Maura Healey has accused Purdue of misleading doctors and patients about the addiction and overdose risks of its medications in a lawsuit originally filed in June. The suit also named current and former Purdue executives and members of the Sackler family, which controls the privately held Purdue, as defendants.
An updated, 300-plus-page complaint from Healey's office filed last week contained newly public portions that showed Purdue executives and the Sacklers demanding greater sales of their medications despite the risks. The complaint alleges the company pressured salespeople to push physicians to prescribe higher doses of their drugs for longer periods of time to more patients.
Much of the document remains redacted, however, so a group of media organizations — including The Boston Globe, STAT, WBUR, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times — filed a motion to release the full document.
“Every day that goes by where this document is substantially under seal is a day that the public does not have access to newsworthy and important information," Jeffrey J. Pyle, a lawyer for the media organizations, argued Friday before Judge Janet L. Sanders.
Purdue lawyers, in a motion, have said “there is simply no urgent or compelling need to justify the media consortium's demand to immediately receive confidential information," arguing that releasing the full document would undermine the court processes with which the company is cooperating. Purdue faces several lawsuits in other states.
Timothy C. Blank, a lawyer for Purdue, said Friday that the company is also concerned about business trade secrets being made public.
The judge said she would rule on the redacted documents by early next week.
Healey sat in the courtroom throughout the two-hour hearing. Speaking with reporters afterward, she described it as “a good development" in the case.
“These families have had to endure so much in terms of stigma," Healey said. “It is really rich for this corporate defendant and corporate officers and directors to come forward and, under the guise of fear of embarrassment or shame about their alleged misconduct, to claim that this information shouldn't come to light."
“The public deserves to know," she said.
On her way into the courthouse, Healey hugged some of the teary-eyed mothers who had gathered outside in protest. “Our children need you!" one woman exclaimed.
Lynn Wencus, bundled in a puffy purple coat, wore a sandwich board of smiling faces — all young adults who died from overdoses — and she held a separate photo of her son, Jeff, who died in 2017.
“It's very important that we show their faces and say their names to remember them," said Wencus, of Wrentham. “I pray my son's death won't be in vain."

Texto completo: The divided government of 2019 is a mirror image of the divided government of 2011. Back then, Democrats controlled the White House and Senate, while Republicans had recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, Republicans control the White House and Senate, while Democrats have recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2018 midterms.
It’s the same situation, essentially. But today there is a vastly different public conversation about the balance of power in government. These days, we are often reminded that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and therefore Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands on an even level with President Trump. Back in 2011, when the two players were Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama, there wasn’t as much of that kind of talk.
Now, Democrats have been saying it every day. There was even talk to the effect that Pelosi is now equal to the president. The chief advocate: Pelosi herself. "Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, ‘The Constitution does,’" The New York Times reported in an article about the speaker.
A Jan. 17 discussion on CNN focused on the speaker’s battle with the president over the government shutdown and State of the Union address. Republican Rep. Michael Turner said of Pelosi, "She needs to come to some recognition that she’s not equal to the president of the United States."
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar, CNN analyst, and editor of the blog Lawfare, blanched. "Pretty wild to hear a member of Congress forcefully argue that congressional leaders are constitutionally inferior to the president," Hennessey tweeted. "James Madison weeps."
But the speaker of the House is not, in fact, equal to the president of the United States. Congress, not the House, is a co-equal branch of government. Actually, more than equal — it is, as Pelosi noted, the first branch of government. But to exert its will, Congress must be united. To overrule the president — and, of course, Congress can even remove the president — Congress must be united.
Pelosi controls just half of Congress. And she only controls the House when she gets 218 members to agree with her. To overrule a presidential veto, she needs 287 members to agree with her. And then the Senate, controlled by Republicans under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has to go along.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person. That gives that one person, in this case President Trump, the power of the executive branch. No single person in the other two branches has that power.
The bottom line is the House is one-half of a co-equal branch of government. The system simply was not designed for a head-to-head equal competition — the president versus the speaker. It doesn’t work that way. It’s entirely understandable that Democrats and their allies in the press would want to see Pelosi as equal to the president.
But that doesn’t make it true.

Elizabeth Warren to pitch 'wealth tax' on very rich Americans, adviser says

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will propose an annual "wealth tax" on Americans with more than $50 million in assets, according to an economist advising her on the plan, as Democratic leaders vie for increasingly aggressive solutions to the nation's soaring wealth inequality.
Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two left-leaning economists at the University of California at Berkeley, have been advising Warren on a proposal to levy a 2 percent wealth tax on Americans with assets greater than $50 million, as well as a 3 percent wealth tax on those who have more than $1 billion, according to Saez.
The wealth tax would raise $2.75 trillion over a 10-year period from about 75,000 families, or fewer than 0.1 percent of U.S. households, Saez said.
Warren's campaign declined to comment on details of the plan.
"The Warren wealth tax is pretty big. We think it could have a significant effect on wealth concentration in the long run," Saez said in an interview. "This is a very interesting development with deep root causes: the fact inequality has been increasing so much, particularly in wealth, and the feeling our current tax system doesn't do a very good job taxing the very richest people."
Warren's proposal includes at least three new mechanisms to combat tax evasion, according to a person familiar with the plan: a significant increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service; a mandatory audit rate requiring a certain number of people who pay the wealth tax to be subject to an annual audit; and a one-time tax penalty for those who have more than $50 million and try to renounce their U.S. citizenship.
Warren's wealth-tax proposal reflects the Democratic Party's leftward drift on economic policy and tax issues. Democratic politicians have traditionally shied away from proposing how they would raise revenue for fear of being branded "tax and spend" liberals, said Jim Manley, who served as an aide to Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) when Reid was Senate majority leader.
Saez and Zucman earlier this week published an op-ed in the New York Times about a proposal by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to raise marginal tax rates to 70 percent on income above $10 million, a plan the economists said would help combat an "inequality crisis" that is akin to climate change.
Republicans are likely to seize on the plan as another example of Democrats' looking to tax Americans' hard-earned gains, even though it would apply to only a tiny percentage of the population. In their major tax overhaul passed in December 2017, Republicans significantly raised the threshold for the federal estate tax - exempting estates with assets of $11.4 million (in 2019) or less from paying it. They have often referred to this provision as the "death tax."
Saez said the proposal came together quickly over the course of the past two weeks, while adding that the economists have spent years considering how to enact a wealth tax.
Saez and Zucman initially evaluated a proposal at Warren's request to levy a 1 percent wealth tax on income above $10 million, rather than a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, according to a Jan. 14 letter the economists sent to Warren. That letter was obtained by The Washington Post.
According to people familiar with the matter, Warren's team has considered multiple proposals with various tax rates.
In recent decades, the taxation of wealth has fallen out of favor in the world's richest countries. In 1990, 12 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had some form of wealth tax.
By 2017, that number had fallen to just four: France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. That decline has been mirrored by a decline in the taxation of high incomes as well as a rise in inequality, according to the OECD.
Estimates of how much money can be raised by taxing the very rich vary dramatically. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, published a report Wednesday finding that a 1 percent wealth tax on the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans would raise $1.3 trillion over a decade. That would affect U.S. households with wealth above $32.2 million.
But conservatives have warned that high taxes on the very rich will stifle growth, lead to capital flight and produce relatively minor revenue gains. This month, the right-leaning Tax Foundation found that Ocasio-Cortez's plan for a 70 percent tax rate would either raise only $189 billion in revenue over 10 years or lose the federal government $63.5 billion.

Critics: Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey's 'Serenity' is 'the daftest movie of 2019'

Texto completo: Reviews are in for the Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey-led thriller "Serenity" and critics thoughts on the movie are decidedly less serene.
The flick is a film noir-style thriller set on a fictional island, with McConaughey as a rough-around-the-edges sailor and Hathaway as his (blonde!) femme fatale ex-wife.
As a whole, reviews lament the lengths the movie went to prove it was a film noir.
"Everything is booze and dames and murder and money," writes Jeffrey M. Anderson of the San Francisco Examiner.
David Sims of The Atlantic has already dubbed it "officially the daftest movie of 2019," as well as a "dime-store romance novel come to life. "
" 'Serenity' has a premise so crackpot it’s impossible to believe that one of its 17 credited producers didn’t pull the director aside and slap him with a tuna," echoed Robert Horton of The Daily Herald. "The result is one of the weirdest releases to roll off the assembly line in some time. "
Wesley Morris of The New York Times writes the movie takes a strange science fiction turn.
"The more we learn about that half of things the less sense the rest of the movie makes," he writes. "That includes a big reveal that’s like the worst of Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan and the condolence-card section at Walgreens. "
The third act surprise also frustrated the Arizona Republic's Andy Cordova.
"A twist ending satisfies when it's surprising yet logical: You look back and say, 'Oh, now I see what that meant' and you piece together how things add up. That's fun," he writes. "But when an inane ending appears out of nowhere and purports to add depth to a movie which has little? That's just maddening. And the twist in 'Serenity' leaves you feeling both cheated and annoyed, which surely isn't the filmmaker's intention. "

More: Matthew McConaughey could have been Jack in 'Titanic' but he lost out to Leonardo DiCaprio
The Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called the movie a "cockamamie grief parable disguised as a tropical film noir. "
He added that it "dog-paddles around trying to figure out what to do with its own story, and how to do it, and who swiped the narrative compass, and where it’s all going, and why the payoff is so very, very not quite right. "
January is notably a time for less-than-stellar movies, but critics argued that "Serenity" took the cake.
"The January movie stands out not for its failings, but for the confidence and ingenuity with which it fails," writes The Guardian's Charles Bromesco. " 'Serenity' was written, directed, and produced by Steven Knight, who’s proven himself competent in all three disciplines as a one-time scribe for David Cronenberg, the helmer of 2014’s solid 'Locke,' and the creator of such BBC favorites as 'Peaky Blinders' and 'Taboo. ' "
He continued: "Evidently convinced of his own brilliance, Knight wielded enough industry cachet to steamroll the people generally tasked with keeping ideas like 'Serenity' in the brains of their makers. The January movie is what happens when someone with a lot of vision and a minimum of self-awareness stops hearing the word 'no,' and in this particular case, Knight lets his absolute assurance in his misguided mission run away with him all the way to Mauritius.

What's So 'Indecent' About Female Pleasure?

Texto completo: A personal massager, a sperm counter, virtual-reality pornography, something described as "the world's first ebook-driven sex toy": All of these products have been exhibited at CES, the country's largest consumer electronics convention. Two of them won awards there.
So Lora Haddock was surprised when Osé, a hands-free sex toy she designed with a team of engineers from Oregon State University, had its CES Innovation Award revoked after three weeks. In an email explaining the convention's change of heart, which Ms. Haddock shared with The New York Times, a representative cited a clause in the awards' terms and conditions that disqualified products deemed "immoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA's image." (CTA refers to the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES.)
"I was shocked," Ms. Haddock, 33, said, "and then I was angry." The award "signified a shift in inclusion," she said. "And then it was actually, no you're obscene and you're indecent and immoral, and you're not innovative at all."
Last year, CES had more than 180,000 attendees from around the world and racked up more than 100,000 mentions in media outlets, by its own count. For start-up companies like Ms. Haddock's, exhibiting at CES is crucial for attracting investment. It's all the more important for sexual wellness companies, which by their nature have a difficult time placing ads on platforms like Facebook, in magazines and in public spaces.
John Parmigiani, the director of the Prototype Development Lab at Oregon State University, first met Ms. Haddock in 2017, shortly after she had officially started her company, now called Lora DiCarlo. Over the years, Mr. Parmigiani -- who has worked with companies like Boeing and Daimler Trucks -- had become a go-to person for entrepreneurs seeking expertise in mechanical engineering.
"I went into the meeting with Lora having no idea what her product was," Mr. Parmigiani said in a recent interview. "The third sentence she said was along the lines of, 'I didn't have my first blended orgasm until I was 20-something years old."' Mr. Parmigiani said he was briefly taken aback but he kept listening.
"I thought, it's a little out of my comfort zone," he said, "but there's nothing wrong with it."
Ms. Haddock had used a term that describes a sexual climax reached from simultaneous external and internal stimulation. Her first blended orgasm, which Ms. Haddock said occurred at age 28, "knocked me off the bed onto the floor. I laid there wondering, how do I do that again?"
That wasn't what sold Mr. Parmigiani on the project.
"I gave him a list of 52 functional engineering requirements that would be needed to produce this product," Ms. Haddock said. "And that's when he lit up."
Ms. Haddock, who previously worked in health care and served in the Navy, is a self-described anatomy nerd. She knew she wanted her product to be customizable, so she started gathering data for where the G-spot and the clitoris are located on different bodies. "I tried to have that conversation with every single person with a vagina that I knew," Ms. Haddock said. "I literally asked them to measure it with their hands and a tape measure."
Osé, which will be available this fall for $250, expands, according to user preference, once placed on the pelvic girdle. It doesn't vibrate but uses gentle, autonomous motions and air flow to enhance stimulation. Eight patents associated with Osé are pending. The team that built it includes Dr. Ada-Rhodes Short, who specializes in robotics and artificial intelligence, and Lola Vars, a current doctoral candidate in design-focused mechanical engineering at Oregon State University.
In follow-up emails, officials from CES and the Consumer Technology Association appeared to step back from the earlier assertion about the product's violations of the morality clause, writing instead that Osé did not fit into the robotics and drones category, nor into any of the other product categories.
"It certainly is a robotic device if you look at a definition of a robotic device," Mr. Parmigiani said. "There is no justification. Lora DiCarlo should have won the award."
In a statement provided to The Times, Gary Shapiro, the president and chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, said: "We have apologized to CEO Lora Haddock for our mistake, as the Lori DiCarlo product does not fit into any of our existing product categories and should not have been accepted for the Innovation Awards Program. CES is a professional business show, and porn, adult toys and sex tech products are not part of the event. CES is a large show with over 4,500 exhibitors. We acknowledge there are inconsistencies in exhibiting companies, and these will be addressed."
But Ms. Haddock believes that what happened was more than an accidental oversight or a clerical error. So she published an open letter accusing CES of gender bias last Tuesday, Jan. 8, the first day of the convention. It is not the first time the trade show has been accused of gender bias: In 2018, numerous people in the tech industry criticized CES for having no female keynote speakers for the second year in a row, a failing CES attributed to "a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions."
This year, of the 89 judges for innovation awards, 20 were women. CES said that it is committed to diversity, and pointed to its announcement this year that it will invest $10 million in venture firms and funds focused on women, people of color and other underrepresented start-ups and entrepreneurs.
On display at CES was a wide array of female-oriented products, including breast pumps, fertility trackers and skin-care tools, but critics point out that many of them exist to enable women to support something or someone else. "They're in service of fertility, of society as a whole, of the household," said Ms. Vars, the technical director at Lora DiCarlo. She noted that a sexual health company that has exhibited at CES for years, OhMiBod, won a prize in 2016 for its Kegel exerciser. "It's something construed as good for men's pleasure or fertility," Ms. Vars said. "I hear that as a joke from men: 'I like to sleep with women who do their Kegels."'
"Sexual health wellness is something that can only happen behind closed doors, especially for women," said Polly Rodriguez, the chief executive of Unbound, a company that makes lubes, vibrators and other sexual wellness products. Ms. Rodriguez has never applied to CES because of its reputation for gender-based discrimination. (Last year, Unbound was in the news after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected the company's ads on the grounds that they violated rules against obscenity.)
But other female-driven sexual wellness products have gone the way of Ms. Haddock's.
Karen Long, who has been in health care technologies for more than 20 years, was told that her company's libido enhancing device, Fiera, did not qualify for the health and technology category in 2015. A later email from convention organizers added: "As a practice, we don't allow sexual wellness products at CES."
"We're a consumer product that's very clinically driven, with studies to support our product, validated surveys, OB-GYNs on board and everything," Ms. Long said.
"We're all sick and tired of this," Ms. Haddock said. "It's not just about our product. It's about something bigger. It's about really embracing an understanding of human sexuality, of recognizing innovation. When you call something obscene just because it has to do with a vagina, technology as an industry starts to lose out."
Liz Klinger, the chief executive of Lioness, which makes a smart vibrator for women that collects data about sexual arousal, was similarly appalled. (She applied to CES in 2017 and was rejected.) "They said they weren't going to include any new adult products in this space," Ms. Klinger said. "That they had bad experiences in the past and didn't want any new products on the floor."
Later she found out that another applicant was approved to rent an entire room to show VR porn.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
On paper, a 31-year-old man found to have serious mental illnesses was released from a New York state prison in September 2017 after serving 10 years behind bars for two robberies.
But in reality, the man, who asked to be identified by his initials C.J., still wakes up each day inside a maximum-security prison in Stormville. Though he is technically free, he is still confined to a cell because of a Kafkaesque bureaucratic dilemma: The state requires people like him to be released to a supportive housing facility, but there is not one available.
Lawyers for C.J. and five other mentally ill men filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan on Wednesday seeking to force Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to address a shortage of housing for people with serious mental illnesses who need help adjusting to life outside prison walls.
The men are no longer being held in prison because they committed offenses, their lawyers argue, but because the state has determined they are likely to become homeless once released -- a practice they contend amounts to discrimination under federal civil rights laws.
Four of the men, including C.J., have finished their maximum prison sentences and maintain their confinement also violates their constitutional rights to due process and protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiffs have asked the court to allow them to proceed anonymously because their lawsuit discusses sensitive personal information and they fear retaliation from prison guards.
Corrections records indicate the men are in "residential treatment facilities" -- housing where residents are able to move about freely to seek jobs, visit family and pursue educational opportunities.
But the lawsuit says that label, as the state has applied it to 13 prisons, is a fraud, because the men are being held and treated as other prisoners are. They are locked in cells that have room for a bed and a few possessions. They are required to wear inmate uniforms. They cannot receive packages.
"Though labeled 'releasees,' they remain prisoners in every respect," the complaint said.
The state continues to hold the men "because they are unable to secure a community-based mental health housing placement that does not exist due to lack of available beds," the complaint said. In effect, the state has lengthened their incarceration, "undermining the most basic principle undergirding the criminal justice system: that a criminal sentence, once imposed by a judge, means what it says," the lawsuit said
The lawsuit, which names the state corrections department and mental health office as defendants, was filed by the Legal Aid Society and Disability Rights New York, who are seeking class-action status on behalf of all inmates held in state prisons beyond their release dates solely because they are waiting to be placed in supportive housing.
It remained unclear on Wednesday how many mentally ill people were being held in prison past their release dates.
Jessica Riley, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Mental Health, declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit, but said the state has "one of the most robust supportive housing networks in the nation for individuals with mental illness," with about 44,000 units.
C.J. has been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and antisocial personality disorder, court papers said. As his release date approached, he was enrolled in a re-entry program that was preparing him to be set free in Orange County, where he was looking forward to seeing his daughter for the first time since he went to prison. He had obtained a G.E.D. and a vocational certificate in prison and hoped to get a job.
But the day before he was scheduled to be released, C.J. was transferred to another prison, and later, to the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville. His mental condition has worsened since his release date passed, and he has been repeatedly placed on suicide watch, according to the lawsuit.
"Every day is hard, very hard," C.J. said in written responses to questions from The New York Times. "I wake up and I look around and I don't understand why I am here."
The lawsuit does not seek an order requiring the six men to be freed. Rather, it asks that the state remove "the only barrier to their release" by creating more supportive housing for mentally ill people being released from prison.
The complaint cites a 1999 Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., which held that public institutions must provide community-based services to people with mental illnesses who need and desire them.
For decades since the civil rights movement, public pressure had built on states to take mentally ill people out of psychiatric hospitals and place them in settings where they could participate in society, an effort called "deinstitutionalization."
But over the years, as psychiatric hospitals closed and lawmakers toughened crime and sentencing policies, more people with mental illnesses wound up incarcerated. Though prisons and jails developed treatment programs, few of them were effective, advocates for the mentally ill said.
About 4,000 people receiving mental health treatment in New York State prisons are released each year, and more than half of them have serious disorders like schizophrenia that severely limit their ability to function independently, according to the state Office of Mental Health.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has committed the state to building 20,000 new supportive housing units, and state lawmakers so far have allocated $2.6 billion to create the first 6,000 units by 2021.
But the lawsuit asserts that, under Governor Cuomo, the Office of Mental Health has neglected requests from counties across the state to build additional housing for former prisoners with mental disorders.
Such housing programs, where residents receive psychiatric care and learn skills like cooking and using mass transit, offer opportunities to participate in public life that prisons do not, mental health advocates say.
But waiting lists have grown longer as the state has eliminated beds from its psychiatric hospitals. The roughly 44,000 spaces available for the mentally ill are about half of what is needed, said Antonia Lasicki, the executive director of the Association for Community Living, which represents supportive-housing operators.
Despite the state's commitment to build more supportive housing, the creation of units has not kept pace with demand, and existing facilities are struggling to stay open, Ms. Lasicki and other advocates said. State funding "is barely enough to cover the rent," she said.
"So that's the problem right there in the nutshell," Ms. Lasicki added. "They're very underfunded."

Texto completo: The filmmaker and novelist Bridgett M. Davis remembers her mother as a proud, confident woman who was also meticulously private, because she had to be. By the time Fannie Drumwright Davis Robinson died in 1992, she had been running an underground numbers gambling operation out of her Detroit home for more than 30 years, collecting her customers' bets on three-digit numbers and paying out if they won.
Fannie wanted her family to make full and forthright use of the opportunities that her profits made possible, but the source of those profits had to stay hidden. She taught her five children to keep their heads up and their mouths shut.
"The World According to Fannie Davis" is a daughter's gesture of loving defiance, an act of reclamation, an absorbing portrait of her mother in full. "The fact that Mama gave us an unapologetically good life by taking others' bets on three-digit numbers," Davis writes, "is the secret I've carried with me." Blending memoir and social history, she recounts her mother's extraordinary story alongside the larger context of Motor City's rise and fall.
Davis's parents moved to Michigan from Nashville, Tenn., in 1955, fleeing the Jim Crow South as part of the Great Migration. Their first years in Detroit were rough. They squeezed into a rat-infested cold-water flat with their children while Fannie's ailing husband found intermittent work at an auto plant. A fourth child only added to Fannie's sense that she had to figure something out, and fast.
Fannie's brother worked at Detroit's racetrack, and she saw her chance. The numbers had been flourishing in Detroit, buoyed by the steady incomes supplied by the auto industry, and the daily racing forms were used to generate the winning three-digit combinations. After working as a bookie for Eddie Wingate, a big numbers man notorious for his ruthlessness, she struck out on her own. To make money, she needed volume; and to get volume, she required an edge. Hers would be a reputation for reliability -- which, in an unregulated business, turned out to be worth a lot.
As the fifth and youngest child, Davis describes herself as the first of Fannie's children "born in comfort"; even though she knew from a young age what her mother did for a living, she doesn't remember worrying about it much. She recalls sitting at the dining table of their red-brick Colonial, eating Frosted Flakes and watching her mother take bets over the phone. When young Davis wanted to be alone, she retreated to her own playroom in the basement, replete with an Easy-Bake Oven and a toy chest from F.A.O. Schwarz.
What Davis recognizes in hindsight is how precarious that comfort and prosperity were. In 1960s Detroit, redlining meant that banks would deny mortgages to black home buyers, no matter the source and regularity of their income. Fannie couldn't purchase that red-brick Colonial outright, entering instead into a risky land contract with the seller. If she missed a single payment, she would forfeit the house.
Fannie also had to worry about cash flow on the business side. If one of her customers won big, she could get wiped out. Davis depicts her mother as a disciplined businesswoman, making sure to limit bets on popular numbers -- "fancies" like 007 (for James Bond) and 313 (Detroit's area code) -- so that she wouldn't be too exposed. She was also superstitious, putting her customers' business in the freezer to "cool it off," and assiduously avoiding anyone or anything she deemed unlucky; aside from one Dinah Washington song, she couldn't bear to listen to the blues.
Fannie used her profits to provide for her family, but as Davis movingly shows, the proceeds allowed for something more. The family home wasn't just a roof over their heads; it became "our armor against a world designed to convince us, black working-class children of migrants, that we didn't deserve a good life." Davis remembers how abundance afforded her "the indulgence of daydreams" and a first-rate education. Fannie also put some of her profits into the local community, supporting black-owned businesses and giving out "a little piece of money" when someone needed it.
Davis links her mother's generosity with the bigger outlays of the established numbers operators, some of whom used their profits to fund Detroit's civil rights movement. "This makes me wary of the charge that numbers had a negative impact on the black community," she writes. "If there were disadvantages, if some folks gambled too much, and if others spent coins and dollars on the numbers that could've gone to more so-called honorable means, then in my mind that is completely offset by the invaluable ways numbers money was used."
"Completely offset"? Is such an exacting calculation possible, or even necessary? Gambling can be a source of hope and pleasure; it can also be grinding addiction. Anyone ruined by it, or duped by a proprietor less scrupulous than Fannie, might feel like a discounted item in Davis's ledger. Not to mention that Fannie herself took risks that were bigger than many people would willingly hazard. She kept a gun in the linen closet and another in her purse. One of Davis's older sisters became so anxious that she wrote pleading letters to God.
The private philanthropy that Davis commends leaves it up to the people with means to apportion the money as they see fit -- an individual solution to what is arguably a structural problem. But then Fannie's experience taught her not to put much stock in public forms of redistribution. "Black folks," Davis writes, "had many, many reasons not to trust the government." She describes her mother's politics as "a blend of progressive and conservative," girded by a firm belief in self-reliance. Davis herself calls the Michigan state lottery, legalized in 1972 as a way to bring in government revenue, a "usurping."
Yet the novelist in Davis knows that Fannie's whole story was more complicated than a daughter's protectiveness will allow. The state lottery ended up being a mixed bag for Fannie. It was a competitor, yes, but Davis concedes that it injected new energy into Fannie's business by taking some of the stigma away from gambling. Fannie started to use the daily lottery as her source for three-digit numbers, shrewdly turning the state into her backup bank; she could offset a customer's heavy bet by playing the same number in the lottery, which meant she no longer had to depend on the big numbers men for cash flow.
"Nice irony," Davis writes, though her mother might have called it something else. Like so many other times in her remarkable life, Fannie had found a way beat the odds.

Texto completo: The introduction to a unique New York Times’ beef stew recipe began: "Make it when you have the time to indulge in the meditative qualities of chopping, sautÃ©ing, reducing, braising, waiting and tasting. You will be rewarded with an exceptionally flavorful dish that is just as satisfying to eat as it was to cook."
OK, those words hooked me. It’s the end of January, and I’m tired of cold weather and, lucky me, have the time on a Saturday or Sunday to hang in my warm kitchen and make some it-takes-time food. For this, there are no special tools required; just a Dutch oven or large pot, a skillet, a few bowls, and a range.
Instead of stew meat I had 3 pounds of beef short ribs ($9 per pound) that I’d purchased directly from the cattle farm on which that cattle had been raised and was delivered to me at a meetup point by the farmer, so that I knew, for sure, it was grass-fed and grass-finished.
Why was that such a big deal for me? Glad you asked.
For me, pigs, poultry and cattle should be raised as they have always been raised until they reach maturity: on a farm in a natural setting, not confined in crates or sent to feedlots. That also means that chickens aren’t fed GMO (genetically modified organisms) corn, and cattle and pigs aren’t fed GMO soybean meal.
I headed to my kitchen and lined up all the ingredients for this meal (and there are quite a few). Recipe substitutions to the stew recipe were needed, however.
That New York Times recipe required two things I did not have: Cognac and Pommery mustard. Cognac is fancy brandy specifically from the Cognac region of France. It’s great stuff; but pricey. Mustard Pommery is expensive (about $17 to $20), whole-grain (you can see the seeds) mustard from, once again, France. Its unique flavor profile is, in one word, incredible.
Those issues did not keep me from making the recipe.
Without Cognac in my liquor cabinet I decided to go with whiskey (Makers Mark); not equal to Cognac, but serviceable. Lucky me, I had a jar of Maille brand Classic Dijon Old Style Mustard in the fridge. You can see the whole mustard seeds in the bottle.
When I first read the 5-step recipe, it didn’t seem to be that big a deal. It turns out, I should have paid attention to the: "chopping, sautÃ©ing, reducing, braising, waiting and tasting" part of the quote.
The recipe didn’t require organic carrots or mushrooms, but I used them anyhow. Once everything was simmering away my kitchen filled with a fantastic aroma. My partner, Nan, came home, took in a deep breath and said, "What are you making, it smells intoxicating."
The original stew recipe called for simmering for 90 minutes; my short ribs took 2 hours before I could add the carrots and finally the mushrooms and red wine.
When I first tasted the broth with all that mustard (a half cup is not an error) it had a sharp edge to it. However, by the time we sat down for dinner, the flavor had mellowed and evolved and was as good as I’d hoped; perhaps, better. Got a lazy, cold-outside afternoon with some available beef short ribs in your fridge? Give this a try. * Don Mauer welcomes questions, comments and recipe makeover requests.

Texto completo: Mike Tomlin's critics have lined up and taken their shots. You know what they're saying. His team is undisciplined. The locker room is out of control. Team Turmoil. A circus. Tomlin is horrible at clock management. He's worse at replay challenges. He loses too often to teams he should beat. The criticism goes on and on.
But the No. 1 condemnation of Tomlin, by far, is he doesn't win enough in the playoffs despite having a franchise quarterback. He is 8-7 in the postseason with Ben Roethlisberger. They won the Super Bowl after the 2008 season and went back to the Super Bowl after the 2010 season but have won just three playoff games in the past eight years.
I'm here to tell you Tomlin isn't alone in failing.
Don Shula comes to mind. He won an NFL-best 347 games, including playoffs, but made it to just one Super Bowl with Dan Marino. The Miami Dolphins lost Super Bowl XIX after the 1984 season to the San Francisco 49ers. They were 6-7 in the postseason during the Shula/Marino era.
How about New Orleans' Sean Payton, the NFL's longest-tenured coach after New England's Bill Belichick? He and his franchise quarterback, Drew Brees, won the Super Bowl after the 2009 season but haven't been back. They missed the playoffs five times since Payton took over in 2006. They are 8-6 in the postseason, although some think they should be 9-5 and headed to Super Bowl LIII. Pass interference? What pass interference?
Seattle's Pete Carroll won the Super Bowl after the 2013 season and went back to the Super Bowl the next season with quarterback Russell Wilson. He is 9-6 in the postseason with the Seahawks - 8-5 with Wilson - and 10-8 dating to his days with the Patriots and New York Jets.
Mike McCarthy had Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers as his quarterbacks in Green Bay before being fired this season, his 13th with the Packers. His team won Super Bowl XLV against Tomlin and the Steelers - his only trip to the big game - but missed the playoffs the past two seasons. McCarthy was 10-8 in the postseason.
Baltimore's John Harbaugh won the Super Bowl after the 2012 season but missed the playoffs four times in five years before this season. Joe Flacco is no longer a franchise quarterback but was good enough in the Ravens' Super Bowl run to throw 11 touchdown passes without an interception.
Andy Reid is 2-5 in the playoffs with the Kansas City Chiefs, 12-14 overall if you go back to his time with the Philadelphia Eagles. He went to one Super Bowl after the 2004 season with the Eagles.
Jason Garrett is 2-3 in the postseason in nine seasons as Dallas Cowboys coach with Tony Romo and Dak Prescott as his quarterbacks. He has never made it past the divisional round. The Cowboys haven't been to a Super Bowl since the 1995 season when they beat the Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.
Other teams have been worse.
Cleveland, Detroit, Jacksonville and Houston have not played in a Super Bowl. Arizona, Atlanta, Buffalo, Carolina, Cincinnati, Minnesota, Tennessee and San Diego/Los Angeles haven't won one.
I'm not too smart, but I sense a trend.
"Win a Super Bowl? It's hard to win a game in the NFL," Roethlisberger has said.
Well, for just about everybody.
New England's Belichick and Tom Brady are the exception. Their team played in the past eight AFC championship games - 13 overall - and is headed to its ninth Super Bowl in their 19 seasons together. They will match the Steelers' six Super Bowl wins if they beat the Los Angeles Rams Feb. 3. The Steelers needed three coaches and two quarterbacks to do it.
Win or lose against the Rams, the accomplishments by Belichick and Brady will never be matched by another coach and quarterback combination.
I'm guessing that won't appease the Tomlin critics, though.

Texto completo: U.S. pact to lift penalties on Putin ally's firms leaves him in control
A Russian oligarch allied with Vladimir Putin will, along with close associates, maintain majority control of a major energy company from which the Treasury Department is lifting sanctions despite the Trump administration's promise to hold him accountable as a key beneficiary of Moscow's "malign activity" worldwide.
Oleg Deripaska, along with his ex-wife, ex-father-in-law and a foundation Deripaska launched years ago, will together maintain well over 50 percent of the shares in En+ Group, the most influential of three companies from which the Treasury Department is lifting sanctions, according to an agreement outlining the deal's terms, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post on Tuesday.
En+ Group controls Rusal, one of the world's biggest aluminum suppliers, and EuroSibEnergo, Russia's largest private power company,which are also addressed in the Treasury deal.
The New York Times first reported on aspects of the agreement, which appears to show that Deripaska is being treated more generously than the Trump administration has acknowledged.
The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment, but administration officials, including Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have vigorously defended the deal. The Post was unable to reach a spokesman for Deripaska.
The Trump administration sanctioned Deripaska and these three companiesin April while taking aim at individuals and businesses with close ties to the Russian state. Before that, he was the subject of intrigue for his ties to President Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who once worked for Deripaska as an investment consultant. Deripaska has said Manafort owes him millions of dollars.
While serving as Trump's campaign chairman, Manafort offered to give Deripaska "private briefings" on the 2016 presidential race - what Manafort's spokesman has characterized as an effort to settle past debts. Deripaska's spokeswoman said he never received briefings from Manafort.
Now it appears Deripaska may be the beneficiary of a different arrangement with the Trump administration, as shares in his companies promise to rebound with Treasury's decision to lift punitive measures against them.
Neither Deripaska nor his allies will retain voting rights in En+ Group commensurate with the holdings they will maintain in the company under the deal's terms, according to the agreement. But the document has revived frustration among Democrats who, earlier this month, were unable to secure enough Republican votes in the Senate to block the deal.
"My concern all along was that Deripaska would retain control over his companies and benefit personally from this deal," said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "This new report suggests that those concerns were valid and that the situation may even have been worse than we thought."
Last week, more 130 House Republicans, including the GOP's entire leadership team, joined House Democrats to deliver a rebuke of the deal - and, by extension, of the president and his Cabinet.
"Because we cannot be sure that we have removed the heavy hand of this Russian oligarch, I cannot support the delisting of these sanctioned entities at this point in time," Rep. Mike McCaul (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said just before the vote.
Under the terms of a sanctions bill Congress passed in 2017, lawmakers have 30 days after the administration announces its intent to reduce or remove Russia-related sanctions to prevent that from happening. That window closed Friday.
Deripaska's agreement details how some of his shares will be dispersed without completely divorcing him and former relatives of a controlling interest in En+ Group.
Although his personal holdings will be significantly reduced, from about 70 percent of shares to no more than 44.95 percent, people and entities close to him will control additional shares, meaning Deripaska could continue to have influence over a majority of the company.
For instance, he is transferring more than 3 percent of En+ Group shares to a charitable foundation he founded in 2008,while his ex-wife and her father will continue to control at least an additional 5.5 percent of the company's shares.
Other Deripaskashares will be transferred to VTB, a Russian bank also under sanctions, and Glencore, a mining firm with ties to the Russian aluminum market, including En+ subsidiary Rusal.
The agreement also outlines new ownership stakes for Rusal that appear to largely protect the holdings of another sanctioned Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, and his business partner Leonard Blavatnik, who holds U.S. citizenship and has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Senate Republicans and a million to Trump's inaugural committee.
Vekselberg and Blavatnik are co-owners of SUAL Partners Limited, an aluminum company that will keep a 22.5 percent stake of Rusal under the Deripaska deal.

Texto completo: Most Americans believe there’s life on other planets, and one-third believe aliens have visited Earth.
And millions of us are watching TV series that explore these beliefs: History Channel’s look at the Air Force investigation of UFOs, “Project Blue Book,” and the CW’s “Roswell, New Mexico,” which features alien-human romance.
Writer Richard Estep crisscrossed the state interviewing true believers for his 12th and latest book, “Colorado UFOs.”
The British-born Estep, who lives in the Longmont area, has been a paranormal investigator for 24 years. His research on haunted places, people and objects has been featured in episodes of TV’s “Haunted Case Files.” He also offers ghost tours at the historic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park.
Working on the UFO book gave Estep a chance to meet people who say they’ve witnessed alien spacecraft or been in close personal contact with aliens. One woman told him she was half-Arcturian, meaning she was the child of an alien-human marriage. One man offered proof that aliens operate a base hidden deep under Denver International Airport featuring a tunnel linking to southern Colorado Springs’ NORAD facility in Cheyenne Mountain.
But Estep says his research hasn’t helped him answer one of humanity’s biggest questions: Are we alone in the cosmos?
“After interviewing eyewitnesses from all walks of life, I am still no closer to figuring out exactly what I believe lies at the heart of the UFO phenomenon,” he writes.
Estep visited Judy Messoline, who says she has seen UFOs in the San Luis Valley and who opened a UFO Watchtower in 2000 near her home in Hooper.
Messoline, who says more than 30,000 people have visited her tower, tells her story in her own book, “That Crazy Lady Down the Road,” available on her website.
Estep also interviewed people who say they’ve been contacted or abducted by aliens. Some say these experiences have been wonderful; others say they’ve been traumatic.
“Some people complain that they have been taken against their will,” Estep said. “They say their alien encounters have wrecked their lives, and they live in fear of future abductions. But other contactees say it has been a very positive thing, and they feel privileged to have been chosen.”
Denver artist Chuck Chroma says that since childhood, he has been visited by the Greys, who are kindly aliens. In recent years, Chroma has worked with a hypnotherapist to recover hidden memories of these encounters, and he has used raw material from these sessions to create art that portrays his experiences.
“Chuck had some fascinating experiences,” Estep said, “and the way he expresses these experiences as an artist is unique and compelling.”
Astronomer Frank Drake’s Drake Equation argues that so many billions of planets are in our cosmos that thousands or millions of them likely are occupied. But after spending the last half-century listening for signs of life, Drake acknowledges that SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) has come up empty.
The U.S. Air Force investigated more than 12,000 UFO reports in the 1950s and 1960s before concluding that most were human- or natural-caused, such as weather balloons and swamp gas.
In 1968, the Condon Report written by University of Colorado physicist Edward Condon concluded that “nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge.”
But UFO believers aren’t easily dissuaded, and some say they have all the evidence they need in animal mutilations. Colorado Springs resident Chuck Zukowski calls himself the “UFO Nut,” a phrase he uses on his license plate and website. Zukowski has investigated hundreds of mutilations, arguing that only aliens could be responsible for such precise surgeries.
He declined to be featured in The Gazette, but he told his story in the 2016 book, “The 37th Parallel,” which argues that aliens have orchestrated more than 10,000 animal mutilations since 1967, when Snippy, a horse from the Alamosa area, suffered a grisly procedure.
But in a review of “The 37th Parallel,” The New York Times observed: “Why aliens would travel a trillion miles to butcher some poor cows isn’t clear.”
“The scientific community is open to the possibility of alien life,” Estep says, “but as for whether they are visiting us or not, that’s another question.”
As Estep says a number of times in his Colorado UFOs book, “I leave that for the reader to decide.”

A Remarkable Chess-playing Machine Could Change The Way We Think About Thinking

Texto completo: In early December, researchers at DeepMind, the artificial-intelligence company owned by Google’s parent corporation, Alphabet Inc., filed a dispatch from the frontiers of chess.
A year earlier, on Dec. 5, 2017, the team had stunned the chess world with its announcement of AlphaZero, a machine-learning algorithm that had mastered not only chess but shogi, or Japanese chess, and Go. The algorithm started with no knowledge of the games beyond their basic rules. It then played against itself millions of times and learned from its mistakes. In a matter of hours, the algorithm became the best player, human or computer, the world has ever seen.
The details of AlphaZero’s achievements and inner workings have now been formally peer-reviewed and published in the journal Science. The new paper addresses several serious criticisms of the original claim. (Among other things, it was hard to tell whether AlphaZero was playing its chosen opponent, a computational beast named Stockfish, with total fairness.) Consider those concerns dispelled. AlphaZero has not grown stronger in the past 12 months, but the evidence of its superiority has. It clearly displays a breed of intellect that humans have not seen before, and that we will be mulling over for a long time to come.
Not like it used to be
Computer chess has come a long way in 20 years. In 1997, IBM’s chess-playing supercomputer, Deep Blue, beat the reigning human world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. In retrospect, there was little mystery in this achievement. Deep Blue could evaluate 200 million positions per second. It never got tired, never blundered in a calculation and never forgot what it had been thinking a moment earlier.
For better and worse, it played like a machine, brutally and materialistically. It could outcompute Kasparov, but it couldn’t outthink him. In Game 1 of their match, Deep Blue greedily accepted Kasparov’s sacrifice of a rook for a bishop, but lost the game 16 moves later. The current generation of the world’s strongest chess programs, such as Stockfish and Komodo, still play in this inhuman style. They like to capture the opponent’s pieces. They defend like iron. But although they are far stronger than any human player, these chess “engines” have no real understanding of the game. They have to be tutored in the basic principles of chess.
These principles, which have been refined over decades of human grandmaster experience, are programmed into the engines as complex evaluation functions that indicate what to seek in a position and what to avoid: how much to value king safety, piece activity, pawn structure, control of the center, and more, and how to balance the trade-offs among them. Today’s chess engines, innately oblivious to these principles, come across as brutes: tremendously fast and strong, but utterly lacking insight.
New way of learning
All of that has changed with the rise of machine learning. By playing against itself and updating its neural network as it learned from experience, AlphaZero discovered the principles of chess on its own and quickly became the best player ever. Not only could it have easily defeated all the human masters - it didn’t even bother to try - it crushed Stockfish, the reigning computer world champion of chess. In a 100-game match against a truly formidable engine, AlphaZero scored 28 wins and 72 draws. It didn’t lose a single game.
Most unnerving was that AlphaZero seemed to express insight. It played as no computer ever had, intuitively and beautifully, with a romantic, attacking style. It played gambits and took risks. In some games it paralyzed Stockfish and toyed with it. While conducting its attack in Game 10, AlphaZero retreated its queen back into the corner of the board on its own side, far from Stockfish’s king, not normally where an attacking queen should be placed. Yet this peculiar retreat was venomous: No matter how Stockfish replied, it was doomed.
Tellingly, AlphaZero won by thinking smarter, not faster; it examined only 60,000 positions a second, compared with 60 million for Stockfish. It was wiser, knowing what to think about and what to ignore. By discovering the principles of chess on its own, AlphaZero developed a style of play that “reflects the truth” about the game rather than “the priorities and prejudices of programmers,” Kasparov wrote in a commentary accompanying the Science article.
The question now is whether machine learning can help humans discover similar truths about the things we really care about.
The early signs are encouraging. In August, two articles in Nature Medicine explored how machine learning could be applied to medical diagnosis. In one, researchers at DeepMind teamed up with clinicians at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London to develop a deep-learning algorithm that could classify a wide range of retinal pathologies as accurately as human experts can. (Ophthalmology suffers from a severe shortage of experts who can interpret the millions of diagnostic eye scans performed each year; artificially intelligent assistants could help enormously.)
Benefit for humans
The other article concerned a machine-learning algorithm that decides whether a CT scan of an emergency-room patient shows signs of a stroke, an intracranial hemorrhage or other critical neurological event. For stroke victims, every minute matters. (Neurologists have a grim saying: “Time is brain.”) The new algorithm flagged these and other critical events with an accuracy comparable to human experts - but it did so 150 times faster. A faster diagnostician could allow the most urgent cases to be triaged sooner, with review by a human radiologist.
What is frustrating about machine learning, however, is that the algorithms can’t articulate what they’re thinking. We don’t know why they work, so we don’t know if they can be trusted. AlphaZero gives every appearance of having discovered some important principles about chess, but it can’t share that understanding with us. Not yet, at least. As humans, we want more than answers. We want insight. This is going to be a source of tension in our interactions with computers from now on.
In fact, in mathematics, it’s been happening for years. Consider the long-standing math problem called the four-color map theorem. It proposes that, under certain reasonable constraints, any map of contiguous countries can always be colored with just four colors such that no two neighboring countries are colored the same.
Although the four-color theorem was proved in 1977 with the help of a computer, no human could check all the steps in the argument. Since then, the proof has been validated and simplified, but there are still parts of it that entail brute-force computation. This development annoyed many mathematicians. They didn’t need to be reassured that the four-color theorem was true. They wanted to understand why it was true, and this proof didn’t help.
But envisage a day when AlphaZero has evolved into a more general problem-solving algorithm; call it AlphaInfinity. Like its ancestor, it would have supreme insight. And each beautiful proof would reveal why a theorem was true.
For human mathematicians and scientists, this day would mark the dawn of a new era of insight. But it may not last. As machines become ever faster, and humans stay put with their neurons running at sluggish millisecond time scales, another day will follow when we can no longer keep up. The dawn of human insight may quickly turn to dusk.

Texto completo: Seven months ago, Michael Dickerson worked the morning shift at the McDonald's in Far Rockaway, Queens. He stocked the freezers with hamburgers, fixed frying machines and did whatever was needed.
Mr. Dickerson, 34, had no problem working hard, he said. But he was barely making enough to pay his bills, let alone make child support payments for his four children. Something had to change, he recalled thinking.
"I want to live right and healthy and be somebody my kids can look up to," he said in a recent interview.
So he started participating in a voluntary job-training program offered through New York City for parents who owe child support, Families Forward. There, he found out about another opportunity: a chance to ditch fast food for the hospitality industry.
It would still be hard work, but with better surroundings and prospects, he thought.
"I didn't want to be at McDonald's," Mr. Dickerson said. "I wanted to say I worked at a nice hotel where I'm accomplishing something."
He quit his job in the summer to enroll in the Chinese-American Planning Council's hospitality careers training program.
Founded in 1979, the program serves students from a variety of communities and backgrounds. Participants are not guaranteed a job at the end, but the council helps them set up interviews at hotels in the region.
For two months, five days a week, Mr. Dickerson and other students sat in a classroom in Flushing, Queens, to learn the ins and outs of the hospitality business. The course focuses mainly on housekeeping and related services, explaining topics as varied as safety and security to the hierarchy of hotels. It teaches participants how to interview for jobs and set budgets for themselves.
Trainers make sure that students know exactly what they will face on the job, said Annette Montalvo, the assistant director of training programs at the planning council.
"Can you work weekends, holidays and overnights?" she said. "It's a physical job, can you handle that? Can you clean a dirty toilet? We know hotels are going to ask them during a real interview."
The council trains about 100 students a year. It is partly funded by F.P.W.A., one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. F.P.W.A. received $20,000 from the fund last year for the training program.
The program helps people from a variety of backgrounds, including immigrants and college graduates who have trouble finding work. Students must read and write English, have a high school diploma, equivalent or pass an eighth-grade level of the Test for Adult Basic Education, and be able to legally work in the United States.
"As long as they meet the requirements, we welcome them," Ms. Montalvo said.
Mr. Dickerson had dropped out of high school in the 10th grade.
"I was born in Harlem, raised in Brooklyn and faced a lot of obstacles," he said. "As far as me picking my career, I ended up on the streets. It took me awhile to mature."
Mr. Dickerson eventually became a live-in home health aide, working with the same client for five years. But his next patient proved difficult for him emotionally -- an 18-year-old boy who had been shot in the Bronx. Mr. Dickerson's older brother had been shot 20 years before, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.
"It hit home," he said. "I really couldn't do that."
He filed for unemployment, working temporary and summer jobs until he landed a full-time job at McDonald's.
Once he was accepted to the hospitality program, he passed the Test for Adult Basic Education to be able to move forward with the program. It was just one step toward creating a better life for himself and his family.
In addition to the hotel industry, the program taught him communication and email skills, and how to present himself in a job interview.
It worked. In the fall, Mr. Dickerson landed a job at the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge, an upscale hotel that opened in 2017 with impressive views of the East River and Manhattan skyline. He helps prepare the banquet hall for events, receiving floor plans for elaborate weddings and parties and "making them come to life," he said. He sets up the tables and chairs and assists the servers, and loves it.
"It's a new experience in my life, and it's a good job," he said. "I look forward to going to work."
His goal now is to work his way up. He sometimes works 12-hour days that can start as early as 4:30 a.m. Mr. Dickerson takes overtime shifts whenever he can, he said, for his children's sake.
"I want to make sure they have the best and make sure I'm being a great provider," said Mr. Dickerson, who added he is now making child care payments.
And he is learning from fellow workers at the hotel and hoping to go back to school and earn a college degree.
"It's never too late," he said.
He hopes to be a banquet manager someday.
"It makes me so happy," he said. "I'll accomplish something in time."
Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone.

Texto completo: The Toledo Lucas County Public Library on Tuesday will kick off the latest Authors! series with Dr. Michael Roizen, a New York Times best-selling writer and the Cleveland Clinic's chief wellness officer.

Dr. Roizen will discuss his new book, What To Eat When.

As chief medical consultant on the Dr. Oz Show, Dr. Roizen co-authored the book with the show's medical director, Michael Crupain. The book aims to break down when and which foods to eat during a 24-hour cycle, and which foods best suit body, mood, and circumstance changes.

The goal of What to Eat When is to help readers improve overall health, lose weight, and show them how to use food to prevent disease [and in some cases, reverse it], according to a news release.

The Cleveland Clinic's Wellness Institute studies the prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related chronic diseases. The clinic's research ranges from studying better weight loss approaches to developing better ways to manage prediabetes.

Dr. Roizen said he'll speak during Tuesday's event about topics ranging from the role carbs play in wellness to tips for gaining a more healthy relationship with food.

You wouldn't be in a relationship that wasn't mutual, and it's the same with food. You should eat food that's going to love you back. ... You may love french fries, but they don't love you back, Dr. Roizen said.

His visit to Toledo comes as recent studies and reports find Lucas County residents have made some health improvements in terms of chronic illness and rates of insurance coverage in recent years, but several wellness-related concerns persist.

The most recent Lucas County Community Health Assessment looked at data such as tobacco use, eating habits, and physical activity in Lucas County adults and youths, as well as specific information about the county's African-American and Latino populations. There was good news for figures such as rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, which all decreased or held steady for the overall adult population.

But the rate of overweight or obese adults is going up. It was 74 percent in 2017, up from 70 percent in 2014. That number was higher for African-Americans, at 85 percent, and 80 percent for Latinos. Twenty-four percent of youths in grades 6-12 were overweight or obese, according to the 2017 report.

The free event begins at 7 p.m. at Bowsher High School, 2200 Arlington Ave. in Toledo. Dr. Roizen is slated to speak for roughly 45 minutes before hosting a question-and-answer session. He will also be available for a book signing, with a limited number of his books available for purchase.

The library has featured noted writers, journalists, and activists in its Authors! collection for more than 20 years. Past speakers include Elizabeth Gilbert, Sandra Cisneros, Nicholas Sparks, and Gloria Steinem.

Authors! is presented by the library and sponsored by The Blade and Buckeye Broadband.

Rush to judgment? New details emerge on Native American elder's standoff with MAGA-hat-wearing teens

Texto completo: New details about a viral video that showed an interaction between white teenagers wearing "Make America Great Again" hats and a Native American elder are leading some people to second-guess their first impression of the encounter.

A student from Kentucky's all-male Covington Catholic High School drew backlash online after a clip emerged Saturday of him smiling and standing close to the face of Nathan Phillips, an Omaha elder and Vietnam War veteran, as Phillips sang and beat a drum near the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C. on Friday. Other young people standing close by can be seen chanting as they encircle Phillips.

Lawmakers, Native American leaders, and the Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School were quick to condemn the boy's behavior. The school announced it was investigating the situation and said the teen could be expelled.

But a longer video from a different angle shows that Philips was the one to approach the teenagers, taking a left on a landing along the stairway up the Lincoln Memorial and walking directly into the throng of students.

In recalling the "ugly" situation to the Washington Post on Saturday, Philips told the newspaper he felt threatened when he was stopped in his tracks by the white teen in a "MAGA" hat, who was standing by a crowd shouting, “Build that wall, build that wall.”

Philips told MSNBC on Sunday he approached the teens after he saw tensions bubbling over between the younger crowd that was there for the anti-abortion March for Life rally and nearby Black Hebrew Israelites.

"Look at my America. Look at my black and white brothers here. They’re tearing at each other. We are at a point where you can't stand by and watch this," Phillips said.

The emergence of a longer recording of the scene and a statement from a Covington Catholic High School student, retweeted on Twitter by National Review columnist Dan McLaughlin, have muddled first impressions of Philips' interaction with the teenagers.

An email from the student sent to WKRC, a Cincinnati-area CBS affiliate, said the boy at the center of the controversy and his friends were "confused" by Philips' approach.

Further, the second student said they did not "partake in any physical or verbal abuse, did not chant 'build the wall' or mock or anything of the like, and did not seek to incite violence."

"My friend faces expulsion for simply standing still and our entire school is being disparaged for a crime we did not commit," the student wrote.

"It begins to look as if the people who did not pig-pile on this story before waiting to learn more about it made the right choice," McLaughlin said in response.

McLaughlin was joined by New York Times columnist David Brooks and Andy Lassner, executive producer of "The Ellen Show," among others, in expressing doubt over the original perception of the incident.

"Yesterday I had one impression of the maga kids from Kentucky. Now after seeing more videos I have a different more complicated impression. Makes all the hot takes seem silly," Brooks tweeted.

"I deleted my tweet about the MAGA boys. I’m willing to watch 'all the video' when I get time. But more importantly, because of a high follower count, I don’t want to contribute to being part of a mob going after minors. Let’s focus on shitty adults turning out shitty kids," Lassner wrote.

Texto completo: VOTES IN THE HOUSE
H.J. Res. 30
Sanctions relief for Russian companies
Voting 362 for and 53 against, the House on Thursday passed a measure that would prevent the Treasury Department from lifting economic sanctions on aluminum and energy companies controlled by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the Senate voted to clear the way for Treasury to grant sanctions relief starting this month in return for Deripaska relinquishing majority stakes in the three firms. U.S. sanctions on his personal assets are to remain in force. Congress and President Trump imposed the sanctions to penalize the Kremlin and Putin-aligned oligarchs for actions including Russia's interference in U.S. elections, military aggression in eastern Ukraine and seizure of Crimea. Deripaska was an associate of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to banking and tax-fraud charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Deripaska reportedly remains under Mueller's scrutiny. A yes vote was to retain sanctions on the Deripaska-controlled companies.
Yes: Fitzpatrick, Dean, Houlahan, Wild, Meuser
H. Res. 41
Disapproval of congressman's racist comments
Voting 424 for and one against, the House on Tuesday adopted a resolution disapproving of comments by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, extolling white nationalism and supremacy. He said in a New York Times interview published Jan. 10: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" The vote occurred the day after House Republican leaders stripped the eight-term congressman from northwestern Iowa of his committee assignments. A yes vote was to adopt the resolution.
Yes: Fitzpatrick, Dean, Houlahan, Wild, Meuser
H.R. 268
$12.1 billion in disaster relief without border wall money
Voting 237 for and 187 against, the House on Wednesday passed a bill that would provide $12.1 billion to homeowners, businesses, farmers, local governments and other entities harmed by wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, mudslides, volcanic eruptions and typhoons in the United States and its territories in recent years. The bill drew Republican opposition because of its language to reopen closed parts of the government through Feb. 8 without providing border-wall funding requested by President Trump. The disaster aid includes $2.96 billion for rebuilding infrastructure; $2.54 billion for mitigating damages in future disasters; $1.86 billion for farmers and rural communities; $1.16 billion for community-development grants and $555 million to fund social services for displaced persons, among other outlays. A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.
Yes: Fitzpatrick, Dean, Houlahan, Wild
No: Meuser
H.R. 268
Prohibition on Mexican border wall funding
With a tally of 230 for and 197 against, the House on Wednesday voted to prohibit the department of Homeland Security or Army Corps of Engineers from spending any funds in a disaster relief bill to plan, develop or build President Trump's proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. The amendment was introduced after Trump said he might use previously appropriated but not yet spent disaster aid to build the wall. A yes vote was to adopt the amendment.
Yes: Fitzpatrick, Dean, Houlahan, Wild
No: Meuser
H.R. 268
"Clean" bill on disaster relief
Voting 193-231, the House on Wednesday defeated a GOP effort to reshape H.R. 268 as a bill dealing only with disaster relief. The motion sought to strip the bill of a "continuing resolution" that would reopen the government through Feb. 8 but disregard President Trump's request for border-wall funding. Republicans called the wall rebuff a "poison pill" they could not accept. A yes vote was to remove stopgap funding from the bill. A yes vote was to produce a bill dealing only with disaster aid.
Yes: Fitzpatrick, Meuser
No: Dean, Houlahan, Wild
VOTES IN THE SENATE
S.J. Res. 2
Sanctions relief for Russian companies
Voting 57 for and 42 against, the Senate on Wednesday failed to reach 60 votes needed to advance a Democratic-sponsored measure that sought to retain U.S. economic sanctions on the corporate domain of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. This upheld a deal soon to take effect in which the Treasury Department will remove the sanctions in return for Deripaska giving up majority interests in three firms he controls. In addition, the vote rendered as symbolic a House move (above) to nullify the sanctions deal. Deripaska is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and onetime business associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. A yes vote was to block Russian sanctions relief.
Yes: Casey
No: Toomey
S. 109
Affordable Care Act abortion funding
Voting 48 for and 47 against, the Senate on Thursday failed to reach 60 votes needed to advance a Republican-sponsored bill that would prohibit federal subsidies of insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act exchanges that provide abortion coverage. The bill would nullify the existing requirement that ACA policyholders personally pay the share of their insurance premium that reflects coverage of reproductive services. The health law is covered by the so-called Hyde Amendment, a standard part of annual appropriations bills that prohibits the expenditure of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the mother. A yes vote was to advance the bill.
Yes: Toomey, Casey

Resumen: [...]it would have required at least the tacit cooperation of a host of senior-level officials of the law enforcement and intelligence services. Among those senior FBI and intelligence officials who, in my view, had to have been complicit were: FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it seems to be President Donald Trump’s public assertion that he would like to get along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump’s ill-advised joke in 2016 that Russia should hack Hillary Clinton’s emails and reveal what she was up to. Were law enforcement and intelligence officials able to instigate and pursue a lengthy national security investigation of the elected head of state without the knowledge and consent of any elected official of the United States government?

Texto completo: More than 44 years ago, I was a junior Foreign Service officer serving as vice consul in my second overseas assignment at the American Consulate General in Zagreb.
Zagreb is the capital of the Republic of Croatia, which then was one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia. It was a fascinating country and a challenging assignment in this communist but nonaligned country then still led by World War II partisan Marshall Josip Broz Tito.
Why the history lesson? It seems to me that history does have a way of repeating. Indeed, as Karl Marx famously wrote, history repeats itself “first as tragedy, then as farce.”
‘Shockingly scary’
The Jan. 11 blockbuster headline reporting that the FBI actually opened a counterintelligence investigation into the president of the United States as a possible Russian agent would be highly humorous if it were not so shockingly scary. It is, in fact, the closest thing this country has come to a coup d’etat in 250 years.
And that brings me back to Yugoslavia circa 1974 at the time of Watergate.
Part of my job in Zagreb was to explain my country to the leaders of Croatia. That meant the society, the values and the foreign policy of the United States and how that related to their part of the world. The theory was that the better they knew and understood us, the more sympathetic they would be to our policies and ideals. Watergate was a real challenge in that regard.
To the people of the Balkans, however, Watergate could mean really only one thing: It was an ill-disguised coup d’etat by the opposition party designed to seize power from the party in power.
In their view, this “constitutional crisis” on the part of the Americans was just politics as usual. So President Richard Nixon covered up a connection to a burglary of the opposition party and lied about it — so what? That was pretty much the conventional wisdom among Croatia’s elites in government, the media and academia. Others went further to profess their disbelief that the Americans would even air such “dirty laundry” in public.
I used all my powers of persuasion and commanded the facts, but I could not convince my audience that such actions by the president were beyond the pale of American politics and a violation of our societal values.
I would like to think that, in the nearly half-century since then, the demise of communism and the rise of an independent and democratic nation of Croatia has put the views and values of Croatians a lot closer to those of mid-1970s Americans.
But in those intervening years have America’s own values become distorted? Can they no longer be relied on as they were in 1974? If indeed the FBI launched a formal national security investigation of the president of the United States as a possible Russian agent following the firing of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, it would have been an unprecedented action. And it would have required at least the tacit cooperation of a host of senior-level officials of the law enforcement and intelligence services.
Is the story even true? We do not know this for certain since the story is based on anonymous sources leaking to The New York Times. Among those senior FBI and intelligence officials who, in my view, had to have been complicit were: FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Only Ohr — somehow — remains in the employ of the federal government; McCabe and Strzok were terminated for cause and Page resigned. All have been criticized for exhibiting excessively partisan and unethical behavior.
Where is the proof?
What was the basis for this precedent-setting action? In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it seems to be President Donald Trump’s public assertion that he would like to get along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump’s ill-advised joke in 2016 that Russia should hack Hillary Clinton’s emails and reveal what she was up to.
Or was the investigation spurred by the so-called “Steele dossier,” whose most controversial elements remain unproven?
Some have suggested it was simply FBI pals seeking revenge for the firing of Comey, so deep was the animus they had for Trump.
Clearly whatever the motivation for launching a national security investigation into Trump’s relationship with Russia, one thing seems clear: Had that investigation unearthed any proof that Trump was working for Russia, the details of that proof would have been leaked to The New York Times by the same unethical officials who leaked the Jan. 11 story. And the headlines would have screamed “Traitor.”
So one can safely assume that there was nothing found by the investigation. The surest proof is that Trump is still in office.
The real question remains: Were law enforcement and intelligence officials able to instigate and pursue a lengthy national security investigation of the elected head of state without the knowledge and consent of any elected official of the United States government?
It appears that our elected officials knew nothing of this cabal, but unelected bureaucrats of the FBI and other agencies — as well as The New York Times — apparently were aware of it. That is the sort of coup d’etat that happens in small, unstable and fledgling countries, not the United States of America.

Iowa Senate should not hide from Iowans

Texto completo: Being in the majority means that you control not only what legislation is brought to a chamber floor, but also the power to unilaterally dictate rules if you refuse to listen to any minority input. At the start of the 88th General Assembly, this appears to be the GOP-controlled Senate's tactic.
During the 10 years of Democratic control and the last two years of GOP control, the rule was that there had to be a 24-hour notice before subcommittee meetings. This year, the Senate GOP has scrapped that [Debate erupts over transparency at Capitol, after Senate Republicans change public notice rule].
The result is that the public may have no notice of debate on bills in subcommittee. That removes the opportunity for the public to give input on legislation before it passes into a full committee meeting.
With no good reason for the change, it appears the goal is to hide legislation from the people at the Statehouse. The very house that we the people own.
I would urge you to call the Capitol switchboard, speak to your senators and ask why they are hiding their agenda from you. Sneaking legislation through before we can give input is not democracy.
— Matt Chapman, Waukee
There should be no government shutdowns In 2013, in April 2017 and again in January 2019, legislation encouraging the end of government shutdowns was proposed.
It is time for all Americans to understand that government services are essential and necessary and they must be properly and completely performed. I believe that legislative solutions must be developed, and that a shutdown shouldn't be an option.
It is time to demand that our representatives and senators develop solutions, so that the American people are no longer punished by not being paid and not having the needed services that assure our safety and well being.
It is also time that our president work for all Americans. He should never be allowed to shut down any part of our government again. Shutdowns were first used in 1976, and I believe we should push for an end to this practice in 2019.
— John Morgan, Urbandale
'Ag gag' not about transparency The recent guest column Will Coggin wrote on behalf of the so-called Center for Consumer Freedom is less about freedom and more about misinformation and scare tactics [Undercover video laws restrict misrepresentation, not speech].
I am not a member of PETA; I eat meat and I support family farmers. That being said, I have not bought industrial animal farm meat in about seven years. I want to eat food that is grown and raised by farmers who control their own farm.
I want to be able to look my farmer in the eye and know he or she is raising animals and planting food that is chemical-free and sustainably grown. Sadly, the power of Big Ag puts many farmers in an untenable situation of loss of autonomy, quantity over quality and debt.
While industrial farming and technology have steadily moved farming to meeting the demands of more humans, ironically it is humans that are failed. Farmers are in a cycle of debt and destruction, and it is affecting our soil and water quality.
Rural areas are decimated due to people fleeing for more stable work. As organic family farmers see more profit per acre, their industrial counterparts continue to need subsidies and handouts to survive.
Those are our tax dollars that are going toward propping up a commodities market that does not deal in reality.
At the very least, I and every consumer have the right to know where and how our food gets to our plates. An educated consumer can actually help make farming a thriving, diverse endeavor again. More transparency, not less is a must.
— Lora Fraracci, Des Moines
Keep guns away from school property Loaded guns on schools grounds? Our legislative session began Monday, and instead of working on improving Medicare, education and mental health treatment for Iowans, our lawmakers are spending our dollars to ensure anyone can go on to our children's school grounds with their guns [Iowans would be able to carry loaded guns onto school grounds if idea gets OK at Capitol].
The reason given is that it is too inconvenient for all of our gun-carrying neighbors to secure their gun away before they pick up their children.
Let me provide a better picture of a true hardship. As a teacher with little funding for my classroom due to school budgets, I can have a class of 32. Seven of those students are seriously mentally disturbed. And any number of their parents, babysitters or current friends can be waiting to meet them with a gun at hand, just outside the classroom window.
Iowa legislators, I foresee another 110 days of meeting none of the goals put forth by Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Janet Petersen. And I am going to ask to be taken off all outdoor duty before and after school.
— Betty Wolfe, Des Moines
King's beliefs are nationalist, not racist I am ashamed of the New York Times in their out-of-context reporting regarding Rep. Steve King.
I am extremely disappointed that Iowans and others have disregarded facts and quickly thrown King under the bus without any regard to researching the truth. King's congressional colleagues are well aware that he is a nationalist, not a racist.
For over 25 years, I have known Steve as man of principle who defends the original intent of the Constitution and the merits of Western civilization.
When Steve and I served in the Iowa Senate together, I witnessed his courage and boldness when standing up for the underprivileged and the rights of all citizens, including unborn children. He stood for personal responsibility under the rule of law. He served the people by defending them against intrusiveness, taxation and over-regulation in government.
He did not enter the political process for personal gain. On the contrary, he endured extreme persecution for his beliefs.
He left the comforts of a successful business and small-town living with the hope of helping to restore our God-given liberties.
His goals and beliefs have not changed but the liberal news media and his opponents have systematically created a false narrative about him.
Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, without facts, removed King of his committee assignments and left the 4th District without a representative voice in our political process. Are our Republican leaders more afraid of the New York Times and Democrat leaders than they are willing to standing up for truth in defending their friend? I believe the truth will prevail.
— Kitty Rehberg, Rowley
Praise for Grassley is misplaced Jonathan Yates really salivated over Sen. Charles Grassley's record of "steamrolling" Democrats on the Judiciary Committee in confirmations for the Courts [Grassley deserves praise for his handling of judicial appointees]. He's obviously a proud member of President Trump's diminishing base.
Frankly, Grassley has outlived his usefulness as a senator. I watched with sadness his difficulty in making any point during Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings. He struggled many times to address the subject at hand, demonstrating it's time for him to retire. Unfortunately, he's now chair of another committee.
It's because he is joined at the hip with Trump that he ran roughshod over all objections during Kavanaugh's hearing. Before that, he failed to permit President Obama's nominee to have any hearing.
The Republicans now have met their match with the Democrats in control of the House.
I hope they will wait for special counsel Robert Mueller's report, and if it supports impeachment, they will rid this country of its poorest and most deceitful president in history.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES >> The last time the Warriors arrived at this city, they did not look like a championship team. Instead, they became a star-driven team plagued with infighting and injuries.
Draymond Green and Kevin Durant sniped at each other. Green escalated the argument over a play call by daring him to leave the Warriors when he plans to become a free agent this summer. And Stephen Curry nursed a left groin injury, preventing him both from helping the Warriors as a sharpshooter and peacemaker.
The Warriors entered Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Clippers with much better vibes.
"We're light years ahead," Warriors coach Steve Kerr joked.
Kerr an obvious nod to Warriors majority owner Joe Lacob infamously boasting those same words in a New York Times story about the state of the organization. Kerr's hyperbole also reflected the Warriors' identify shift in the past two months.
Then, the Warriors became saddled with injuries to Curry (11 games) and Green (a combined 13 games with a right toe injury in his right foot). They fielded tension between Green and Durant following their argument on Nov. 12 at the end of regulation against the Clippers. And they experienced hiccups with their bench featuring younger players in heightened roles.
And now? The Warriors entered Friday night riding a six-game winning streak. Curry, Green, Durant and Klay Thompson are all healthy. And after spending the past year rehabbing a left Achilles tendon, DeMarcus Cousins made his Warriors debut against the Clippers.
"I'm really proud of our guys," Kerr said. "I'm really proud of how far we've come and how our guys have gotten to this point playing at a high level and playing through frustration and playing through adversity."
Incidentally, Cousins played an integral role in patching up differences between Durant and Green. Following their argument Cousins separated Green from the group and told him "to lock in."
"No need to go into detail. It's not about what I said," Cousins said. "Those two guys made a decision to get over it for the betterment of ourselves and the team. That's all that really matters."
What also matters: the Warriors had the collective experiences, personalities and talent to overcome those issues.
"I don't really think it's something we thought about," Cousins said. "It was a little bump in the road. It's a team. There's going to be disagreements and arguments, and it won't be the last one. It's about overcoming that and getting the job done, which those guys did. I don't think it's a thought."
No wonder Kerr argues he should be considered a "manager" and not a "coach."
Kerr considers "the whole job" to be more about handling personalities than just drawing up plays and practice time. Kerr excelled in the NBA as a sharp-shooting role player for 16 years (1988-2003) through five championship teams with the Chicago Bulls (1996-98) and San Antonio Spurs (1999, 2003). That has given him a window on how to play with dominant talent, including Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman, as well as handle the emotional swings during an 82-game NBA season.
"As a coach its your job to manage the situation and try to help the guys get back on the right track. Playing in the league was definitely a big help for me in experiencing those ups and downs and helping me figure out how to help as a coach."
 In the run-up to Cousins' highly anticipated debut, Showtime has released a new clip from its documentary on the four-time NBA All-Star.
Titled "The Resurgence," the work-in-progress film chronicles Cousins' grueling rehabilitation from a torn Achilles tendon that he suffered nearly a year ago while playing for the New Orleans Pelicans. The brief clip reflects both his frustration and resolve during the long ordeal.
"I know what player I want to be and I'm not settling for an injury to determine who I am as a player," he says at one point. "I determine my worth."
The premiere date and complete scope of the project have yet to be announced by Showtime.

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: Delve into fraught British affairs with the movie "Brexit" on HBO. Or stick with politics right at home with the documentary "Fahrenheit 11/9" on Amazon Prime.

What's on TV
BREXIT (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO Go or HBO Now. After an earlier introduction in Britain, the feature-length drama "Brexit" hops across the pond to tell the story -- or one possible version -- of how the British referendum on leaving the European Union resulted in the narrow triumph of the Leave campaign. Written by the political playwright James Graham, the movie follows the Vote Leave campaign manager, Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he ignites a dormant group of voters to "take back control" with strategies to overwhelm the Remain campaign and its leader, Craig Oliver (Rory Kinnear). As the Brexit controversy continues to send shock waves around the world, the only film yet to attempt to unravel the chaos may do the same.
ESCAPING THE MADHOUSE: THE NELLIE BLY STORY (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Nellie Bly, the famed female journalist, is the stuff of legend -- and so is this drama detailing her infiltration of the Women's Lunatic Asylum (based on the real New York City institution on Blackwell's Island). Inspired by Bly's real-life investigation into the mistreatment of mentally ill patients, this movie, starring Christina Ricci, brings a dark intensity to the deplorable conditions Bly experienced, with several cinematic twists.
SICARIO: DAY OF THE SOLDADO (2018) 8 p.m. on STARZ; rent on Google Play, YouTube and Vudu. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro square off in this suspenseful drama, in which an F.B.I. agent and a mysterious operative grudgingly work together to stop a Mexican drug cartel smuggling terrorists into the United States. Despite having a hot-button issue central to the story, the sequel to "Sicario" mostly manages to avoid politics.
TULLY (2018) 7:30 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO Go or HBO Now. In this dramedy directed by Jason Reitman, Marlo (Charlize Theron) is an overwhelmed "supermom," a type many mothers watching the show can probably identify with. When a night nanny named Tully (Mackenzie Davis) arrives to help, the two women form a surprising and special bond.
DYNASTIES 9 p.m. on BBC America. Narrated by the omnipresent naturalist Sir David Attenborough and produced by Mike Gunton of "Planet Earth II," this series follows five endangered animals as they fight to survive a treacherous world.
What's Streaming
[Video: FAHRENHEIT 11/9 Official Trailer (2018) Michael Moore, Donald Trump Movie HD Watch on YouTube.]
FAHRENHEIT 11/9 (2018) stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, YouTube and Vudu. Michael Moore adds to his documentary credits with a film that points fingers -- at everyone. Moore's sense of outrage at America's current state is palpable, from the water crisis in Flint, Mich., to his correct prediction of the outcome of the presidential election. But as Glenn Kenny wrote in a review for The New York Times, the film still manages to find hope in young activists who are taking on the country's most divisive issues.

Limited access mars artist profiles

Texto completo: When writing an artist profile, access is everything.

You get to the know the artist or band as human beings and not just as sounds you hear after pressing "play."

These days, not much time is spent between the interviewer and artist, if it happens at all.

In September, several pop critics sat down and talked about "the death of the celebrity profile" for an episode of the New York Times' Popcast, the newspaper's podcast that addresses the most interesting topics in music.

Times' pop critic and host Jon Caramanica had a conversation with Vanessa Grigoriadis, contributing writer at the New York Times, and Zach Baron, a staff writer at GQ Magazine, about specific things that need to happen today before an adequate profile can be put together, including the celebrity actually agreeing to be written about by another person, and the writer able to be challenging and critical during the interview.

Throughout the episode, they mention examples of celebrities interviewing other celebrities, celebrities writing their own cover story, and friends of celebrities writing the profile.

How are you supposed to put together an in-depth artist profile without having the proper access to make the interview work, whether that consists of spending the day with them while they go about their daily routine or spend an hour or two on a phone call?

While we certainly aren't interviewing or writing about celebrities regularly, this topic certainly applies when bigger artists make their way to Toledo.

It'll be rare to see an interview in The Blade with a popular Hollywood celebrity today. Even if that does happen, 10 times out of 10 the interview would be conducted over the phone with a given time limit (usually 15-20 minutes).

Management for Brian Wilson (the Beach Boys) gave me a solid 15 minutes for a phone interview. In 2012, I had 15 minutes on the phone with Machine Gun Kelly, but all he talked about was how the previous time he was in Bowling Green he had a great threesome. Amusing, but not especially relevant.

There's that question again: How do you write an article after such limited access to the person you interviewed, especially if the interview went bad.

Twenty One Pilots performed in Bowling Green at Howard's Club H in January, 2013. After their show that same night, they allowed me to the second floor of the bar for an interview. They were both sweaty and tired, so I was able to see and speak with them in an environment, which made for a great piece.

That's why interviews with local artists almost always end up being more engaging conversations. First, they actually want to do an interview because the exposure will help their career, and they don't have to worry as much about their image or what they say, though some will probably argue against that statement.

As painful as social media is to bring up, it's a huge factor in determining whether you'll secure an interview.

From an artist's standpoint, why should they agree to an interview with a writer whom they've never met and answer questions when they can conveniently and directly post statements to all of their followers on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere?

Last week before Bob Seger sold out the Huntington Center for a final Toledo performance of his more than 50-year career, I tried to secure an interview with the "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man" but his publicist said the singer didn't have time. Wouldn't it have been nice for his fans in the local area to read about his thoughts playing in Toledo one last time because it is so close to his hometown of Detroit?

On a local level, Waterville folk band Oliver Hazard invited me to their house last year for a long in-person interview, which presented the musicians in what a regular day was like for them. And as recently as December, I met Toledo hip-hop artist Baby Jayy at a restaurant and conducted a nearly two-hour interview with him while he ate chicken fajitas.

It's access such as these examples that really make for a better and more interesting artist profile because it's capturing them in their true element in real time. Not through their own online post, but still through their own words.

The ultimate question that presents itself from time to time is just how long before limited access becomes no access at all?

LOUIS C.K. IS UNAPOLOGETIC WITH JOKES ABOUT SEXUALLY HARASSING WOMEN, KIDS THAT GOT SHOT'

Texto completo: As more than two dozen protesters rallied outside Louis C.K.'s performance at a San Jose comedy club Wednesday night, the embattled comedian wasted no time inside addressing the sexual misconduct scandal that crashed his once high-flying career in comedy, TV and film, according to audience members.
After receiving a standing ovation, C.K. opened his set by saying, "I like to jerk off, and I don't like being alone," according to Daily Beast writer Stacey Solie, who attended the sold-out show at the San Jose Improv.
The masturbation joke refers to C.K. being accused in a November 2017 New York Times report of forcing female colleagues to watch him masturbate.
C.K. offered "no trace of an apology" with his joke about his sexual misconduct, according to Solie. The joke still managed to get "a good laugh," Solie added.
Another person attending the show also said that C.K. addressed the controversy at the start of the show, then noted on Twitter, "It was a really great time."
But Solie offered a somewhat different take, saying that "the first half of the show garnered a lot of laughter," including when C.K. addressed his missteps. But "the energy started to go downhill" about halfway through after C.K. made a joke about 9/11, she said.
C.K.'s missteps involved sexual harassment claims made by five women in the New York Times report. After admitting the women's claims were true, the 51-year-old comedian, actor and director lost his production deal with FX Networks, and his film, "I Love You, Daddy" was shelved.
He kept a low profile until this past fall when he began to mount a comeback by performing in comedy clubs such as the San Jose Improv. C.K. was scheduled to perform again Thursday night. That show also was sold out.
Solie said one way C.K. addressed his missteps was with this joke: "If you ever need people to forget that you jerked off, what you do is you make a joke about kids that got shot."
The joke was a reference to his attempt to mine humor at a show last month by mocking teen survivors of the February 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida.
"They testify in front of Congress, these kids," the Emmy winner had joked at the Governor's Comedy Club in Levittown, New York, on Dec. 16, according to reports. "You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids were shot. Why does that mean I have to listen to you?"
It was jokes like that, as well as his admission of sexual harassment, that prompted about two dozen protesters to gather in the pouring rain Wednesday outside the San Jose Improv.
The rally was attended by organizers of the San Jose Women's March and the Enough is Enough Voter Project, a national political action committee aimed at targeting politicians who condone violence against woman. The groups denounced the Improv for booking the comedian.
"We are here because Louis C.K. is an admitted serial sexual harasser. He caused tremendous damage to the careers of young women comedians who were very brave and came forward against him," said Michele Dauber, founder and chairwoman of Enough is Enough. "We do not think it's appropriate to welcome him back as a celebrity as if he has not caused all of this harm. He does not appear to really be accountable or be sorry for what he's done."
Solie wrote that C.K. demonstrated none of the "charming self-deprecation" or empathy he once successfully used to leaven some of his more abrasive and edgy humor. Solie said there "were a lot of tired jokes," including one that relied on racial stereotypes and references to men's penis sizes.
C.K. also made jokes about "retarded" kids and "dead babies." As for the 9/11 riff that deflated a lot of energy in the room, Solie said it was one she had heard C.K. make before. It had to do with C.K. getting off a plane because a woman and her husband were offering him different takes about wanting him to move so they could sit together.
"So I just got off the plane," C.K. said. "And then the plane took off. And it hit the World Trade Center."
That joke generated both laughter as well as "a lot of groans," Solie said.
The Improv defended its decision to book C.K. by saying in a statement that it doesn't "censor artists."
"We want them to perform without scrutiny," according to the statement. "We trust that our audiences can decide for themselves what their limits are. We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision and we respect their right to protest. We also respect Louis C.K.'s right to perform."
Before entering the venue, ticketholders declined to be interviewed when approached by a reporter, but one man who asked to remain anonymous said, "I like to separate the art from the artist."
The rally was peaceful, but two men who stood across the street and shouted their support for the protest got into a fight with a third man who appeared to be at the Improv for C.K.'s performance.
Police were called to the scene, but there were no arrests or citations in connection with the melee, which left one man with a bloodied face.

Texto completo: As more than two dozen protesters rallied outside Louis C.K.'s performance at a San Jose comedy club Wednesday night, the embattled comedian wasted no time inside addressing the sexual misconduct scandal that crashed his once high-flying career in comedy, TV and film, according to audience members.
After receiving a standing ovation, C.K. opened his set by saying, "I like to jerk off, and I don't like being alone," according to Daily Beast writer Stacey Solie, who attended the sold-out show at the San Jose Improv.
The masturbation joke refers to C.K. being accused in a November 2017 New York Times report of forcing female colleagues to watch him masturbate.
C.K. offered "no trace of an apology" with his joke about his sexual misconduct, according to Solie. The joke still managed to get "a good laugh," Solie added.
Another person attending the show also said that C.K. addressed the controversy at the start of the show, then noted on Twitter, "It was a really great time."
But Solie offered a somewhat different take, saying that "the first half of the show garnered a lot of laughter," including when C.K. addressed his missteps. But "the energy started to go downhill" about halfway through after C.K. made a joke about 9/11, she said.
C.K.'s missteps involved sexual harassment claims made by five women in the New York Times report. After admitting the women's claims were true, the 51-year-old comedian, actor and director lost his production deal with FX Networks, and his film, "I Love You, Daddy" was shelved.
He kept a low profile until this past fall when he began to mount a comeback by performing in comedy clubs such as the San Jose Improv. C.K. was scheduled to perform again Thursday night. That show also was sold out.
Solie said one way C.K. addressed his missteps was with this joke: "If you ever need people to forget that you jerked off, what you do is you make a joke about kids that got shot."
The joke was a reference to his attempt to mine humor at a show last month by mocking teen survivors of the February 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida.
"They testify in front of Congress, these kids," the Emmy winner had joked at the Governor's Comedy Club in Levittown, New York, on Dec. 16, according to reports. "You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids were shot. Why does that mean I have to listen to you?"
It was jokes like that, as well as his admission of sexual harassment, that prompted about two dozen protesters to gather in the pouring rain Wednesday outside the San Jose Improv.
The rally was attended by organizers of the San Jose Women's March and the Enough is Enough Voter Project, a national political action committee aimed at targeting politicians who condone violence against woman. The groups denounced the Improv for booking the comedian.
"We are here because Louis C.K. is an admitted serial sexual harasser. He caused tremendous damage to the careers of young women comedians who were very brave and came forward against him," said Michele Dauber, founder and chairwoman of Enough is Enough. "We do not think it's appropriate to welcome him back as a celebrity as if he has not caused all of this harm. He does not appear to really be accountable or be sorry for what he's done."
Solie wrote that C.K. demonstrated none of the "charming self-deprecation" or empathy he once successfully used to leaven some of his more abrasive and edgy humor. Solie said there "were a lot of tired jokes," including one that relied on racial stereotypes and references to men's penis sizes.
C.K. also made jokes about "retarded" kids and "dead babies." As for the 9/11 riff that deflated a lot of energy in the room, Solie said it was one she had heard C.K. make before. It had to do with C.K. getting off a plane because a woman and her husband were offering him different takes about wanting him to move so they could sit together.
"So I just got off the plane," C.K. said. "And then the plane took off. And it hit the World Trade Center."
That joke generated both laughter as well as "a lot of groans," Solie said.
The Improv defended its decision to book C.K. by saying in a statement that it doesn't "censor artists."
"We want them to perform without scrutiny," according to the statement. "We trust that our audiences can decide for themselves what their limits are. We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision and we respect their right to protest. We also respect Louis C.K.'s right to perform."
Before entering the venue, ticketholders declined to be interviewed when approached by a reporter, but one man who asked to remain anonymous said, "I like to separate the art from the artist."
The rally was peaceful, but two men who stood across the street and shouted their support for the protest got into a fight with a third man who appeared to be at the Improv for C.K.'s performance.
Police were called to the scene, but there were no arrests or citations in connection with the melee, which left one man with a bloodied face.

He is currently on several boards and committees.

The Trail-Gazette's Editorial Board is composed of the Publisher, our Editor and a number of citizen members, selected because of their interest, experience, and knowledge of the community at large.
Its purpose is to provide the Trail's professional staff with a variety of views and opinions on the events and issues that make up the community news of the day. In addition, they are tasked with serving as a check and balance on how we do what we do in order to ensure that we are even-handed and transparent in all things and at all times.
To avoid "group think," we try very hard to make sure that the Editorial Board includes members whose views and outlook represent the widest possible cross-section of the community. We want those Editorial Board members to challenge each other even as they challenge us. None are paid; none set policy; and only on occasion are Editorial Board members invited (or volunteer) to write editorials or opinion pieces. When they do, their names are attached. Whatever their source, our editorials are always the responsibility of the Publisher.
The editorials may or may not reflect the views of Editorial Board members, but our goal is to make certain that they meet the highest standards of professional journalism, the backbone of a free people. As to conflict of interest, any time a topic arises involving a company or an organization that benefit or involve a Board member, that individual member is recused from taking part in the discussion. We have, in short, strict rules that everyone has agreed to play by.

Texto completo: Dear Readers: Back in the day the first thing I’d read when I opened my Daily Herald was Jim O’Donnell’s media column. I found him to be bright and articulate with a vocabulary shared by few. I knew someday I’d enjoy working with him if given the chance.
O’Donnell, with his decades of connections, knows the Chicago sports scene, so what better than to have him complement our lineup of knowledgeable, familiar experts: Dietz, Gregor, McGraw, Miles and Rozner.
O’Donnell returns today to the Friday Sports pages of The Daily Herald with a sports media column. I’m confident you’ll enjoy his eye for detail, insight, great reporting and occasional feather-ruffling.
In addition to previous work here, the award-winning O’Donnell has written for Frank Deford’s National Sports Daily, the Sun-Times, the Tribune and The New York Times. He also worked on two best-selling books authorized by Michael Jordan, and while a freelance radio writer he worked with Steve Dahl and Garry Meier.
He’s back with us. Once you read his column, you’ll want to keep reading him.

Texto completo: Describing a "very difficult" road ahead, Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the automaker would cut its staff by about 7 percent.
The Palo Alto, California-based company grew by 30 percent last year, but struggles to remain profitable at that staffing level, Musk said in a memo to Tesla employees also posted on the company's website. The company had a "tiny profit" in the third quarter and expects to post an even smaller one in the fourth quarter, Musk said.
Tesla must make the job cuts as it ramps up production of the Model 3, he said.
"While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people," Musk said. "We will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles. "
A 7 percent staff reduction would mean about 3,150 employees would be let go, based on Musk's tweet in October that Tesla has 45,000 employees.
"We unfortunately have no choice but to reduce full-time employee headcount by approximately 7 percent . . . and retain only the most critical temps and contractors," Musk said.

Tesla delivered more than 245,000 electric cars and SUVs last year, nearly as many as all previous years combined. But its 2018 production fell far short of a goal set nearly three years ago of manufacturing 500,000 vehicles for the year. That goal was announced in May 2016 based on advance orders for its mid-range Model 3, which Musk said sells for $44,000.
"Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company," Musk said. "There isn't any other way. "
Tesla’s shares fell earlier this month after it cut vehicle prices by $2,000 and announced fourth-quarter sales figures that fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company faces growing competition from other automakers including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Nissan.
“Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we’re up against massive, entrenched competitors,” he said. "The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products. "
“Attempting to build affordable clean energy products at scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity,” he said in the memo, “but succeeding in our mission is essential to ensure that the future is good, so we must do everything we can to advance the cause. ”
Tesla will begin selling the Model 3 in Europe and China in February, a significant milestone in the company's global goals. Its factory in Shanghai is its first outside the United States.
Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 13 percent to close at $302. 26 on Friday. While the "knee jerk reaction" to the company's news may be negative, the long-term view for Tesla is positive, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives in a note to investors.
"We continue to believe Tesla will be able to emerge from the next 12 to 18 months a stronger, profitable more product diversified (geographically and price points) EV company helping lay the groundwork for Model 3 as a linchpin of growth going forward into 2020 and beyond," wrote Ives, whose firm maintains an "Outperform" rating on Tesla's stock.
The staffing reductions come after a tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla. In September, the CEO agreed to step down as company chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine as part of a fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC had filed a complaint charging Musk with making a "false and misleading" statement when he tweeted in August that the company had enough funding to go private.
Also in September, Musk was seen apparently smoking marijuana in a video podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. The Tesla CEO had described 2018 as "the most difficult and painful" year of his career in an interview with The New York Times.
That led media mogul turned sleep advocate Arianna Huffington to issue an open letter to Musk suggesting he get more rest.
He replied in his own tweet: "Ford & Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy,'' he replied. "I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not. ''

Steve King is using controversy to fundraise

Texto completo: While Republicans and Democrats are condemning or calling for Rep. Steve King's resignation after his comments on white nationalism and white supremacy, the congressman is using the backlash to raise money for his campaign.
"The unhinged left has teamed up with Republican 'NeverTrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me," King wrote in a campaign email to his supporters.
In the email, King said the New York Times and "rabid leftist media" are coming after him for supporting President Donald Trump and because of his views on immigration. The email came after a week of controversy from the Times article where King asked "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
King has clarified his comments on the House floor and elsewhere saying he did not mean to put white nationalism and supremacy in the same category as Western civilization. But that did not stop House Republicans from stripping him of committee assignments, or the House from passing a resolution of making its condemnation of white supremacy clear.
But that seems to be the extent of punishment for King so far. Democrat House leaders blocked an effort to censure King, a more formal punishment for the representative, Wednesday.
"I think we have spoken, and we have spoken on both sides of the aisle, that this is unacceptable rhetoric and behavior," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said.
King laughed down a question from Fox News Wednesday when asked about the possibility of getting censured by the House.
"No, that's just not going to happen," King said. "Oh, no."
While the nine-term representative said he was confident the House will take no further action, Republican leaders have not taken back their calls for King to step down from his elected position.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Iowa conservative should "find another line of work." Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican, echoed McConnell's comments. Sen. Mitt Romney told reporters King should "step aside."
Though King has not made moves to step down from his position, he will likely need the fundraising money to fend off primary challengers.
State Sen. Randy Feenstra, the chair of the Senate's powerful Ways and Means Committee, said he would run for the Republican nomination in King's 4th Congressional District. Bret Richards, an Irwin Republican, is also seeking the nomination.
King has long battled back challenges from within his party and from Democrats. Until 2018, he had easily won reelection. But last year, he faced the closest race of his career.

As citizen or presidential hopeful, what's DNA got to do with it? Sen. Elizabeth Warren's case points up the historical and legal arbitrariness of racial categories in the U.S.

Texto completo: As Sen. Elizabeth Warren explores a 2020 presidential run, she reminds me of some long-standing issues about racial identification.
Warren, whom President Trump has pejoratively labeled "Pocahontas" for claiming she has American Indian heritage, took a DNA test to prove it. When the results showed she has hardly any, she was criticized for falsely claiming Native American ancestry. Some speculate this may hurt her presidential aspirations.
Warren's predicament points up the historical, legal and cultural arbitrariness of racial categories. For example, if Warren had proclaimed she had even one African ancestor, she would be defined as black legally and socially in most of the United States. That's because our nation uses the one-drop rule, or hypodescent, as the definition of who is black.
As white slave-owners realized they would benefit by categorizing their offspring with enslaved African women as nonwhite - thus increasing the number of people who could be treated as property - the legal and social definition of who is black became anyone with even one black ancestor.
The rule has been used in court repeatedly. One of the most famous cases involved Susie Guillory Phipps, a Louisiana woman, who presumed she and all her ancestors were white; when she tried to get a passport, however, she discovered that she was listed as black on her birth certificate. According to The New York Times, because Phipps had a black ancestor - an enslaved woman, 222 years back in her family history - she was black under state law.
The 2016 movie "Free State of Jones" is based partly on the case of Davis Knight, who, in the 1940s in Mississippi, was convicted of the crime of miscegenation for having a white wife. Generations of his family lived as white people, although one of their ancestors had been a freed black woman. Their case was documented by scholar Victoria Bynum.
Warren, who is from Oklahoma, a state with a large Native American population, learned, like many black people, that sometime in the past, her family has indigenous ancestry without any documentation of exactly when that happened.
Here is where I see similarities between Warren's situation and that of many black people. After all, we African Americans could not document specifically all our ancestors in slavery, but we know they existed.
I have heard stories of indigenous ancestry in my family all my life, most often involving the Choctaws. But, like Warren, when I had my DNA ancestry tests done, only one would say there was a probability that 1 percent of my genes come from Native Americans. Does this mean family stories have been debunked? Not necessarily. There are limits to how far back these tests can trace - only about five to seven generations - and they are less reliable for non-white customers.
The truth is, throughout the history of this country, race has been manipulated and defined to the disadvantage of both black and indigenous people. My attempts at empathy with others have opened my mind to connections that could be.
Warren has not used her Native American heritage to defraud anyone or take advantage of affirmative action programs. The way for her to deal with racism is not to prove that she is indigenous or a member of any other race, but to decry the racism in the epithets used against her and others. This is especially important for someone who is running for president of a diverse nation.

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Texto completo: Michael D. Cohen, the former personal lawyer and fixer for President Trump, acknowledged on Thursday that he had paid the owner of a technology services company to help doctor results of an online poll to help Trump as he considered a run for president.
In a post on Twitter about his actions, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Cohen said that he had done so at the direction of Trump, and regretted it.
Cohen wrote: “As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it."
The Journal reported that in early 2015, before Trump declared himself a candidate for president, Cohen gave $12,000 to $13,000 in cash stuffed in a Walmart bag to John Gauger, the owner of RedFinch Solutions, who also works for Liberty University. The money was in exchange for help boosting Trump's name in two online polls.
Cohen was supposed to pay Gauger $50,000 for the work, the man told The Journal, but the full amount was never paid out. However, Cohen billed the Trump Organization $50,000 for technology services, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who referenced the amount in a charging document.
Cohen has agreed to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb. 7. Cohen's testimony will be restricted to avoid issues directly related to the special counsel investigation into whether there was collusion by anyone in the Trump campaign with Russian officials.

Conway's spouse jabs Trump, is labeled 'bad husband'
President Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, publicly branded White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's spouse a bad husband Wednesday in response to his latest barb directed at the president — this one over Trump's misspelling of "hamburger."
The latest flare-up in the escalating drama involving lawyer and frequent Trump critic George Conway stemmed from the visit of the Clemson Tigers football team to the White House on Monday night. Hamstrung by the partial government shutdown, Trump served the team fast food, including Whoppers from Burger King, which he said he paid for out of his own pocket.
Trump relived the gathering the following morning on Twitter, writing: "Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamberders etc. Within one hour, it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!"
Trump soon deleted the tweet and replaced it with one in which "hamburgers" was correctly spelled.
Burger King, nevertheless, took note, responding in a tweet that "due to a large order placed yesterday, we're all out of hamberders."
George Conway, who has previously questioned Trump's veracity and respect for the law, pounced on Wednesday.
"Think of how much of a laughingstock a president has to become to have *Burger King* make fun of him. Sad," he wrote in a searing tweet.
Responding to Conway's tweet, Parscale shot back: "Think how bad of a husband you have to be to act this way."

Spoof kid's books donated to Karen Pence's school
Here's a donation that probably isn't too welcome: The Trevor Project, an organization that supports LGBTQ young people, is sending 100 copies of a book about the family rabbit of Vice President Mike Pence to a school in Northern Virginia.
The recipient, Immanuel Christian School, is the institution where second lady Karen Pence is teaching art — the one with policies that ban gay or transgender people from enrolling or being employed there — and the book is "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo," a story promoting acceptance and marriage equality that's a spoof of Karen Pence's own children's book about the family's bunny.
The books were penned by a writer for HBO's "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver," and feature a story line about Marlon Bundo falling in love and eventually marrying another boy bunny. In the tome, Vice President Pence is portrayed as a stink bug who disapproves, and is later voted out of being "In Charge" by the animals.

Poll sees Generation Z as more diverse, leaning left
Students from Parkland, Fla., became some of the country's most effective opponents of gun violence after a man fatally shot 17 people at their Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The teens are organized, well-researched, and poised. They've weathered social media abuse with maturity because they've been dealing with it their entire lives.
According to a new poll from the Pew Research Center, the teens may offer a window into the politics of Generation Z more broadly.
Generation Z, defined as those born after 1996, is nearing adulthood. The oldest among them are graduating college. By 2020, almost half will be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which means their values and opinions could soon help shape national politics.
According to the survey, released Thursday, Gen Z teens and young adults have overwhelmingly adopted left-leaning beliefs similar to the millennials before them. They overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump, believe the government should do more, and reject American exceptionalism.
It's not uncommon for young people to hold liberal views that moderate as they age. But Gen Zers grew up in a very different world than previous generations. The oldest among them was just 11 when the first black president was elected. They became teenagers as same-sex marriage was legalized around the country. They also, according to Pew, will be the most racially diverse and well-educated generation.
This younger generation is much more likely to see climate change as a result of human behavior and to believe black Americans are treated unfairly.

Jeff Jacobs: All in the Division III family with Jim Calhoun

Texto completo: WEST HARTFORD — Jim Calhoun is talking organic pizza and area Asian restaurants with sports information director Josh Ingham when I walk into his office Wednesday. His hands joined behind his head, wearing a St. Joseph sweatshirt, Calhoun is remarkably relaxed behind his desk one day before a conference game.
Me? I’m pretty freaked out.
“I like the two guards,” Calhoun said before I open my mouth.
He’s talking about Lasell’s Stefan Masciarelli and Kevin Nunez, who recently transferred from UMass Boston. I tell him Masciarelli’s dad played football at AIC, where Calhoun played basketball. Calhoun nods, even at 76 a sponge for information.
My son Liam will play for a Lasell team against Calhoun’s Blue Jays on Thursday night at St. Joseph. It’s a simple matter, really. They’ll throw up a ball. One team will score more over 40 minutes in a Great Northeast Athletic Conference game. Liam will get on a bus returning to Newton, Mass. Calhoun will either count his 883rd career victory or he won’t.
Yeah, if only it were that simple.
“Just trying to win,” Liam texts. “It’s a privilege just to be on the same court as coach Calhoun.”
His unwritten message is: This is dad’s deal. Not his.
He’s right. I’m the mess.
Liam’s the one who had a UConn poster, with his guy Niels Giffey, hanging in his bedroom. I’m the one with all the angry emails from UConn fans.
A number of people have asked me how I feel about my kid playing against Calhoun. And then they smile a mischievous smile. My editors encouraged me to write about it. They know the bumpy relationship we’ve had over a quarter-century, and that’s putting it politely.
A Google search will turn up the worst of it in 2006. It started over my contention that Marcus Williams should have been suspended for an entire season for stealing laptops. By the time it was over it had spilled onto the pages of The New York Times and the WFAN airwaves on “Mike and the Mad Dog.”
There were other times, too, but there were warm times, columns about his family and his Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame induction and, of course, his three national championships. In a little side room in Phoenix, I saw the worst loser, the toughest guy I ever came across, dissolve in tears when he made his first Final Four in 1999. People, though, they remember the ugly writer-coach moments.
Associate head coach Glen Miller walks into Calhoun’s office. Miller helped Calhoun to UConn’s 2011 national title and helped Kevin Ollie devise game plans to knock off Michigan State, Florida and Kentucky for the 2014 championship. And now here he is reading off his scouting report about Lasell’s No. 15. When he finishes, I say, “You forgot the part about leaving him open.” Miller smiles and says “Not happening.”
Liam struggled in the first half of the season. A buzzer-beater to upset St. Joe’s Maine last Tuesday seemed to give him confidence. He had 25 points, 11 rebounds, five 3s and five blocks against Rivier his last game.
Calhoun and I will never agree on everything written while he was at UConn. But Colby Sawyer and Regis? We’re pretty much DIII buds. And maybe that’s the best part of this story. There is something pure about Division III. When you erase a billion-dollar industry, what’s left is the basketball.
“The perception these kids don’t want to win as much as the UConn kids is so far off the mark,” Calhoun said. “As much as Syracuse wanted to beat us, Emmanuel wanted to beat us. When I’m coaching, whether it’s 20,000 or 200, I’m not counting fans in the stands. The game is the game.”
Ingham said he has been told since Calhoun spent almost all his career at Northeastern and UConn, his St. Joseph win total gets grandfathered in and counted versus other Division I coaches. He passed Dean Smith in December and now trails only Coach K, Jim Boeheim and Bob Knight.
There is an ESPN crew following Calhoun around this season for a documentary. His return to coaching has been written about in several national outlets. Our DIII relationship takes us deeper into the weeds.
We talk about St. Joseph having to spend six hours on the bus for a game at Colby Sawyer in New Hampshire on Tuesday, return home for a game against Emmanuel on Thursday and then another six-hour round trip to St. Joe’s Maine starting Saturday morning. The Blue Jays lost all three games. Calhoun said he’s fine on the bus, reading a book and two or three newspapers. But three games in five days, with the travel, Calhoun didn’t think the scheduling was fair to his players’ preparation. He’s right.
In the program’s first year, St. Joe, made up of nearly all freshmen, is 9-8 overall, 0-3 in the GNAC. The Blue Jays, picked for third in the preseason, recruited a bunch of young talent. They’re going to be really good. Lasell, picked eighth of 12, is 2-0 in the GNAC. We talk about the 31 Connecticut kids from other conference teams. Emmanuel’s Joe Tamburro, from South Windsor, hit a 3-pointer with eight seconds left to beat the Blue Jays last week. Interviewed by Joe D’Ambrosio on WTIC, which carries Blue Jays home games, Tamburro’s voice was one of pure joy. Emmanuel has a bunch of Connecticut kids on its roster and a group of its fans evidently gave it to Calhoun pretty good. He got it at St. Joe’s Maine, too, when the Blue Jays lost by 11 on Saturday. What? You don’t think teams want to beat a Hall of Fame legend?
I can close my eyes and see Calhoun up on the podium at Madison Square Garden after those unforgettable Big East Tournament games. I can see hundreds of reporters at those Final Four events. I can see Calhoun staring out at Allen Iverson, at Shaq, at Grant Hill, at Vince Carter. And now he’s coaching in a game against my kid? Damn straight, it blows my mind.
I never mention that part. Instead we talk about how Division I players can take part in strength workouts under instruction in the summer.
“Meanwhile, Division III coaches can’t get near the kids until Oct. 15,” Calhoun said. “In the midst of games, kids never lose their concentration on offense. They lose it on defense. With us a lot of it is youth, but some of it has to with practice schedule, strength training. Amherst, those teams are set. They’ve got the pick of the litter. If we played better defense we’d be 12-5.”
We talk about how his “biggest surprise” is the work ethic of some players. He is still coming to understand the DIII student-athlete. He talks about molding teams like he did at UConn, even if it means sacrificing a few wins this season. So, will there be a next season for Jim Calhoun.
“The plan is to keep going forward,” Calhoun said. “We’ll have to make some changes how we think about it and how we approach it.”
At that point it struck me that 20 years from now my son will look at a list of all Calhoun’s wins and losses and see 77-74 UConn over Duke in 1999 alongside the score of a Lasell-St. Joseph game in 2019.
Surely, that will blow his mind as much as mine is today.

Anti-Semitism doesn't reflect MLK values

Texto completo: So far, all the articles and opinions I've read in the Citizen Times regarding Tamika Mallory's selection to give the Martin Luther King Jr. Keynote Address have fallen short. Nowhere is the overwhelming evidence of Mallory's anti-Semitism mentioned. This is not a matter of speculation, it's a matter of fact.
Exhibit A: Tamika Mallory has attacked the Anti-Defamation League, which has been fighting racism and bigotry for over 100 years, claiming the ADL "CONSTANTLY attacks black and brown people." Anyone at all familiar with the work of the ADL knows how outrageous this claim is.
Mallory went so far as to organize a boycott of Starbucks, because Starbucks had asked the ADL to assist in sensitivity training after Starbucks employees had called the police to arrest two black men inside a Starbucks for loitering. In a despicable show of cowardice, Starbucks acquiesced to Mallory, and told the ADL their help was no longer welcomed.
Mallory's malice towards the ADL is due to the ADL calling out her hero Louis Farrakhan for his many vile anti-Semitic remarks. Mallory correctly says that she is not responsible for Farrakhan's words, but she has repeatedly refused to say she thinks Farrakhan's horrific anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ statements are unacceptable. Instead, she has stood on stage with him, and called him "the Greatest of All Time."
Exhibit B: From the NYT, Dec. 23:
"Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez say they categorically condemn anti-Semitism, and that when they asked Ms. Wruble to leave the group, it had nothing to do with her being Jewish. But they acknowledged that the role of Jewish women was discussed in that first meeting." If making a special case of Jews ("the role of Jewish women") is not anti-Semitism, what is?
Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this fiasco is the attempt by the University to cast this as a "free speech" issue, emphasizing that "an invitation is not an endorsement of the speaker or their views."
While this is valid as a general rule, it certainly does not apply to high profile speaking opportunities at the University. The individual chosen to speak at graduation is vetted entirely differently from a speaker invited to give a talk on civil war history, or any other topic of academic interest, where "free speech" certainly needs to be respected, without implying endorsement. But were UNC Asheville to invite Ann Coulter to give the graduation address, it would be absolutely interpreted as an endorsement of her views. Of course, Coulter would never be invited, as it would be clearly recognized as inappropriate.
And thus it should have been with Mallory giving the MLK Jr. Week Keynote Address. The primary consideration in selecting a speaker for this occasion can't possibly be "freedom of speech," the only consideration must be, how well does this speaker reflect and honor Martin Luther King's memory and values?
Sadly, it's clear that Mallory fails this test. Even more regrettably, the controversy is not something new, although it has risen to higher prominence after it was explored in the New York Times article of Dec. 23, titled "Women's March Roiled by Accusations of Anti-Semitism." This has been a high-profile issue for at least a year now. Evidence of anti-Semitism from Mallory and the three other self-appointed national leaders of the Women's March has resulted in major fissures in the Women's March. Due to the refusal of these four to step down, many local chapters, including the Asheville Chapter of the Women's March, have dissociated from the national group.
Many high-profile women have called for Mallory and others to step down due to their anti-Semitism, including the Founder of the Women's March, Theresa Shook, and leaders of the #MeToo movement.
How sad that Tamika Mallory's last big payday will come at the expense of the dignity of the MLK Keynote at UNCA.

Getting Help and Finding the Path Out of Student Loan Debt and Toward Hope

Texto completo: Eddie Rodriguez approached his financial counselor, beaming in his new navy suit.
"It's a small office," said Mr. Rodriguez, 42, "but magic comes out of there."
Early last year, Mr. Rodriguez could hardly afford to pay his basic living expenses, let alone buy new clothes. After defaulting another time on his student loans, his Social Security disability benefits were again garnished, leaving him with little. Knowing he needed help, he sought assistance in June from the Financial Coaching Corps, part of the Community Service Society.
Mr. Rodriguez is not alone in his struggle with student debt: Federal statistics show that nearly a third of the people who take out student loans have serious trouble repaying them.
"A lot of my clients never received good information at any sort of point along the student loan journey," said Mr. Rodriguez's financial counselor, Courtney Davis, the community development specialist at Financial Coaching Corps. She helped him rehabilitate his defaulted loans.
As a teenager on Long Island, Mr. Rodriguez did not focus on education, he recalled in an interview last month. His parents worked long hours at multiple jobs, including hotel, restaurant and factory work. "They tried their best with what they had," Mr. Rodriguez said. "I know that now."
As a boy, he dreamed of playing professional football and idolized the quarterback Dan Marino. But Mr. Rodriguez was hit by a truck in junior high school, leaving him with a leg injury, and he hung up his jersey.
To numb the pain of his injury and the loss of his athletic dreams, he began using drugs and alcohol. His struggle with addiction continued after he became a father at 18.
"It was stressful," he said. "I didn't know how to be a parent. I wasn't ready."
He and his daughter's mother stayed together for several years, and Mr. Rodriguez tried to support his new family.
"I took any job I could get: food industry, retail, any labor job," Mr. Rodriguez said. "Because of my lack of education, it was tough."
He kept working low-wage jobs after his relationship unraveled, and he enrolled at Sullivan County Community College in 2005 to set an example for his daughter, as well as his nieces and nephews. He also began taking out loans.
The effort fizzled, and he tried again in 2011, this time at Suffolk County Community College, pursuing a degree in human services and writing for the college paper's sports section. He took on more loans and continued to work part-time.
But he was unable to finish college as he wrestled with addiction and economic stress brought on a major depressive episode. He found himself with more than $30,000 in student debt and relied on Social Security disability payments related to his mental health. On and off over the following years, he would be found in default and unable to receive his full disability benefits.
Last year brought a shift. Mr. Rodriguez was proud when his daughter graduated from college, which he called "one of the greatest moments" of his life, and she found a job in the public health field.
He committed to receiving help from the Maryhaven Center of Hope rehabilitation center on Long Island, and he has been sober since March, after 15 years of stops and starts.
"Keep God first, be honest with myself and never give up -- those are the three principles I live by today," he said. "My first goal always is staying clean. No. 1, nothing will be possible if you don't stay clean."
Mr. Rodriguez has found a job that is meaningful to him: helping other men with addiction as a wellness coach at the nonprofit organization Reality House.
"I started to believe in myself that there's a better way," Mr. Rodriguez said.
While looking into potential resources to help improve his financial situation, he found support from Ms. Davis at Financial Coaching Corps.
"Eddie was really motivated to tackle this issue," she said. Part of her salary is paid for with support from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, of which Community Service Society is a beneficiary.
Mr. Rodriguez is seven months into a 10-month payment plan that, once completed, will bring his loan out of default, improving his credit rating and restoring his eligibility to apply for federal financial aid.
Mr. Rodriguez's next goal is to finish his degree in human services; he hopes to start school again part-time by the end of 2019. This time, he'll do it with better financial advice.
"There are people out there that are willing to take their time to sit with you," Mr. Rodriguez said.

Texto completo: Now that Republican officials have finally taken long-overdue measures to condemn and diminish the power of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, a new line of critique from the Left has emerged: Why not President Trump?

"They're taking on King instead of taking on Trump. It’s safer," wrote New York Times columnist Frank Bruni. "The sacrifice of one wretched bigot to atone for the indulgence of another; an opportunity for moral preening after so much moral surrender.”

Liberals have echoed Bruni's sentiment, accusing Republicans of moral cowardice and diminishing the intentions of their denouncement of King. Not only is this a counterproductive line of inquiry — one that actually encourages political factions to remain mum on their unpalatable allies — but it also misses the very real difference between Trump and King.

Trump frequently uses language and expresses sentiments below not just the office of the presidency but that of civil society. He has made xenophobic remarks and doesn't mind poking a stick at modern multiculturalism. That said, he is not a white supremacist, whereas Steve King has openly become one.

King has flirted with the neo-Nazi community, openly dog-whistling hints about the "14 words," the credo of white nationalism. He has endorsed and met with white nationalist politicians abroad. He's peddled the conspiracy theory about the replacement of the white race.

King hasn't just said a few careless or offensive things or retweeted someone who later turned out to be a white supremacist. Rather, he's become a full-blown racialist who questions racial equality and nakedly appeals to white nationalists for support, meeting with them and using their exact language. To place him in the same category as Trump is simply a category error.

This distinction matters, and not because there's some good reason to exonerate Republicans, who too often fail to denounce Trump when he's wrong. What's at stake here is your view of your fellow citizens as well as your ability to debate with them. As many as 40 percent of Americans share Trump's protectionism, not due to any racial animus but fear of impacted labor markets and cultural differences. Very, very few of them think like King, although that number is still too large.

The public should continue to hold the GOP's feet to the fire and demand accountability from the Republican Party when Trump goes off on his tirades. But don't make the mistake of conflating ignorance and casual cultural chauvinism with white supremacy.

House rebukes King

Texto completo: The U.S. House nearly unanimously passed a resolution condemning Iowa Rep. Steve King on Tuesday over comments he made approving of white supremacy.
The vote was 424-1. Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, who wanted to go further by censuring King, was the only vote against it.
King, of Kiron, voted to approve the measure and encouraged all House members to vote for it.
"I'm putting up a 'yes' up on the board here because what you state here is right and it's true and it's just," he said.
House Republicans on Monday also removed him from committee assignments.
The House resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy," was proposed by Rep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus. It begins with King's controversial quote from a recent New York Times interview: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
The measure does not take further action against King but states the House rejects white nationalism and supremacy while referencing his quote.
"When representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes of our society," Clyburn said when the resolution was brought to the House floor Tuesday.
King supported the measure Republicans also spoke on the floor in support of the resolution condemning white nationalism — including King himself.
"Even though I'd add some more that were stronger language, I agree with the language in it," King said on the floor Tuesday. "So I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: 'Let's vote for this resolution.'"
It's rare, even unheard of, for an elected official to vote for a resolution condemning their own actions. But King said that while he disagreed with the Times' interpretation of his words, he supported the denouncement of white nationalism and white supremacy.
"That ideology never shows up in of my head," he said. "I don't know how it could possibly come out of my mouth."
Eighteen representatives from both sides of the aisle spoke in support of the resolution. While King and the other Republican speakers talked broadly about the need to combat white supremacy, Democrats focused on King's history of controversial remarks.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said King's racism was an "open secret" in the House. She cited a King quote from 2013, that for every young immigrant who becomes a school valedictorian, there are hundreds more with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."
"While I'm glad that my colleagues on the other side are speaking out and have taken this important act of stripping Mr. King of his committees, let us be very clear," she said, "We all know that the record of these kinds of comments is long."
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, of California, supported the move to penalize King for the controversial statement. He met with King on Monday and then convened the Republican Steering Committee to remove King from his committees. Previously, King served on the judiciary, agriculture and small business committees.
"Steve's remarks are beneath the dignity of the party of Lincoln and the United States of America," McCarthy said in a statement Monday.
Proposals from Rush and Tim Ryan to formally censure King's have yet to see floor action.
If he were censured, King would be forced to stand in front of the House and listen to the full censure resolution against him read aloud as a way for Congress to formally show its disapproval of his conduct. A censure would not remove or limit King's power as a representative.
Congress also has the ability to vote on King's expulsion, but that has not been proposed. But multiple Republicans, including Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called for King's resignation.
Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, repeated McConnell's advice for King on Tuesday: "I think that he should find another line of work."
If King were to resign from office, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds would appoint someone to fill the seat. King has made no moves toward resigning and called his committee removals an "Unprecedented Assault on my Freedom of Speech" on Twitter Monday night.
There are election challenges coming for King. State Sen. Randy Feenstra, who helped lead an effort last year to approve massive tax cuts in Iowa, and Bret Richards, an Irwin native announced they will seek the GOP nomination for the 4th District seat.

Opinion: Lakers firing Luke Walton would be totally unfair - but that won't save him

Texto completo: LeBron James still being out injured sure as heck doesn’t stop the NBA universe from talking about LeBron James, and it doesn’t stop the chatter and speculation about his supporting actors in the ever-entertaining Los Angeles Lakers soap opera either.
The latest plot twist to come out of the Staples Center is a potential cliffhanger involving head coach Luke Walton, who, not for the first time this season, finds his seat of employment trending on the toasty side.
Tuesday night’s victory over the Chicago Bulls might have prevented Walton from being given his marching orders by front office duo Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka (general manager), or it might have stopped owner Jeannie Buss from stepping in to veto his firing, depending on which reports you read.
Regardless, let’s be clear on this. Sacking Walton would be completely unfair, preposterously hasty and totally out of touch with the reality of what he has had to contend with this season.
More columns: Read commentary from columnist Martin Rogers
But here’s the thing. Not one of those factors will matter when it comes to the ultimate decision on his removal.
Johnson, the Lakers' president of basketball operations, cares nothing for what others think is fair, or in forgiving a few tough breaks. As you might expect from someone with such a storied resume in basketball and a burgeoning one in business, he cares about winning. Not the kind of 50-32 winning that plenty of teams would be satisfied with, but the kind that nets you a chunky piece of jewelry at the end of it.
For her part, Buss, who according to the New York Times would balk at attempts to get rid of Walton in the immediate term, wouldn’t be doing so because he’s a nice guy with a dry sense of humor that makes you want to root for him. She’d be doing so because she expected things to get better, and because the disruption of letting the coach go mid-season could be counter-productive.

Either way, the reality is that Walton will get canned eventually if the Lakers’ slide continues. As intriguing as things have been in L. A. since James’ arrival, the outlook for more drama is stronger than the prognosis for a sudden surge in productivity. There have been some positive signs, but plenty of troubling ones, too, including inconsistency and continued clumsy mistakes from young players.
Beating the woeful Bulls 107-100 took the Lakers’ record to 4-7 since James tweaked his groin during an impressive Christmas Day triumph over the Golden State Warriors.
Yet the visuals have been largely miserable: the games came against teams with a combined record of 181-240, and seven of the 11 were at home. The low point was a Sunday setback against Cleveland that allowed the Cavaliers to arrest a league-worst 12-game losing skid.
In Lakerland, fans have gotten worried, with a drop in optimism palpable at recent games. Even the Chicago win turned from being a comfortable stroll into a late nail-biter thanks to some careless lapses, not to mention the cardinal sin of costing the crowd free tacos in a promotional offer when Ivica Zubac committed a pointless foul with a second left and allowed the Bulls to reach 100 points.
“We had to find out a way to scrap out a win, and we did it,” Walton said afterward, in as friendly a spin as he could manage.
To keep Johnson off his case, Walton had to do one of two things. He either had to make the Lakers excellent with James or he had to improve the inexperienced core in a way more obvious than what most people expected.
Either outcome would have raised hopes of a future title tilt, assuming a big free agent comes to play in the summer. Neither has really happened, not with any regularity.
Walton doesn’t get quizzed hard by the L. A. media, which is almost as soft on him as it is on James, but don’t expect Johnson to share any of that reticence.
Meanwhile, Walton seems to have retained plenty of support in the locker room. “Luke has done a great job handling all the adversity we have been through,” Kyle Kuzma said.
“It’s a tough job,” Kuzma added, and he’s right, perhaps one of the hardest in the league.
Walton has done a decent job in a grueling spot, a better one it could be argued than plenty of coaches whose positions are not coming under any kind of scrutiny.
Yet this is Los Angeles, it is the Lakers, and it is the LeBron James Show, where higher standards are expected and different rules apply.
With visits to Oklahoma City and Houston to come, followed by a home tilt against the Warriors, and the schedule on James’ return still not concrete, these are challenging times – and time is a luxury that Walton doesn’t have.

FBI investigation is an affront to our political order

Texto completo: The FBI took it upon itself to determine whether the president of the United States is a threat to national security.
No one had ever before thought that this was an appropriate role for the FBI, a subordinate agency in the executive branch, but Donald Trump isn't the only one in Washington trampling norms.
The New York Times reported the astonishing news. "Counterintelligence investigators," the paper writes, "had to consider whether the president's own actions constituted a possible threat to national security." U.S. presidents over the decades have made many foolhardy decisions that have undermined our security; never before have they been deemed a fit subject for an FBI investigation.
The proximate cause for the probe into Trump was his firing of FBI Director James Comey, which the FBI considered both a potential crime and a national-security matter because it might shut down the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.
Even if they were shocked by the treatment of Comey, top FBI officials should have been able to quickly ascertain that the Russia investigation continued unimpeded — indeed, it is still ongoing today.
If the Times reporting is correct, the FBI grew more suspicious of Trump's conduct based on comments that have been widely misunderstood. Among the bill of particulars:
During the campaign, he urged the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Trump clearly meant this line sardonically, though.
The GOP platform allegedly was softened toward Russia. Never mind that, as Byron York of the Washington Examiner has demonstrated, this didn't actually happen.
And in his Lester Holt interview after the Comey firing, Trump said that "this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story." The president added, it's worth noting, that he knew firing Comey probably extended the investigation rather than shortened it.
More legitimately, agents were disturbed by Trump's continual praise for Vladimir Putin. These comments were blameworthy, but not a federal offense.
The Times implies that foreign policy played into the FBI internal debate over whether to investigate Trump.
"Many involved in the case," the paper reports, "viewed Russia as the chief threat to American democratic values." That is an entirely defensible and perhaps correct view (China is the other candidate for the dubious distinction). But there is no warrant for the FBI letting it influence the momentous decision whether to investigate a president of the United States.
As part of the executive branch, the FBI should brush up on the powers of the chief executive. The president gets to fire subordinate executive-branch officials. He gets to meet with and talk to foreign leaders. He gets to make policy toward foreign nations. Especially important to the current investigation, he gets to say foolish, ill-informed, and destructive things.
If the president wants to tilt toward Russia (not that Trump really has, except in his words), he can. If he wants to butter up China's dictatorial president during high-stakes trade negotiations, he can. If he wants to announce a precipitous withdrawal from Syria and make it slightly less precipitous in a fog of confusion, he can.
And the FBI should have nothing to say about it.
The Times story is another sign that we have forgotten the role of our respective branches of government. It is Congress that exists to check and investigate the president, not the FBI. Congress can inveigh against his foreign policy and constrain his options. It can build a case for not reelecting him and perhaps impeach him. These are all actions to be undertaken out in the open by politically accountable players, so the public can make informed judgments about them.
Perhaps the Times report is exaggerated, or the FBI has serious evidence of a criminally corrupt quid pro quo between Trump and Moscow that there's no public indication of yet.
Otherwise, the Times story is a damning account of an offense against our political order, and not by Donald Trump.

Texto completo: Before we get to the question of whether the president of the United States is a Russian asset, let's consider another question: When was the last time a popular and contentious conspiracy theory turned out to be true? Not a little true, but, like, really true?
It does happen. Whittaker Chambers was right about Alger Hiss being a Soviet spy. The government really did put poison in legal alcohol during Prohibition.
But even when conspiracy theorists earn the right to say "We told you so," the actual reality often falls short of the mark. The motives of the conspirators aren't as sinister as claimed, or the plot is better explained by incompetence than malevolence, or the scope of the conspiracy itself isn't nearly as vast as suspected.
This has always been my problem with the most extreme versions of the Russian collusion theories.
I have a similar problem with the Deep State theories that have bounced around the Trumpian right: President Trump's problems are all the result of the fiendish doings of a vast "globalist" conspiracy.
"The central premise," Infowars nutter Jerome Corsi writes in his book "Killing the Deep State," "is that President Trump is the target of a coup d'etat being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order." The Deep State hates Trump, the argument goes, because his victory meant it could no longer "continue running the international drug trade while supporting the military-industrial complex in a policy of perpetual war."
Obviously, most sane people on either side of the Trumpian divide reject the cartoonish versions of their own positions. But similarities endure.
Pattern recognition is one of humanity's great evolutionary advantages. It is the foundation for trial and error, the scientific method and reason itself. But it can also mislead us. Most conspiracy theories involve motivated reasoning in which we deduce backward from a result.
The people who insist that Trump colluded with Russia start with the explanation and then pluck facts to fit. But, as Trump defenders and even Trump himself will quickly note, there are many contrary facts as well. His energy policies, for example, are deeply contrary to Russia's interests.
The bombshell New York Times report that the FBI opened an investigation into whether Trump was a Russian asset strikes me as simultaneously understandable and outrageous.
Trump's disastrous hiring of actual Kremlin stooges and cronies, his praise of Putin, his lies about business dealings with Russia, his public beseeching of the Kremlin to release Clinton's emails, his campaign's infamous meeting at Trump Tower with an actual Russian agent, not to mention his firing of the FBI director and his comments to Russian officials in the Oval Office: One doesn't even need to resort to Deep State theories to understand why the FBI would be concerned.
But that doesn't necessarily make Trump a Manchurian president, either.
Jeb Bush was right when he predicted in 2015 that "chaos candidate" Trump would be a "chaos president." The Atlantic just published a list, "Unthinkable: 50 Moments that Define an Improbable Presidency," and what comes through most is that Trump's glandular, impulsive and often vindictive character is the only reliable signal in the noise that is his presidency. Any theory that doesn't take this into account is not likely to pan out.

Byron York: FBI interview makes big news — so why is it still secret?

Texto completo: James Baker — the general counsel of the FBI during both the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations — sat for two interviews with House investigators last October. After the sessions — one on Oct. 3, the other Oct. 18 — Republican Rep. Mark Meadows called parts of Baker's testimony "explosive."

Republicans intended to make the interview transcripts public. The questioning was not conducted in a classified setting, and Baker had FBI and other lawyers with him the whole time. But the House still had to send the transcripts to the FBI for clearance, just to make sure public release would not reveal any classified or otherwise secret information.

If Republicans hoped for a quick OK from the bureau, they were sorely disappointed. October passed. Then November. Then December. And now, half of January. The FBI still has the transcripts, and there is no word on when the bureau will clear them for release.

But now, the Baker transcripts are making news, even as they sit on FBI desks. Two major news stories in the past few days have been based in whole or in part on what Baker told lawmakers. Some news organizations appear to have read the transcripts, or at least significant portions of them, or had them read to reporters by someone with access. Suddenly, the Baker transcripts are hot.

The most recent of the stories broke Tuesday. In a letter to Justice Department prosecutors, Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan, now ranking minority on the House Judiciary Committee, revealed that Baker is the subject of a criminal leak investigation. It wasn't clear from the letter what the leak was -- it appeared to be dossier-related, and in the interviews the two sides discussed Baker's interactions with Mother Jones journalist David Corn, but it was not clear from the letter what, precisely, the leak involved.

To tell the story, Jordan and Meadows included tantalizing bits of the still-secret Baker transcripts. The excerpt began with Daniel Levin, Baker's lawyer, cutting off House investigators as they tried to question Baker.

"You may or may not know, he's the subject of a leak investigation which is still -- a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department," Levin said.

It turned out the lawmakers did not know.

"You're saying he's under criminal investigation?" said Meadows. "That's why you're not letting him answer?"

"Yes," said Levin.

Levin told lawmakers that John Durham, the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, is conducting the investigation. It is not clear why Durham is handling the case, or whether it has anything to do with Connecticut, or whether Durham has a special assignment. But that's what is happening.

Jordan noted that Baker had just moments earlier discussed his interactions with Corn. No more, said Levin. "Well, he's talked a little bit about it, but I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters," Levin told Jordan.

Jordan pressed. "So he talked to me only about what Mr. Corn may have given him via information or actual documents or recordings or anything else, but he's not allowed to talk to me about information he may have given Mr. Corn himself?"

"That's right," said Levin.

The Baker excerpt, revealing the criminal investigation, is a new and important part of the story of the FBI's handling of the Trump-Russia investigation. Release of the full transcripts could shed new light on the FBI's use of the Trump dossier in the Russia probe. But they remain secret -- and it is the FBI that has the final word on whether and when to allow the release of information that is unflattering to the FBI.

The second big story that came in part from the Baker transcript was the New York Times piece last Friday headlined, "FBI Opened Inquiry Into Whether Trump Was Secretly Working on Behalf of Russia."

The story caused intense excitement in anti-Trump circles. "Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president's own actions constituted a possible threat to national security," the Times reported. "Agents also sought to determine whether Mr. Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence."

In the piece, the bureau's reasoning was explained by references to...the secret Baker transcripts. The paper said Baker told lawmakers that the FBI viewed President Trump's firing of director James Comey as a national security issue. "Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security," Baker said in the still-secret testimony, according to the Times. The paper said portions of the testimony "were read to The New York Times."

Not long after, CNN published an article, "Transcripts detail how FBI debated whether Trump was 'following directions' of Russia." CNN quoted significant portions of the Baker transcripts, in which Baker said the FBI wanted to know if Trump "was acting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing [Russia's] will."

"That was one extreme. The other extreme is that the president is completely innocent, and we discussed that too," Baker said in the secret transcripts, according to CNN. "There's a range of things this could possibly be. We need to investigate, because we don't know whether, you know, the worst-case scenario is possibly true or the president is totally innocent and we need to get this thing over with -- and so he can move forward with his agenda."

CNN said only that it had "obtained" the transcripts.

So the Baker transcripts have made a lot of news. They might have other news in them, or they might provide important context, but the public doesn't know what that might be. So far, the public has had to depend on what portions of the transcripts that CNN, the New York Times, and Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows find newsworthy. And all because the FBI has decided to keep its secret secret for as long as it can.

Republicans suspect they are being slow-walked as the FBI tries to protect its image. "Unfortunately, the delay may relate to a lack of eagerness by the FBI to confirm yet another investigation into official misconduct, or perhaps criminal behavior, by another one of the FBI's top officials," Rep. John Ratcliffe, a key investigator, said in a text exchange.

GOP lawmakers spent two years in a frustrating attempt to pull information out of the FBI as the House probed important aspects of the Trump-Russia investigation. And that was when Republicans were in the majority. Now, with the GOP in the minority, it has little clout to push the FBI to reveal secrets it should have revealed by now.

Liz Cheney: Steve King 'should find another line of work'

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, should seek other employment, according to House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney.

"I agree with Leader McConnell actually. I think he should find another line of work," Cheney, Wyo., told reporters Tuesday at a press conference, echoing comments the prior day by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "I think that we've been very clear. I think it was [a] very significant and serious step to remove him from committees. And I think that you've seen [this] now repeated, this wasn't the first time."

Cheney, the number three-ranked House Republican leader, added about King, "His language questioning whether or not the notion of white supremacy is offensive is absolutely abhorrent, it's racist, we do not support it or agree with it. And as I said, I think he should find another line of work."

Cheney's comments come after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Calif., and other House Republicans voted to strip King of his committee assignments. King slammed McCarthy's move Monday as “a political decision that ignores the truth."

The backlash against King was prompted by an interview he gave last week to The New York Times.

“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? ... Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?" King said, according to the newspaper.

King asserted Monday that he was only referring to Western civilization, not “any previously stated evil ideology.” King also indicated he intends to continue representing Iowa's 4th Congressional District for the rest of his two-year term.

Two House Democrats announced plans Monday to introduce censure measures against King. The resolution brought forward by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., cited King's 12-year history of making inflammatory statements.

TRUMP TOUTS ELECTRIC CAR DEAL IN TENNESSEE AS VW FACES NEW FINES: President Trump congratulated Tennessee on Tuesday for being Volkswagen’s choice to open its first $800 million electric vehicle manufacturing plant in North America.


Trump called the news a “big win” for Chattanooga Tuesday morning.

VW has also been under pressure from the Trump administration to increase its investments in the U.S.


The electric vehicle plan was agreed to after considering adding new production runs for luxury Audi cars in Chattanooga, VW CEO Herbert Deiss explained on Monday. But that idea was scrapped to build EVs at the plant in Tennessee, beginning in 2022.


VW announced the news on Monday at the Detroit Auto Show.


U.S. carmaker Ford announced Tuesday that it is forming an alliance with VW to build and market its mid-size trucks and vans globally. The effort will begin in 2022.


Bad news from the subcontinent: But alongside the company’s good news, the company suffered a blow in India. A special “green” panel established in the country last year is recommending fines against VW for allegations it installed emission cheating software in makes of vehicles sold in the country.


The Indian green commission was set up in 2018 in the wake of allegations stemming from U.S. regulators in 2015 that the company intentionally installed defeat device to make it easier for its diesel cars to comply with environmental rules.


VW said Tuesday that it rejects the Indian panel’s findings. The panel is recommending $24 million in fines against the company. VW has paid billions of dollars in fines, penalties, and restitution in the U.S.

GREEN NEW DEAL EXPOSES RIFTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY: Transforming the so-called "Green New Deal" from broad concept to legislative language will be a major challenge for the Democratic Party.


The proposal, backed by freshman media sensation Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., has excited progressives, who have longed for major federal action to combat climate change.


But it has also exposed fissures between establishment Democrats and new progressives over turf, ambition, and process.


What’s in the deal? Its core tenets are requiring the country to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 and making massive public investments in clean energy infrastructure on things such as light rail, electric vehicle charging stations, and weatherized buildings.


The plan also would guarantee a job to anybody who wants to work in the clean-energy transition, make every residential and industrial building more energy efficient, and build a national “smart” grid to better incorporate wind and solar power.


“Now it’s the job of Congress to come up with policies and be concrete and precise about what that means,” Rep. Ro Khanna , D-Calif., told Josh.


As an example of how aspects of the Green New Deal could become policy, Khanna said he plans to introduce a bill that expands the EV tax credit and links it to a requirement for automakers to build their electric cars in the U.S.


How about carbon pricing? One big question climate advocates have is what role carbon pricing has in the Green New Deal.


Progressives say they are not dismissing it, but view carbon pricing as a "tiny part" of a bigger policy.


"The debate over carbon pricing to me isn’t all that interesting,” Saikat Chakrabarti , Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, told Josh.


Read more of Josh’s story in this week’s Washington Examiner magazine.


NO ‘NEW WAIVERS’ FROM IRAN SANCTIONS, TRUMP OFFICIAL SAYS: A senior Trump administration official said Monday that it does not intend to grant any new sanctions waivers for countries that buy Iranian oil.


“We are not looking to grant any new waivers — that’s been our policy from the beginning,” Brian Hook , the State Department’s special representative for Iran, told Bloomberg. “We’ve been able to achieve a lot of economic pressure on Iran. We want to deny the Iranian regime the revenue that it uses to destabilize the Middle East.”


Eighty percent of Iran’s revenues come from oil exports, Hook added.


Hook said that of the eight countries that secured exemptions to continue buying oil from Iran, only five are still making purchases. He said U.S. sanctions have cut Iran’s exports to about 1 million barrels a day from 2.7 million.


How we got here: After promising a zero-tolerance approach to cutting off oil supplied from Iran, the Trump administration blinked at the prospect of higher oil and gas prices, and granted exemptions in November, to countries including China, India, South Korea, and others.


The exemptions contributed to the recent fall in oil prices, as less crude came off the market than expected.


RYAN ZINKE LANDS JOB AT INVESTMENT COMPANY: Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has landed his first job since leaving the Trump administration, becoming managing director of the investment company, Artillery One.


In his new job, Zinke will pursue investing and development opportunities in energy, technology,  and cybersecurity, the North Carolina-based company said in a statement Monday.


Zinke told the Associated Press that he’s “glad to be out of the swamp” and working in the private sector.


He resigned from the Interior Department last month after facing probes into whether he used his position for personal gain.


ETHANOL INDUSTRY LAUNCHES NATIONAL E15 CAMPAIGN AFTER TRUMP’S SPEECH: The ethanol industry launched a national campaign Tuesday morning to proclaim the benefits of 15-percent ethanol fuel blends, after Trump addressed farmers Monday touting his support for the fuel.


“We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15,” Trump said in a speech before the American Farm Bureau Federation's 100th annual convention. “And we're making it available year round — all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers.”


Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler is working on a rule that would repeal restrictions on 15-percent ethanol fuels, or E15, year-round. The regulation is not finished, but is being promised by the time the summer driving season begins in June. The high-concentration ethanol fuel is banned from use during the summer months because of its high volatility. But an EPA waiver could end that.


The Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry’s top lobbying group, kicked off a campaign on the benefits of year-round E15 Tuesday morning with digital ads on The Washington Post website and the launch of a new  consumer education internet portal on E15.


Wheeler goes before the Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday where the waiver is expected to come up. Wheeler was nominated this month to be the new EPA administrator, where he currently serves as acting chief after the agency’s former head resigned after numerous scandals.


TRUMP SIGNS NEW NUCLEAR BILL INTO LAW: Trump signed a new bill Monday night into law to drive nuclear energy innovation at the federal level, while making federal nuclear regulators more accountable for their budget.


The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act would provide greater transparency to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s budget, which has been the focus of the GOP in recent years. On the Democratic side of the ledger, the bill would position the nation’s nuclear regulatory to be more inclined to permit advanced reactor technology, which will be required to lower emissions and fight climate change.


“The law will bring greater transparency and accountability to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s spending,” said Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wy., the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that oversees the NRC.


The committee’s ranking Democrat, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, recognized the climate benefits of signing the bill into law.


“Nuclear power serves as our nation’s largest source of reliable, carbon-free energy, which can help combat the negative impacts of climate change and at the same time, foster economic opportunities for Americans,” Carper said.

Texto completo: What happens when immense bigotry gets lodged in a small mind? Rep. Steve King, Republican of Iowa, is what happens.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" It is a question that could only be posed by a bigot. And because it was a rhetorical question, King was assuming that all the rest of us — all right-thinking people — are bigots as well. Shouldn’t the tie between whiteness and civilization be obvious?
As a reminder, white nationalism and supremacy — the ideology shared by Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and, evidently, Steve King — became offensive because of centuries of stolen labor, murder and cruel abuse; because of a bloody war that one side conducted on behalf of slavery; because of repeating waves of anti-immigrant prejudice, alarmism and discrimination; because of routine lynchings and the stinging viciousness of segregation; because of the assumption that robbed, exploited and oppressed people somehow deserve social challenges resulting from robbery, exploitation and oppression.
For King, this was not a slip of the tongue, but the development of a theme. "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies," King has argued. Those babies eventually grow up to be, in King’s words, migrant kids with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." This is threatening because "diversity is not our strength." In fact, it is "cultural suicide by demographic transformation."
Many elected Republicans in Washington have been forthright in their criticism of King after his latest offense. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King’s remarks "reckless" and "wrong." Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, said King’s argument was "abhorrent and racist." To Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, it was "offensive and racist." To Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, it was "an embrace of racism."
McCarthy has (vaguely) promised that disciplinary "action will be taken." If King is not at least censured, it will mean the House has no standards at all. And this, unfortunately, would be no surprise at all.
In their criticism of King, you get the sense that Republicans are actually relieved to be in the position of attacking racism for a change, instead of being forced to defend it from the president. They seem to be signaling that they are not really the bigots that they appear to be. Republicans seem desperate to explain that they are normal and moral, in spite of all the evidence. Attacking King reveals some sense of shame at what they have become.
Yet, in the end, Republican critics of King manage to look worse rather than better. If racism is the problem, then President Donald Trump is a worse offender. And their relative silence on Trump is a sign of hypocrisy and weakness.
Take the last days before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump closed his campaign for Republicans with a hysterical warning that brown people were invading the country. He initially suggested they should be shot. He added that he "wouldn’t be surprised" if Soros was funding the migrant caravan. This is clearly what he regards as his strongest political argument — the racist promotion of animus against outsiders, tied to pernicious conspiracy theories.
Trump feeds ethnic stereotypes of migrants as "rapists" and "murderers." He makes apocalyptic warnings that Democratic control would "turn America into Venezuela" and "totally open borders." And his supporters dismiss criticism against him as a personality thing. Add to this Trump’s attribution of Kenyan citizenship to Barack Obama. And his sympathy for the "very fine people" attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. And his attacks on African-American athletes and other figures. And his pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for racial profiling, terror raids and cruel punishment of inmates. And his attempts at a Muslim ban. And his contempt for "(expletive) countries." And ... a list far longer than I can include.
By any standard, Trump says things that are reckless, wrong, abhorrent, offensive and racist. And until Republicans can state this reality with the same clarity and intensity that they now criticize King, they will be cowards in a time crying for bravery.

Texto completo: Shopping for a new phone on AT&T's website, you might come across a feature tab labeled "5G Evolution. "
Don't be fooled. This isn't actual 5G but rather AT&T's marketing department at work.
While the rest of the wireless industry gears up for next generation 5G wireless networks, AT&T has gone ahead and rebranded some of its latest 4G LTE phones. The goal: To convince people that these phones, which includes a number of recent iPhones, Galaxys and LG devices, are similar to the 5G devices due to arrive in the coming weeks and months.
AT&T is even updating the icons on some of its existing Android phones to feature a "5G E" logo.
Hate to break it to you, but your existing iPhone 8, iPhone XR, Galaxy S9 or LG V30 did not magically gain 5G capabilities. They will work the same as they did before, connecting to AT&T's updated 4G LTE network.
Actual 5G phones will need to have the proper chips inside to connect to the new networks, something current devices lack. Samsung, LG and OnePlus have all said they will release 5G phones this year, with AT&T announcing it will have two 5G Samsung phones in 2019.
These 5G devices will be able to take advantage of 5G's improvements, including its faster speeds and more responsive performance. While current 4G LTE phones will still work fine over the next few years, calling them a form of 5G is misleading. (Making things more confusing: AT&T plans for two different versions of 5G, one called 5G and another 5G+).
On its website, AT&T justifies the marketing by saying that they've "made changes that are already bringing faster speeds to the latest devices on our LTE network. "
More: Tech in 2019: 5G, AI, 8K – the year ahead looks like an alphabet soup of progress
More: AT&T turns on its mobile 5G network on Dec. 21, starting with 12 cities and mobile hotspot
More: You’re going to love 5G, but there are a few things you need to know first
Not the first time
This isn't the first time AT&T, or the wireless industry, has tried to blur the lines when it comes to new technology.
Before T-Mobile launched its LTE network, it rebranded its improved 3G network, known as HSPA+, as "4G" in 2010 to tap into the excitement around 4G and keep itself competitive in the public eye with the 4G networks being launched by its rivals.
The move ironically angered AT&T at the time, though the company soon rebranded its own HSPA+ network as "4G," changing the designation for its improved 3G network as it worked to launch LTE in 2011.
This switch is also why AT&T and T-Mobile iPhones today show "4G" when not connected to their respective LTE networks.
Verizon and T-Mobile have both taken advantage of AT&T's latest marketing ploy to get in a few digs at their shared rival.
In a tweet, T-Mobile replaced the LTE logo on an iPhone with a "9G" sticker, adding, "didn’t realize it was this easy, brb updating. "
Verizon, meanwhile, took out full-page ads in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and USA TODAY Tuesday to seemingly address AT&T's recent moves.
"The potential for 5G is awesome, but the potential to over-hype and under-deliver on the 5G promise is a temptation that the wireless industry must resist," Kyle Malady, Verizon's chief technology officer, writes in the ad. Confusing terms "risk alienating the very people we want most to join in developing and harnessing this exciting new technology. "
"Verizon is making this commitment today: We won’t take an old phone and just change the software to turn the 4 in the status bar into a 5. We will not call our 4G network a 5G network if customers don’t experience a performance or capability upgrade that only 5G can deliver. "

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has certainly surrounded himself with plenty of incompetent and ethically challenged people. But in William Barr, he has nominated someone with a track record of integrity and experience to be the next attorney general.
Such a person is badly needed at the Justice Department. Not only has Trump repeatedly debased law enforcement, his actions also have left many Americans thinking the unthinkable — that the president not only benefited from Russia's interference in the 2016 election but also is somehow beholden to its government.
No less than the FBI has entertained this thought. The New York Times reported Friday that the FBI started a counterintelligence inquiry in 2017 into whether Trump was — gulp! — acting as an agent of the Russian government.
The outcome of that inquiry is unknown, and Trump denied on Monday that he ever worked on Russia's behalf. But he has given Americans plenty of reason for suspicion, including his odd obsequiousness toward Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, his confiscation of notes and records from his meetings with Putin, his real estate dealings with Russians, and his decision to pull U. S. troops out of Syria, leaving a vacuum for Russia and others to fill.
It is into this troubling context that Barr now drops as Trump's pick to become the nation’s top law enforcement official and overseer of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia inquiry. This would be Barr's second stint as attorney general, a position he ably held during the administration of President George H. W. Bush.
At the very least, Barr would represent a huge upgrade over acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is wholly ill-suited for the job.
At the Senate confirmation hearings that begin Tuesday, Barr's first imperative must be an unequivocal defense of Mueller, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former FBI director whom Trump has attacked incessantly.
Barr states in prepared testimony that Mueller should be given a chance to finish his report, and that the report should be made public. This is a good start but is not sufficient. Mueller might plan further legal actions such as subpoenas, indictments and plea agreements. Barr needs to pledge that he would not interfere with those. He also needs to make abundantly clear that he would not fire Mueller.
Beyond these things, Barr needs to explain recent statements and writings defending the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and criticizing Mueller on the grounds that members of the special counsel's team made political contributions to Hillary Clinton.
While some Democrats have urged that his nomination be withdrawn, this is too extreme. Barr has done nothing to disqualify himself and deserves a chance to make his case.

Polling data is the real holy grail of political campaigns

Texto completo: The goal of advertising, like politics, is to persuade someone somewhere to buy something, whether it's a product or a candidate.
It's not a coincidence that we both call our persuasive pitches the same thing: a campaign. And at the heart of every campaign is data about markets, the competition and, most of all, the potential customers.
When Paul Manafort allegedly shared "polling data" with Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a Russian businessman and former military interpreter who the FBI says has "ties to a Russian intelligence service," many Americans may have shrugged and thought "so what?"
To them, polling data is the result of simple surveys that tell us "52 percent of people favor Candidate A," or "72 percent of Democrats oppose Policy B." It's not. It's far more detailed, and the way advertisers and political campaigns use it has serious consequences.
Polling data is the same contextual business intelligence that big brands use in their marketing activities, including advertising. It's the raw material we use in the battle to win hearts and minds, and to get people to choose one product or service over another - to vote with their wallets.
If advertisers - and political campaigns - want to persuade you, first they need to really get to know you. For this purpose, marketing departments at big companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars and employ thousands of people in pursuit of data: generating it, managing it, and developing insights and implications from it.
It's very expensive, labor-intensive and takes a lot of time. Anyone who works for a major company knows that big data is the business battle of our time, and data and analytics operations are mission-critical to a company's profitability and survival. Data is one of the most valuable resources a company has. It's also one of its most guarded secrets.
The sort of data Manafort shared may have comprised the same types of information that advertisers covet when trying to persuade consumers to buy products. Polling data generally starts with simple demographic information about people, including age, gender, race, household income, education level and geographic location.
But those data sets can be cross-referenced with more nuanced - and more valuable - information from other sources, including media-consumption patterns, affinity group affiliations and which consumer segments Americans belong to.
Much of that kind of information is fished from the same stream that's under heavy scrutiny for dubious privacy practices, including data collected from unknowing consumers with every Facebook like and YouTube view, every mobile location-based GPS cellphone ping, and every cookied website visit. We've seen just how devious companies can be when casting their nets into these waters.
Cambridge Analytica manipulated the Facebook platform with a fake app that it used to harvest personal data from up to 87 million users. Each of these individuals became a data stream of actions they took on Facebook: what they liked, watched, shared and bought.
In the political context, this created highly detailed profiles of voters with whom a campaign could speak in their language and according to their interests, their fears, their behaviors and their values.
As we learn in fits and starts in our digital age, the data that's collected on us and from us - the type of data that constitutes polling data - is more detailed, more nuanced and often more invasive than we really know.
We don't yet know why Manafort allegedly shared this polling data. As The New York Times reported, "He might have hoped that any proof he was managing a winning candidate would help him collect money he claimed to be owed for his work on behalf of the Ukrainian parties."
But it's a mistake to treat polling data as mere briefing material; it's actionable information. Those of us in advertising use it to decide who to target; to position the brands we represent as distinctive from other brands; to develop messaging and ads; and to knock competitors out of their positions in consumers' minds.
We've known since 2017 that the Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential election did the same thing - aiming different posts at people who indicated that they "liked" patriotism or lived in Ferguson, Mo.
Passing on this kind of information gives a partner the ability to reach audiences in a very personalized way. And if that partner is a foreign country intent on influencing voters, exploiting divisions and disrupting elections, the data is priceless.
It gives them the tools to get pretty close to the holy grail of marketing: to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right message.

Texto completo: Six award-winning and best-selling authors will travel to Des Moines this spring as part of the Des Moines Public Library's AViD author series in 2019.
The series, dubbed Authors Visiting in Des Moines, began in 2001 as a way to bring local and nationally-renowned authors to Des Moines.
"The idea was to provide our patrons with a way to see these national, accomplished authors for free without reservations or tickets," said Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library spokesman. "They can hear from these people on a more personal level."
The AViD series is funded by the library foundation and lasts throughout the spring. Each talk and book signing is scheduled for weeknights at 7 p.m. and attracts about 200-300 attendees.
"That's so (audience members) can just stop in without losing their weekend plans," Paluch said. "It expands horizons for some of our readers, and gives everyone a chance to see some accomplished literary icons."
For the 2019 lineup, organizers have taken special care to select authors who have written about topics relevant to current local and national issues such as economic inequality in the Midwest, Paluch said.
"This year's lineup is very exciting and interesting," Paluch said. "We have authors writing about raising a transgender child. C.J. Chivers wrote about the fighters and the effects of war on the combatants on the ground. We find not just good books, but books that provide engaging discussion and are relevant to Central Iowans and everybody."
Another author to note is Chigozie Obioma, a Nigerian-American, who wrote the acclaimed novel "The Fishermen." Obioma's latest book, "An Orchestra of Minorities," is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" and is set to release Jan. 8.
"Some might not know his name yet, but they're going to be seeing him in coming months," Paluch said.
Susan Orlean, author of "The Library Book" and "The Orchid Thief," will be the first author to visit Des Moines during the 2019 AViD series. AViD is sponsoring Orlean at the DSM Book Festival at 4 p.m. on March 30.
The other events will take place at the Des Moines Public Library Central Library at 7 p.m.
AViD series lineup:
March 30: Susan Orlean at the DSM Book Festival. She is the author of the critically-acclaimed 2018 best-seller "The Library Book," a love letter to libraries that doubles as a true crime exploration of the unsolved 1986 fire that damaged the Los Angeles Public Library. Orlean's 1998 nonfiction classic, "The Orchid Thief," was adapted into a feature film, "Adaptation."
April 18: Laurie Frankel. She's the author of the best-selling 2017 novel "This is How It Always Is," which tells the story of a family struggling with the challenges of raising a transgender child. The story is fiction, but the author is the mother of a transgender child herself. The book was chosen as a Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick in fall 2018.
April 22: Chigozie Obioma. The Nigerian-born author burst onto the literary scene in 2015 with his debut novel, "The Fishermen," which won multiple national and international awards — including an NAACP Image Award — and was a finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize. That same year he was named one of Foreign Policy's 100 Leading Global Thinkers. His much-anticipated second novel, "An Orchestra of Minorities" is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" written in the style of the Nigerian Igbo tradition.
May 2: Sarah Smarsh. Journalist, educator and author Sarah Smarsh's debut book, "Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth," was an instant best-seller upon release in 2018. It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize and National Book Award. Heartland was named one of the best books of 2018 by NPR, Amazon, Audible, Publisher's Weekly and more. The book examines America's historic economic inequality and tells the story of her upbringing among the working poor of rural Kansas.
May 16: Madeline Miller. Madeline Miller's 2018 novel, "Circe," was a New York Times No. 1 best-seller and appeared on dozens of "Best Books of 2018" lists, including NPR, People, The Washington Post, Time, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Book Riot and more. "Circe" was also named the Booklist 2018 Book of the Year. The novel, a retelling of the story of the villainous goddess Circe, recasts the infamous figure from "The Odyssey" into a feminist hero.
May 23: C.J. Chivers. Journalist C.J. Chivers is one of this generation's most revered war correspondents and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for The New York Times. His magazine story, "The Fighter," won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in feature writing. Chivers served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War. In 2018, he released "The Fighters," a vivid account of modern warfare told through the stories of a half-dozen American combatants serving in the Middle East conflicts. The book explores the growing disconnect between military leaders making decisions and the men and women on the ground facing the dangerous consequences of those decisions.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Democrats have scheduled a Tuesday vote on a resolution of disapproval of Rep. Steve King over the Iowa Republican's comments on white supremacy.
The decision to hold a vote came on the same night GOP leadership voted not to give committee assignments to King. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters the Republican steering committee voted unanimously not to assign King, who has been in Congress since 2003, to any positions on House committees.
“Steve’s remarks are beneath the dignity of the Party of Lincoln and the United States of America. His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity," McCarthy said. "House Republicans are clear: We are all in this together, as fellow citizens equal before God and the law. "
King was previously on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees and served as chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee.
Opinion: JD Scholten: Here's how I nearly beat Steve King and here's why he keeps winning. So far.

Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders are coalescing behind a vote of disapproval being considered by Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, the aide said.
"I rise today to address what I will call a tale of two kings. One, a member of this body, who wondered out loud to the New York Times why the terms white nationalism and white supremacy are offensive," Clyburn, who is black, will say on the House floor according to an excerpt of his remarks. "I would say to my colleague that the terms are offensive because the concepts are evil.
"I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in breaking the deafening silence and letting our resounding condemnation be heard. "
Earlier Monday, two House Democrats introduced resolutions to formally censure King, a stronger step than a vote of disapproval, although both are formal rebukes from the chamber.
Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. , and Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, both proposed censure resolutions.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?” King said in an interview with the New York Times last week. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
King has sought to tamp down the controversy over his comments about white supremacy, saying: "I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define. ”
In a statement on Monday, King vowed to stay in office, describing McCarthy's decision as an assault on his freedom of speech.
"Ultimately, I told him, ‘You have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do,'" King said. "I will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years. "
The resolution of disapproval is similar to the one passed in 2009 for Rep. Joe Wilson, also led by Clyburn. Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, had shouted “You lie!" at then-President Barack Obama during a speech in front of Congress. The following week the Democratic-controlled House passed a resolution of disapproval, largely on party-lines.
Rush said King has "become too comfortable with proudly insulting, disrespecting, and denigrating people of color. "
"As with any animal that is rabid, Steve King should be set aside and isolated,” Rush said in a statement Monday. Rush's censure resolution is "privileged" which means it must come to the floor either for a vote or be tabled by leadership.
Rush "firmly believes anything short of censure would be shallow," a statement from his office said.
A censure resolution would require that King go to the well of the House and listen as a statement of disapproval is read, while the resolution of disapproval would not.
Many of King's colleagues, including Republicans, have criticized his comments.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a scathing statement on Monday: "Rep. King’s statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn’t understand why ‘white supremacy’ is offensive, he should find another line of work. "
Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah called King's comments "reprehensible" and called on him to resign. King already faces Republican primary challengers, including state Sen. Randy Feenstra.
"These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse," Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the House GOP conference chair tweeted.
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S. C. , the only black Republican in the Senate, wrote a Washington Post op-ed titled: "Why are Republicans accused of racism? Because we’re silent on things like this. "
King has made other comments that have stirred outrage. In 2013, King said Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who came to the U. S. as children, were involved in drug smuggling.
“For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” King told Newsmax in 2013.
He was abandoned by the House Republican campaign arm going into the 2018 election over alleged ties to white nationalist groups. He narrowly won his election in his deep red district.
On Monday morning, President Donald Trump said he was not familiar with comments from King.
"Who?" Trump asked after a reporter asked him about King's recent comments. After the question was reiterated, Trump responded, "I haven't been following. "

The sickness of white identity politics

Texto completo: The Republican Party is on the defensive after the latest inflammatory comments from Rep. Steve King, the controversial Republican congressman from Iowa. King, who has long fielded accusations of racism, all but embraced the label when he said an interview with The New York Times, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
While King has since tried to walk back those remarks, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has promised to take still-unspecified action to penalize King. But the King problem is not just a matter of one man prone to intemperate comments; it reflects recent trends of intellectual corruption in the GOP and in the conservative movement.
King, an anti-immigration crusader, has a history of vile rhetoric. Most notoriously, in 2017 he shared an article about nationalist Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who has demanded an end to Muslim immigration and a ban on the Quran, with the comment, "Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies." In response to accusations of promoting white supremacy, he asserted that he was talking about culture, not race - a defense that some conservative commentators, including Ben Shapiro, took at face value. After King's latest remarks, Shapiro conceded that he had been wrong to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Last year, King shared an anti-immigration tweet by British author Mark Collett, an unabashed Nazi sympathizer and Holocaust skeptic who deplores race-mixing and blames the Jews for slavery. When criticized for the retweet, King stood his ground. Several months later, he went to Europe on a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group and gave an interview to an Austrian far-right website founded by a former SS officer and run by a former neo-Nazi.
In November, at a meeting with voters while running for re-election, King joked about "dirt" coming from Mexico, in a conversation that started with a reference to importing soil for gardening but turned into an unmistakable attack on immigrants. When the now-defunct Weekly Standard published an account of the exchange, he accused the conservative magazine of lying - until the magazine posted an audio clip.
King was rebuked by fellow Republicans on prior occasions but never has been sanctioned. The fact that he won re-election does not speak well of the state of the party.
It is also hard to deny that King represents the same nativist strain of right-wing populism as the current occupant of the White House. Donald Trump, who appeared with King in Iowa in 2014 before launching his presidential campaign, has sometimes professed a belief in U.S. citizenship that transcends race; but he also has repeatedly denigrated immigrants from Third World countries. This is a stark contrast to the conservatism of Ronald Reagan, for whom the essence of America was the fact that anyone can come and become an American.
Just the other day, Trump tweeted a column by Pat Buchanan - whom he once called an anti-Semite and a racist - arguing that unless the border wall is built, "the United States, as we have known it, is going to cease to exist" because of the rise of ethnic, racial and cultural diversity.
Both King and Buchanan have accused the Democratic Party of hostility to white men. It is true that current progressive identity politics often promotes racial and ethnic division rather than integration. But this is no excuse for the embrace of nearly overt white nationalism by large segments of the right. Until Republicans repudiate white identity politics, the sickness will continue to spread.

New York Is Tough, She Is Tougher: 'I'm a Person Who Never Gives Up'

Texto completo: The first time Laurie Fleming visited New York City to see if it was the right fit, she knew she had to live here.
At the time, she was living in Columbus, Ohio, working in the county records office.
"Right after 9/11 I thought, what other place to be but New York?" she recalled. It was time for her to pursue her dreams of becoming a fashion designer.
When she left New York after that first visit, "I cried, it felt like I was leaving home," she recalled in an interview in the fall. "That's when I knew I was going to do it."
She saved up and made the move in late 2002. But things did not work out as she had hoped and her dreams of becoming a fashion designer had to pause.
Within months of arriving, she and her son wound up in a homeless shelter for nine months. Afterward, there was a bright period, when she found work at Chase Bank and an apartment in Bushwick. She had a second child, Symarrah, in 2008. After three years at Chase, she moved on to the communications department at the General Board of Global Ministries.
But in 2009, she was laid off. Others might wallow, but Ms. Fleming saw it as an opportunity to finally get back on the fashion track.
"It was a real tumultuous and emotional time, but I said, you know, I came to New York to go to fashion school, " she said. "I felt like that was that push to finally do it."
So she enrolled in Parsons School of Design part-time in 2010.
But by 2014, finances became too strained as she and her family faced eviction from their Bushwick apartment when the landlord wanted to sell and housing court costs added up, Ms. Fleming said.
"It was a do-or-die situation," said Ms. Fleming, who attended Parsons while raising her daughter, Symarrah, 10. Ms. Fleming decided she had to drop out of school, just one semester short of finishing. "It was devastating. I moved to New York, to be the first one graduating from college, and I'm right here -- that was my dream, it's still my dream. But now I need work."
Today, Ms. Fleming has $70,000 in student loans and still owes Parsons $8,000. Because she could not work while taking care of her daughter and attending school part-time, Ms. Fleming has been unemployed since 2009.
But she said she has never given up hope.
"I realize I'm a person who never gives up. I never quit," Ms. Fleming, 46, said in her apartment in the Mott Haven neighborhood in the Bronx, where she moved in 2016. "I'm very resilient."
New York ended up being a "totally different animal" than she anticipated. Between losing her jobs, dropping out of Parsons in 2014, and being a single mom, depression set in.
"I tried and had applications out up the wazoo. It gets daunting when you're trying and filling out applications and going to the interviews and getting turned down, having people telling you you're old and dealing with that," she said. "As a single mom, of course you're depressed because you're dealing with all of this and trying to keep above water."
Ms. Fleming was dropping her daughter off at dance school in May when she noticed a flier on the bulletin board for Grace Institute. The organization, based in Lower Manhattan, provides low-income women with job skills, counseling, placement services and continuing education. Ms. Fleming applied to the administrative training program.
She excelled.
"It was a life-changing experience to me, because they treated you as a woman and capable, and they showed you your strengths," Ms. Fleming said. "To be in that atmosphere and have people to treat you like you're equal, it's amazing."
In addition to graduating from the program in August, Ms. Fleming also served on the Grace Institute's participant advisory board, working as a liaison between students and staff members. She worked as an intern there until November. She is now interviewing for jobs.
"I thought my skills were lagging, after being out of work for nine years," Ms. Fleming said. "All the strides and different mountains and hurdles that I've dealt with -- hindsight is 20/20 -- but I crossed them."
Ms. Fleming and her daughter were sharing a bed with a broken frame and worn-out mattress and a dresser last year when Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $456 from the fund to buy them a new mattress and microwave.
Ms. Fleming receives $246 a month in public benefits and $300 a month in food stamps.
She is now "ready to conquer the world," Ms. Fleming said, emphasizing the last syllable. She hopes to do that with her daughter.
"I'm trying to live my dreams through her and live them together," Ms. Fleming said. "I want her to learn to be as resilient and persistent as I am."

Texto completo: President Trump on Monday asked why he would hurt Russia by expanding U.S. energy production if he was in cahoots with the Kremlin, as most Democrats suspect.

“‘Gas prices drop across the United States because President Trump has deregulated Energy and we are now producing a great deal more oil than ever before.’ @foxandfriends But this is bad news for Russia, why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin?” Trump wrote on Twitter Monday morning.

On Friday, the New York Times reported that the FBI opened an investigation into whether President Trump was working with Russia, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's team continues to press ahead with its investigation into whether Trump colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Prosecutors recently told a court that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, shared Trump's polling data with Ukrainian oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.

Democrats and intelligence officials say those documents show there was “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia.

McCarthy strips Steve King of committee assignments after white supremacist comments

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and House Republicans voted Monday night to strip Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, of all of committee assignments days after he openly wondered when "white supremacist" and "white nationalism" became offensive terms.

The Iowa Republican is slated to lose his post on the House Judiciary Committee, including his expected spot as the top Republican on the subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. He was also set to lose his spot on the House Agriculture Committee, a key position given the importance of farming to his home state, and the Small Business Committee.

The decision was handed down after McCarthy met with King Monday afternoon for an hour and a day after McCarthy promised in an interview that "action will be taken" in the aftermath of King's comments.

King declined to comment after the meeting with McCarthy.

King's comments came in an interview with The New York Times last week and were quickly denounced by top Republicans of all stripes, including McCarthy, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the House GOP Conference chair. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also lambasted King on Monday and indicated it’s time for him to exit politics.

Even usual supporters of King came down hard on him for the remarks. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had King serve as his Iowa chairman during the 2016 campaign, called the comments "stupid." President Trump said Monday that he was unfamiliar with what King said.

Two House Democrats also announced plans to introduce censure measures against the Iowa Republican. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., introduced his measure Monday by quoting a myriad of quotes by the GOP congressman and to combat his "rabid racism."

House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., added that he plans to support a reprimand of King on the floor, but not a censure because the comment was made to a reporter and not on the House floor.

Alexander: Still an uphill battle for Chargers in L.A.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

CAN WOMEN'S MARCH SURVIVE DIVISION?

Texto completo: When the story spread last month that charges of anti-Semitism were behind a split at the top of the national Women's March, chapter leaders and activists across the country were so shocked they wondered if it was fake news fabricated to discredit their movement.
It wasn't. One of the national march's original organizers, Vanessa Wruble, claimed she had been forced out after the group's co-founders treated her with hostility because of her Jewish heritage a charge the others insisted was not true.
"It went through my head, we don't need this now, but at the same time, I did want to know if this was a serious allegation," said Kristen Podulka, a Palo Alto activist who attended the first Women's March on Washington in 2017 protesting newly-elected President Donald Trump.
With local Women's March chapters across the Bay Area and beyond gearing up for the third annual march Saturday, the rift is roiling the ranks and frustrating feminists who fear it could derail their momentum: A record 117 women were elected to Congress in November, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is taking star turns in the Oval Office during showdowns with Trump, and a record number of women are considering runs at the White House.
But suddenly, the organizers of the Women's March in San Jose were inundated with inquiries from women who weren't sure they were comfortable to march this year.
"It fractures the women's movement, and it plays to stereotypes for sure," said Jenny Higgins Bradanini, the lead organizer of the Women's March San Jose who said her "stomach sunk" when she first read the stories about the accusations. "Unfortunately, I think it had a big impact for a while. We would receive email messages from women asking if we are supporting anti-Semitic remarks."
At least one chapter, in New Orleans, canceled its event. Chicago also canceled its march, blaming financial concerns and a lack of volunteers, but said the conflict made the decision easier. And in New York, where the national leaders broke apart, two marches will go forward Saturday, one ostensibly celebrating diversity and the other led by Wruble's new group, March On, denouncing anti-Semitism.
Adding another layer of intrigue was the announcement this month that the official march in Humboldt County where more than 70 percent of the population is white was canceled when organizers said the group's leadership was "too white."
The conflicts are especially sensitive to feminists who remember the downfall of the women's liberation movement of the 1970s, dominated by white women who were criticized for alienating minority women with other viewpoints.
"When we look back, by silencing people, by making it a professional white women's movement, that weakened the movement profoundly," said Doreen Mattingly, San Diego State University's chair of the women's studies department.
The causes of the recent schism among the Women's March co-leaders in New York were more nuanced than this headline in the conservative Washington Times: "Mean girls: Farrakhan's influence tarnishes Women's March leadership team," referring to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
Wruble, a Brooklyn activist, said her Jewish heritage played a role when she was ousted by co-leaders Tamika Mallory, an African-American gun control activist, and Carmen Perez, a Latina who advocates criminal justice reform. Wruble told The New York Times that Mallory and Perez confronted her at the first organizing meeting by insisting that Jews played a role in the slave trade something the women deny and made offensive comments about the privilege of wealthy Jews.
Mallory and Perez have both denounced anti-Semitism, created a list of "unity principles" for the organization and apologized for the way they handled the conflict. Still, it didn't help when Mallory attended an event with Farrakhan, a divisive figure who is admired for his role in rehabilitating black men in prison but who has made numerous anti-Semitic remarks and whose Nation of Islam is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
In Oakland, Alison Mata, director of the Women's March there, said that in such a large movement, "there are going to be people who don't agree with one another. We really have to see the women's movement as being inclusive, that there are going to be some bumps in the road, but it's going to make us stronger and better together."
At each of the Bay Area marches, speakers from diverse backgrounds, including Jews, blacks and Latinos, will take the stage. More than 150,000 people are expected to march at events throughout the Bay Area, including as many as 70,000 in both San Francisco and Oakland and about 25,000 in San Jose.
In San Jose, Higgins Bradanini said march organizers have been reassuring participants that the group represents all women and condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and anti-Semitism.
"We're working hard to create an empowering, safe and impactful march for everyone January 19," Women's March San Jose organizers said in an email blast. "We've sought the advice and input of diverse community organizations for our programming and we hope you will join us."
In San Francisco, volunteers Martha Shaughnessy and Sophia Andary say stories that amplify conflicts within the organization make it seem that there are forces that want the women's movement to fail.
"People don't want this to work," Shaughnessy said, "and it makes for better news if women are in a cat fight" rather than putting together a broad coalition around social justice issues, from gender identity to immigration and housing costs.
Podulka, who wondered if the conflict was a "smear campaign," said she had considered joining the Washington march again, but the conflict "made me take pause," and for a variety of other reasons as well, she decided to attend the San Jose event instead.
"I'm not abandoning them in that sense. I'm still participating," she said. "Focusing on the bumps in the road hurts us more than the bumps themselves. We have to keep our momentum and keep our eye on the bigger picture."

Texto completo: Superior Motors will kick off its 2019 Dinner Series on Feb. 5, the first night of the Lunar New Year celebration, with guest chef Simone Tong of New York's Little Tong Noodle Shop visiting the Braddock location.
"We're excited to introduce and showcase (Tong's) amazing Yunnan-inspired cuisine to Braddock and Pittsburgh," says Chris Clark, Superior Motors manager and Tong's associate at the former wd~50.
Since opening Little Tong's first location in March 2017, Chef Tong's takes on Yunnan cuisine have earned reviews and profiles in publications including "The New York Times" and the "Wall Street Journal."
Yunnan is a southern province of China with a unique cuisine heavily influenced by its neighbors of Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.
Little Tong Noodle Shop's signature dishes feature its mixian noodles, a non-glutinous rice noodle from the province. Noodle bowls are topped with Yunnan-inspired accoutrements, as in the "Grandma Chicken" mixian bowl served with chicken confit, black sesame garlic oil, Chinese broccoli, pickled daikon and fermented chili in a chicken broth.
Guests can expect similar dishes when Tong teams up with Superior Motors chef and owner Kevin Sousa for the Chinese New Year dinner.
Tickets are $85, with an optional $30 beverage pairing enhancement.

Texto completo: The theory that President Donald Trump is or has been a Russian asset is a popular one among his detractors. But for the first time, we're learning that it's something the FBI suspected strongly enough to dig into.

The Washington Post has confirmed that the FBI launched a counterintelligence inquiry into whether Trump was working for Russia shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. The news was first reported by the New York Times.

Practically speaking, this may not mean a whole lot. Special counsel Robert Mueller III was appointed mere days later, meaning any evidence the FBI collected was likely limited. It was Mueller's decision to continue the line of inquiry, and we don't know whether he has. But practical concerns aside, it's a shocking story: The nation's leading law enforcement agency was looking into whether a sitting U.S. president was working for a hostile foreign nation. The decision was something the FBI reportedly struggled with for months, and it still has its detractors.

But what might have led to such an extraordinary step by the FBI? And what's the state of the evidence?

Comey's firing was obviously the tipping point. Investigators reportedly shed their previous reservations about the inquiry after Trump's televised admission to NBC News' Lester Holt that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he did it. Another red flag was Trump's attempts to include a reference to the Russia investigation in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's letter justifying the firing.

We already know that these few days contained a central event in Mueller's investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice, but the idea that it also warranted a counterintelligence inquiry is notable. It's one thing to deliberately hamper the investigation; it's another to suspect Trump might have done so on behalf of Russia. Were this to ever lead to any concrete conclusions, that Holt interview will apparently have been an extraordinary misstep by Trump, who has often seemed to blurt out unhelpful statements about his true motivations.

The other obvious one here is the British former intelligence officer Christopher Steele's dossier. The dossier included a high-profile allegation that Russia had kompromat - or compromising material - on Trump thanks to supposedly salacious evidence it had about Trump's pursuits in a Moscow hotel room. This allegation has never been proved and Putin has denied it (as if he would confirm it), but Comey has suggested it's not out of the question, and some lawmakers have even gone so far as to raise the idea that Trump is compromised.

"Millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous and inexplicable behavior is the possibility - the very real possibility - that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump," Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor last year.

Added Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.: "I think it's likely." A retiring GOP congressman, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, agreed.

The Times outlined a number of other events that played into the obstruction case and could have fed further suspicions about Trump's motivations, including his pro-Russia and pro-Putin campaign-trail rhetoric and his public request that Russia try to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails. The GOP also altered its platform on Ukraine in a more pro-Russia direction.

What hasn't been outlined, though, are the proposed back channels between the Trump team and Russia.

A month before Comey was fired, The Washington Post reported that Trump ally and Blackwater founder Erik Prince had proposed a secret channel of communication between Trump and Moscow at a Jan. 2017 meeting in the Seychelles with a Putin representative. The FBI was also presumably aware at the time (because it monitors the calls of Russian officials on U.S. soil) that then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had told his superiors in Moscow that Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had proposed a back channel during the transition period. (The Post reported this shortly after Comey's firing.)

If Trump was working for Russia, it would be logical to assume he'd need some way of actually learning what Russia desired - which would be difficult through regular channels, given they'd be monitored. We don't know where these back channels stand in the Russia investigation, but if Mueller were probing a potential secret Trump-Russia alliance, you'd think they'd be of interest.

For similar reasons, Trump's meeting with Putin in Helsinki last year has also raised eyebrows. He met privately with Putin for two hours, with nobody but interpreters present, and apparently nobody in the American government really knows what they discussed. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats even seemed to express concern about the lack of information. "I'm not in a position to either understand fully or talk about what happened in Helsinki," Coats said afterward. Why Trump would need to keep things so under wraps has always been curious.

There are, of course, simpler explanations to all of this than the idea that Trump was working for Russia. Perhaps he truly admires Putin's leadership style - which very much fits with his expressed admiration and work with other authoritarian leaders. It has been clear that Trump wanted to do business in Russia, so he seemed to be positively predisposed toward the country. And his efforts to hamper the Russia investigation needn't be about any secret pro-Russia agenda; it's also quite logical to think Trump simply views the whole thing as casting a pall over his election and raising concerns about the legitimacy of his presidency. Even if Trump unjustly attempted to obstruct the investigation, that doesn't mean he was necessarily doing it for Russia. In fact, Russia would seem to have less to gain from such obstruction than Trump would.

But there was apparently enough subterfuge and concern here to cause the FBI to take an extraordinary step - even if it might have wound up being a brief one. The idea that Trump's interests might not indeed be "America First" has largely bubbled beneath the surface of American politics for the past two-plus years. It's still highly speculative, based upon the public evidence, but as always, the question is what Mueller knows that we don't.

Texto completo: Both mocking and denouncing news reports that the FBI has investigated him for being under Russian influence, President Donald Trump found himself denying Monday that he has ever been under Russia's thumb.
"I never worked for Russia," Trump told reporters as he departed the White House en route to an agriculture speech in New Orleans, adding that the question itself was a "disgrace" and that accusations against him are "a whole big fat hoax. "
Earlier, citing a Fox News report on lower gas prices being the result of more oil production, the president tweeted: "But this is bad news for Russia, why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin?"
Trump's tweet came days after The New York Times reported that the FBI had begun a counter-intelligence investigation on Trump to see if he had been influenced by Russia and its president Vladimir Putin when he fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017.
The Washington Post then reported that Trump has concealed many of the details of his conversations with Putin, even from aides and U. S. intelligence officials.
Asked about the Post report that he had seized notes from his interpreter after a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Trump called it "fake news. " House Democrats, however, have talked about issuing a subpoena for the interpreter to testify about Trump's actions.
Trump also accused Comey and other FBI officials of being "dirty cops" and "known scoundrels" who were politically biased against him and launched investigations of him as a result.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, and whether the Trump campaign was somehow involved.
Trump has denounced the Mueller investigation as a "witch hunt," and has constantly attacked media coverage of it.
Over the weekend, Fox News host and Trump supporter Jeanine Pirro, asked Trump: "Are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?"
Trump replied: "I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing. "
Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, said Trump's relationship with Russia needs to be looked into.
"Why is he so chummy with Vladimir Putin, this man who is a former KGB agent, never been a friend to the United States, invaded our allies, threatens us around the world, and tries his damndest to undermine our elections?" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. , speaking on ABC's This Week.
"Why is this President Trump's best buddy?" Durbin said. "I don't get it. "

FAMU, FSU researchers nervous over shutdown

Texto completo: Research universities across the country are expressing concerns about future funding proposals and the impact of a long-term shutdown.
While financial aid questions appear largely resolved for students and parents, there's mounting anxiety among research directors at area universities as the partial federal shutdown drags on.
In fiscal year 2018, Florida State University received more than $177 million in research money. The bulk of that funding came from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the National Institutes of Health.
The NSF is one of the agencies affected by the longest shutdown in history, along with the Department of Agriculture, NASA and the Department of Transportation.
The New York Times recently reported the NSF will cancel dozens of proposal review panel meetings this month if the government remains closed.
Research universities across the country are expressing concerns about future funding proposals and the impact of a long-term shutdown. Already, it has affected national conferences, and in some cases, accessing needed data from affected agencies.
Charles Weatherford, interim associate vice president for research at Florida A&M University, said project officers at shuttered federal agencies are unavailable to respond to inquiries, and proposals can't be submitted or grants awarded.
In addition, he said, closed agencies have halted spending on their supported research projects.
"So far, only isolated difficulties, mainly involving no-cost grant extension requests have also occurred — no-cost extensions can't be approved while the government is shut down and this causes a cascading series of complications," Weatherford said of the impact at FAMU. "If the shutdown continues much longer, the repercussions will start to accumulate and will become more serious."
Florida A&M University was awarded $44.6 million in federal research money for 2017-18, representing about 96 percent of funding.
Meanwhile, Gary K. Ostrander, FSU's vice president for research, advised faculty and staff last month that current operations are not expected to be disrupted.
"At this time, we do not know if proposal deadlines or electronic proposal submission systems for impacted agencies will be affected by the shutdown," he wrote. "During previous shutdowns, work on already funded projects was allowed to continue."
Researchers with active funded grants or contracts may continue work unless the principal investigator or FSU receives a Stop Work Order, he said. But Ostrander said agencies currently not funded may not have employees available to assist with prior approvals, support or administrative actions.
"We anticipate that new awards, funding increments, payments, and prior approvals will not be forthcoming from the impacted agencies under a shutdown," he said.
Financial aid continues to be processed While the shutdown has raised anxiety for parents and students regarding financial aid applications and refunds, campus administrators say services have not been markedly interrupted.
At FSU, approximately 54 percent students enrolled for 2017-18 received some type of federal aid.
Sally McRorie, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at FSU, said the university has successfully processed financial aid for the spring semester, including Pell Grants, for students. And, new applications continue to be processed, she said.
"Should the shutdown continue indefinitely, new first time in college students and new transfers may have difficulties finalizing financial aid documents for upcoming semesters," McRorie said.
FSU Director of Financial Aid Somnath Chatterjee said students and parents have expressed concern about obtaining tax verification information needed to complete applications, but the U.S. Department of Education, which is not affected by the shutdown, has told universities and colleges that has been resolved.
William Spiers, director of financial aid at TCC, said the Department of Education Wednesday authorized the college to use IRS 1040 information for tax verification. The IRS is expected to be back up on Monday.
At Florida A&M, approximately 85 percent students receive some form of federal aid.
"The major concern as it relates to our students and parents is the unnecessary anxiety the shutdown has caused," VP Student Affairs William Hudson Jr. said. "Parents and students are worried about their refunds and rewarding of aid. It has also increased the workload for staff."

Links to Russia emerge as even greater threat to Trump

Texto completo: Even as President Trump is consumed by his standoff with Democrats over the border and the government shutdown, a potentially larger battle looms for the White House.
On Sunday, Republicans, Democrats and the president seemed to be preparing for the prospect that the special counsel's inquiry into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia could further upend a government that's in the midst of the longest shutdown in U.S. history.
"Impeachment is an unbelievably serious undertaking. No president has ever been removed from office," Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) told ABC's "This Week." "If the crimes are serious enough, it needs to be done."
The president shot back in an interview with Fox News, blasting reports in the New York Times and The Washington Post that raised new questions about his interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and whether he had been working on behalf of the Russian government.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," Trump told Fox News's Jeanine Pirro after the Times reported that law enforcement officials in 2017 began investigating whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo amplified that message Sunday, telling CBS's "Face the Nation" that the notion that the president is a threat to national security is "absolutely ludicrous."
The counterintelligence inquiry was taken over by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and is now part of Mueller's broader probe into whether Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.
In the Fox interview, Trump also dismissed a report by The Post that catalogued the extraordinary measures he had taken to keep details of his conversations with Putin from other U.S. officials. In once instance, Trump took possession of the notes of his own interpreter and instructed the linguist not to discuss what had happened with other administration officials.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Saturday that his panel had tried to get the notes but was blocked by Republicans. "Will they join us now?" he asked. "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first'?"
Trump dismissed those questions on Fox, describing his meeting with Putin as "very positive."
"We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things, and it was a great conversation," he said. "I'm not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn't care less."
The shadow of the Mueller probe is likely to become a more pressing problem for the Trump administration and Republicans as the year progresses and the special counsel completes his work.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a Trump ally, said he was astonished that law enforcement officials had sought to investigate whether Trump was an agent of the Russians.
"It tells me a lot about the people running the FBI . . . I don't trust them as far as I can throw them," he told "Fox News Sunday."
Graham said he planned to ask William P. Barr, the president's nominee for attorney general, during his confirmation hearing this week whether he trusted Mueller and his team to be fair and whether he saw any reason to fire the special counsel.
Democrats countered that it was critical for Mueller to be allowed to complete his probe into whether Trump or his campaign worked on behalf of Russian interests. "That's the defining question of our investigation and the Mueller investigation," said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "Was there collusion?"
Democrats also pledged to press Barr to release Mueller's eventual report to the public, while most are avoiding talk of impeachment until it is finished. It is not clear when that will be or what conclusions, if any, the report will reach.
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the new head of the House Oversight Committee, brushed off talk of impeachment as premature in an interview with "60 Minutes" on Sunday. But he said House Democrats would aggressively probe the Trump White House.
"The fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem," he said. "There's so much . . . And all I'm saying is that we've got to hit the ground, not running, but flying."

Rising sea temperatures set record after record

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's National Security Council asked for military options on striking Iran in response to that country's support of insurgents in Iraq, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.
The council, under national security adviser John Bolton, made the request after militants aligned with Iran fired three mortar rounds into the diplomatic section of Baghdad, which includes the U. S. Embassy, according to the report. The mortars landed in a vacant lot, and no one was injured.
The Journal reported that the Pentagon developed plans for a strike on Iran in response to the National Security Council request, but it is unclear whether those plans were shared with the White House or Trump.
Unnamed sources told the Journal that the request raised alarm within the Defense and State Departments.
"It definitely rattled people," a former senior administration official told the newspaper. "People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran. "
A current senior administration official disputed that characterization, telling USA TODAY that the Pentagon and State Department were not "caught off guard. "
NSC spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement that the council "provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats. "
"We continue to review the status of our personnel following attempted attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and our Basra consulate, and we will consider a full range of options to preserve their safety and our interests," Marquis said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comment on the report when asked about it during a news conference in Qatar.

Former U. S. officials told the Journal "it was unnerving that the National Security Council asked for far-reaching military options to strike Iran in response to attacks that caused little damage and no injuries. "
Bolton has long backed a more aggressive U. S. policy toward Iran. He was a strong proponent of pulling out of the Obama administration-era deal in which Iran agreed to pause its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a reduction in sanctions.
Not long after the mortar attack that riled the National Security Council, Bolton warned the Iranians that "if you cross us, our allies or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay. "
Before joining the administration, Bolton was a strong advocate of a U. S. attack on Iran. In a New York Times op-ed in 2015 titled "To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran," Bolton argued the "inconvenient truth is that only military action" could stop the nuclear program and called for "vigorous American support for Iran’s opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran. "
Bolton has said the Trump administration "policy is not regime change, but we want to put unprecedented pressure on the government of Iran to change its behavior. " Citing unnamed sources, the Journal reported that since joining the administration, Bolton "has made it clear that he personally supports regime change in Iran. "
After Bolton replaced former Gen. H. R. McMaster in March, The American Conservative wrote that his appointment creates a "prospect of war with Iran that is very real. "
"He has been obsessed for many years with going to war against the Islamic Republic," The American Conservative said.

25 years of 'Midnight': By Katie Nussbaum

Texto completo: Fewer than 3 million people were making trips to Savannah in the mid-1980s, but one of those people would go on to help put the Hostess City on the map to become a sought-after visitor destination.
"It's changed my life completely - for the better I think, obviously," said John Berendt, author of the New York Times bestseller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," known to most locals simply as "The Book."
A tale of mystery and murder centered around Savannah antique dealer Jim Williams and a host of other eccentric characters who could only be found in Savannah, the book spent 216 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list following its release on Jan. 13, 1994, thrusting Savannah into the national spotlight and helping lay the foundation for the city's ever-growing tourism industry.
Between hardback, paperback and audio, more than 4 million copies have been sold domestically.
'Stumbled on Savannah'
"I had a column in Esquire magazine and I would do a different subject every month, and I couldn't get very deep into any subject I chose for the column ... So, I thought it was time to write a book, but I didn't know what I would write about," Berendt said.
"I stumbled on Savannah at that moment and I threw myself into it and I was crazy about Savannah and Savannahians."
Berendt said it wasn't just the city's beauty that attracted him, but also the humor in Savannah, which he said was intoxicating and very appealing.
"The people I met in Savannah had a certain ironic sense of humor, which in the book you can see with Joe Odom and [Lady] Chablis; both had that ironic sense, sort of joking outlook," he said.
While tourism may have taken off in the mid-1990s and never looked back, Savannah in the 1980s was a little different, Berendt said.
"There were very few people on the street and Broughton Street was all boarded," he said, recalling the growth and changes in the city, including trips to the now-demolished Johnny Harris restauranton Victory Drive, Crystal Beer Parlor and frequent meals at Elizabeth on 37thwith Williams, who would often take home multiple desserts and always insisted on paying.
Did he expect the book to be as successful as it turned out to be? Not quite.
"I thought as I was writing it that people are going to enjoy this book because it's entertaining. It's about a murder, but it's not a gruesome book, so I thought people who are going to read it are going to like it, but I didn't have any expectation that it was going to be a bestseller," he said.
"Someone asked me,
'Do you think it'll be a bestseller?' and I said, 'Are you kidding? Look what's in it.' ... I thought there will be some word of mouth and it'll sell modestly and that's what my hopes were for it."
Changing tourism
Berendt, of course, doesn't take all of the credit for all of Savannah's growth, but looking at the numbers and listening to the chatter, it's obvious the book made and continues to make an impact.
According to records from Visit Savannah, about 5,010,000 people visited Savannah in 1993, spending $587 million; in 1994, visitors increased to 5,029,000, contributing $629 million to the local economy. The following year, in 1995, visitor numbers jumped to 5,348,000 and spending increased to $673.4 million.
"There's been a tremendous evolution, especially on River Street. We opened Spanky's in December 1976 and the plaza wasn't dedicated until June 1977, so in those days you could shoot a cannon off River Street and not hit anyone," said Ansley Williams of Live Oak Restaurant Group.
"We just tried to make it to St. Patrick's Day."
But then came the book and things started to change.
"That was a major league shot in the arm. We saw a spike in business immediately and another bump when the movie came out," Williams said.
"Then came Tom Hanks and 'Forrest Gump'and that was another blip on the screen and we were thrilled about all of it."
Angela Sergi opened Savannah Heritage Tours nearly 12 years ago, and at that time, she said no one really had a tour dedicated to the book, so she decided to offer her own.
"People said, 'People are tired of that book,' and I thought, 'No they're not,'" Sergi recalled.
The tour covers how Williams got his start in Savannah along with highlighting more than 20 of the homes he restored, the murder trial, Bonaventure Cemetery and a variety of the eccentric characters found in the book.
"When I started out in 2007, I had a little 15-passenger van and I was going out twice a day on that tour, seven days a week," Sergi said.
"... The book has really had a huge impact on Savannah."
Sergi said some of her customers travel to Savannah because of the book, but others have just heard of the book or movie and are curious to learn more.
"I think it's truly the unique characters that are in it. Joe Odom, who partied all the time, and of course, Lady Chablis, she's the most popular character in the story and the fact that she played herself in the movie, people were coming here just to see her," Sergi said of why she thinks people continue to be captivated by the book.
"That always helped me out when she was in town."
Stepping stones
Although he didn't live in Savannah in the 1990s, Visit Savannah president Joseph Marinelli said people often tell him how much the area has improved since then, which is the best compliment to get.
"Today I look at the vibrancy of it all and just kind of smile," Marinelli said.
The impact of the book can be seen on any given day in the Historic District, with visitors often carrying a copy and identifying landmarks, as well as still being a strong seller at the Visit Savannah gift shop and visitors center on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, he said.
When the Clint Eastwood-directed adaption of the book was released in theaters in November 1997, visitors numbers and interest jumped again.
"The book and the movie are part of the stepping stones of Savannah's modern history of becoming a visitor destination," Marinelli said.
Mystique continues
As far as why people are still captivated by the book and its Savannah tale, it's simple: It's still a great book, Marinelli said.
"The mystique of the characters, whether they're fictional or not, and the intrigue of how the book tells the story about the city is still driving people here. People are still curious, because there are very few places in this country that have the live oaks, Spanish moss and the cobblestones and squares," he said.
"I think the combination of how the book was written and the fact that you can still come here today and experience what is portrayed in the book is what drives people here."
While the book isn't the showpiece the organization uses to market the city to visitors, it still has a large presence, Marinelli said.
"It's still woven through our blog posts and social media," he said, including a guide on their website that takes visitors from the Mercer Williams House on Monterey Square to the Telfair Academy to view the Bird Girl statue made famous on the book's cover to Bonaventure Cemetery and Clary's Cafe on Abercorn Street.
Marinelli said it's not just in Savannah that he and his team get quizzed about the book, either.
"We go to Atlanta, New York, Toronto, Charleston and meet with editors of national publications and it's fascinating to me that when we're having those conversations, people still inquire about certain characters or certain landmarks from the book to this day," he said, adding the people often ask about the Lady Chablis and Clary's.
"I think the fact that the book was so well written and has been a bestseller for 25 years still is intriguing to people and we still get asked about it even when we're in a meeting with the biggest editors of publications, so it's just fascinating."

Texto completo: At last, one Donald Trump supporter has been honest in an article from the New York Times. Outraged that she's being harmed by the government shutdown, Crystal Minton said, "I thought (Trump) was going to do good things. He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting."
To prove the point, Trump threatened to cut FEMA funding following the devastating California wildfires, just out of political spite. Trump and his supports still don't get it — you cannot claim to love America while taking grotesque pleasure in the pain of its citizens.
The entire Trump movement is based on rage, revenge fantasies and irrational fear of shrinking white Christian power. Although Trump is the embodiment of ugly, he didn't create it.
I remember my many Republican friends during the Obama administration who spread outlandish untruths about the former president as a "secret Muslim," Antichrist or Kenyan communist. Some Americans are furious over the existence of gay people, growing secularism, "uppity minorities," immigrants and a host of perceived losses that have nothing to do with them.
We do have problems. Life expectancy is down, malaise and frustration reign, and people are suffering, but these are the inevitable outcomes of policy choices from the 1980s. You could say the desiccated corpse of Ronald Reagan is far more dangerous than any zombie apocalypse. The previous generation inherited a functioning country and passed on a steaming pile of failure, outrage and stupidity to the next generation. Unfairly maligned millennials are far worse off than their parents.
The question is, what do we do about it?
In Nevada, Steve Sisolak just took the Governor's Mansion in a bipartisan handoff from one sensible moderate, Brian Sandoval, to another. In local and state politics, we have a great tradition of consensus-building. Government can and does work, mostly when we reject immoral, inane "leaders" like failed governor Jim Gibbons and his less-able clone, Adam Laxalt. Watching Sisolak's swearing in, I was deeply moved by his emotion and sense of history. I feel so much hope and optimism for the incoming governor.
Looking at the national level, there's no moderation, capitulation or reasoning with Trump. We had a moderate president in Barack Obama, a dispassionate, competent technocrat unreasonably vilified by the right. Obama sometimes disappointed liberals too. One thing is certain, America will not overcome Trump with milquetoast centrism or neoliberalism. We need bold policy, like universal health care. We should also protect immigrant "dreamers," cut the defense budget and legalize cannabis, just for starters.
You could say that I also attack Americans when I criticize Trump supporters, but there's a big difference. I take no pleasure in their suffering or anger. Liberals want every American to have jobs, opportunity and joy. More than anything, we want them to shed the outrageous, self-defeating hate animating the movement.

Texto completo: "We're thrilled to see a great book getting into the hands of so many readers! It's always a joy when a book finds a new audience"
Miriam Parker,
Ecco associate publisher
They've seen the movie, and now they're reading the original "Bird Box" book.
The 2014 novel by Ferndale author/musician Josh Malerman has landed for the first time on the New York Times best-seller list, thanks to the overwhelming success of the Sandra Bullock-starring horror movie from Netflix.
It ranks fourth for combined print and e-book fiction — and it's on the rise. Last week, it debuted at seventh place.
The novel also bumped former First Lady Michelle Obama's memoir "Becoming" from the top of the Apple books list. As of Thursday, "Bird Box" was at No. 1, with "Becoming" in second place.
For a book that debuted modestly five years ago, it's the publishing world equivalent of going viral (just like "Bird Box" memes and jokes have).
Ecco, a division of HarperCollins, is doing numerous additional printings of the book that will have wide distribution.
"We're thrilled to see a great book getting into the hands of so many readers!," said Ecco associate publisher Miriam Parker via email. "It's always a joy when a book finds a new audience"
"Bird Box" received good reviews when it initially came out. Malerman's spare, powerful writing style and pacing drew comparisons to the stylish chills of director Alfred Hitchcock.
Kirkus named it one of the best fiction books of 2014 and said Malerman "keeps us tinglingly on edge with his cool, merciless storytelling."
Publishers Weekly raved that "the author uses understatement and allusion to create a lean, spellbinding thriller that Stephen King fans will relish."
Hollywood recognized the book's potential before it even reached stores. Universal optioned the film rights in 2013, with Netflix eventually buying them for the film adaptation directed by Susanne Bier.
With a screenplay by Eric Heisserer, the movie follows the same structure as the book, but changes the location from the Detroit suburbs to northern California and compresses the action for the two-hour running time.
Even if you've seen the movie, the novel makes for a gripping read. It goes much deeper into the details of what life is like for a group of strangers who hide inside a house after the world is gripped by a mysterious presence that kills you when you look at it.
And because what you can only imagine is always scarier than what you see, the book ratchets up the tension beyond the film's scares — all while maintaining a crisp, clean writing style and taking a perceptive look at the human psyche stretched to the limits.
Malerman wrote the first draft in 2006. Back then it was twice as long as the final version and had many more characters. But the essentials — the blindfolds, the deadly presence that kills when you look at it, the alternating time periods between Malorie hiding in the house and her taking the children on the dangerous river trip — were the same.
He starting rewriting in roughly 2010 and got a publisher, HarperCollins, about two years later.
Malerman was driving home from the Upper Peninsula when his agent called and told him "Bird Box" had made the New York Times best-seller list. "She screamed with excitement and I probably did the same and all I can say is, I'm so glad I was in a traffic stop when I got the news. It was absolutely electrifying," he told Variety.
Long before the film adaptation came out, Malerman saw how audiences responded to the drama of the book's narrative.
When "Bird Box" initially reached book stores, Malerman and his fiancee, Allison Laakko, did some readings where audiences were blindfolded. Laako would play Malorie, while he provided eerie music with a keyboard. Sometimes friends joined in with sound effects.
"It was really a magical moment for us because we (founded) a theater troupe almost," he told the Free Press last month.
Malerman is currently busy with more than just the "Bird Box" buzz. His band, the High Strung (known for the theme song to Showtime's "Shameless") is celebrating its new album, "Quiet Riots."
On April 23, his latest novel, "Inspection," is coming out. It involves the mysteries and secrets of two isolated schools for geniuses, one for girls and one for boys.
And for the first time, Malerman can now be promoted as a New York Times best-selling author.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily rejected a New York Times report that said the FBI opened an investigation in 2017 to determine whether he worked, knowingly or unknowingly, on behalf of Russia.
The report said that in the days after Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May 2017, the agency began investigating whether the president had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
U.S. counterintelligence investigators attempted to assess whether Trump's actions constituted a possible threat to national security, and agents also tried to determine whether Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unknowingly come under Moscow's influence, the Times reported.
Trump has repeatedly denounced the FBI and Justice Department.
"The corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the president tweeted. "My firing of James B. Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop."
The president also criticized familiar targets including special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump concluded Saturday by asserting that he'd been tougher on Russia than former U.S. presidents.
S. Korea balks at Trump's push over more funds for U.S. troops
WASHINGTON - South Korea is resisting a Trump administration demand for sharply higher payments to defray the cost of basing U.S. forces on its territory, raising fears that President Donald Trump might threaten a troop drawdown at a time of sensitive diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.
U.S. negotiators have sought a 50 percent increase in Seoul's annual payment, which last year was about $830 million, or about half of the estimated cost of hosting 28,500 U.S. troops, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions.
South Korea is expected to make a counteroffer this month.
The standoff is straining the alliance as Trump plans a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to renew the U.S. push for elimination of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.
Former Obama housing chief Castro enters 2020 campaign
SAN ANTONIO - Assailing President Donald Trump for "a crisis of leadership," former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro joined the 2020 presidential race Saturday as a rush of Democrats accelerates.
Castro, 44, could end up being the only Latino in a crowded Democratic field. He was San Antonio's mayor for five year and U.S. housing secretary in President Barack Obama's second term. He became the second Democrat to formally enter the race, after former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have formed exploratory committees. Casto's first trip as a candidate comes Monday to Puerto Rico, where an outcry has begun as the White House considers diverting disaster funding to pay for a border wall.
U.S. calls for the formation of new government in Venezuela
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - The U.S. stepped up its criticism of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday with an explicit call for the formation of a new government in the South American country.
The State Department said in a statement that it stood behind the head of Venezuela's opposition-run congress, Juan Guaido, who said Friday that he was prepared to step into the presidency temporarily. The statement was the latest in a series of Trump administration attacks on Maduro, whose inauguration to a new term as president Thursday has been widely denounced as illegitimate.
"The people of Venezuela deserve to live in freedom in a democratic society governed by the rule of law," State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said.
Pompeo upbeat on deal with Turkey over Kurds
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - Despite Turkey's vows to the contrary, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday he was confident the two nations can agree on a way to protect U.S.-allied Kurdish rebels in Syria after American troops withdraw from the country.
After speaking to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Pompeo said an agreement was a work in progress but can be achieved in a way that allows the Turks to defend their country while leaving alone Kurds who do not pose a threat.
The top U.S. diplomat said he was "optimistic" that Kurds who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State group in Syria are not threatened by pledges from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch military operations against what he terms Kurdish "terrorists."
Hamas probe: Israel tried to wiretap group in Gaza Strip
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - Gaza's ruling Hamas said Saturday that Israeli undercover forces had attempted to install equipment to monitor the Islamic militant group's landline communications network during a botched mission in November.
The findings of an investigation were announced by the Hamas military wing, Qassam Brigades, in a prerecorded TV statement.
Hamas presented surveillance footage and photos to back up its claims.
Hamas thwarted an attempt to "plant spying devices in the Gaza Strip," a Qassam spokesman said in the statement.
Israel's military has not released details about the operation, which went awry Nov. 11, leading to the heaviest round of cross-border fire, including Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes, since a 2014 war between the two sides.
Still missing: Police arrested 12 people alleged to have been involved in the kidnapping of an American in Costa Rica. Police say a joint operation caught nine Costa Rican suspects Friday; three others were arrested in Spain. William Sean Creighton Kopko was abducted Sept. 24, 2018, in Costa Rica. He is still missing.
In Congo: Presidential runner-up Martin Fayulu has asked a constitutional court to order a recount. He has accused the winner, Felix Tshisekedi, of a deal with President Joseph Kabila. An official said Fayulu has two options: accept the vote or it is annulled, which would keep Kabila in power until another election.

Texto completo: In September, the president of the lobbying organization Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an alliance of insurance companies and consumer, medical, public health and safety groups, warned a U.S. Senate committee of the dangers of the push for large-scale public testing of autonomous vehicles.
Deploying these self-driving vehicles “before they can be safely operated on public roads and without common-sense government oversight and industry accountability,” Catherine Chase wrote, “is not only reckless and ill-advised, but it will also substantially reduce public confidence in this new technology.”
Many members of the public, it seems, are already there: The organization pointed to polling — its own and surveys by the American Automobile Association, Reuters/Ipsos and others — that found about 70 percent of Americans saying they were concerned about the safety of self-driving vehicles and were likely to be too afraid to ride in one.
And in Chandler, Ariz., where the Google spinoff known as Waymo started testing its driverless vans in 2017, some residents are registering their concerns in ways that transcend opinion surveys: They are pelting the vehicles with rocks, slashing their tires, trying to run them off the road with their own cars or braking hard in front of them, and threatening the vehicles’ emergency backup drivers — in one case, according to The New York Times, with a .22-caliber handgun, and in another with a length of PVC pipe.
Behavior like this is unsupportable, but the fear it reflects is not unjustified.
In May 2016, the driver of a Tesla Model S operating with its driver-assist Autopilot technology was killed when the vehicle failed to brake to avoid hitting a tractor-trailer. Last January, another Tesla on Autopilot crashed into a parked fire engine (no one was injured). In March, yet another Tesla on Autopilot, a Model X, left the roadway and struck a safety barrier at 70 mph, killing the driver. In March, a self-driving Uber sport utility vehicle, a Volvo, struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz.
There’s no doubt that human error and bad decisions contribute mightily to the wreckage and slaughter on America’s roads, with millions of crashes and tens of thousands of people killed every year (there were 37,133 fatalities on U.S. highways in 2017, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Self-driving vehicle technology has the potential to help reduce those tragic numbers, among other possible advantages, but at this point it remains just potential.
Efforts to rush through corporate-backed legislation like the AV START Act (for the American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act), are simply wrong-headed. That legislation, which stalled in the Senate last year, could have unleashed millions of self-driving vehicles — all of them exempt from federal motor vehicle safety standards — onto American roads in what would have amounted to a massive and potentially bloody beta test. That, in part, is why New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu last summer vetoed legislation that would have allowed more testing of autonomous vehicles, known as AVs, in the Granite State.
“The artificial urgency to deploy immature AVs is disconnected from public opinion as well as the reality that serious and fatal crashes have revealed significant flaws in this still developing technology,” Chase, of the highway safety lobbying group, wrote.
We understand the attraction of self-driving vehicles. Ours is a rural region with limited public transportation options. The population is growing older and some may find driving more difficult with each passing year. Certainly people with disabilities could benefit from easy access to autonomous transportation. Others could find it convenient and productive to read or answer email, for example, while their car took care of the chore of commuting. If most or all of those vehicles got their power from renewable energy sources, such as solar, it could be a boon for the environment. And if the technology works and is adopted on a large scale, it could make some huge — and expensive — transportation infrastructure projects, such as new rail lines, unnecessary. On the other hand, we might need more or wider roads. And then there’s the question of where all these vehicles will park, and how they might handle challenges such as a snow- or ice-covered road surface.
As anyone with any experience at all with technology, especially new technology, knows, there are glitches, freezes and system failures large and small. Capabilities are routinely overstated and computer security is, we’ve come to find out, an oxymoron. It’s obvious that Google, Tesla and the other tech companies working on autonomous and self-driving vehicles are eager to get their products on the road, and generating revenue, as quickly as possible. But when the systems running these vehicles crash — and they will crash — people stand to lose more than a report or a spreadsheet. They could lose their lives.

Her Autistic Twins Raise a Ruckus, but They're 'My Joy in Life'

Texto completo: Hallway photos in Teisha Waterman's Brooklyn apartment show her identical twin sons, Pharaoh and Phallon, dressed alike. They are both smiling, cute as two matching buttons.
Around the corner, in the living room, the real boys are less sedate. The cracked television screen is a result of their raucous play sessions. Ms. Waterman keeps the other furnishings in her home spare and durable, to withstand moments of unrestrained behavior.
"If it can be broken, it's not going to last here," Ms. Waterman, 41, said with a laugh.
Her sons, age 6, are lovely, playful kids, but because of their severe autism, they also need special attention and parenting support to meet their social and behavioral needs.
The boys were born 26 weeks into her pregnancy, and each weighed less than 2 pounds. Doctors said early on that they had autism, and Ms. Waterman has struggled to get them the services they need, including occupational therapy and specialists to help them eat with utensils and communicate by using gestures.
"Parenting is hard enough," she said, "but having a child with special needs is 20 times harder."
Even by age 3, the boys did not respond to their names or other verbal communication, from their mother or between themselves. Only recently have they begun to acknowledge each other and play together.
Interacting with other children remains problematic. At the playground, Ms. Waterman must often intervene, and offer apologies or explanations for awkward behavior from the boys.
Pharaoh is prone to tantrums that can include hitting himself, screaming and ramming into his mother.
"If a child asks his name, he might just start jumping up and down," Ms. Waterman said. "Kids and parents don't know how to respond. Some parents aren't compassionate. They don't understand."
The boys also are liable to bolt into the street and simply keep running, she said, so she must hold them tightly. She avoids playgrounds with more than one entrance and must tends the exit closely.
"They have no sense of fear," said Ms. Waterman, who raises the boys along with their father, her longtime companion.
Even with both parents' salaries, after covering the monthly rent of $1,100, plus utilities and other expenses, the parents are barely able to cover the many out-of-pocket expenses related to the boys' care, including behavior analyses and therapy critical for children with autism spectrum disorder.
The summer camp at the Shorefront YM-YWHA of Brighton-Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn has become vital to them. Its services include special programs and services for children with autism and developmental disabilities, including swimming, trampolines and sensory integration.
The Shorefront Y is a beneficiary agency of UJA Federation of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
When Ms. Waterman was unable to afford camp fees last summer, $1,260 from The Neediest Cases Fund covered part of the cost.
"They can't go to a mainstream summer camp -- it's too dangerous for them to be in groups with 12 kids to one counselor," said Ms. Waterman, who has been frustrated by delays in New York State's developmental disabilities services.
After more than a year of delays in processing her sons' applications, she said, she finally sought help from the Legal Aid Society's health law unit, which has helped her make progress.
Ms. Waterman grew up in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. She worked in the Bronx district attorney's office as a community associate, largely documenting police officers' testimony.
She found the job so upsetting that she eventually quit. She has worked at several Manhattan law firms and now works as a legal coordinator for Beam Living, a management company for the Stuyvesant Town residential complex in Manhattan.
To keep the job, she must pay for after-school programs for her sons, she said.
As strenuous as it can be, she said she is buoyed by the boys' compassion and affection.
"I love my sons more than I love myself," she said. "My joy in life comes from being able to teach them and letting them explore and learn and become upstanding citizens in society."
Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone.

Texto completo: TORONTO -- It was another proud moment for Canada: a Saudi teenager who had just been granted asylum walking through the arrivals gate at Toronto airport embraced by the country's popular foreign minister.
Wearing a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with the word "Canada," 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun smiled at the throng of cameras that greeted her. But she left it to Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland to do the talking.
The minister presented her as a "very brave new Canadian," adding that the young woman -- who spent the last week in a Bangkok airport hotel lobbying for her freedom -- was tired and just wanted to "go to her new home."
"Where we can save a single person, where we can save a single woman, that is a good thing to do," said Ms. Freeland, who refused to answer repeated questions about how this decision will affect Canada's already strained relationship with Saudi Arabia. "And I'd like to also emphasize, this is part of a broader Canadian policy of supporting women and girls in Canada and around the world."
The Saudi teenager became a social media sensation and cause celébrè for women's and refugee rights after fleeing her family during a holiday in Kuwait to seek asylum.
She described her life in an interview with The New York Times as one of unrelenting abuse at the hands of her family, who live in the city of Hail, in northern Saudi Arabia. She said she was once locked in a room for six months because she had cut her hair in a way that her family did not approve of and that her family members used to beat her, particularly her brother.
Two years ago, after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, her family did not seek help for her, she said. It was then she started planning her escape. Her chance for freedom came last week, when her family took a trip to Kuwait, which does not have the same restrictions on women.
But once she arrived in Bangkok last Saturday, planning to travel on to Australia, she said her passport was confiscated and Thai officials threatened to return her to her family. Her brother and father arrived in Bangkok, demanding that she return with them.
Instead, she barricaded herself in a Thai airport hotel, opened a Twitter account and mounted a social media campaign for her asylum.
"I'm in real danger because the Saudi embassy trying to forcing me to go back to Saudi Arabia, while I'm at the airport waiting for my second flight," she wrote in one post in English. In another post, she said: "They will kill me because I fled and because I announced my atheism. They wanted me to pray and to wear a veil, and I didn't want to."
After Thai officials relented, and the United Nations declared her a refugee, the Canadian government agreed to grant her asylum. This further cemented the country's status as a bastion of refuge in a world where Western nations have become increasingly hostile to refugees.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday said his government was "pleased" to provide safe haven for Ms. Alqunun "because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women's rights around the world."
While praise for Canada poured in, human rights groups criticized Australia -- which had been Ms. Alqunun's original destination -- for dragging its feet on her file.
At a press conference two days ago in Bangkok, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said her government was going through the procedural steps to assess Ms. Alqunun as a refugee.
"Why did Rahaf go to Canada instead of her preferred choice of Australia where she had friends?" Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth said in a tweet. "Because she needed safety from her Saudi pursuers fast, and Canada expedited her case while Australia (under Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton) slow-walked it."
Locally, there is concern about whether the move will further damage Canada's already frayed relationship with Saudi Arabia. In August, the kingdom expelled the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh, recalled the Saudi ambassador to Ottawa and froze all new trade and investment deals with Canada after Ms. Freeland's ministry posted two Twitter messages calling on Saudi Arabia to release imprisoned rights activists, including two who have family in Canada.
"It's not going to help for sure," said former Canadian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Dennis Horak in a radio interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation."This will be seen as probably just another example of our interference in Saudi's internal affairs."
Attempts to reach the Saudi Embassy in Canada failed. The kingdom also retaliated against Canada last summer with a series of other measures that included suspending flights by national airline Saudia to Canadian airports and ordering the transfer of thousands of Saudi students studying in Canada elsewhere.
Over the next months, Ms. Alqunun will be able to access Canada's generous immigration programs, including free language classes, monthly checks for food, and help finding and furnishing a home. But first, she will have to get used to the Canadian winters.
"I told her it does get warmer," Ms. Freeland said.

Texto completo: Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, announced on Saturday that he would run for president, one of the most high-profile Latino Democrats ever to seek the party's nomination.
His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico, where he will speak on Monday at the Latino Victory Fund's annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria. Later in the week, his campaign said, he will go to New Hampshire.
"When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago," Mr. Castro said at the Plaza Guadalupe amphitheater in San Antonio, in the neighborhood where he was raised. "I'm sure that she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America."
Mr. Castro's announcement had been expected for several weeks. He established an exploratory committee in December, two months after publishing a memoir, "An Unlikely Journey" -- a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and, perhaps, get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities. This month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states, Iowa and Nevada.
He joins Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former State Senator Richard Ojeda of West Virginia and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland on the list of Democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the party's 2020 nomination. That list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months.
In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Castro emphasized education, calling for a national version of the prekindergarten program he established in San Antonio when he was mayor. To fund the program there, he increased the city's sales tax -- a politically risky proposition, especially in Texas, but San Antonio voters approved it.
His message was firmly progressive. He called for a higher minimum wage, denounced police killings of African-Americans, which he described as "state violence," and embraced the Black Lives Matter movement. He also condemned President Trump's immigration policy, including the practice of family separation and the proposed border wall, and declared that his first executive order if elected would be to rejoin the Paris climate accords, which Mr. Trump left.
George Rodriguez, a conservative blogger, talk-show host and Fox News contributor whom Texas Republican leaders designated as their spokesman on the announcement, said after the speech that the discussion of immigration had stood out to him. Mr. Castro, he said, did not "seem to be able to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration."
Mr. Rodriguez also argued that the San Antonio pre-K program, which was one of Mr. Castro's chief accomplishments as mayor, had duplicated existing programs like Head Start. "How much of an accomplishment that is is rather dubious," he said.
[Read about what Mr. Castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign.]
Mr. Castro, 44, was raised in San Antonio in a politically active family. His mother, Rosie Castro, was an activist with the Mexican-American political party La Raza Unida and frequently took Julián and his twin brother, Joaquin -- now a congressman -- to rallies and meetings. Joaquin Castro will be the chairman of Julián's campaign.
At the age of 26, Mr. Castro became San Antonio's youngest City Council member, and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005, he was elected to the city's top job in 2009. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention -- the same platform that catapulted Barack Obama, then a little-known state senator, to national prominence in 2004. Mr. Obama, as president, later chose him to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In a statement on Saturday, the Republican National Committee previewed one of the main arguments it is likely to use against Mr. Castro, calling him a "lightweight" without the experience needed to be president.
Mr. Castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates.
"In my whole life, I don't think I've ever started out as the front-runner," he told The New York Times last month. "I grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front-runner at anything. So I'm not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front-runner and who they don't."
Among the Democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders, he is one of the youngest. If elected, he would be the third-youngest person ever to become president, after Theodore Roosevelt (42) and John F. Kennedy (43).
The full field of candidates could include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who ran a high-profile but unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year.
Surrounded by his supporters after the speech, Mr. Castro was asked whether he expected to face a fellow Texan, Mr. O'Rourke, in the race. "There will probably be 15 or 20 people in the race, so it's going to be crowded," he said.

Helped spur movement at a Miss. lunch counter

Texto completo: When John Salter Jr. arrived in Mississippi in 1961, he was 27 and had already served in the Army, worked as a labor organizer in Arizona, received a master's degree in sociology and taught at a college in Wisconsin. He was taking a new job as a professor at Tougaloo College, a historically black institution a few miles outside the state capital of Jackson.
Mr. Salter did much more than teach at Tougaloo. He became a close associate of Medgar Evers, the NAACP's Mississippi field secretary, and helped organize what became known as the Jackson Movement.
Mr. Salter, who later changed his name to John Hunter Gray to honor his American Indian heritage, was perceived as white at the time.
Mr. Salter - as he was known throughout his career as an activist and academic - died Jan. 7 at his home in Pocatello, Idaho, at age 84. He had recovered from systemic lupus, said a son, John Salter III, who could not cite a specific cause of death.
In Mississippi, the home of Mr. Salter and his wife became an informal headquarters for civil rights activists.
"We decided to go south because things were happening," he told filmmaker Loki Mulholland for his documentary "An Ordinary Hero," about his mother, Joan Trumpauer Mulholland, who was one of Mr. Salter's students at Tougaloo.
"When history calls, you usually get, I would say, maybe one chance to do something," Mr. Salter added, "and then if you reach out for it, you ride off on the wings of destiny."
At Tougaloo, he organized an NAACP youth council, taught tactics of nonviolence and published a mimeographed newsletter, "North Jackson Action." He conducted a study of poverty in Mississippi for the NAACP and testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
He was also under surveillance by the FBI, which compiled a file of several thousand pages about him. Police officials often tailed Mr. Salter as he walked on the streets or drove on local roads. He once found the lug nuts on his car wheels loosened.
Nonetheless, Mr. Salter became "the Jackson Movement's radical heart," as M.J. O'Brien wrote in his 2013 history, "We Shall Not Be Moved: The Jackson Woolworth's Sit-In and the Movement It Inspired."
After a series of commercial boycotts and protests, the Jackson Movement burst into the nation's consciousness with the dramatic events of May 28, 1963.
That day, Evers called for Mississippi's first sit-in. Students from Tougaloo and other activists planned to enter a Woolworth's department store, sit down at a segregated lunch counter and ask for service.
An all-white crowd of several hundred, many of them young men from a local high school, quickly gathered and began to taunt the protesters, pulling the women off their stools. The male demonstrators were physically attacked.
Mr. Salter soon joined the protesters at the lunch counter. Reporters and a photographer for the Jackson Daily News, Fred Blackwell, captured what happened next.
A former Jackson police officer, Benny Oliver - fired for his violent tendencies - punched black demonstrator Memphis Norman in the head, knocking him down.
"As Mr. Norman lay on the floor," a New York Times account noted, "Mr. Oliver began kicking him in the face until blood spurted from his mouth and nose."
Police officers, who otherwise stood idly by, placed both Oliver and Norman under arrest.
In Blackwell's famous photograph of the incident, Mr. Salter sits in the left foreground at the counter alongside two Tougaloo students, Joan Trumpauer - one of the college's two white undergraduates - and Anne Moody.
"Annie and I were pulled off our stools," Trumpauer, now Joan Mulholland, said in an interview. "I didn't get any bad blows, but I had every condiment on the counter poured on my head."
Mr. Salter was struck with brass knuckles and slashed in the back of the head with the edge of a broken glass sugar container. A watery pepper solution was thrown in his eyes. His cuts and abrasions were filled with salt and pepper. Blood dripped onto his shirt and mixed with the ketchup, mustard and sugar that had been dumped on his head.
Cigarettes were stubbed out on the back of Mr. Salter's neck, leaving scars that were visible for the rest of his life.
"We knew we were going to die," Joan Mulholland said. "My spirit had left my body and was hovering somewhere above, protecting me."
The ordeal lasted for three hours. The police stepped in only when the mob began to loot and damage the store.
The demonstrators were escorted out only after the president of Tougaloo College was able to organize a caravan of cars to take them to safety.
In the next few days, further demonstrations were held in Jackson. Police tactics grew tougher, as Mr. Salter and other protesters were arrested, hauled away in garbage trucks and held in cattle pens at the local fairgrounds.
"In some instances," Mr. Salter recalled, "police urinated in water buckets, threw the food on the ground and said, 'Eat, dogs, eat.' "
On June 11, two weeks after the lunch-counter protest, President John F. Kennedy went on national television to call for a comprehensive national civil rights bill. That night, Evers was assassinated at his home.
The next day, Mr. Salter was arrested during a protest march and beaten until he "woke up in a pool of muddy blood." He was taken to the fairgrounds, where other demonstrators were being held.
"I stepped out of the paddy wagon and held my fist up," he said. "You know in a nice early '60s stance. Probably one of the first times that had been done, and was immediately cheered by a whole throng of people."
After a suspicious car accident in which Mr. Salter and a chaplain were seriously injured, he left Mississippi and continued his civil rights activities in North Carolina and elsewhere. A year later, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law.
John Randall Salter Jr. was born Feb. 14, 1934, in Chicago. He grew up mostly in Flagstaff, Ariz., where his father, an American Indian descended from several tribes in the Northeast, was an artist and college professor. His mother was a teacher.
After serving in the Army and helping organize labor unions at mining camps, Mr. Salter graduated in 1958 from Arizona State University, from which he received a master's degree in sociology in 1960.
He alternated between teaching and activism, moving from Vermont to the state of Washington, from Rochester, N.Y., to Chicago, where he worked with street gangs. He taught at the University of Iowa, at a college for Navajo Indians (now Diné College) in Arizona and from 1980 to 1994, at the University of North Dakota, where he directed the Department of American Indian Studies.
Mr. Salter, who settled in Idaho in 1997, legally changed his name in homage to his ancestors; Gray had been his father's last name before he was adopted by a white family.
His wife of 54 years, the former Eldri Johanson, died in 2015. Survivors include four children, Maria Salter and Josephine Evans, both of Pocatello, and John Salter III and Peter Salter, both of Lincoln, Neb.; a brother; 12 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
In 1979, Mr. Salter published a book about his civil rights experiences, "Jackson, Mississippi: An American Chronicle of Struggle and Schism."
"Nobody who was part of it can forget it," he told filmmaker Mulholland. "You don't have to remember every detail, just remember that you know there was a time when a pretty hideous situation existed and there were people who set out to change it."

Have a cleaner house in no time

Texto completo: Sometimes it seems an insurmountable task to keep up with home maintenance. No need to worry. Take the advice of these cleaning experts, who have sketched out 10 quick-and-easy shortcuts that’ll help you fake the fact that you haven’t dusted in weeks: 1. Live like your home is for sale.
Instead of thinking of tidying up as a chore, consider that you are simply putting your best foot forward. Those who open the door to regular homebuyer visits must keep their homes in shipshape. With that mindset, it’s easier to do simple things like scooping up newspapers, putting away the breakfast dishes and wiping down the dining room table. "Create the showcase space you want to come home to everyday," says Marni Jameson, a syndicated columnist and author of "Downsizing the Family Home" (Sterling, 2016).
2. Clean while you cook.
To avoid a bad case of "grungy kitchen," start every meal prep by emptying the dishwasher so it’s ready to fill. Then, before you start cooking, keep the sink filled with hot water and dish soap. "As you finish with a utensil or a pan, drop it into the sink to start the cleaning process," suggests Linda Cobb, author of The New York Times best-selling "Queen of Clean" book series (Pocket Books). In addition, use a spoon rest to keep dirty utensils and food from spilling all over the counter.
3. Establish (reasonable) daily cleaning habits.
To keep cleanup tasks from piling up, add some daily chores to your routine that aren’t too hard to follow. Making the bed right after working up and putting away your toiletries right after using them are simple goals to start. Always hang towels up and put toilet lids down. "If something needs sweeping, wiping, washing or folding, do it that minute, so nothing snowballs," Jameson says.
4. Don’t neglect the bathroom.
Since this room can get really messy — fast — stay on top of it by keeping a microfiber cloth under the sink and using it daily. "Before you leave the house, wring the cloth out in warm water and wipe all the sink surfaces and faucets," Cobb suggests. In addition, make sure everybody has a place to hang up towels and washcloths and use baskets under the sink to store hair styling tools and products.
5. Smells matter.
If you can’t thoroughly clean a room, don’t despair. Spritzing a favorite home fragrance or light a candle. "If a room smells clean, you’ll feel less stressed that you haven’t had as much time to clean it," says Leslie Reichert, a green and author of "The Joy of Green Cleaning" (CreateSpace, 2015).
6. When in doubt, fluff and straighten.
It’s a small thing, but merely fluffing the pillows, straightening the chairs around your table and even putting fresh flowers on a table can make the entire room look cleaner, Reichert adds. To fluff the pillows really well, toss them in the dryer on the "air fluff" setting. "This removes dust and pet dander," Cobb says. "Just be sure that you’re not overcrowding the dryer."
7. Focus on the floors.
There’s nothing worse than a mountain of dust bunnies to make you feel like your house is sloppy. So, after you vacuum your floors, go over high-traffic areas with a dry microfiber mop and your favorite spray cleaner. "This is quick to do and it makes the floors look good," Reichert says. "When your floors look clean, the whole room looks better."
8. Don’t underestimate the power of the basket.
If your living room is filled with a mishmash of Legos, magazines and DVDs, consider purchasing a basket (or two) to keep that room looking neat and organized. "I like baskets that are large enough to hold everything," Cobb says.
9. Corral the mudroom.
Instead of seeing the clutter of multiple coats, boots and shoes when you first walk into your house, keep everything behind closed doors. "Get a toy box or some type of box with a lid to store the shoes and boots," Reichert says. "Or, install a shoe storage hanger behind a door."
10. Take a snapshot of each room at its cleanest.
The next time you clean a room from top-to-bottom, take a picture of it in all its sparkling glory. This photographic evidence is especially helpful if you want your kids to pitch in and clean up. "A photo helps moms show their children how the room should look when they tell them to go clean their room," Reichert says.

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.

As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

'Midnight' a 25-year boon for Savannah

Texto completo: Author John Berendt published "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" 25 years ago Sunday. To many Savannahians, that iconic bestseller will forever be known simply as "The Book."
Ostensibly written as a nonfiction suspense story about a notable Savannah murder and subsequent trial, "Midnight" dripped with real-life eccentric characters rendered in Southern gothic style and was full of evocative descriptions. It also featured a stunning, eerie cover photo of the Bird Girl statue that gifted photographer Jack Leigh shot beneath curtains of Spanish moss at Bonaventure Cemetery.
As if a story about a man tried for the same murder four times wasn't enough, throw in a colorful drag queen, a self-proclaimed voodoo priestess and a steamy portrayal of high society and you get a book that ruled the New York Times bestseller list for a record-setting 216 weeks.
A movie had to follow, of course. And it did.
In 1997, Clint Eastwood directed the film starring Kevin Spacey and John Cusack. The movie was filmed in Savannah and dozens of locals had supporting roles and bit parts. The city itself was the star, however, as Eastwood's lens lingered over all that is beautiful in our town.
A turning point
In 1981, Jim Williams, a well-known man about town, a semi-closeted gay antiques dealer and a self-made millionaire, allegedly murdered his openly gay lover Danny Hansford, who is described in "Midnight" as "a walking streak of sex." The murder took place in Monterey Square's Mercer House, which Williams had meticulously restored.
Savannah was shocked. The crime was violent, unseemly and brought to light things most Savannahians preferred not to talk about in front of company: sex, money and the difference in how someone who was rich and well-educated was treated compared to someone who was poor and on the edges of society.
The murder of Hansford and the trials that followed didn't get much publicity outside Georgia. But that all changed when Berendt published "Midnight."
By any measure, "The Book" changed Savannah and served as a real turning point for the city's tourism industry. Previously, tourism in Savannah was mostly confined to regional travelers ogling at antebellum homes saved from Civil War destruction, strolling through our green squares and enjoying our pedestrian-friendly urban plan.
Before "The Book," Savannah was still "old" Savannah, a community where change was not always welcome.
"For me, Savannah's resistance to change was its saving grace," Berendt astutely observed in "Midnight." "The city looked inward, sealed off from the noises and distractions of the world at large. It grew inward, too, and in such a way that its people flourished like hothouse plants tended by an indulgent gardener. The ordinary became extraordinary. Eccentrics thrived. Every nuance and quirk of personality achieved greater brilliance in that lush enclosure than would have been possible anywhere else in the world."
Raising Savannah's profile
"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" turned the spotlight on Savannah. Once "The Book" exploded on the nation's stage, the world could not get enough of Savannah.
Some locals hated "Midnight" and what they thought it said about their town. They hated the hustle and bustle of the filming, the crowds and having their special places discovered by the masses.
Other locals loved the attention and the tourist dollars that rolled in. There were book tours on foot and by trolley, as well as midnight picnics for a fee in Bonaventure Cemetery. Tickets for The Lady Chablis' drag shows at Club One on Jefferson Street sold out quickly to wide-eyed tourists.
Savannah's tourism industry grew into a dynamo, responsible for bringing more and more visitors to Georgia's First City each year. Empty storefronts on Broughton Street filled with businesses. Savannah became the place to be.
So, this weekend, dust off your copy of "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' head over to Bonaventure, sit on the Conrad Aiken bench and raise a martini to Berendt. Let's thank this talented author for his role in helping to make Savannah the vital, thriving, cosmopolitan city it is today.

NOT JUST NAMATH

Texto completo: Almost every recollection of Super Bowl III begins and ends with Joe Namath.
As they should.
Namath commanded all the attention 50 years ago on that Jan. 12, 1969 day in Miami's Orange Bowl.
First, with his pregame guarantee that his New York Jets would defeat the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts. Then, with his MVP play at quarterback in a 16-7 victory by the renegade Jets that shocked the pro football world and led to the merger between the NFL and AFL.
Namath readily admits he didn't pull out the victory over a Colts team that was favored by almost three touchdowns on his own. He had plenty of help.
So here's a look at the 10 best players in Super Bowl III not named Joe Namath:
10. Jim Turner The Jets' veteran placekicker, who later played for Denver, connected on 3-of-4 field goal attempts, and if you don't think that's important then you weren't watching the ending of the Bears-Eagles game last Sunday.
Turner's field goals were from 36, 30 and nine yards. Yes, nine yards. Don't forget that the goal posts in those days were on the goal line, not at the back of the end zone.
The nine-yarder upped the Jets' lead to 16-0 early in the fourth quarter.
9. Billy Baird Free safety Baird was given the assignment, with occasional help from others in the secondary, of defending John Mackey, the Colts' future Hall of Fame tight end.
Assistant coach Walt Michaels' strategy worked, as Mackey was a non-factor, with three catches for 35 yards. Baird had 34 interceptions in his Jets' career.
8. John Schmitt The veteran center nearly missed the game with pneumonia.
But he played – and played well – despite suffering from dehydration and near exhaustion. After the game, however, he vomited into a locker. Nearby, Namath was reliving his guarantee to the media.
7. John Elliott A bit undersized for a nose tackle, Elliott stood his ground against the Colts' bigger offensive linemen, not allowing Baltimore's running game to dominate.
"He didn't get the notoriety he deserved," said tight end Pete Lammons, Elliott's teammate at the University of Texas and the Jets. "He was as good a defensive tackle as there was in the game, either the AFL or NFL. We all thought very highly of him."
Elliott died of cancer in 2010 at age 66.
6. Al Atkinson Known for his soft hands, the middle linebacker tipped a Colts pass that was intercepted by cornerback Randy Beverly.
Atkinson, who intercepted 21 passes in his career, also helped Elliott clog up the middle, limiting where Baltimore's runners could go.
5. Randy Beverly The Colts thought their best passing approach was to test the Jets' right cornerback. The plan didn't work as Beverly had two of the Jets' four interceptions.
In three years as a Jet, the Wildwood native intercepted 10 passes. There were times when his ball-hawking worked against him, but not in the biggest game he played in.
4. Winston Hill The Jets' offensive plan was to run behind Hill, their all-star left tackle, and that's what Matt Snell did on a majority of his 30 carries.
Hill dominated defensive end Ordell Braase, one of the best Colts defenders. The success of the running game enabled Namath, who checked off a lot of plays at the line of scrimmage, to pass when he wanted to, not when he had to.
When Hill died in 2016 at age 74, teammate Emerson Boozer remembered: "You could not meet a nicer person off the field. But on the field? Winnie was vicious."
3. George Sauer, Jr. Since Don Maynard, the future Hall of Fame wide receiver, had caught six passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns in the Jets' win over the Raiders in the AFL championship game, Colts coach Don Shula devised a plan to contain Maynard.
What Shula didn't know was that Maynard was slowed by a pulled left hamstring he suffered in mid-December.
While Maynard didn't catch a pass, Sauer had eight receptions for 133 yards, with five catches producing first downs.
Sauer retired at age 27 and died in 2013 at age 69 after battling Alzheimer's disease.
2. Dave Herman Jets coach Weeb Ewbank benched rookie Sam Walton for the AFL title game, moving Herman from right guard to right tackle. He decided to stick with Herman against Bubba Smith.
Smith produced only one sack and was a non-factor even though he was seven inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Herman, who was a senior at Michigan State when Smith arrived as a freshman.
"I thought that, for I don't know how many years, I wasn't the one who got the ball to the receivers or to either the halfback or fullback," Herman said years later. "But I was the one that made it possible."
Herman announced in 2014 that he was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
1. Matt Snell All Snell did was rush for 121 yards and the only Jets touchdown. And, oh yeah, he contributed a tackle on punt coverage.
Snell sensed the Colts were reeling after Lou Michaels, Walt's brother, missed an early 27-yard field goal try. "You could almost feel the steam go out of them," Snell said.
Snell is a member of the Jets' Wall of Honor, but he has boycotted other team functions.
He reportedly is angry that the late Leon Hess, the Jets' owner during the 1980s and 90s, did not write a job recommendation for him after Snell said Hess said he would.
The Joe Namath factor Of course, Broadway Joe was more than a game manager under the bright lights. Both before and during the game he got under the Colts' skin.
Besides the victory guarantee, Namath poked fun at Earl Morrall, who was the Colts' starting quarterback because Johnny Unitas, who engineered a fourth-quarter TD drive that produced Baltimore's only points, was limited by a rib injury.
"There are five quarterbacks in the AFL better than Morrall," Namath told the late Dave Anderson, the New York Times' sports columnist. "You put Babe Parilli (Namath's veteran backup) with Baltimore instead of Morrall, and Baltimore might be better. Babe throws better than Morrall."
Many of his teammates were convinced Namath's words wore on the Colts as the game progressed.
So did his unpredictable play. Normally a gambler with a high interception rate, Namath completed 17 of 26 passes for 206 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions. He did not attempt a pass in the fourth quarter.
Years later, Morrall said: "I'm still not sure what happened that day."
The Jets know.
And 50 years later, they haven't stopped talking about it.

The GOP is finally turning a new leaf in rejecting bigotry

Texto completo: Shahid Shafi, the Muslim vice chairman of the Tarrant County Republican Party, was reassured by his fellow Texans that the recent petition from a small but vocal minority to remove him from his position due to his faith was, on its face, absurd.

On Thursday, the committee voted 139-49 in favor of Shafi, with 10 abstentions, to have him remain in the party.

In a statement, Tarrant County Party Chairman Darl Easton said, "This vote reaffirms the commitment by a majority of Tarrant County Republicans to our core values and moral compass, a demonstration of our allegiance to the Texas Republican Party Platform and the Constitutions of the United States and Texas, which strictly prohibit religious and racial discrimination of any kind."

Shafi told the committee he was "honored and privileged" and wouldn't hold any ill will toward the members who voted to have him removed.

It should not have come down to this. The concept of holding a religious litmus test is completely un-American. But in the larger context, Republicans are turning over a new leaf, especially with respect to speaking out against bigotry.

Earlier in the week, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, in an interview with the New York Times, appeared to embrace white supremacist tenets, saying, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”

Within hours, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King, saying, "Everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation."

He went on to say, "Steve’s language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society. The Declaration of Independence states that ‘all men are created equal.’ That is a fact. It is self-evident."

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., also denounced King. The National Review editorial board published an article with the title, "Dump Steve King." Washington Examiner contributor Kimberly Ross wrote a rebuke of King as well.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the first African-American senator from South Carolina, slammed King, writing in an op-ed in the Washington Post, "King’s comments are not conservative views but separate views that should be ridiculed at every turn possible."

Scott's original point was that Republicans are accused of racism because they are silent in cases such as King's. The tides seem to be changing.

Already, Gov. Kim Reynolds, R-Iowa, in the wake of his comments, declined to endorse King in his 2020 primary election after Republican state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced his candidacy for King's congressional seat.

Bigotry is, of course, not just limited to the Republican Party. Democrats such as Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, have renewed Sen. Dianne Feinstein's, D-Calif., line of attack by suggesting a federal judicial nominee is unfit to serve because of his Catholic faith. Save for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's, D-Hawaii, rebuke, Democrats have been largely silent. The same can be said about newly elected Reps. Ilhan Omar's, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib's, D-Mich., anti-Semitic comments.

It's important to condemn bigotry in any instance, but a show of true consistency is speaking out when those on your side of the aisle are doing it.

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

Resumen: Pegan is a hybrid of the paleo and vegan diets. It was coined in 2014 but has recently gained steam.

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest since last year and has seen a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet?
In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A vegan diet is refraining from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2. 5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.

How does pegan differ from vegan and paleo diets?
Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat?
Plants.
Basically most of your diet will be comprised of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding eating dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises to reach for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And like most diets – sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.

Is the pegan diet safe?
Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn’t one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it’s a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds. "
What are the benefits?
Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it does have proven benefits for some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health. "
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, which is where plant-based eaters would mostly get their protein from and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It’s a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern, which many of us consume in North America, which is not healthy for us. "
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist at her own consulting firm and former director of brand advocacy for Weight Watchers, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she ended up enjoying the journey and the ultimate results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual. "

Texto completo: Suffolk law enforcement officials said the three males charged in connection with the stabbing of a Huntington High School student outside a fast-food restaurant Wednesday afternoon are members of the MS-13 street gang - though it is not clear if the attack was gang-related.
Ramon Arevalo Lopez, 19; Oscar Canales Molina, 17; and Nobeli Montes Zuniga, 20, all of Huntington Station, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of second-degree assault in Central Islip. District Court Judge Gaetan Lozito ordered them held on bail of $35,000 cash or $75,000 bond. 
Suffolk District Attorney Timothy Sini said a group of students from the high school was eating at a Burger King on New York Avenue not far from the school about 3:30 p.m. when they noticed six young men whom they recognized from school, "staring at them in a menacing way."
Sini said all three of those arrested had attended Huntington High School.
The students left and the other group chased them into a rear parking lot and attacked them with bats and knives, Sini said. Arevalo Lopez stabbed one 16-year-old boy in the back and another boy was injured, he said. Both were treated for non-life threatening injuries.
Sini said the attackers fled in a black 2007 Toyota with a large spoiler. When officers stopped the car shortly afterward, the three had blood on their clothes and hands.
Arevalo Lopez "made admissions" to committing the stabbing, and the others also made incriminating statements, he said.
Two knives were taken from Canales Molina, including a small one that appeared to be covered in blood, which was found in his shoe, the Suffolk District Attorney's Office said in a release.
Each of the three suspects had entered the country illegally, Sini said., and  were in the Suffolk Police Department's database of likely gang members.
Canales Molina and Montes Zuniga's attorneys could not be reached for comment.
Arevalo Lopez's attorney, Jason Bassett of Hauppauge, said his client is no gang member.
"By all accounts he's a gentle and unassuming young man who's not a MS-13 member," Bassett said. "He's an innocent young man. We're going to fight these charges vigorously."
Bassett said the fight had nothing to do with the gang.
"While it's not clear what the fight was about, it is clear that the defendants are all members of the MS-13 gang," Suffolk Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said. As a result of the attack and concerns about possible retaliation, Hart said officers were stationed at the high school all day Thursday at the school district's request.
Despite the daytime attack in a busy shopping area, Sini and Hart said they have made great strides in fighting MS-13. Gang incidents are down significantly from 2015 and 2016, Sini said.
The arrests come after dozens of residents turned out Tuesday to question Suffolk police officials about what role a school resource officer played in the deportation of a Huntington High student.
The crowd of more than 50 people at the monthly community meeting at the Second Precinct in Huntington aired concerns about the handling of the student. The deportation came to light in a New York Times/ProPublica article that The New York Times Magazine posted online in late December. 
The student was arrested in June 2017 by federal immigration officials after he was questioned by the school resource officer - who has since been reassigned to another school - and the principal about what they believed to be his gang activities, according to the account. Identified only as "Alex," the boy was sent back to his native Honduras, the article said.
The police department "is satisfied that the proper procedures were followed,"  a public information officer said in an email. The Huntington School District is reviewing its relationship with the department.

Texto completo: Sometimes a whale just wants to change its tune.
That’s one of the things researchers have learned recently by eavesdropping on whales in several parts of the world and listening for changes in their pattern and pitch. Together, the new studies suggest that whales are not just whistling in the water, but constantly evolving a form of communication that we are only beginning to understand.
Most whales and dolphins vocalize, but dolphins and toothed whales mostly make clicking and whistling sounds. Humpbacks, and possibly bowheads, sing complex songs with repeated patterns, said Michael Noad, an associate professor in the Cetacean Ecology and Acoustics Laboratory at the University of Queensland in Australia.
Birds may broadcast their social hierarchy among song-sharing populations by allowing the dominant bird to pick the playlist and patterns. But how and why whales pass song fragments across hundreds of miles, and to thousands of animals, is far more mysterious.
The biggest question is why whales sing at all.
“The thing that always gets me out of bed in the morning is the function of the song,” Noad said. “I find humpback song fascinating from the point of view of how it’s evolved.”
The leading hypothesis is that male humpbacks - only the males sing - are trying to attract females. But they may also switch tunes when another male is nearby, apparently to assess a rival’s size and fitness, said Noad, who was the senior author of one of four new papers on whale songs.
Cultural evolution
Why the humpbacks’ musical patterns tend to be more complex than those of other whales is also a bit murky. Noad suggested the development may be the result of “runaway selection.”
Early humpbacks with complex songs were so much more successful at mating that they gained a substantial evolutionary advantage over their brethren with simpler vocalizations. This led to some very large, sometimes very noisy animals.
In one of the new studies, led by scientists at the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, researchers tracked humpbacks singing along the east and west coasts of Africa, comparing songs sung by those off the coast of Gabon to those near Madagascar.
The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, confirmed that the two populations interact, noting overlap in their vocalizations. The researchers recorded songs annually from 2001 to 2005 using hand-held hydrophones aboard boats.
“Male humpback whales within a population tend to sing the same song type, but it’s continuously changing and evolving over time,” said Melinda Rekdahl, the study’s first author and a marine conservation scientist with the wildlife society. “It’s thought to be one of the best examples of cultural evolution in the animal kingdom.”
Singing a new tune
Two additional recent studies examined how the songs change, seasonally and across years.
In one paper, Jenny Allen, who was a doctoral student with Noad, found an unexpected pattern among humpbacks. Once their songs reach a certain level of complexity, humpbacks drop that tune entirely and pick up a new, simpler one. Her study, the first to quantify the complexity of the songs, was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.
Assuming that the songs are meant to attract females, “it might be that a brand-new song is a bit sexier than continuing to sing the complicated version of the old song,” said Allen, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Queensland and a lecturer at Griffith University in Australia.
But because it’s hard to memorize a whole new song, “they’re simplifying it to make it easy to learn so much new material all at once.”
In another new paper, researchers at the University of Brest in France found the pitch of Antarctic blue whale, pygmy blue whale and fin whale vocalizations fell from 2007 to 2016 at various recording sites in the southern Indian Ocean.
Because of a whale’s anatomy, a louder call is higher in pitch, and a quieter one is lower. Essentially, the whales have gotten slightly quieter, said Emmanuelle Leroy, now a research fellow at the University of New South Wales and an author of the new research.
Her team has two hypotheses to explain the drop in pitch. With the populations rebounding since the end of commercial whaling, perhaps the whales don’t need their calls to carry as far to be heard by others. Or perhaps with oceans acidifying because of climate change, the calls are naturally carrying farther, allowing the whales to reduce their volume.
The team does not believe the change in pitch is tied directly to human activity.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and environmentalist who has been pushing for President Trump's impeachment, will not be running for president in 2020.

Steyer, 61, whose "Need to Impeach" petition to oust Trump from the White House has amassed almost 6.7 million signatures, won't contest the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier told the Washington Examiner .

Steyer was in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday to talk with teachers and students about education policy as part of his "Five Rights" platform, a set of priority issues he starting promoting last year. The megadonor told CNN last October he may endorse another presidential hopeful who shared similar values.

Steyer was also in the first-in-the-nation caucus state this week to host a town hall and meet with Iowa Latino and Asia Coalition representatives. He has been traveling to early-nominating states as he mulled whether he wanted to vie for the White House.

"I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove this president. Not because I disagree with his policies," Steyer said in a tweet. "Not because we hold different ideologies. But because the right time to do the right thing is ALWAYS right now."

Steyer's decision comes after he invested $120 million ahead of the 2018 elections to support Democratic candidates. After posting an advertisement on LinkedIn in December seeking staff, the New York Times reported he had hired a campaign manager, conducted polling, and had poached former Massachusetts Gov. Patrick Deval's top adviser. The newspaper reported on Wednesday he would instead give $40 million to further his impeachment efforts.

Texto completo: President Trump said hours before his Oval Office address Tuesday night that he didn't think it would change anyone's mind.

“It’s not going to change a damn thing, but I’m still doing it,” Trump said Tuesday, according to the New York Times.

Trump used his first Oval Office address to the nation to argue that the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is a humanitarian crisis that demands a border wall. But he was instantly rebutted by congressional Democratic leaders, and the two sides are no closer to a solution Wednesday morning.

Trump is headed to Capitol Hill Wednesday to have lunch with Senate Republicans, and will later meet with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders to continue negotiations for a funding bill that he hopes can include money to build a border wall.

The president says he will not sign a bill that does not include funding for the border wall, and has said law enforcement officers believe $5.7 billion is necessary for the physical barrier.

Democratic leaders have said that they would not grant the money Trump demands for the wall, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has called it “immoral.”

One option still open to Trump is declaring a national emergency at the border to loosen up federal funding to build a wall. Even though Trump did not declare an emergency during his prime-time speech Tuesday night, a source close to the president told Axios in a report published Wednesday that a national emergency declaration is still the most likely option.

'ON POINT' CO-HOST FOLKENFLIK OPENS SERIES

Texto completo: David Folkenflik will take your questions now.
Or, more precisely, he will Tuesday, when he opens the new season of Point Park University's Media Innovators speaker series.
Mr. Folkenflik, NPR media correspondent and co-host of "On Point," appears at the school's brand new Pittsburgh Playhouse, Downtown. He also is the author of "Murdoch's World: The Last of the Old Media Empires."
"We wanted people who were innovative in the media in some way, and who could speak to the changes that are happening in media and society today," said Andrew Conte, director of the Center for Media Innovation. "So, having David come in and speak about the media was important, a good way to kick off the project."
Mr. Folkenflik really enjoys the give-and-take of a conversation.
"I want it to feel like a live, organic back-and-forth," he said. "I thrive off of that."
So, no long lectures. Students are encouraged to engage their guest about issues - whether it's the president's latest slam on the media, Netflix pulling an episode of "Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj" on order from the Saudi government, or something else entirely.
Although Point Park launched the speaker series last year with Newsmax founder Chris Ruddy, activist and rapper Jasiri X and NFL Hall of Fame writer John Clayton, there was no unifying thread. This season brings together four national reporters to focus on the state of media in America today.
In addition to Mr. Folkenflik, Nathaniel Rich, novelist and New York Times Magazine writer-at-large, will speak Feb. 21 at the Highmark Theatre. He authored the Times' remarkable interactive feature "Losing Earth," which starkly outlines society's failure to stop climate change.
Also on board is Melissa Block (March 19, PNC Theatre), an NPR special correspondent and former host of "All Things Considered." NPR political correspondent Don Gonyea (May 9, Highmark Theatre) will close out the series.
Mr. Folkenflik described the "dizzying, bewildering array of events and stories and trends and dynamics playing out in front of us" as providing more than enough topics for him on any given day. Journalists are working harder than ever but finding roadblocks in many ways, from politicians declaring theoretical war on the so-called media "enemy of the people" to harsh economic realities.
"Two things stand out," he said. "One of which is that social media has hijacked how people consume news. . They are still consuming news that's even produced by traditional news organizations - and their digital cousins - but they are doing it through Facebook and Twitter and Reddit and other places.
"And when it comes to Facebook and Twitter and Google News, those are the guys who are monetizing this stuff, as opposed to [traditional outlets such as newspapers], who create it. And that's a huge problem.
"The second, of course, is that social media has added jet fuel to the claim attributed to almost everyone: that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is just putting on its boots."
This "tsunami of information" is something "people have to wade and swim through."
And that can obscure the truth.
"We are constantly swimming in pixels, and it's just too much," he said.
But there's still an upside.
"There is also more good stuff, a hell of a lot of good stuff is available to you," he said. "The challenge of the journalist is to make it as clear and compelling and as trustworthy as possible."
For all its faults, Twitter, Mr. Folkenflik said, can be an extraordinarily useful tool. He processes daily reads of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and Washington Post, among other traditional news sources, but bolsters his news intake by following certain journalists, a wide spectrum of politicians, activists, lawyers and policymakers.
"Even as it's a site swimming in abuse and vitriol and misinformation, I find that by trying to follow people I judge to be interesting and reliable, I can find an incredible amount of productive information," he said.
Mr. Folkenflik's event begins at 7 p.m. and tickets are $25. Prices vary from speaker to speaker, up to $50. For series subscription and meet-and-greet package information call the Playhouse box office at 412-392-8000 or go to www.pittsburghplayhouse.com.

CULTURE MONSTER; A classical comeback; Following the end of her 'Composer' podcast, Nadia Sirota will bring the format to the stage

Texto completo: In the 1980s, while other kids plastered their bedroom walls with posters of Michael Jordan suspended in air mid-dunk or the New Kids on the Block showing off well-coiffed manes, Nadia Sirota decorated her room with heroes of a different sort: early 20th century modernist composers.
"I was obsessed with Benjamin Britten and Stravinsky when I was a little kid," the 36-year-old violist, curator and podcast host says. "Hindemith, too. I cut all three of their names out of construction paper and put them on my walls."
Sirota's musical taste evolved and expanded over the years, but her obsession with inventive, forward-looking composers never dissipated; it intensified into a clearly defined mission: to share contemporary classical music with the widest possible audience.

In pursuit of that goal, Sirota will appear onstage at the Theatre at Ace Hotel this Saturday alongside composers Andrew Norman and Caroline Shaw and new music ensemble wild Up for the first iteration of "Living Music Live!"
Presented by Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA, this hybrid conversation-concert will draw audiences into the music and creative processes of Norman and Shaw, with wild Up performing demonstrations and excerpts and Sirota acting as musical sherpa and host.
The format and tone of "Living Music Live!" will feel familiar to fans of "Meet the Composer," the Peabody Award-winning podcast that Sirota created and hosted from 2014 to 2017 for New York Public Radio's Q2 Music, the online new music platform of WQXR that has since been rebranded as New Sounds.
Each hourlong episode was a colorful sonic portrait of one living composer. Whether she was dissecting the complex structures of a piece such as Norman's "Play" through the metaphor of video games or reveling in the expansive beauty of John Luther Adams' compositions through the imagery of the vast, barren Alaskan landscape he calls home, Sirota's conversational approach to interviewing and storytelling, along with her unbridled enthusiasm for her subjects, imbued the show with an entertaining, informative, accessible tone that appealed to music aficionados and the randomly curious.
Composer Nico Muhly, Sirota's longtime friend, former Juilliard classmate and the subject of one "Meet the Composer" episode, said that listening to the podcast was similar to watching Sirota dissect and perform a new piece of music on her viola.
"The podcast is like a slowed-down version of her ability to understand what is going on in a piece of music and communicate it to an audience," Muhly said. "For me, what is interesting is that sometimes the podcast sounds a lot like conversations Nadia and I would have in our day-to-day lives. When she and I speak about music, it's pretty much shoptalk. But she manages to communicate it in such a way that you'll totally get it even if you're not a musician."
Collaborating with composers and performing their music is a familiar experience for Sirota. At Juilliard, where she studied viola as an undergraduate and graduate student, she sought out composer friends like Muhly to write music for her, much of which she later recorded across four solo albums.
In high school, Sirota took composition lessons but found she preferred bringing her fellow composition students' musical creations to life in concerts to writing her own.
Growing up in New England, Sirota was surrounded by composers and new music, and not just on her bedroom walls. Her father, Robert, is a composer; her older brother, Jonah, is a violist, chamber musician and composer. Her mother was a church organist and choir director before she became an Episcopal priest.
That led the instrumentalist and tastemaker to fun opportunities, including making a cameo on Amazon's "Mozart in the Jungle" and performing with Paul Simon on "SNL" and his farewell tour.
"Everything I do, all the different branches of my life that seem disparate, they all have a common goal. It's about following joy," she says, calling the podcast her "passion project."
That passion project was a success, with monthly downloads reaching 10 times what a No. 1 classical album sells in a month, Sirota says. But it hit a snag.
In 2017, New York Public Radio underwent what Sirota describes as a "slight restructuring." Sirota was asked to re-pitch her show and start over with a new concept, something she was unwilling to do. Her mission and vision for the podcast were crystal clear, she said, and she wasn't interested in working on a version of the show she was less passionate about.
"This goal of making the audience for contemporary classical music larger, for me, that is the thing," Sirota says.
She wanted to continue with "Meet the Composer" but did not own the material she had created.
"I didn't own the name. I didn't own any of the content. New York Public Radio owned it all," she says. "In that moment I realized that I didn't need to ask someone's permission or wait for somebody else to tell me what I needed to do. I can be responsible for my own content and move forward."
"Ever since 'Meet the Composer' ended, I've been waiting for a new show to fill the niche it left behind," Joshua Barone wrote in the New York Times just last week. He's not alone, and thanks to Sirota's hustle, and dedication to her mission, fans won't have to wait much longer.

Texto completo: Television anchors from cable and broadcast news channels attended an off-the-record lunch at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, hours before President Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech on border security Tuesday evening.

Among those in attendance at the lunch were CNN’s Chris Cuomo and Fox News’ Bret Baier. The New York Times reported they were expected to have lunch in the White House’s Roosevelt Room.

Trump’s Oval Office speech is set to be televised by major networks such as CNN at 9 p.m., two days before Trump is planning to visit the Mexican border on Thursday amid a partial government shutdown resulting from a dispute over border wall funding.

Trump is expected to make the case for funds to build a border wall, and argue that the lack of border security has become a national crisis that affects the safety of all Americans. The White House has said Trump wrote the speech.

Trump has long discussed building a border wall and has requested more than $5 billion in funding to build it, but Democrats have not agreed to such a proposal. In recent days, Trump has entertained the possibility of declaring a national emergency to direct military funding toward a border wall, but officials familiar with the president’s speech claim Trump is not planning to announce such an action.

The lack of any agreement has led to a partial government shutdown that has lasted more than two weeks and has affected about 800,000 federal workers.

Texto completo: A federal jury in Wilkes-Barre recently cast some much-needed light on a shadowy aspect of the justice system, while awarding $450,000 to a man who had been abused by a private-sector prisoner transportation company.
Darren Richardson, 53, of Spring Hill, Florida, filed suit in 2015 against Prisoner Transport Services of America, a Tennessee-based company that counts among its clients Lackawanna County and others in Pennsylvania.
Richardson was wanted in Pike County for failing to pay $250 fine for writing a bad check in 2008, when he was stopped in Florida for a traffic offense on May 29, 2013. Pike County extradited him and hired Prisoner Transport Services of America to return him to Milford.
In his suit, Richardson alleged that company personnel had urinated on him, denied him food and shackled his ankles so tightly that he had lost circulation.
According to James Conaboy of Scranton, Richardson’s lawyer, Prisoner Transport Services of America had been sued more than 20 times in counties nationwide.
According to a 2016 investigation by the investigative news organization the Marshall Project, published in The New York Times, at least five prisoners have died from abuse or neglect while being transported by the company. Another dozen prisoners and guards have died in van crashes since 2000.
The U.S. Surface Transportation Board complained about for-profit prisoner transport in 2016 and the Department of Justice opened an inquiry, but nothing has come of it.
Congress should establish stringent standards for for-profit prisoner transport, the DOJ civil rights division should ensure enforcement.

Texto completo: As the new year dawned, the top editor at the Associated Press - one of the most influential journalists in the country, though hers is not a household name - was making a resolution.
"We should all resolve to spend less time, or perhaps no time at all, on horse race polls that project forward to the 2020 presidential election," Sally Buzbee said on CNN's "Reliable Sources."
The Atlantic's James Fallows responded to her pledge by tweeting a resounding amen: "No poll right now is worth anything. Who 'should' run? Anyone who wants to try. The best way to tell who's 'likable'/'electable' is to listen to them and see how primaries turn out."
Buzbee herself said she doubted news organizations, including the AP, would heed her words.
As the presidential election season kicked off in earnest this month, it was obvious the media would do what it always has done: focus on personalities and electability; get distracted by gaffes and blow them way out of proportion.
And pay some attention to issues of substance, but mostly as a dutiful side dish - a moderate helping of steamed broccoli that can be shoved to the side of the plate. (I researched this in early 2016 while public editor of the New York Times; in a fairly typical two-week period, three out of every four pieces of political journalism were horse race coverage.)
You can see it happening again, already. News organizations were agog at Elizabeth Warren's video in which she began to lay out her substantial ideas but then awkwardly declared a brief pause - "I'm gonna get me a beer."
CBS News, among many others, found this last part newsworthy, tweeting: "Sen. Elizabeth Warren drank a beer on Instagram Live - and it received mixed reactions." Boston Herald columnist Jaclyn Cashman (amusingly) teed off on it.
And nearly every news organization published articles on Warren's personality and gender, comparing her to Hillary Clinton. Last Sunday's Times featured an above-the-fold article with the headline, "Party tension: Can a Woman Defeat Trump?"
Then commentators wrote meta-pieces on all this, many readable or funny or enlightening. (Devorah Blachor in McSweeney's was all three in a piece called "I Don't Hate Women Candidates - I Just Hated Hillary Clinton and Now I'm Starting to Hate Elizabeth Warren."
But none of that had much to do with acquainting voters with what Warren stands for.
The press critic and New York University professor Jay Rosen may have a better idea: What he calls the "citizens agenda."
The gist is that the mission of pre-election coverage should not be to determine who's going to win, but to respond intelligently to what voters want and need to know.
It's so simple it seems absurd the reality is so far from it.
Rosen writes on his PressThink blog that one of the problems with election coverage as it stands is no one has any idea what it means to succeed at it.
"Predicting the winner? Is that success? Even if journalists could do that (and they can't) it would not be much of a public service, would it? A very weird thing about horse race or 'game' coverage is it doesn't answer to any identifiable need of the voter. Should I vote for the candidate with the best strategy for capturing my vote?"
The citizens agenda, which Rosen says was once tried to good effect by the Charlotte Observer partnering with the Poynter Institute, asks different questions: "What do you want the candidates to be discussing as they compete for votes?"
From the best answers to that everything else flows.
Rosen knows this all sounds dorky and not much fun. (And granted, people may ultimately cast their votes partly because they'd rather have a beer with one candidate over another, which is no doubt part of the reason Warren downed that beer on social media.)
For journalists, it amounts to, he writes, "civics class, as against drinks with the county chairman at the Des Moines Marriott."
But given we're in an extreme situation these days - with a president dismissive of democratic norms and commanding the news cycle with a wave of his hand - such ideas take on new urgency.
There may be others. Some may be under consideration or discussion even now. And we do see examples of journalism based on public interest - not just charts comparing stances on issues, but meaningful, engaging explorations of how tax or immigration policy affects real lives and pocketbooks; but they are vastly outweighed by horse race or shiny-object coverage.
Meanwhile, the clock is already ticking toward November of next year. Ticking toward what may be the most consequential election in American history, other than the last one - before which news organizations for the most part failed to serve the public interest.
You might recall.
Obsessed with polls, they still called the election wrong. They helped crown the Democratic Party's favored nominee, Hillary Clinton, literally years before the party convention. They allowed Donald Trump to dominate coverage as he wished. In the name of "fairness," they focused on personality flaws and relatively minor mistakes while failing to effectively drive home obvious character disasters.
The prospect of repetition is grim but, from the early signs, all too likely.
And if that makes embracing the status quo - doing things the same old way but maybe with more staff - a good idea, I can't understand why.

Facebook probing News for Democracy

Texto completo: Facebook said it is investigating whether an organization backed by Internet billionaire and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman violated the social media giant's policies when it set up several misleading news pages in a bid to target U.S. voters with left-leaning political messages.
The probe focuses on News for Democracy, whose Facebook ads and affiliated pages about sports, religion, the American flag and other topics were viewed millions of times during the 2018 midterm elections, according to an analysis of the company ad archive conducted by New York University.
News for Democracy's potential violations may have included Facebook's community standards and advertising policies, the company said. Facebook's community standards emphasize authenticity and ban "misrepresentation," including coordinated efforts to mislead people about the origin of content.
Some of News for Democracy's pages inserted Democratic messages into the feeds of right-leaning voters, according to a review of Facebook's ad archive. News for Democracy ran ads touting Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat, on "The Holy Tribune," a Facebook page targeted to evangelicals, the archive shows. Another page called "Sounds like Tennessee" focused on local sports and news but also ran at least one ad attacking now-Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).
"People start to trust the content emanating from the page, because it appeals to their interests, and once there is a certain degree of trust, you can start to pivot by slowly adding in kernels of disinformation or overly politicized information that lacks context," said Benjamin T. Decker, research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who called such tactics an "intentional act of deception" that mimicked strategies of Russian operatives around the 2016 presidential election.
During the 2018 midterms, News for Democracy helped create at least 14 Facebook pages and purchased the ads that ran on them, according to a person familiar with its operations who was not authorized to speak on the record. While the ads, cached in Facebook's public database, show that News for Democracy paid for them, the pages themselves - which are listed as news companies - do not disclose their backers or offer any identifying information beyond their name.
The pages also don't offer contact information for an administrator, a standard practice for news organizations and groups on Facebook.
Dmitri Mehlhorn, Hoffman's top political adviser and a board member of News for Democracy, declined to comment. Mehlhorn said in a previous interview that News for Democracy aimed to cultivate "outreach to groups that were center [and] center-right, and trying to reach out to them with messages."
The News for Democracy pages were created by another start-up backed by Hoffman called MotiveAI, according to the person. MotiveAI declined to comment.
It is unclear who else is behind News for Democracy or when it started. Hoffman did not respond to requests for comment.
News for Democracy is exposing potential gaps in the law and in Facebook's approach to fighting misinformation. Facebook pages, including those listed as news organizations, are not required to disclose identifying information beyond the page's name - unlike the requirement that buyers of political ads reveal their origins, a response to the Russian interference that dogged social media platforms during the 2016 election and afterward. Such disclosures are not required by law.
A Facebook spokesman said the company was reviewing its approach. "People connecting with [pages] shouldn't be misled about who's behind them," said Facebook spokesman Matt Steinfeld. "Just as we've stepped up our enforcement of coordinated inauthentic behavior and financially motivated spam over the past year, we'll continue improving so people can get more information about the Pages they follow."
Facebook declined to comment on which policies the group may have violated. It has used its community standards and advertising policies to shut down attempts by Russian and Iranian agents to manipulate the American public on its platform.
News for Democracy is the latest Hoffman-backed organization that has come under scrutiny in recent weeks. Last month, reports by The Washington Post and the New York Times found that an investment from the LinkedIn co-founder ended up funding an operation to spread disinformation during the 2017 special election in Alabama, though Hoffman said he did not endorse its tactics. The Daily Beast first reported on News for Democracy's pages in September.
The social network has poured significant resources into policing its platform since the Russia controversy, including doing some vetting of Facebook pages with large followings.
Facebook began its investigation of News for Democracy in December, after The Post first reported some details about the Alabama campaign, known as Project Birmingham. Facebook suspended at least one researcher involved, Jonathon Morgan, for violating its policies prohibiting coordinated inauthentic activity. That included the creation of a fake Facebook page that offered an endorsement of a write-in Republican candidate in the state's 2017 special election for Senate.
In the previous interview, Mehlhorn said that News for Democracy did not spread misinformation as part of their work. He said that U.S. political groups could learn from Russia's its use of microtargeting to reach narrow groups of voters.
The study by the New York University Tandon School of Engineering found that News for Democracy's ads garnered at least 16 million impressions, defined as views or clicks, over just a two-week period in September. The pages are still active.
"These groups find a community, they try to build it with non-political content, and once they have that community established, they start inserting political messages," said Laura Edelson, one of the NYU researchers.

Census to be less transparent over privacy worries

Texto completo: Whether sociologist Aggie Yellow Horse is teaching or researching, she relies on Census data.
The Arizona State University professor has used it to investigate how income inequality affects health, and racial disparities in which households move.
More than 60,000 scholars, analysts and business professionals, like Yellow Horse, make Census data among the most widely cited sources for researchers. But a decision by the Census Bureau to add errors to the results displayed from the upcoming 2020 Census — a move Census officials say is necessary to protect privacy — could make that data less useful.
According to a Dec. 6 presentation by a Census Bureau official, the government will reduce the accuracy of 36 percent of what's known as "block level" data, the most localized data generated by the agency. City, county and state data will be largely unchanged, officials said.
U.S. law requires public responses to Census questionnaires be kept private, and government officials currently conceal some records at the local level. But adding more errors to prevent people from being identified could affect data used to draw school boundaries, voting districts, and the allocation of government funding, and transportation plans.
The Census' decision to alter the accuracy of data is the latest in a series of changes. The decennial count will also include a question on citizenship, a change that has been widely criticized because it's expected to suppress participation by legal and undocumented residents.
The Census Bureau also plans to alter the accuracy of data in the popular American Community Surveysto protect privacy.
The Census Bureau acknowledged data privacy is "a hot topic and timely" but didn't respond to The Republic's questions before publication.
For decades, Census officials have debated whether it is possible to identify individuals based on the data they publish.
The debate has been stoked by the increasing availability of digital data, and the risks those pose of identifying individuals using aggregated data.
To prevent individuals from being identified, Census Bureau statisticians report income and age in ranges, as well as replace data that because it's so unusual — Bill Gates' income, for example — it could allow a person to be identified.
They also conceal the responses of unique households, such as the sole inhabitants of New York's Liberty Island, as reported by the New York Times, by swapping their responses with a similar household.
But according to John Abowd, the chief scientist and associate director for research and methodology at the Census Bureau, those methods are no longer enough to ensure the privacy of people who answer the Census.
Abowd told the Census Scientific Advisory Committee in December that his team was able to correctly identify the age, sex, race and ethnicity of half the Census records at a block level. That rose to 90 percent if their search allowed for one error, such as a person's age being off by one or two years.
"The way that we're going to protect confidentiality in the publications of the 2020 Census is with 'differential privacy,'" Abowd said at the meeting.
"Differential privacy" is used to obscure identifiable information by adding "noise" when a dataset queried. Companies like Apple and Google have used the technique.
"The dataset first generates the true value, and the noise is added," said Jane Bambauer, a law professor at University of Arizona. "You don't see line-by-line data."
The Census Bureau plans to use the technique in its popular data tables. The more localized the data, the more errors will be included.
This trade-off between privacy and accuracy means 36 percent of data at the block level will have errors.

Hearing Cases on a Sidewalk in Niger

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
I was reporting in the West African nation of Niger when the Unicef workers I was traveling with suggested we make a side trip to a clinic that treats women suffering from fistula.
Fistula occurs when the lining between the bladder and the vagina is punctured. It happens often to girls when they experience tears while delivering babies before their bodies are fully developed. The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has written extensively about the condition, which often leaves the girls unable to control their bladders, viewed as dirty and ejected from their families.
There was steady demand for treatment of fistula in Niger, a poverty-stricken nation with high rates of child marriage. The fistula facility we toured was near a leprosy clinic, a sign of just how stigmatized these patients are by society. It also treated girls who had been subjected to genital cutting, a practice that has been outlawed but still occurs in some places.
I was there to learn about girls whose parents had forced them into marriage. Niger has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world, but there were signs that the practice had been slowing, at least a little. I went to villages where girls had bravely resisted marriage, sometimes enduring beatings for doing so. They had been helped by aid workers and government employees who were trying to stop the practice.
My reporting took me in an unexpected direction after I met with a judge who oversaw a street-side Islamic court.
The judge, Alkali Laouali Ismaël, told me he had noticed that in his city, Maradi, women and girls were taking control of their relationships in new and positive ways.
More and more, he said, they were leaving husbands who didn't meet their expectations. Some were angry over being denied the right to work by their husbands, even though the region is suffering economically. Some were unhappy with their sex lives. Many were asking for a divorce.
Divorce wasn't always a positive outcome, he explained, but it was a sign that women knew their rights and were demanding respect, and happiness, in their marriages. He invited me to sit in on his court sessions.
His bench was nothing more than a double sheepskin rug on a sidewalk, where he plops down with his bare calloused feet poking out from under a shiny gown. Two associates flanked him, wearing dark sunglasses and whispering in his ear. I heard cases on land disputes, inheritance spats and, one morning, a case between two squabbling prostitutes.
"Just go, you're wasting my time," he told them, accusing one of being high on marijuana and the other of being drunk.
The testimony in the divorce cases I listened to could have been aired by annoyed wives in courtrooms, or living rooms, anywhere in the world: complaints about deadbeat dads; husbands who forgot to run errands on the way home from work.
During the hearings, cars, motorbikes and sheep passed, all of them sometimes drowning out Mr. Ismaël's soft but firm counsel.
"I wasn't the one who rejected her," a man at one hearing pleaded, contending that he deserved more than half of the divorcing couple's belongings.
"You are a good man," the judge told him. "But you are not realistic."
One of the petitioners was Saadia Halidou, 27, who had expected to fold her married life into her active social life, a busy calendar of weddings, other celebrations and selling cakes at the local market. But her husband insisted she stay home when he wasn't around.
"When someone was sick, he didn't even let me go visit them," she said. "If it were a tree he'd take better care of it, but I'm a human being."
She knew asking for a divorce wasn't going to please her parents, but she had to get out of her marriage.
"No, no, no, I wasn't used to this life," Ms. Halidou said.
I went to a religious center across town called Dynamic Women, where women took cooking and sewing classes -- and sought advice about unfulfilled sex lives.
The photographer Laura Boushnak and I followed some of the women home. I interviewed them and their parents into the night, taking notes with the help of someone holding the light from her phone over my notebook. There was no electricity in the evenings.
Women were taking control of their relationships across the region, I learned through more reporting, even in places like Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world, with high rates of illiteracy. The women I met were so inspiring, I plan to include more of their stories in a book I'm writing that will be out in early 2020.
At his sidewalk court, Mr. Ismaël was helping to make things better for women.
"Islam grants women their rights," he said, "and they know their rights."
I knew the divorcing women would face economic struggles in the future without added income from their husbands. Almost all of them told me they wanted to marry again eventually, when they found a man who would treat them right.
Niger is still lagging when it comes to quality of life for women, but I was happy to find a bit of brightness there for some young women who were part of a quiet new resistance.

Texto completo: For the last four years the ride-share company Lyft has honored its most popular destinations in a few dozen American cities with Lyftie Awards. Here are the hottest spots in Salt Lake City in 2018, based on Lyft ridership:
Most Visited Bar
• The Sun Trapp, 102 S. 600 West, Salt Lake City
The popular gay bar is a good spot for dancing and, of course, drinks. They serve beer in Mason jars, host live music and have a pool table and a patio. The bar is open 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday through Sunday.
Most Visited Concert Venue
• USANA Amphitheatre, 5150 Upper Ridge Road, West Valley City
The 20,000-seat outdoor amphitheater boasts views of the Wasatch Mountains and has hosted an eclectic mix of musicians, from rock bands Weezer and Green Day, to rapper Snoop Dog and country legends like the Dixie Chicks.
Most Visited Fitness Studio
• The Gym at City Creek, 51 Main St., Suite 308, Salt Lake City
The downtown Salt Lake City gym is located within the outdoor City Creek shopping mall. It offers personal fitness training, group fitness classes, sauna and steam room, a pool and other standard gym fare, like weights and cardio equipment.
Most Visited Brunch Spot
• Red Iguana, 736 W. North Temple, Salt Lake City
The most recognized dining establishment in Salt Lake City, Red Iguana serves up a number of brunch dishes, like huevos rancheros and chilaquiles. But the restaurant, which has been showcased on the Food Network and The New York Times, cooks a number of different specialties — from moles to chile verde burritos — that can keep people lining up outside its door throughout the day.
Most Visited Late-Night Restaurant
• Beer Bar, 161 E. 200 South, Salt Lake City
Serving a seemingly endless selection of local and other craft brews, this boozy establishment (licensed as a bar) also sells various sausages, Belgium fries, salads and strudel. The bar is open daily from noon to 2 a.m.
Most Visited Late-Night Neighborhood
• Downtown Salt Lake City
This honoree comes as no surprise, given three other Lyftie Awards went to establishments in downtown. The Downtown Salt Lake City Alliance call’s the urban area Utah’s center for culture, commerce and entertainment — and it’s not a stretch, given downtown Salt Lake City is home to the Eccles Theater, Vivant Smart Home Arena, two outdoor shopping malls, the Salt Palace Convention Center, plenty of bars and restaurants and thousands of businesses.
Only in Salt Lake City...
• Powder Mountain Resort, 6965 E. Powder Mountain Road, Eden
Ironically, this Utah ski resort isn’t in Salt Lake City and isn’t as close as resorts like Snowbird and Solitude. Powder Mountain lies about an hour north of Salt Lake City on more than 8,000 acres of skiable terrain, according to Ski Utah. It is one of North America’s largest ski areas and limits day lift tickets to 1,500 to keep its promise of “preserving the pow" for its visitors.

Apple aftershock raises growth questions

Texto completo: Apple Inc. began the new year by revealing it would miss a quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2002 -- but consumers and investors heard much more than that.
There was the sound of the curtain falling on two of the growth stories of the past decade: smartphones and China. Then came the din of second-guesses to Apple's strategy of consistently raising prices. And finally, came the worries that nothing as profitable as the rise of mobile computing has been for investors over the past decade will soon emerge to succeed it.
"Where is that next spark that will light us all up?" Kara Swisher, technology journalist, asked in a New York Times column Friday.
Apple late Wednesday said revenue for the last three months of 2018 missed expectations, chiefly due to weakness in China. The effect of the statement rippled more than most corporate warnings because Apple's products are so ubiquitous, its connections to other companies so broad, its stock so valuable and trouble, real trouble, for the company so rare.
In Minnesota, Apple's
announcement reverberated in share drops of Maplewood-based 3M Co., the diversified manufacturer that sells many products in China and provides materials in smartphones, and Richfield-based Best Buy Co., the nation's largest electronics retailer and top seller of Apple products. Shares in both recovered in a broad market rally Friday.
And two of the most prolific and closely followed analysts of Apple, Gene Munster of Loup Ventures and Piper Jaffray's Mike Olson, both from Minneapolis, went into overdrive trying to assess what it all meant. In interviews, both said the company is at a crossroad and so are investors. But their reasons varied, shedding light on the broader debate around Apple.
Munster, who became known nationally in the early 2000s when, as a Piper Jaffray analyst, he made an early call on Apple's hypergrowth, said the reaction to last week's warning showed that the future of Apple's stock hinges on the company's ability to lead the way on another "next big thing" as it did when computing shifted to mobile devices a decade ago. "Investors don't value earnings. They value revenue growth," Munster said. "The question is, does Apple take an approach of investing more in growth?"
Olson said he thinks investors in most tech companies care more about revenue than growth but that Apple's investors balance them out. For him, the company's revenue warning signified a slip in the company's ability to execute.
"The real concern for many investors … is that the company has lost its ability to provide the right products in the right markets at the right time and that Apple management has lower visibility into the company's future performance than what it had historically," he said.
Apple shares fell 10 percent Thursday, their steepest one-day drop since 2013. The company in August became the first U.S. firm to have a market value of $1 trillion. But its shares started to fall after reaching an all-time high in early October as investors began to get nervous about whether new iPhones would meet prior-year sales levels. The shares closed Friday 37 percent below the October peak.
For several weeks, news from Apple suppliers in Taiwan and elsewhere hinted that iPhone sales would not live up to expectations. Its warning confirmed those reports and zeroed in on China, the company's third-largest market after the Americas and Europe.
China has been the world's largest market for cellphones for more than a decade and, in a sign of its rising wealth, the country's consumers upgraded to smartphones nearly as quickly as those in more developed markets. But sales of smartphones have leveled off there as well as globally, where unit shipments have hovered around 1.4 billion since 2015 and actually fell in 2017 and likely in 2018.
As well, with the pace of new features in smartphones slowing down, consumers are hanging on to them longer. Apple's response to that development has been to raise prices in hopes of preserving revenue. But last weeks announcement showed that strategy may not be working in China, where it competes with several domestic producers like Huawei and Xiaomi that offer comparable phones at lower prices.
Like many analysts, Olson lowered his price target on Apple's stock. For Munster, the timing of Apple's announcement couldn't have been worse: It came just days after he made several predictions for the tech sector in 2019, including one that Apple's stock would outperform the other U.S. tech giants -- Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix. "We're still standing behind that, though this is not how I wanted the year to start out," he said.
He said he believes that Apple's fundamental drive to sell several technology devices to consumers and then deliver services on top won't change. But he is waiting to see whether executives signal bigger spending in three areas of potentially large growth: entertainment content, wearable devices and automobiles.
While the growth bet is up in the air, he said Apple is on the verge of offering a service that has long been a feature of other industries where products are expensive: financing.
"They're going to make it easier for people to purchase their products on a subscription basis," Munster said. "I think you'll see news out in the next year around that."

TSA agents call in sick as closure drags on

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: The Fox Cities Performing Arts Center isn't wasting any time getting the new year started, with the touring production of the Broadway musical "Anastasia" opening Tuesday for a six-day, eight-show run. Before the third show of the PAC's Broadway season begins its journey to the past, here's a roundup of what you should know — about the musical, its history and whether or not it's worth opening your wallet for.
So, 'Anastasia.' What is it? "Anastasia" is a musical inspired by the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, who was murdered with her family by Bolshevik secret police in 1918. In this story Anastasia survives, suffers from memory loss and years later learns of her true identity. Perhaps you remember the animated film from 20-some years ago?
It's not a direct adaptation of the 1997 Fox Animation Studios movie of the same name, but is inspired by it. Same goes for the 1956 "Anastasia" film that won actress Ingrid Bergman an Academy Award. (You may run into a tagline or two about the musical being "inspired by the 20th Century Fox motion pictures." That's why.)
A few of the songs from the 1997 film, including "Once Upon a December" and "Journey to the Past," are in the musical, but the majority of the songs are new.
Among the elements not making the trip to the stage are Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok, the villains of the animated version of the story. Instead the antagonist here is Gleb, a Bolshevik general.
Lila Coogan, the actress who plays the lead role of Anya (Anastasia) on the tour, said the musical is sort of like a grown-up version of the story from the film.
"We don't have a talking bat. We don't have a fantastical demon from the other world," she said. "We have real people struggling with real issues in a real time setting."
Who's behind it? Terrence McNally, a playwright with a lengthy list of accolades to his credit (including multiple Tony and Drama Desk awards), wrote the book. Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, two more Tony winners, handled the music. Those three also worked together on the decorated mid-'90s musical "Ragtime."
Darko Tresnjak directs. He's best known as the Tony Award-winning director of "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder."
Is it new? Yes. It made its debut on Broadway in March 2017 and the tour on its way to Appleton began in October. This visit to the Fox Cities PAC is its Wisconsin premiere.
How's it been received? Reviews have been mostly called it ... fine. The Hollywood Reporter labeled it a "pretty but anodyne musical, which ends up being more satisfying than the sum of its parts."
In the New York Times it was compared to "those mid-20th-century musicals that must've sounded like a good idea at the time, but tend to be remembered today only by hard-core aficionados of the genre." Young adults who remember the animated film may latch on, the Times' Ben Brantley wrote, but those without "such nostalgic insulation are likely to find this 'Anastasia' a chore."
The Broadway production picked up two Tony Award nominations in 2017: one for actress Mary Beth Peil and one for costume design. Neither won.
At the Drama Desk Awards, there was more love in the form of nine nominations, though the result was just a single win in the projection design category.
What else is there to know? Coogan said the first thing she often hears praise for is what the musical looks like.
"I think visually, across the board, the show is absolutely stunning," she said. "We have the best costumes that anyone could ask for, designed by Linda Cho; a gorgeous, gorgeous set; these projection screens that take you from Paris to Russia and all over the place, they're just so beautiful. It's magical to see."
If you thought the animated "Anastasia" movie, done by Fox Animation Studios, was made by Disney, it's a common mistake. That's because it looks like a Disney film and its directors, Gary Goldman and Don Bluth, had both worked for Disney. (Bluth also directed "An American Tail," "The Land Before Time" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven." Goldman was a producer on each.)
That movie, which featured voice work by Meg Ryan, Christopher Lloyd, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Hank Azaria, made more than $58 million and was the second highest-grossing animated movie of 1997. ("Hercules" was first.)
Coogan said she loved the 1997 movie and the Anastasia character specifically.
"She was the first princess I can recall that kind of had a bit to her," she said. "I personally am not like a flowers and sunshine kind of girl. I'm a little bit spunkier and kookier than that. It was just way more relatable at that time in my life for me."
The "Anastasia" opening is one of three Wisconsin premieres in the 2018-19 Kimberly-Clark Broadway Across America-Fox Cities Series. By season's end, the Fox Cities PAC will have hosted 36 statewide premieres since opening in 2002. Next up this season? "The Lion King," which made its Wisconsin premiere at the PAC in 2007.

Texto completo: Transportation Security Administration workers who screen passengers and baggage at U.S. airports have been calling off sick in increased numbers around the country during the partial government shutdown, raising the possibility that passengers could soon face unusually long security lines.
So far the absences have had "minimal impact" on TSA operations nationwide, according to TSA spokesman Michael Bilello.
At Pittsburgh International Airport, security is operating normally, Allegheny County Airport Authority spokesman Bob Kerlik said.
"We aren't noticing any impact in our security wait times or lines," Mr. Kerlik said Saturday morning. "Right now, it's business as usual."
He said he did not have any information on the number of TSA employees in Pittsburgh who may have called in sick.
A spokeswoman for the TSA in the Pittsburgh region couldn't be reached.
Across the country, "Screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," Mr. Bilello said in a tweet Friday evening, noting that wait times could be affected if call outs increase. TSA agents are required to work even though they aren't getting paid.
TSA workers reportedly have been calling off in unusually high numbers at Kennedy International Airport in New York and a few other major airports.
More than 150 TSA employees, many of them responsible for screening passengers, called in on Friday morning at Kennedy International Airport in New York to say they were ill or otherwise unable to work their shifts, according to a union official with knowledge of the situation, The New York Times reported.
The staffing gap was covered by other officers, who also are working without pay, the person said.
The so-called call-outs have spiked to three times their normal level at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, where an average of 25 employees usually call in sick per shift, a local official of the agency told CNN, which first reported on the story.
A federal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to comment publicly on the matter, said the call-outs seemed to be a coordinated protest. But union officials said that many of the workers who called in sick were most likely seeking alternative temporary employment to make up for the lost wages, according to the Times.
Those numbers could spike as workers are set to start missing their first paychecks this week.
CNN quoted an unidentified TSA union official as saying sick calls are expected to "explode" over the next week or two as workers call off to work other jobs.
About a quarter of the government, including the TSA, has been without funding since the shutdown began Dec. 22.
"TSA is grateful to the agents who show up to work, remain focused on the mission and respectful to the traveling public as they continue the important work necessary to secure the nation's transportation systems," Mr. Bilello tweeted.
Mr. Kerlik said Pittsburgh passengers can check the airport authority's website for an estimate of security wait times at www.flypittsburgh.com.
As always, he said, travelers should check with their airline concerning flight delays before going to the airport.

On the Go, Nonstop

Texto completo: The man on the train platform who spoke only Hindi looked at my ticket and chuckled. This had been one of those days when mistakes piled up faster than I could track them.
I had tarried too long in Chandigarh, India, and the four-hour taxi ride back to New Delhi now promised to be a six-hour slog in traffic. No problem, I could take a train instead, I thought, only to run out of money on my cellphone SIM card just as I was booking a last-minute ticket. I hopped in a tuk tuk and raced to the station, and got there five minutes after the last fast train had left for the night.
When I started this harebrained experiment in January, to visit and report on the Times's entire 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, I thought that by stop 48, for sure, I'd be the Wonder Woman of travel: blocking mishaps with a flick of my wrist. Instead I was staring down a 2 a.m. arrival in New Delhi before having to force myself awake for a morning plane to Bhutan.
But there was the man on the platform -- a waiter for the railway, whose job it is to pass out dinners -- flashing a gesture that seemed to mean, "Don't worry, I've got you." I had bought an "unreserved" ticket, which I thought was for people who'd had trouble purchasing online, but which really meant I'd likely have to stand for five hours.
But when the train pulled in, the man talked to the conductor and ushered me into a sleeper car. English-speakers all around jumped in to interpret. Seven dollars in fines and upgrade fees later, I was sitting in a cluster of bunks with four boisterous 20-something women from New Delhi.
The words "dream job" come up whenever I tell people about the 52 Places project. Like the thousands of others who answered that fateful job listing -- travel the world for The New York Times! -- I had a vision of winning a journalism lottery, of getting to leave behind my routine to swim in waterfalls in Australia, paraglide off mountaintops in Switzerland and eat at Michelin-starred restaurants in France. And I got to do all of those things, for which I am incredibly grateful.
I've also had to face reality: that constant travel -- alone -- on an illogical route no sane human would plan, might take a toll on my physical and mental well-being. That The Times, quite reasonably, expected me to do work and file stories, which meant spending a lot of time in beautiful destinations in front of a computer. That I'd make gaffes along the way and have to weather the sting of valid criticism. That I'd meet new friends only to have to say goodbye a few days later. And that I'd be mostly celibate, miss the births of four close friends' babies, forget to call my parents. That I'd reach the end, and all I'd want is to do it over again.
I started out, arms laden with recommendations and highlights, determined to do every one of them: Eat all the food in New Orleans, hike to the sea cave everyone goes to in Tasmania, visit every mountain temple in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Yet what I remember most are the small wins and human connections. The kind people and delicious salchipapas (deconstructed hot dogs with French fries) at a Peruvian food truck on the highway outside Disney Springs, Fla. The man in Lucerne, Switzerland, who returned my laptop when I left it on a bridge in the rain. That army of concerned citizens in Chandigarh.
Trust has been the through-line that has emerged from it all. Trust in myself, trust in the fundamental goodness of people, trust that as a solo female traveler, I could watch my back without walling myself off from experiences.
You see, it was a dream job. It's just that my idea of what made this dream job dreamy has changed so much.
Lesson No. 1: A year is short
I was going on 40, feeling sad about being single, and contemplating a sabbatical from New York Magazine, where I'd worked for 17 years, when I clicked on The New York Times home page and saw something curious: A job listing in the most-read articles list. Did I want to travel around the world and document it? it asked. Sure I did! So did pretty much everyone. By the time I saw the listing, 3,500 people had already applied. The final number, they tell me, was 13,000.
The odds were so impossible and the selection process so mysterious that I couldn't allow myself to get too excited. And then I got the incredible phone call telling me I had three weeks to pack up my apartment, say goodbye to everyone I knew, quit a workplace that felt like family and set out for a year on the road.
All through my 20s and 30s, I had watched friends move to London or West Africa, or quit their jobs and travel, and wondered how they possibly had the confidence to do it. I had made the huge, scary leap from New Mexico to New York City after college because it was the one big city I knew, and I had family there. And then I stayed at the same workplace, building a career I loved while living in a series of closet-size walk-ups and earning barely enough money to go home for the holidays.
"Why do you think they picked you?" interviewers often asked me, and I didn't know the answer. I suspected it was because I hadn't done anything like this before. I'd never been brave enough. And maybe I could be a representative for those who didn't think they were brave enough, either.
Getting on that first plane to New Orleans, I felt as though I were stepping into an unknowable void from which there was no return. The first few months were tough. Five stops in, and behind on my writing, I wound up in Bogotá, Colombia, still needing to file my articles on Montgomery, Ala. (stop No. 3) and Disney Springs, Fla. (stop No. 4). I spent three straight days in my Bogotá hotel, losing precious time to report on and photograph the city. The one day I got outside, I took a taxi 30 minutes to the museum I wanted to see and realized I'd left my wallet back at the hotel.
And I just lost it.
I called a dear friend of mine who works for The Wall Street Journal and has made many a global move, and sobbed.
"I know this feels daunting right now," she said, "but you have to remember that a year is short."
I argued that this was the longest year of my life, and it was only February, and she didn't know what she was talking about. But the saying stuck in my head and acquired new meaning whenever I'd hear myself complain about this wondrous opportunity.
Freezing down to your bones and sleeping in a by-the-hour motel where you shower while sitting on the toilet? Suck it up! You're about to see the rainbow hills of Zhangye, China! A year is short.
Freezing again and dinner is bar nuts because you waited past 8 p.m., when all the restaurants close? You just rode a horse in Iceland! A year is short.
Car got towed in Auckland, New Zealand, while on your third trip to the Chinese consulate trying to get a visa? But you're in New Zealand! And you're going to China! A year is short.
A year is short and a year is not enough.
A year is short, and I was strong, and the risk had always been worth it.
Lesson No. 2: Know thy logistical self
My 27-hour travel day from Kanazawa, Japan, to India, was one of the trickiest of the year and I had gamed it out to the minute: A 4 a.m. taxi to the Kanazawa station, where I'd pick up luggage I'd left in a locker; a six-hour train ride with two transfers, arriving at the Osaka airport with a generous two and a half hours to check in for my flight. I'd filled out the longest form in the world to get my India eVisa and paid to get it expedited. And I had a ticket for onward travel to Bhutan, having anticipating that India would require me to show I'd booked travel to exit the country before I could get on the plane in Japan.
Then the AirAsia ticket counter woman asked if I had a paper copy of my eVisa. I hadn't thought to print it out. Nowhere else in the world, in 47 stops, had I needed to show anything but my phone at a check-in counter.
She couldn't let me on the flight without it, she said. Check-in was closing in 20 minutes. After a mad scramble, I ended up in line at a Family Mart convenience store behind a woman printing out what looked like a 40-page dissertation, watching as the clock ticked down. The complicated printer setup required downloading an app to my phone, and by the time I had printed it out, I'd missed the deadline by 15 minutes.
I raced up two flights of escalators and down several long corridors, carrying the bags I hadn't been allowed to check, prepared to beg the ticket agent for leniency. By some miracle the line was still open. I handed everything over, smiling with relief, and then looked up to see my plane was on a 2-hour delay.
So like any reasonable person, I went back to the Family Mart and bought a basket full of sushi snacks and tea-flavored Kit Kats, plus a beer to take the edge off.
I'd estimate that at least 60 percent of this job was dealing with logistics. And I even had a helper back in New York, who would research hotels and flights for me.
Every country is different, with different currencies and different languages, a different pace and different cultural customs. An unreserved train ticket means one thing in India and another in Spain. Had I done cursory research on the dual-island African nation of São Tomé and Príncipe, I would have known to show up with a wad of euros, because the society is completely cash-based and there are no ATMs foreigners can use.
At first, I tried following travel conventions that had worked for me on one-off trips: booking planes and hotels in advance, picking the absolute cheapest fares, guarding against delays by taking 6 a.m. flights, which are the least likely to be canceled. Then four 6 a.m. flights in a row, with the necessary 3 a.m. wake-up calls, turned me into a zombie.
I started listening to my rhythms. I am a night owl, for one, happy to wake up for sunrises but usually not for planes. Inflexible travel plans give me anxiety, particularly when they were coupled with work deadlines.
The trip had been planned to go from west to east, minimizing jet lag, but some time zone changes knocked me out. The 24-hour travel day from Zambia to Darwin, Australia, knocked me out for days.
I've become far calmer from having to deal with mishap after mishap, and realizing that nothing dire usually happens. There would be another plane, and more trains if I missed that one, too. Maybe I'd lose a day, but when you're on the road this long, time becomes malleable, too.
Lesson No. 3: Develop your superpower
"So what countries are you going to?" asked Tina Phillips, a nurse at Passport Health in Orlando, Fla., which issues vaccinations and prescriptions for travelers who might encounter infectious diseases like malaria, rabies or Japanese encephalitis.
I started listing off my 52 Places destinations. Ms. Phillips typed the country names into the computer, her eyes widening as she laughed at the absurdity. She sent me home with several needle sticks in my arm, $1,100 in preventive medicine, a video message telling my mother not to worry, and a spiral-bound printout of all my health vulnerabilities.
One of my biggest fears going into this project was getting sick, or injured, and having to come home early -- or worse, having something happen while I was in a remote location without access to adequate medical care. Getting sick is painful, and often gross, but what worried me more was the potential time suck on a trip so tightly scheduled that it would go off the rails if I spent days groaning on a hotel bathroom floor.
My waistline has expanded and diminished throughout this trip, but the medical kits I built so meticulously before I left the U.S. have remained largely untouched in my suitcase. It's a stash so extensive that a customs officer at the ferry entrance to Tangier, Morocco, spent an hour threatening, in Arabic, to confiscate it and accusing me of being a drug dealer.
Instead, I discovered I have a superpower, which may be the sole reason I've stayed relatively healthy: the ability to sleep anywhere, under any conditions. Give me a window seat on an airplane and I'll be lights out before takeoff, no earplugs, eye mask or neck pillow.
I'd fall asleep in hotels on noisy streets as dogs barked all night, and in 20-minute chunks, regulated by an alarm, between writing paragraphs of articles on an all-nighter. In Tangier, two friends who joined me started looking like death because of hourlong prayer calls outside our windows every morning at 4 a.m. I didn't even notice them.
But the only times I've gotten really sick were the colds I caught in Seville, Spain, and Chandigarh after extensive sleep deprivation. I warded them off with a lot of naps.
Lesson No. 4: Try it
The rain in Chilean Patagonia never really seemed to stop. Every article of clothing I owned was soaked. Soppy socks, soppy shoes. The weather matched my mood. Earlier that week, I'd called my friend crying yet again, and told her I wanted to quit -- I was so far behind in writing it felt like I was drowning in obligations I couldn't meet.
What do people do when it rains like this? I asked the hotel manager in the national park, Parque Pumalín. "We do what we always do," he said. "If we stopped for rain, nothing would ever get done."
So, in a small break in the rain, I went out to do what I always do: take pictures, talk to people, get to know the place.
I was in the tiny town of Chaitén, which had been leveled by a volcanic eruption 10 years earlier. Residents had come back, but the buildings closest to the slope were still abandoned. I went to examine the ghost town. A few friendly construction workers were rebuilding a house, a school. I wandered further, to an industrial building that had been overtaken by jungle growth straight out of "Jurassic Park."
The rain started up again while I was inside, exploring the concrete corridors and coming to the realization that I was inside an abandoned prison.
And now I was trapped by torrential rain.
For two hours I watched the rain flood the dirt streets before me, and the inside of this prison. I tweeted out my location, just in case. Then my phone's battery died, and it was just me and the torrent, alone in the wilds of Patagonia, with the sun going down.
I had to make a decision, and the decision was to run, through the rain. And in that rain, soaked and running, I looked around, at the blue-tinged mountains around me, and the jungle shrubs on all sides, and the kind people laughing at this silly foreigner who'd gotten caught in an abandoned prison in the rain, and realized that all the rest was superfluous. This was why I was here.
Something crystallized for me in that moment, of how singular this trip was. I started trying things: I jumped off a 30-foot cliff into freezing river water while "canyoning" in Megève, France; scuba dived and surfed for the first time in Fiji; and maybe scariest of all, tried a taco with a crispy-fried ant at Gustu in La Paz, Bolivia.
Two days ago, my friend Ben saw a dish on the menu of a barbecue joint in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, he thought I should try to commemorate making it to my 52nd place.
"Come on," he said. "After this you can tell everyone you tried Fried Spicy Cow Penis."
The whole table agreed to join me. We ordered it and the kitchen brought out Fried Spicy Beef instead. "We changed it for you!" they said, cheerily.
"Awesome," said Ben. "We also want this one."
The dish came out. It looked exactly as you would imagine. Ben ate a piece. Then it was my turn. We have video evidence. I know I said, "try it," but you don't need to try that one. I did it for you. You're welcome.
Lesson No. 5: Learn what safe means to you

Of all the news that has filtered across my phone screen while I've been bouncing around the world, none had the potential to throw me into a paralytic spiral more than reading about a woman killed simply because she was alone.
"Was there ever a time you felt unsafe?" a friend asked me recently. The answer was no, not like I have been in the past, when I escaped attackers in my Williamsburg, Brooklyn, neighborhood or on a trip to France; and also, "Always."
Caution as a solo female traveler is healthy; blind fear is not. I find that for me the best system is to always remember that I am a tourist. It's good to know what people who live in a place have to say about safety, but also realize that the rules that apply to them, who know where they are going, and can blend in, don't apply to me.
I've had to sacrifice areas of coverage I might otherwise enjoy, like night life, because I didn't feel safe going out alone. For the one destination that was all about going out, in Belgrade, Serbia, I hired a translator-guide to keep me company, who became a fast friend. In Bogotá, I met a young female professor through Instagram who took me out with her friends for a night.
There's a literal extra cost to being a woman traveling on your own. In cities where safety seemed like it might be an issue, I took cabs and Ubers rather than cheaper public transport. Climbing up certain mountains or going around certain cities, I opted for a guide, and often paid extra because most private tours have a two-person minimum.
At one point, I got delayed arriving at an Airbnb I'd booked in Glasgow, and had to retrieve the key, after midnight, from a lockbox attached to a fence on a dark side street. A man, clearly on something, swayed back and forth about 20 feet away, as I fumbled with the combination while also trying to keep an eye on my bags. When I got inside, the apartment was lovely, but the building looked like it had been through a bombing and never recovered. Certain landings, including mine, had no lights, and glass covered the floor from broken windows. I was hanging out with a local travel writer who usually walked me home at night, but if he hadn't been there, no one would have known my whereabouts.
After that I vowed to stay only in hotels with 24-hour front desks rather than rental apartments.
The idea of dating in a strange land quickly went out the window -- I didn't have time and it didn't seem safe. But I didn't swear off romantic leanings entirely. All told I had four make-out sessions all year, all in public or under what felt like very safe circumstances. Those seem like little miracles.
Lesson No. 6: Still, talk to strangers
Oh, the stories of strangers that I could tell.
In Montgomery, there was Marcus, an Uber driver who'd grown up in what he described as "abject poverty," who gave me an inspired lecture on his city's complicated racial history. We picked up his neighbor, a nurse, from work, as he does every night, and finished with a feast at Applebee's.
In Puerto Rico, there was Blandine, a travel agent who'd greeted me dancing and singing by the baggage carousel, a few months after Hurricane Maria, when much of the country was without power. A farmer, Elmer Sánchez, mentioned a party to me and my friend, and we showed up to find at least 400 people dancing to the best musicians in the country playing by the light of a generator.
In Ypres, Belgium, there were the countless people attending the Last Post Ceremony, to honor the missing fallen Commonwealth soldiers of World War I, who told me the stories of their valiant, dead relatives, and ripped my heart in two.
In Matera, Italy, there were Cosimo, Angelica, Mariangela, Alessandro and Marcello, who introduced me to possibly the world's most delicious food, panzerotto (fried dough with cheese and tomato sauce), and made me feel like I was family, even with my rusty Italian.
In Kigali, Rwanda, there was M.A., now a surrogate sister, and her entire family, who hosted me at a birthday gathering two days after I met them, while also sharing their stories of surviving genocide.
What's the biggest lesson you've learned? is a question I often get. I always answer, "That people are fundamentally good around the world."
Lesson No. 7: Alone does not mean lonely
Solo travel is an experience I'd urge every human, and particularly every woman, to try at least once. You'll find that while you might physically be without people you know, you're rarely alone. I had a device in my pocket that allowed me to call home, and to post a picture on an app that opened up conversations with strangers who just seemed to want to wish me well.
While in Patagonia, I spent four hours climbing a volcano in the rain by myself, to reach a desolate summit with nothing but burned trees and ashen pebbles. Out of the freezing cold mist came a hooded figure. "Hablas esapañol o ingles?" I asked. English, he told me. He was a vegan punk-rock drummer from Berlin who liked to laugh a lot and pet stray dogs, and we ended up traveling together for the next five days.
My parents were my rocks through the ups and the downs. Weekly phone calls with my therapist were among the best work I did. Certain friends became lifelines. There was Heidi Vogt, with her endless logistical know-how; Jean Lee, an expert on Korea and also on how to pack for any eventuality; Chiwan Choi, a poet friend who kept me clearheaded on writing; Marie Ternes, who talked me through story ideas even two days before having her first child.
For the past week, I've stayed put in my 52nd place, the small town of Kep on the Cambodian Coast. The plan was to spend the holidays alone in this tranquil, piece of heaven on the beach, banging out my final articles.
Then I got an Instagram DM from an acquaintance from Los Angeles. She had seen a photo I'd posted from Kep, and it was a strange coincidence, but she and a girlfriend would be there the next day. Then I got another message from Ben, who lives in Bangkok. He and his girlfriend, Zoe, were trying to figure out one last vacation to take before they moved to New York. Would I recommend Kep? Within 10 minutes he sent me his hotel booking and flight information.
The next morning, I befriended a British family at my hotel and we got along so well we went on a sunset cruise together.
The posse grew with each new arrival. We'd feast on crabs and then head to a bar to play cards until the owner kicked us out. It was a magical holiday, and in it I could see glimpses of the future, of being surrounded by found family, content in each other's company, of traveling solo but never being, or desiring to be, truly alone.
What's next? I don't know. I might be physically going back to the apartment I left behind in Brooklyn 12 months ago, but the center of my life isn't there for me anymore. It's with me and it's mobile.

Like any globe-trotter, Jada has learned a lot of lessons on how to travel -- the easy way, the hard way and, occasionally, in a different language. She's also been given advice from fellow travelers, proud natives, and followers and fans across social media.Here's a look at some of the best advice Jada has received from readers and some of the best advice she's shared right back.You can also read all of her dispatches so far, and follow her travels on Instagram and Twitter.
Let (social) followers lead
Before her trip to the Rogue River in Oregon, Jada asked Twitter followers what she couldn't miss in the area. Followers responded with recommendations for caramels, road trips, hikes and sausages.She followed the advice of many, and also had her own recommendations."When you do eat, though, make sure it involves blue cheese," Jada said of her time in Oregon. The creamery she went to was recommended by a Twitter user, Katie D.: "Rogue Creamery has won awards for that moldy goodness, and a farm stand on its dairy in Grants Pass served a grilled cheese sandwich made of Oregon blue cheese, a type of mild Cheddar called TouVelle, and honey, on locally made white bread basted with grape seed oil, that I'd commemorate in song if I could.""Even more indelible was Jasper's Café in Medford, a roadside burger joint near the airport," Jada wrote. The cafe was another recommendation from Katie D. "I craved it every day I was in Oregon -- and was nearly late to my flight getting another one on the way out.
"Eat ice cream for breakfast
For many, the 52 Places traveler position is a dream job. For Jada, that dream, while not always totally dreamy, is a daily reality. And in that reality, you sometimes land in a hotel where there's ice cream for breakfast.In Prague, she tweeted the following:Some readers had a few things to say about ice cream. In Cincinnati, the consensus was clear: Go to Graeter's, they said. And get the blackberry chip -- in a pretzel cone.And when someone suggests a chocolate factory, never, ever, say no.
Look for helpers
It goes without saying that when you're traveling the world for a year, there will be some high highs and low lows.When Jada's car was stuck in the mud on a remote beach in São Tomé -- with no cell service, to boot -- the following happened:"This," her guide, Juliano, said, "is just part of the São Tomé culture; no one would ever leave anyone stranded."In Lucerne, Switzerland, Jada faced a different kind of crisis: a lost bag with her laptop inside. "My hotel desk clerk said not to worry; Swiss people return things they find," she writes in this Instagram caption.The next morning, she woke up to a direct message on Twitter from a man named Anton. "Hi Jada Yuan, please contact me if you lost something," he wrote.Anton was in Jada's hotel lobby -- with her bag -- 10 minutes later.A few months later in Fiji, Jada was tasked with voting in the U.S. midterm elections from the South Pacific, about 8,000 miles away. She credits a team of locals -- from hotel staff to newfound friends -- for helping her ballot make it back to New York City.
Pack wisely and strategically
In June, Jada answered many questions about her packing strategy. "Blogs, travel writers, foreign correspondent friends, and flight attendants all gave me great advice, but the past five months of hopscotching through climates and national borders have been figuring out what works for me, with trial -- and a ton of error," she writes.She shared a handful of her own tips and her biggest concern: "What happens when I get my period?" she asked. Tampons -- and Duane Reades -- aren't everywhere, and that includes the African bush:
... but pack creatively
Because why have a neck pillow when you could have an animal neck pillow, as spotted in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International airport?Listen to the chefWhile traveling in Bolivia, Jada ate at Gustu, a restaurant in La Paz, Bolivia. Perhaps the most important advice in a restaurant comes from the chef. In this case, the advice was: Eat it. Jada held the hand of the co-head chef, Marsia Taha Mohamed, while taking a bite of a queen ant taco. "Smoky and crunchy," she wrote."This Gustu tasting menu had at least 3 other proteins I've never tried (oxtails, beef hearts, and alligator ceviche). I won't eat any of them again, but once seemed worth it."Nothing against chefs, but bus drivers also have some good advice (if unintentional):

Texto completo: Former Secretary of Defense during the Carter administration Harold Brown — the first scientist to lead the Pentagon — has died in Rancho Santa Fe, California.

According to the Rand Corp., where Brown served as a member of the board of trustees, Brown passed away at the age of 91 on Friday. Brown’s daughter Deborah Brown said he had been battling pancreatic cancer, per the New York Times.

Brown, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, worked to boost Pentagon spending during his time heading the Department of Defense. Additionally, Brown headed the Pentagon when the U.S. navigated the Iranian hostage crisis that involved the death of eight U.S. service members. He characterized the crisis as the "greatest regret and most painful lesson learned.”

Even so, Brown said in his farewell address after leaving his post as defense secretary that it was fulfilling keeping the U.S. at peace amid global tensions.

"Most satisfying of all is that for four years, our nation remained at peace despite the world tensions and turmoil that constantly pose challenges to our interest and peace," Brown said.

Before serving as defense secretary, Brown became Secretary of the Air Force in 1965. He became a visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and was the chairman of Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute after he departed the Pentagon. He also received the Energy Department's Enrico Fermi Award for achievement in science and technology under former President Bill Clinton.

Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said that Brown “led a remarkable life” and contributed to the United State’s military by “revolutionizing the development of naval munitions, renovating America’s post-Vietnam War weapons platforms, developing stealth aircraft, and leading nuclear weapons research.”

“As Secretary of Defense, Dr. Brown’s steady leadership piloted our nation through a consequential segment of the Cold War,” Shanahan said in a statement. “His focus on deterrence through a strong nuclear triad facilitated long-term peace and stability in the United States and Europe.”

“We in the Department of Defense are forever grateful for Harold Brown’s devoted leadership and lifetime of service,” Shanahan said.

Promise From Powell, Mixed With Defiance: 'We Will Be Patient'

Texto completo: ATLANTA -- Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Friday that low inflation would allow the Fed to be "patient" in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates, a message welcomed by jittery investors.
The Fed is confronting an increasingly uncertain economic outlook. Falling stock prices, weakening global growth and concerns about President Trump's economic policies have set investors on edge and prompted warnings that the economic expansion is nearing its end. But measures of domestic economic activity remain strong, including Friday's report the economy added 312,000 jobs in December.
Mr. Powell's message on Friday was that the Fed can afford to watch and wait. He said the best available evidence suggested that the economy was still in good shape. But he also was at pains to reassure investors unsettled by his confident tone at his last news conference, in mid-December. He said that the Fed was watching for evidence of weakness, and that the health of the economy would ultimately determine the course of policy.
"With the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves," Mr. Powell said. The Fed predicted in December that it would raise rates twice in 2019, but Mr. Powell said the central bank was ready to change course "significantly if necessary."
The stock market, driven down on Thursday by concerns about growth, surged on Friday on the strength of the jobs data, and then kept climbing as Mr. Powell spoke. Investors who are worried about the growing economic impact of a trade war with China also hoped for progress toward a resolution when the Trump administration and Chinese officials hold meetings next week.
The S&P 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent.
[Read more: The jobs data, and signs of flexibility at the Fed, helped stocks soar on Friday.]
Mr. Powell also defended the Fed's autonomy on Friday in the face of sharp attacks by Mr. Trump, who has complained to aides that the Fed's rate increases would undermine economic growth and "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the president during the Great Depression's early years.
Some of Mr. Trump's economic advisers, alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire Mr. Powell, want to arrange a meeting between the two men. Mr. Powell, under questioning by Neil Irwin, an economics writer at The New York Times, said that he was open to meeting with Mr. Trump, as Fed chairs have done with past presidents, but that no meeting had been scheduled.
He also said the Fed would make policy without regard to Mr. Trump's views. "I want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture, it's not a fragile one, it's not being disrupted," he said.
Asked if he would resign if Mr. Trump asked him to do so, Mr. Powell replied directly: "No."
Mr. Powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association by his immediate predecessors at the Fed, Janet L. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke. Both of them criticized Mr. Trump's attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.
Strong economic growth fueled the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2018, into a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. The rate, which had hovered near zero in the wake of the financial crisis a decade earlier, now sits at the lower end of the range that Fed officials consider a reasonable estimate of "neutrality," meaning that the central bank is neither encouraging nor discouraging economic growth.

Fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy. "I think we're actually in a good spot," Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control.
But critics, including Mr. Trump, have said the economy still needs the Fed's help. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.
Clouds also are gathering on the economic horizon. The Trump administration increased economic growth last year through large tax cuts and increased federal spending, but those benefits are waning. And Mr. Trump's trade war with China is beginning to be felt by American companies, like Apple and FedEx, which have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs are pinching profits.
The Fed's decision to raise the benchmark rate at its most recent meeting, in mid-December, drove down stock prices and bond yields in a show of concern about the prospects for continued economic growth. Asset prices imply an expectation that the Fed will not raise interest rates at all during 2019.

Mr. Powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets' concerns are overstated. He said that 2018 had been "a good year for the United States economy" and that the latest economic data suggested "ongoing momentum heading into 2019." Wall Street's pessimism, he said, is "well ahead of the data."
But the Fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the Fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion.
Inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent available data. It is likely that inflation remained soft in December, marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent.
And inflation would have been even weaker but for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, according to a study published Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Trump has repeatedly argued that the cost of the tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, is being absorbed by Chinese exporters. But the study found that American consumers were paying a hefty price. The authors estimated that the tariffs added about 0.3 percentage points to the Consumer Price Index last year.
Job growth has remained strong, and wage growth has increased in recent months, but Mr. Powell said the Fed was on guard against rising prices, not rising wages. He said the strength of the labor market "does not raise concerns about too high inflation."
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Mr. Powell's remarks convinced him that the Fed would move more slowly in 2019. Mr. Feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019; he said he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, in July and December.
"Powell's message was unmistakable," Mr. Feroli wrote in a note to clients.
Mr. Powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the Fed's gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. Some analysts have argued that the Fed's retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets.
Mr. Powell said that the Fed disagreed but, returning to his theme for the day, that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind.
"If we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals, we wouldn't hesitate to change it," he said.

CELEBRITY DUOS THAT COULD BRING RIGHT STUFF TO ACADEMY AWARDS

Texto completo: Hosting an awards show is one of Hollywood's most thankless jobs - Adam Samberg and Sandra Oh will surely be reminded if they dare to check their Twitter feeds while hosting Sunday's Golden Globes ceremonies. Taking swipes at the poor suckers tasked with keeping the audience awake has become more popular sport than picking the winners.
At least Mr. Samberg and Ms. Oh will have each other to lean on.
Comedy duos have gone out of fashion on the stand-up circuit - with good reason. Club performers should be connecting with the audience, not the other doofus on stage.
But when it comes to a gig as daunting and massive as overseeing an international awards show, sharing podium duties, as well as the high-stakes pressure, makes sense.
Amy Poehler and Tina Fey showed off the power of two when they emceed the Globes for three sidesplitting ceremonies from 2013 to 2015. Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood have perfected their Sonny and Cher routine over more than a decade of headlining the CMT Awards.
At one point, the Academy Awards employed half of Hollywood as hosts. In 1958, the roster included Bob Hope, David Niven, James Stewart, Jack Lemmon, Rosalind Russell and Donald Duck. But the academy has generally stuck to a single host in recent years. The exceptions: Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin in 2010 (they killed) and James Franco and Anne Hathaway in 2011 (they died).
With this year's Oscar host still up in the air after Kevin Hart bowed out, it may be time for the academy to take another chance on a duo. Here are five suggestions:
KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY AND JORDAN PEELE
It's only been three years since the end of Comedy Central's "Key & Peele," but we're already pining for a reunion. Since the split, both have padded their credentials, Mr. Key with his critically acclaimed turn as Horatio in the Public Theater's "Hamlet," and Mr. Peele with his Oscar-winning sensation, "Get Out." Hopefully they haven't become too big to bring back some of their sketch show's signature characters, including Barack Obama's "Anger Translator," at least for one night.
WILL FERRELL AND KRISTEN WIIG
These late-night MVPs were never "Saturday Night Live" cast members at the same time, all the more reason why watching them play off each other would be such a treat. The only reason it wouldn't work is if they copied what Michael Che and Colin Jost did at the Emmys last year, turning the ceremonies into a not-very-special edition of "SNL."
TIFFANY HADDISH AND MAYA RUDOLPH
They specialize in scene-stealing on screen, but they also did a pretty slick job of owning the 2018 Oscars ceremony. No one remembers what categories they announced, but memories of Ms. Rudolph moaning about her tight shoes ("My pinky toe fell off") and Ms. Haddish ad-libbing a shout-out to Meryl Streep ("I want you to be my mama one day") lasted long after the Champagne hangovers.
CARL REINER AND MEL BROOKS
During each of Jimmy Kimmel's turns as Oscars host, he gave serious consideration to using these comic legends as his personal Statler and Waldorf, hurling biting commentary from the cheap seats. The idea never materialized - but he was onto something. Why not take it a step further? Plopping Mr. Reiner, 96, and Mr. Brooks, 92, on stage for a whole show may require some rocking chairs, but it would be a worthwhile investment.
STEVE MARTIN AND MARTIN SHORT
Mr. Martin has presided over the Oscars three previous times, but never with his best sparring partner, a spitball of energy eager to make more costume changes during the commercial breaks than Katy Perry in concert. After a multiyear stretch of theater shows, which hinge almost entirely on good-natured ribbing and deflating egos, this pair could step in with little to no notice. If the Academy doesn't hurry up and make a decision regarding its plans for the Feb. 24 event, they may have to.

Texto completo: Headnote EDITOR'S COLUMN
"Already Broken Your Resolutions? Be Precise, Be Reasonable, Remain Resolute"
We all have our favorite traditions, some that we've inherited from our families - others that have more to do with our willingness to comply with societal norms. One tradition common among those living in the Western Hemisphere that gets plenty of mileage during the first days of January remains making New Year's resolutions.
Simply put, it's a promise to us that for the new year we'll change undesired traits or behaviors, focus on accomplishing individual goals or generally working toward improving our lives.
Centuries ago, both the Babylonians and Romans began each year by making promises to their god(s). Later, medieval knights took a vow to reaffirm their commitment to chivalry at the start of each year. Today, many Christians prepare for the year ahead by praying and making resolutions while attending watchnight services on New Year's Eve.
But successfully achieving these goals, as we all probably know, tends to be an annual effort in futility as recent studies indicate with 88 percent of those who set New Year's resolutions failing to achieve them - one-third failing to make it past the end of January according to the time management firm FranklinCovey.
The greater failure rates came from those who admitted they'd set unrealistic goals but not far behind were those who simply didn't keep track of their progress or who just forgot about it. Finally, there are those who make too many resolutions and realize that they've put themselves on an impossible quest.
Consider: A lot of these resolutions fail because they're not the right resolutions. And a resolution may be wrong for one of three main reasons: it's a resolution created based on what someone else (or society) is telling you to change; it's too vague; or you don't have a realistic plan for achieving your resolution.
One solution: make your goals SMART - an acronym coined in the journal Management Review in 1981 for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. It makes sense for managers, but it could be helpful in establishing and keeping your resolutions, too.
Specific. Your resolution should be absolutely clear. Instead of promising to lose weight, decide to "lose 10 pounds in the next three months.
Measurable. Keep track of your progress, or lack thereof, in a journal or make notes on your phone or in an app designed to help you track behavior. You'll better be able to reinforce the progress, no matter what your resolution.
Achievable. Goals requiring a giant leap are good. But too big a step too fast can leave you frustrated and negatively impact other areas of your life.
Relevant. Is this a goal that really matters to you, and are you making it for the right reasons? Doing things because of self-hate, remorse or momentary passion will undoubtedly be difficult to maintain. But if you believe your new goals will improve your life, surround yourself with people who both agree with and will support your resolution.
Time-bound. Make sure your timeline allows you to reach your goal in a realistic span of time. Give yourself enough time to do it by including smaller, short-termed goals along your path. "Focus on these small wins so you can make gradual progress," Charles Duhigg, author of "The Power of Habit" and a former New York Times writer, said. "If you're building a habit, you're planning for the next decade, not the next few months."
Let's see how we all fare a few months from today. Break a leg!

Texto completo: One result of the current nationwide shutdown of the federal government -- we hope -- will be a new appreciation of the important work federal workers do across the country.
They should not become political footballs in a government that seems unable to accomplish basic tasks. Republican or Democrat, it is past time that Congress pass spending bills, and someday even an entire budget, that the president can sign in a timely fashion. According to Pew Research Center, Congress has passed its required spending measures by deadline only four times since the current system was adopted in the 1970s -- the last in 1997.
Obviously, we live in unusual times, with President Donald Trump unable to negotiate rationally and in good faith. Even amid this tumult, leaders on the Senate and House side need to begin planning for the day when lawmakers return to passing spending bills with established procedures -- ensuring that the government does not lack money just because someone decides to throw a hissy fit.
Workers deserve to be paid, on time, without having to worry about where the money will come from for groceries, utilities or a mortgage, especially not during the holidays.
Tips from the Trump administration on what to do to make dollars stretch included advice from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management -- including a letter employees could send to landlords offering "the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments." This is similar to advice offered in past shutdowns, but it was dumb then and remains so today. Meanwhile, the federal employees union is suing for its pay.
The partial shutdown affects some tens of thousands of federal workers across the country, including in New Mexico, who are furloughed without pay at home. Others are working, doing their job, all without pay because their jobs are considered essential. The Washington Post reports some 800,000 employees are affected.
The impact on individuals, whether workers or contractors, has been devastating. Small businesses -- and that will include people in New Mexico -- also will be affected.
Parks, museums, forests, government work big and small across the nation is being damaged. Small-business loans can't be processed. Food and drug inspections are stopped. We are at standstill.
In Indian Country, where federal agencies carry out responsibilities laid out in treaties, the pain is real. On the Navajo Nation, where snow-covered roads are not being plowed because basic maintenance stopped, people are trapped in their homes, according to the New York Times.
At issue for Trump is funding for his longed-for border wall. He lacks the necessary votes to win $5 billion in taxpayer dollars for the wall -- the same wall that Mexico was going to pay for -- and decided to close government instead. With the shutdown in its second week, few solutions are in sight.
We have one: Put federal employees back to work. Resolve to win disputes through negotiation and persuasion rather than ultimatums that hurt individuals and society as a whole. Back down, in other words.
That has never been Trump's style, but in a new year, why not try new strategies? He could "find" money not spent and apply it to places on the border where he believes a wall will increase security. That's not our preferred solution -- there are smarter ways to secure the border, including by investing in countries that are sending refugees -- but Trump has to save face somehow.
There already is $1.6 billion being offered for border security, and U.S. Sen. Doug Jones said last month that those dollars, along with billions that remain unspent, would get Trump close to the sum he is demanding. This shutdown, to be blunt, has no point.
Declare victory, Mr. President. Then restart the government, with politicians from all sides promising never, ever to use workers as a bargaining chip. Unless, of course, the first salaries to be put on hold belong to the president and every member of Congress. Since they are being paid, so should everyone else.

Texto completo: GOP lawmakers groaned when liberal darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., voted for Nancy Pelosi to become the next House speaker on Thursday.

Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman elected to Congress, publicly endorsed Pelosi's speakership bid in November. But her voice vote Thursday, which helped Pelosi secure the 213 votes she needed to retake the gavel, provoked a response from House Republicans that her congressional colleagues did not receive.

Some reporters in the chamber described the reaction as "boos," while others said they were "groans."

Michael Barbaro, of the New York Times, tweeted that the rumbling from the GOP side did not appear to be malicious.

"Republicans gently and playfully boo as AOC votes for Pelosi," he wrote.

While Ocasio-Cortez supported Pelosi for speaker, she and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., announced Wednesday they would oppose a rules package proposed by Democratic leaders that would continue a requirement for mandatory spending cuts or tax increases for any provision that increases entitlement spending.

Pelosi previously served as the first female House speaker in 2007 and held the position until 2011 when the Democrats lost the House.

Texto completo: "They're everything, these women. We call them survivors. They're so brave. Their stories are important, and they have every right to share them. Many of them have said they (want) to prevent someone else from falling into (such situations). There are no big paychecks for these women.
Dream Hampton,
executive producer of "Surviving R. Kelly."
Starting Thursday, the Lifetime network will devote six hours and three consecutive nights to "Surviving R. Kelly," a powerful, disturbing chronicle of the long-running allegations that the music superstar has sexually and physically abused women and young girls.
Containing more than 50 interviews and covering a time span from 1970 to today, the cable-TV documentary is among the most comprehensive looks ever at the scandal surrounding the man once nicknamed the king of R & B.
It's a story that deserves a docu-series, according to Detroit author, activist and filmmaker Dream Hampton, executive producer of "Surviving R. Kelly."
"I felt like it was time to deal with him, for lack of a better word," says Hampton.
Viewers will learn more about everything from Kelly's troubled childhood in Chicago to his early success to his secretive relationship with Aaliyah, the late singer-actress from Detroit who was 15 when she wed Kelly, then 27.
Most of all, they will hear accounts from those described by Lifetime as survivors and people from R. Kelly's inner circle who "are now finally ready to share their full story and shed light on the secret life the public has never seen."
The interview subjects include Kelly's ex-wife, Andrea Kelly; ex-girlfriend Kitti Jones, and brothers Carey and Bruce Kelly.
Already, the documentary has made headlines. An early-December screening in New York City was canceled as a result of anonymous phone threats. In a current People magazine story timed to the docu-series, eight women speak out about the alleged abuse that Kelly inflicted on them or their loved ones.
"Surviving R. Kelly" is part of Lifetime's pledge to give a voice to women who have been unheard until now and to spread awareness about issues like the abuse and harassment of women.
Hampton spoke to the Free Press about the docu-series and the courage of the women who have stepped forward to share their stories. Here's the conversation, edited for length and clarity.
QUESTION: There are appearances in the documentary by famous people like singer John Legend. Was it a difficult process to get celebrities involved or were people ready to step up?
ANSWER: When it comes to celebrities, It was incredibly difficult to get people who had collaborated (artistically) with Kelly to come forward. We asked Lady Gaga. We asked Erykah Badu. We asked Celine Dion. We asked Jay-Z. We asked Dave Chappelle. (They're) people who have been critical of him. That makes John Legend even more of a hero for me.
Q: There's been much written about the R. Kelly allegations, but do you think a documentary like this could be the biggest step so far in terms of public awareness?
A: The New York Times did a piece that we're in a post-text world. Even though Jim DeRogatis has done the heavy lifting of being on this story for the past 15, 20 years probably, at this point, I think seeing it is going to be (important). That's just where we are. No one's reading, and they're not getting to articles. If you have Facebook, people just argue about the title of an article in the comments section. As a storyteller, it's really important to me to make sure we get the most eyes on (the docu-series) as possible. It really is an incredibly important story We have to see what gender violence looks like, what sexual and mental abuse look like, in order to avoid it and know the signs.
Q: Can you talk about the women who've come forward for this docuseries? What do they mean to it?
A: They're everything, these women. We call them survivors. They're so brave. Their stories are important, and they have every right to share them. Many of them have said they (want) to prevent someone else from falling into (such situations). There are no big paychecks for these women. We can't pay them to be in a documentary. There are no endorsement deals. This kind of exposure doesn't lead to some great something. I admire them so much and have all the respect in the world for them.
Q: What would you tell viewers about why they should watch all six hours?
A: I suggest that women in particular watch it with other women. I can't promise you that there's not something triggering in every episode because there absolutely is. But you're also going to see a real resolve, not just in women who are telling their stories, but in parents who are trying to get their kids back. It's quite a journey. I hope that people do stick with it.

Texto completo: A Lehigh Valley native is presenting two autobiographical one-man shows at the Association of Performing Arts Professionals annual conference in New York City.
Catasauqua High grad Bob Brader performs his solo shows "Spitting In The Face of the Devil" and "Smoker" as part of "3 From JMTC," running in repertory at the Bridge Theatre in New York City through Jan. 13. The performances also will include "The Good Adoptee" by Brader's wife, Suzanne Bachner. The Monday performance will be featured as a showcase for the conference.
Brader says he got his first taste of theater at the Pennsylvania Playhouse in Bethlehem.
"It was amazing," Brader says. "Pennsylvania Playhouse was my home-away-from-home. I grew up in an abusive household and getting into theater helped me escape it. I felt safe there."
"Spitting in the Face of the Devil" is the story of his Brader's discovery that his abusive ex-Marine father also was a pedophile. His father, a heavy smoker, died of a heart attack in 2004.
He says after his father died, he wanted to tell his story and met with Bachner, a playwright and director, because he wanted her to write a play based on his relationship with his father.
"We were at Great Adventure eating funnel cake and I told her my story," Brader says. "She told me I should write it because it needed to come from me."
At first, Brader wrote the play having himself talk to the audience from behind a desk, but Bachner told him to get rid of the desk.
"I was telling a true personal story and I felt safe behind the desk," he says. "It was terrifying for me to be alone on the stage, but it opened the show up."
He says after that change, the show, which premiered in New York, started winning awards.
"I thought I would write it, perform in it and it would be done, but it kind of took off," he says.
The show, which premiered in New York in 2007, got the Best of Fest Award seven times at the London Fringe and won "Best Script" and "Best Encore" at New York City's United Solo Theatre Festival.
The next show Brader wrote was "Smoker," which he calls the story of "my 28-year-love affair with smoking and how I quit."
" 'Smoker' deals with addiction," he says. "In my turbulent relationship with my father, the only connection we had was smoking together. People don't realize how smoking is really woven into a smoker's life, and becomes a part of who you are."
"Smoker" also was well-received and won the Best Autobiographical Show Award at New York's United Solo Theatre Festival, where it premiered in 2015.
During all this, Brader and Bachner got married, and she serves as director and developer of his shows.
Brader also became co-artistic director of Bachner's nonprofit John Montgomery Theatre Company in New York, after which "3 From JMTC" is named.
The other show, "The Good Adoptee," is the story of Bachner's search for her birth parents as she confronts the uncooperative bureaucracy that guards New York state's sealed records.
The shows have been touring in the United States and Canada, and are returning to New York for 13 performances.
For the conference showcase Monday, 20-minute segments from the shows will be presented in continuous rotation 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at The Bridge Theatre, Shetler Studios, 12th floor, 244 W. 54th St., New York. The showcase is open only to conference members.
The other performances are 80 minutes long and will be presented in repertory at The Bridge Theatre. There will be a talk with the artists after each performance.
All performances of "Spitting In The Face Of The Devil" and "Smoker" will benefit Safe Horizon, an organization supporting abuse survivors. "The Good Adoptee" will benefit You Gotta Believe, an organization that helps prevent homelessness of former foster youth.
JMTC Theatre has produced more than 50 productions in New York City, including Bachner's Off-Broadway hit "Circle" and her memoir play "We Call Her Benny."
Brader says he still gets back to the Lehigh Valley to visit his mother and sister, with whom he says he is very close.
He also dreams of one day presenting "Spitting in the Face of the Devil" at the Pennsylvania Playhouse, where it all started for him.
*"Smoker," 2 p.m. Jan. 12; 7 p.m. Saturday and Tuesday "The Good Adoptee," 7 p.m. Jan. 11; 2 p.m. Saturday, Wednesday and Jan. 13. "Spitting in the Face of the Devil,' 7 p.m. today, and Jan. 9 and 12; and 2 p.m. Sunday. The Bridge Theatre, Shetler Studios, 244 W. 54th St., 12th floor, New York. Tickets: $50.

NCC Summer Theatre 2019
Northampton Community College Summer Theatre has announced the productions for its third season. The program was started by director Bill Mutimer in 2017. Its five shows drew nearly 8,000 over two months at Northampton Community College's Lipkin Theater.
The 2019 season starts with "In the Heights" June 5-16. The musical features music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda of "Hamilton" fame and a book by Quiara Alegria Hudes. The story is set over the course of three days, involving characters in the largely Hispanic-American neighborhood of Washington Heights in New York City.
The next show is "Falsettos" June 19-30. "Falsettos" is a musical with a book by William Finn and James Lapine, and music and lyrics by Finn, who also wrote the book and lyrics for "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee." It is a hilarious and poignant look at a modern family revolving around the life of a gay man Marvin, his wife, his lover and his soon-to-be-bar-mitzvahed son.
"Jesus Christ Superstar" will be on stage July 24 to Aug. 4. The 1970 rock opera features music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical is loosely based on the Gospel accounts of the last week of Jesus' life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion.
Next is "A Buddy Holly Tribute: the Day he Music Died," running July 3-14, with a special July 4 picnic/performance. It follows the story of rock 'n' roll legend Buddy Holly from his humble roots to his string of hits like "Peggy Sue" and "That'll Be the Day" to the tragic plane crash that killed Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson.
The children's show is "The Perfect Dog," scheduled to run July 10-Aug. 3. In this musical, inspired by The New York Times' best-selling author, John O'Hurley's book, 12-year-old Sam is searching for the perfect dog to enter in the town's dog contest.
Tickets for all shows go on sale March 1 at www.nccsummertheatre.org. Info: 610-332-6549

Texto completo: With the coming of the new year, bread and water is officially off the U.S. Navy’s menu of punishments for minor misconduct. No longer can commanders of ships confine misbehaving sailors to the brig for three days with only bread and water for rations.
Startled to learn that a vestige of the age of sail was still on the books until this week? More startling, perhaps, is the fact that this 19th century punishment was still being imposed in the 21st. In 2017, a skipper’s liberal use of the penalty led to a cruiser in the Pacific being referred to informally as the USS Bread and Water, The New York Times reported recently.
The deletion of bread and water from a ship commander’s punishment options resulted from a 2016 congressional update of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It culminated an abolition effort that began as early as in 1882, when the secretary of the Navy said that the punishment “meets with the disapprobation of the department.”
The Navy had gradually lessened its severity over the years by imposing restrictions on its use. In 1909, new regulations reduced sentences from 30 to seven days, and in 1951, the limit was dropped to three.
More recently a medical examination was required before the punishment could be imposed. And those being sanctioned in this fashion at least got as much bread and water as they wanted.
“It just seems anachronistic and stupid,” Capt. Scott Tait told the Times last month. He said he had never imposed the punishment himself while commanding two destroyers, nor had he ever heard of it being used. “People used to joke about putting guys on bread and water, but I was well into my career before I realized I was actually allowed to do that,” Tait said.
That bread and water endured so long is no doubt attributable to the Navy’s reverence for tradition, but still. England’s Royal Navy, once notoriously harsh, did away with it in 1891. And cultural attitudes long ago shifted away from spanking children, for instance.
The bread-and-water regimen has its defenders, though, and their arguments are not wholly without merit. They point out that with ships being at sea for long periods, commanders need to be able to sanction minor misconduct swiftly and on the spot. And while captains retain the power to impose sanctions such as extra duty for up to 45 days, loss of rank, half-pay for two months and restriction to the ship for up to 60 days, supporters of the more direct approach point out that some of those sanctions, such as half pay, can punish a sailor’s family, too, instead of only the offender.
Bread and water “sounds medieval, and that is sort of the point,” said Capt. Kevin Eyer, who regularly imposed the punishment before he retired 10 years ago. “Sometimes you just need to scare a kid. We want them to succeed, but you need to give them a kick in the pants.”
And just to put things in perspective, consider this: In the 19th century, bread and water was considered an enlightened alternative to flogging, which was outlawed by Congress in 1862.

A sign of intelligent life for Dems

Texto completo: WASHINGTON
If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November, she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue -- 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer; 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are -- were, they are shuffling off stage -- almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November -- the Democrats lost only two seats nationally -- come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party -- come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined -- they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income. Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party – come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined – they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income.

Texto completo: A fractured collarbone. Spinal fractures. Head wounds.
Antony Fernandez, his wife and daughter suffered devastating injuries six years ago after an attack in their home in India.
The family had spent much of its time doing charitable acts, said Mr. Fernandez, 46, like distributing food, clothing and medicine to the poor and impoverished in their city, Thiruvananthapuram.
"We will give everything to everyone," he said in a recent interview. "There is no discrimination."
Devout Christians, they actively practiced their faith in a country with a majority Hindu population. And their deeds caught the attention of a group that believed the Fernandez family had been trying to convert others to their religion -- a point of tension and conflict between right-wing Hindu activists and India's minority groups.
On Nov. 3, 2012, five zealots entered the family's home. Records from their city's Medical College Hospital show that Mr. Fernandez had a fractured collar bone and a blade-puncture to the abdomen; he lost the tip of a finger.
His wife, Sheehan Fernandez, suffered spinal fractures and deep head wounds, the records show, and their daughter, Aiswarya, then 11, had injuries to ligaments and soft tissues, as well as a compression fracture of the spine.
After their release from the hospital, three years of destitution and terror followed.
The injuries prevented Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez from working. Their daughter did not attend school so the family could keep a low profile. They went into hiding, moving frequently and scraping together food and shelter. They leaned heavily on the Missionaries of Charity Sisters, a group established by Mother Teresa (Mrs. Fernandez, an orphan, had been raised in one of their convents).
In December 2015, the family came to New York to apply for asylum. Their first night in the United States was spent on the floor of a small room in New Rochelle, where they were boarded thanks to a contact Mr. Fernandez made in advance of their trip to the United States.
The family did not have clothing appropriate for the weather. Any sense of awe they could have felt at seeing snow for the first time was overshadowed by the frigid temperatures.
"I didn't sleep," recalled Aiswarya, now 17.
"The floor was so cold," Mr. Fernandez added. He said that they used a window curtain for a blanket.
Within a few months, they met a stranger who told them about the New York City shelter system. The man even drove them to an intake center.
"After that, he disappeared," Mr. Fernandez said. "Like an angel."
For the last two and a half years, the family has lived in a shelter in the Bronx. They each have work permits and Social Security cards; all three are awaiting a decision on their asylum applications. And they have become parishioners at St. Dominic Church.
Catholic Charities, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $350 in Neediest funds to buy a laptop for the family in December 2017. It is a treasured asset for Aiswarya, who is excelling at school.
Mr. Fernandez works at an IHOP restaurant within biking distance of the shelter. He washes dishes and cleans floors.
"I don't feel any shame," he said. "I'm working for my family, and I'm working for Jesus. So if I have $5, two for us and three for others. Every time, I'm thinking like that."
Mrs. Fernandez, 41, remains unable to work because of her injuries. She contends with neck pain, headaches and severe anxiety. Doctors have advised her against lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds.
The family's trauma has not prevented them from giving back to others in need. Twice a month, Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez bring items from their personal food pantry rations -- specifically extra bread -- to Pennsylvania Station in Midtown and distribute it to the many homeless people who congregate there.
"We won't eat that much," said Mr. Fernandez. "We don't want to waste it."
It disturbs them to see so many people living on the streets, he added. Even with what little they have, the family believes in doing acts of charity and kindness.
"We don't want too much money," Mr. Fernandez said. "We want to do something for the poor."
Mrs. Fernandez, who grew up with seven shirts, one for every day of the week, is often compelled to give her husband's clothes away to Goodwill. He usually learns she has done so when he searches for a certain one.
Despite their hardships, the family's faith has never wavered. "The essence of the flame is the same if it is burning a forest or used to light a lamp," Mr. Fernandez said.
The family hopes they will soon be able to leave the shelter system and be placed in public housing. Things are imperfect, Mr. Fernandez said, but they now have some peace that eluded them in their home country.
"When we were in India, we thought that any time, we will be attacked," Mr. Fernandez said. "Here, we can sleep without the fear."

Texto completo: In a dusty, deserted patch of desert near the Mexican border, inside a tent city enclosed with a giant fence, there are thousands of detained children and teenagers. Just outside the locked entrance, sitting on a metal chair and holding a sign that says "FREE THEM," is Joshua Rubin.
Rubin, 67, a software developer from Brooklyn, has been keeping watch at the entrance to the camp in Tornillo, Texas, since the middle of October 2018. He spends his days watching trucks - filled with construction materials, water and child refugees - drive inside, unload and come back out, and peering through the chain-link fence at the teenagers locked inside. By night, he sleeps in an RV.
"The hardest part of it is seeing people moving [into the camp] and seeing it by myself," he told me. "Seeing faces go by. You'd think it would get easier, but it doesn't."
Though Rubin had protested at the border multiple times this past summer - and was arrested once - in October he decided he didn't want to continue reading the news from home. He set up a Facebook page - Witness: Tornillo - started a GoFundMe page and drove nearly 2,200 miles to West Texas from New York. His goal: to bring attention to the Tornillo camp, and hopefully shut it down.
"The fact that there are children involved here is kind of a window into people's hearts," he said. "I was hoping I could show people that immigrants are just children who need help."
Rubin, who identifies as ethnically Jewish, is part of a wave of activism aimed at protesting the detainment of children without their families at immigrant processing centers. Rabbi Josh Whinston, a Reform rabbi from Ann Arbor, Michigan, led a group of 200 people to Tornillo for Thanksgiving. Rabbis from Chicago; Little Rock, Arkansas, and elsewhere have led "border pilgrimages" to Tornillo, which is south of El Paso.
The Tornillo camp was built in June 2018 to process refugees on their way to longer-term detention centers in El Paso; it was also built for children before they were sent to foster homes or to their sponsors. When the Trump administration enacted policies separating asylum-seeking parents from their children last spring, the minors were taken all over the country, to shelters and to foster homes. Court rulings have forced the administration to reunite the children with their families. In September, the administration began moving those children to one location: Tornillo.
Now, the average stay in the camp is nearly 60 days for children, according to news reports, on top of the months that some children there have already spent in detention centers elsewhere.
They live in massive walled tents; the largest tent holds 300 teenage girls. They receive some schooling from teachers working on contract and play soccer on a small turf field. The camp, run by Baptist Family & Children's Services, a large disaster relief not-for-profit, costs about $100 million a month to operate.
Rubin's residency on a chair outside the front entrance has made him something of an authority on the camp. He says that contract workers in the camp, despite having been warned not to speak with him, sometimes "get tempted" and leak information to him. He says he's also brokered contacts between sources from the camp and journalists reporting on what goes on inside.
A New York Times article from mid-October reported that the camp held 1,500 minors. Recently, Rubin says, he's seen the population swell. He bases his estimates on what he hears from the workers and from watching vans with opaque windows and trucks with portable toilets going in. Lately, he's noticed more teenage girls coming into the camp. He thinks there are about 2,500 minors there right now. The Department of Health and Human Services said in September that the camp could have the capacity for 3,800.
Rubin says that the Tornillo campsite is "fragile," meaning he thinks that a critical mass of protesters - and media attention - could shut it down. In pictures posted on the Witness: Tornillo Facebook page, Rubin notes that nearby power lines don't appear to be connected to the camp, and he says that the camp is run off generators. His pictures show trucks bringing in potable water by the 2,000-gallon load.
Rubin believes that the children should be reunited with their families immediately, and that the United States should not bar immigrants from coming into the country.
"Let's open our arms to people coming to the border," he said. "It's not going to hurt us."
Rubin's wife, Melissa Bowen Rubin, said that having her husband away from the house for so long has been difficult. He was not home for her 65th birthday or for Thanksgiving. Bowen Rubin, a painter and a teacher of English as a second language, said she hopes he'll back in Brooklyn sometime in January.
"It's a bad season to miss," she said. "It's the sacrifice on the homefront."
Bowen Rubin went to visit her husband for several days. His absence has been difficult, but she believes in his activism.
"It was great to go down there and see the life that he's creating," she said. "This sort of thing is what has to be done in order to have a hope of a solution or a serious response."
Rubin acknowledges that the distance from his family has taken a toll on him, too.
"It's lonely at times, and I miss my wife and my son," he said.
Rubin, who is self-employed, says he isn't sure what will come of his sitting and watching and witnessing, but his vigil has taken on a higher intensity of late - the camp appears to be bringing in construction materials at an even higher rate than usual. He's seen dozens of toilets - a good barometer for the number of residents - trucked in.
So until he goes home, he'll continue taking pictures, posting on social media and watching the trucks go in and out.
"All we have to do is say, 'Enough of this nonsense,' and say, 'Unite the families,' and this goes away," he said.

Texto completo: Dr. Rafael Campo describes poetry as a form of primary care that can help heal both patient and physician. Campo, who practices and teaches at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, was recently appointed editor of the Poetry and Medicine section of the medical journal JAMA. He is the latest in a line connecting poetry to medicine. Here is a look at some other notable poets who trained as doctors.
John Keats: The English Romantic poet was apprenticed to his family's London doctor at age 14 then trained for six months at Guy's Hospital, where he was quickly promoted to “dresser," assisting surgeons during operations. He also was a qualified apothecary, the forerunner of the pharmacist. In his poetry, he suggests that scientific knowledge can so demystify the natural world that it lessens its allure. He writes in the poem “Lamia" (1820):
Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
We know her woof, her texture; she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things.
Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr : The Cambridge native practiced medicine and later became dean of Harvard Medical School. In 1843, Holmes famously publicized the connection between infection and cleanliness, urging fellow surgeons to wash thoroughly, wear clean clothes, and abstain from deliveries for 48 hours after coming into contact with a case of puerperal, or postpartum, infection. His poem “Old Ironsides" (1830) is credited with helping to save the Navy frigate USS Constitution from being scrapped.
O, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave.
William Carlos Williams : A New Jersey native and lifelong resident, Williams obtained a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania and did advanced study in pediatrics. He maintained a practice out of his home — and delivered an estimated 3,000 babies — even as he became a strong voice in the modernist movement of literature. In Williams's 1917 poem “January Morning," a physician makes an appearance.
The young doctor is dancing with happiness
in the sparkling wind, alone
at the prow of the ferry! He notices
the curdy barnacles and broken ice crusts
left at the slip's base by the low tide
and thinks of summer and green
shell-crusted ledges among
the emerald eel-grass!
