Texto completo: Inspired by reports of a second patient apparently freed of infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, scientists are pursuing dozens of ways to cure the disease.
But now, researchers must reckon with a long-standing obstacle: the lack of women in clinical trials of potential HIV treatments, cures and vaccines.
Women make up just over half the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide, and the virus is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age. In Africa, parts of South America and even in the southern United States, new infections in young women are helping to sustain the epidemic.
Women and men respond differently to HIV infection, but clinical trials continue to rely heavily on the participation of gay men. Trials of potential cures fare particularly poorly in this regard.
A 2016 analysis by the charity AMFAR found that Women represented a median of 11% in cure trials. Trials of antiretroviral drugs fared little better; 19% of the participants were women.
Vaccine studies were the closest to equitable participation, at 38%.
"If we're going to find a cure, it's important that we find a cure that actually works for everybody," said Rowena Johnston, AMFAR's director of research.
There are well-known differences in the immune systems of men and women. The flu shot produces a much stronger immune response in women, for example.
The response to HIV infection seems also to differ. The immune system in women initially responds forcefully, maintaining tight control over the virus for five to seven years.
But over the long term, this state of high alert takes a toll. Women progress faster to AIDS than infected men, and are more likely to have heart attacks and strokes.
"There are all sorts of differences between men and women, probably mediated partially by hormonal effects," said Dr. Monica Gandhi, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
For example, the female hormone estrogen seems to lull HIV into a dormant state. That may sound like a good thing, but the dormant virus is harder for the immune system, or drugs, to kill.
Some differences may be evident even before puberty: In one study, all but one of the 11 children who were "elite controllers" - people who seem to suppress HIV to undetectable levels without drugs - were girls.
Women also respond differently to some drug treatments.
Dolutegravir may increase the risk of neural tube defects in children born to women taking the drug, researchers have found. Nevirapine is far more likely to cause a severe rash in women than in men - yet men accounted for 85% of the trial subjects in which the drug was tested.
These sex differences are likely to be germane to trials of potential cures, most of which are exploring ways to energize the immune system to kill HIV.
The number of men - and gay men in particular - in HIV trials has always surpassed the number of women. Early on, the epidemic was largely concentrated in gay men, who enrolled to gain access to new drugs as early as possible.
Gay men "were literally dying to get into these trials," said Jeff Taylor, 56, an HIV advocate in Palm Springs, California, who enrolled in dozens of trials after his diagnosis in 1982.
Now, 30 years later, "it's the same group of people, who understand the value of clinical trials."
Gay men have formed strong support networks that alert potential participants to clinical trials, and they often live in cities where the research is conducted.
By contrast, women with HIV tend to be isolated, and may not advocate for themselves. They may need help with child care or transportation, or be more comfortable with female doctors - accommodations few trials offer.
For women of color, there is an additional hurdle: mistrust resulting from a long history of exploitation by medical researchers. "It's a lot of stigma still in our community around research," said Ublanca Adams, 60, who is living with HIV in Concord, California.
Scientists do not seem to know how to gain that trust, she said: "How information is given out to our community and our people is just not in a way to be inclusive, nor is it inviting."
Adams said she has enrolled in a few observational studies, but does not trust scientists enough to participate in tests of a treatment or cure.
In the rare cases where scientists go the extra mile to enroll women, they face additional scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration. (The agency has strict rules for including women of childbearing age.)
Most researchers simply opt for the easy way out and enroll men, collecting data from women only after a drug is on the market.
Two recent trials of long-acting antiretroviral drugs - which can be injected monthly instead of taken by mouth daily - have managed to attract significant numbers of women: 33% of participants in one study, and 23% in the other. But because of the promise of less frequent treatment, these trials were hugely popular and so had an easier time recruiting women than most.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Just weeks before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged on Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died in August. It reveals that Hofeller “played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, ‘Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,’ ” and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller’s role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman. Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year.
The letter drew on new information discovered on Hofeller’s hard drives, which were found accidentally by Hofeller’s estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers’ letter to Furman.
The evidence, which was first reported by The New York Times, contradicts sworn testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court on Thursday morning for “sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony” by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU on Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to “respectfully inform” it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting “and that Petitioners (the government) obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations.”
The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion; the hearing would be Wednesday.
“Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census,” Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. “Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday’s hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments.”
The Supreme Court heard the case on April 23. Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public. On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump’s election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
“It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing,” he said.
Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence.
The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and to determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.
Hofeller’s files also reveal that in August 2017, he helped ghostwrite a draft Department of Justice letter to the Commerce Department requesting a citizenship question and coming up with a rationale — to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, the plaintiffs’ lawyers said. He then gave this letter to Gore, the principal deputy assistant attorney general, in October 2017, they said.
The genesis of that request and the rationale behind it were key questions in trials challenging the question. Ross initially told Congress that the request was initiated by the Justice Department in a December 2017 letter, but administration documents released in the case later indicated that it came at Ross’ urging, starting months earlier. Census and voting rights experts have said the question is not needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act.
The Justice Department letter “bears striking similarities to Dr. Hofeller’s 2015 study, stating that a citizenship question on the Census was essential to advantaging Republicans and white voters,” the letter to Furman said. It added: “Based on this new evidence, it appears that both Neuman and Gore falsely testified about the genesis of DOJ’s request to Commerce in ways that obscured the pretextual character of the request.”
Critics of the question blasted the administration after the news broke.
“Republican political operatives plainly want to deny communities of color the health care, education and other services they need in order to consolidate GOP power and a whiter electorate,” said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “We call on Congress to hold Trump administration officials — including Secretary Ross — accountable now and not to wait until after the Supreme Court ruling to do so.”
Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House subcommittee on census oversight, said the new information undercut the bureau’s years of work to plan a nonpartisan count.
“Revelations that this administration threw a grenade into that process in order to achieve partisan goals must be a gut-punch to every career Census employee whose goal is to earn the public’s trust and confidence in the 2020 Census,” she said.
In April the high court’s five conservatives seemed to lean toward allowing the question, citing the Voting Rights Act rationale and focusing not on Ross’ motivations but rather on whether he was using the power he was authorized to exercise.
The court’s liberal justices were skeptical. Justice Elana Kagan said Ross seemed to be “shopping for a need,” trying unsuccessfully to get Justice Department and Homeland Security Department officials to request the question before finally getting the Justice Department to agree.
“You can’t read this record without sensing that this — this need is a contrived one,” she said. “There have been lots of assistant attorneys general in the (Justice Department’s) Civil Rights Division that have never made a plea for this kind of data.”
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wondered whether courts should be making the decision. “The statute that Congress has passed gives huge discretion to the secretary (in) how to fill out the form, what to put on the form,” he said.
If Congress is unhappy with the secretary’s decision, “why doesn’t Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?” Kavanaugh asked.
Since taking the majority in January, some House Democrats have sought to do exactly that, but they have accused the administration of stymieing their efforts.

Texto completo: Baltimore's budget office estimates a ransomware attack on city computers will cost at least $18.2 million - a combination of lost or delayed revenue and direct costs to restore systems.
The cost estimates were disclosed Wednesday at a City Council budget hearing as regular email service was restored for at least some Baltimore employees, the first public indication that the city's technological recovery is showing signs of success.
The city's information technology office has spent $4.6 million on recovery efforts since the ransomware struck May 7 and expects to spend an additional $5.4 million by the end of the year, officials said.
The other $8.2 million in impact is from potential lost or delayed revenue, such as money from property taxes, real estate fees and some fines.
The hackers demanded the city pay a ransom in bitcoins worth about $76,000 on the day of the attack, but Democratic Mayor Bernard C. "Jack" Young refused to pay. While the estimated cost of recovery is vastly higher than the ransom, the city still likely would have needed to spend money to bolster its defenses to prevent a future breach.
After hearing the news, Young said in an interview Wednesday night that he was going to "leave all of that to the professionals and we'll just have to find the money" in the budget.
He added that he has talked with U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, and plans to reach out to other members of Maryland's congressional delegation to talk about getting financial help from the federal government because of "the virus that they let out," referencing a New York Times report that a tool leaked from the National Security Agency played a role in the Baltimore hack.
As for the estimated cost and lost revenue being much larger than the ransom demand, Young said: "We're not going to pay criminals for bad deeds. That's not going to happen." He added that even if the city were to pay the ransom, "there's no guarantee that if you pay, you reset your system."
Members of the congressional delegation have sought briefings from the NSA and federal law enforcement about the hack.
City budget director Bob Cenname shared the cost estimates at the council hearing. He said he didn't expect to see a long-term hit to revenues, but some payments to the city had been delayed.
"Once we get through this bump, I don't think the ransomware will have a huge effect," Cenname said.
A summary of the cost estimate did not provide a breakdown of the projected $10 million in spending, but officials have said they're working with outside experts to restore the network under arrangements approved by the city's finance director.
The initial cost estimate is similar to a figure for Atlanta, which suffered a similar attack last year and that Baltimore officials have said they're using for comparison. A confidential estimate obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution put Atlanta's costs at $17 million, but it's not clear whether that included any effect on the city's revenue.
Democratic Councilman Isaac "Yitzy" Schleifer said he was not surprised by the Baltimore estimate, given the experience of other jurisdictions. But he said council members are seeking a fuller estimate that would include lost productivity by city employees.
Schleifer said he expects the total cost to rise, adding: "There's obviously a lot more where that came from."
Since the beginning of the attack, employees had been without access to baltimorecity.gov emails. Many resorted to creating Gmail accounts as a workaround. That caused fresh problems, though, when Google's security system flagged some of the accounts as suspicious and briefly suspended them.
Lester Davis, a spokesman for Young, said the city has successfully carried out a pilot to restore some email accounts. The city will begin restoring accounts, prioritizing the police and fire departments as the system is rolled out. Davis said the email system now includes additional safeguards, but he declined to describe them.
Officials have not given a timetable for how long the recovery will take, other than saying it could be months.
The city also restored some services with manual workarounds. While the city's credit card payment system was knocked offline, residents with copies of bills could pay what they owed by mail or in person using checks or money orders.
After the city's property market was halted by the attack, officials came up with a temporary fix, relying on sellers to sign paperwork promising to pay any outstanding bills once the systems come back online.

As Barr mulls declassification, a familiar tune from critics

Texto completo: In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee released the so-called Nunes memo. In four pages, the document, from the committee’s then-chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed much of what the public knows today about the FBI’s reliance on the Steele dossier in pursuing since-discredited allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election. Specifically, it revealed that the FBI included unverified material from the dossier in applications to a secret spy court to win a warrant to wiretap Trump foreign policy volunteer adviser Carter Page.
All that was classified. To release it, the committee appealed to President Donald Trump, who made a declassification order. That is the only way Americans know about the Page warrant. From that knowledge came later revelations about the FBI’s use of confidential informants and undercover agents to get information on Trump campaign figures.
It is good that the public knows such things, just as it is good that the public knows what is in the Mueller report. But in the days before the Nunes memo was declassified, many of the nation’s top current and former intelligence officials, members of Congress, and analysts in the press warned that declassification would do grave damage to American national security.
It didn’t happen.
Now, some of the same people are issuing somber warnings of the damage that will be done if Attorney General William Barr declassifies documents showing what else the nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the 2016 Trump investigation.
In 2018, former CIA Director John Brennan said of the Nunes memo, "I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing." In 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff, the current chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo "crosses a dangerous line." In 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the Nunes memo "unheard of," "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Many others echoed Brennan’s and Schiff’s and Holder’s sentiments. The problem is, they were wrong then, and they are likely wrong again now.
The revelation that the FBI used the Steele dossier — the collection of unconfirmed anti-Trump dirt compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele — set off a tremendous argument about the dossier’s reliability. But there was no doubt that the Nunes memo was correct, that the FBI had indeed cited the dossier as evidence in its argument that Carter Page should be wiretapped. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that some of the loudest voices denouncing Nunes were angry about the exposure of the FBI’s questionable actions, and not the fact that the FBI’s actions were indeed questionable.
Now, there is another fight about declassification. Nunes himself has heard this all before. "These people simply use national security as a false justification to hide information that would reveal their abuses," he said in a text exchange.
Nunes summed up with one more line: "Democracy dies in darkness."
The resistance to declassification is likely to be ferocious. Almost immediately after President Donald Trump ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with Barr and gave the attorney general "full and complete authority" to declassify information from the Trump-Russia investigation, the intelligence world struck back when The New York Times reported that Barr’s project could endanger one of the CIA’s most prized sources.
Attributing its story to "former officials," the Times said the source was someone "close to (Vladimir) Putin" who gave the CIA "information about (Putin’s) involvement" in U.S. election interference, and specifically turned over evidence to support the conclusion that "Putin himself was behind the Russia hack." The source had been "long nurtured" by the CIA and was highly valued by Brennan when he was director. All of that work might be at risk if Barr moves ahead, the Times suggested.
Now, if anything might endanger such a source, it would be exposure in The New York Times. But the story showed that the intelligence world will push back hard against this new effort to investigate its record. The fight could be messy. But Barr, like Nunes, has heard such threats before. It’s time to find out what the CIA, FBI and other agencies did in those difficult days of the 2016 campaign.

Texto completo: North Carolina likes to be number one—at everything.
We declare ourselves to be "First in Flight." But it took a couple of Ohio boys to make that happen.
We declare ourselves to be "First in Freedom" based on the May 20, 1775, Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, a controversial claim that many historians dispute.
We also love it when books written by North Carolinians or ones set in our state become No. 1 best sellers on The New York Times list.
So this year we are bragging about "Where the Crawdads Sing," a book set in the fictional eastern North Carolina town of Barkley Cove, and the surrounding marshes, coves, and ocean waters.
This book by Delia Owens has been on the Times' list, usually at No. 1, for 35 weeks.
But there is a problem. We will get to that in a moment, after we consider a few things about the book that explain why it has already sold more than two million copies.
"Crawdads" is literary fiction with strong writing and lovely descriptions of nature's plants and creatures. A compelling murder mystery with an unexpected ending gives readers a superior entertainment experience.
Owens is a fan of "A Sand County Almanac," a book of nature-themed essays by Aldo Leopold. She wanted to write a book with a similar nature focus, but one that also has a strong story line.
"Crawdads" is the result. Its success demonstrates that the combination of good writing, a solid story, and interesting information about serious topics can be a commercial success.
The book's central character, Catherine Clark or "Kya," lives by herself in a shack in the marshes miles away from town. People in Barkley Cove think she is weird, keep their distance, and call her "the Marsh Girl." She spent only one day in school and cannot read or write. However, because she is smart and diligent, she learns about the nature of the marshes.
She meets Tate Walker, a young man from Barkley Cove. He senses her strengths and shares her love of plants and animals. He teaches her to read and write, and falls in love with her.
When Tate leaves Kya behind to study science at UNC-Chapel Hill, she is devastated. But she rebounds to the seductive charms of Chase Andrews, a town football hero and big shot. Their secret affair is interrupted by Chase's marriage to another woman, and Kya is again distraught.
Overcoming these disappointments, Kya leverages her reading, writing, and self-taught artistic talents to record the nature world that surrounds her. When Tate, now a scientist, returns to her life, he persuades her to submit her work for publication. That book is a great success, and she writes and illustrates several more.
All this is background for the story that begins on the first pages of the book. Chase Andrews is found dead at the bottom of an old fire tower. Kya is a suspect and is ultimately charged, arrested, put in prison, and tried for Chase's murder.
The author's deftness in setting up this situation, and resolving it smoothly, has helped make it a best seller. "Crawdads" gained the attention of beloved actress, Reese Witherspoon.
Fox 2000 has acquired film rights and plans for Witherspoon to be the producer.
We can hope that the movie will be shot in North Carolina.
But here the book's problem jumps up. The geography described in the book, with palmettos and deep marshes adjoining ocean coves, seems to fit South Carolina or Georgia coastal landscapes better than North Carolina's coastlands.
Nevertheless, whatever the moviemakers decide, North Carolinians can bask in the reflected glory of a No. 1 best seller that claims our state for its setting.

Texto completo: Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, made his first public comments on Wednesday about the Russia investigation that he took over two years ago.
The following is a transcript of his remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.
[Read our full coverage here.]
_________________
ROBERT S. MUELLER III, the special counsel: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for being here. Two years ago, the acting attorney general asked me to serve as special counsel and he created the special counsel's office. The appointment order directed the office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This included investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.
Now, I have not spoken publicly during our investigation. I am speaking out today because our investigation is complete. The attorney general has made the report on our investigation largely public. We are formally closing the special counsel's office, and as well, I'm resigning from the Department of Justice to return to private life. I'll make a few remarks about the results of our work. But beyond these few remarks, it is important that the office's written work speak for itself. Let me begin where the appointment order begins, and that is interference in the 2016 presidential election.
As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military, launched a concerted attack on our political system. The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cybertechniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks.
The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate. And at the same time, as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation, where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election. These indictments contain allegations, and we are not commenting on the guilt or the innocence of any specific defendant. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The indictments allege, and the other activities in our report describe, efforts to interfere in our political system. They needed to be investigated and understood. And that is among the reasons why the Department of Justice established our office. That is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation. The matters we investigated were of paramount importance. It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned. When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government's effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.
Let me say a word about the report. The report has two parts, addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate. The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election. This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy. And in the second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president.
The order appointing me special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation, and we kept the office of the acting attorney general apprised of the progress of our work. And as set forth in the report, after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.
The introduction to the Volume II of our report explains that decision. It explains that under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited. A special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. The department's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation. Those points are summarized in our report, and I will describe two of them for you.
First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting president, because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available. Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now.
And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. And beyond department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially -- it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.
So that was Justice Department policy. Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime. That is the office's final position, and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president. We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the attorney general, as required by department regulations.
The attorney general then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and to the American people. At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released and the attorney general preferred to make -- preferred to make the entire report public all at once and we appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public. And I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.
Now, I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter. There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress. In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office.
So beyond what I've said here today and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress. And it's for that reason I will not be taking questions today, as well.
Now, before I step away, I want to thank the attorneys, the F.B.I. agents, the analysts, the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner. These individuals who spent nearly two years with the special counsel's office were of the highest integrity. And I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments, that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American. Thank you. Thank you for being here today.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: As news of Bill Buckner’s death spread Monday, reports chronicled his impressive 2,715 career hits — and revisited the error that would come to overshadow his accomplishments.
It was 1986, Game 6 of the World Series. Buckner, then playing for the Boston Red Sox after years as a Chicago Cub, let a ball roll through his legs, allowing the Mets to score and go on to win the series.
Yes, the error hit hard in a town that had not won a World Series since 1918. But the response was far more tragic than the error: Buckner received death threats and ultimately had to move his family out of Massachusetts.
Today, with the ease of the internet and the sting of social media, it likely would have been worse. To those who don’t understand the fervor surrounding professional sports — who find the culture at times distasteful — the Buckner incident goes a long way toward illustrating why.
In this country, we are too quick to turn athletes into heroes — and too quick to turn away from them when their talents, or bodies, fail them. And too often, we are just as fickle with people in other professions and even with ourselves.
We all make mistakes in our professional lives. And we all dread making one that will define the careers we work so hard to build.
As the Daily Herald’s own sports columnist Barry Rozner pointed out, Buckner finished his career with 2,715 hits, 498 doubles, 1,208 RBI and only 453 strikeouts in 10,000 plate appearances. In a perfect world, those are the numbers that should shape his legacy, rather than a single error.
At a news conference years after the World Series play, Buckner called the spotlight on his error "the ugly part of sports," The New York Times reported. "I don’t think that in society in general that’s the way we should operate," he said at the time. "What are you teaching kids? Not to try because if you don’t succeed, then you’re going to be buried, so don’t try?"
It’s a fair and important question, one given added emphasis as we glance over the pictures of high school graduates that have filled this newspaper’s pages and Facebook feeds in recent days.
Those graduates will venture out into the world. Some will start work after tossing their caps into the air. Others will head off to college. A select few will try their luck in professional sports.
Every one of them will make mistakes.
A verbal beating like the one Buckner took should never discourage them from chasing their dreams, but it should make them think twice before publicly trashing a colleague — or a stranger — for a mistake.
And they should take notes on how Buckner moved on from his. He didn’t pass blame. He didn’t give up. He soldiered on with grace.
Ultimately, that is the lesson we can all draw on, whatever our station or profession.

Stacey Abrams Won't Go Away; The loser of the Georgia governor's race builds a political career on failure.

Texto completo: Since losing the 2018 Georgia governor's race, Stacey Abrams has given self-pity a bad name. "I did win," Ms. Abrams still insists, making fantastic claims of a stolen election. She says Republican Gov. Brian Kemp holds the office only because "it was not a free and fair election." Never mind his 54,723-vote margin of victory; she's hoping that repeating a falsehood will make it true and pave her way to the governorship in 2022, if not the presidency in 2020.
How did Democrats respond to Ms. Abrams's unsupported and incendiary charges? They selected her to deliver the party's response to President Trump's State of the Union address.
Ms. Abrams's indictment of Mr. Kemp, the former Georgia secretary of state, starts with the accusation that he closed or moved polling locations. She contends this created confusion and meant "black people faced hourslong lines . . . waiting to cast their ballots." But by law, polling places are selected by independent county election boards, not the secretary of state.
Moreover, long lines affected Georgians of all races this past November, as turnout rose from 2.59 million in 2014 to 3.95 million in 2018, the biggest-ever total in a Peach State governor's race. Ms. Abrams's claim that Georgia was ground zero for "suppression" of black voters is undermined by the state's gap in turnout, which was higher among blacks than whites.
Ms. Abrams also argues that Mr. Kemp used the state's "exact match" law to "disenfranchise voters of color." This law requires basic information on voter-registration applications to match that on Georgia's driver's license list, in Social Security records, or on state-issued IDs for those who don't drive. Mr. Kemp's office notified 53,000 registrants that their applications didn't match and informed them that under the law they had 26 months to correct their forms. In the meantime, they could still vote after showing photo ID, which is required of all Georgians.
To stir the pot, Ms. Abrams frequently points out that while 32% of Georgians are black, nearly 70% of the erroneous forms were for blacks. She fails to mention that a registration drive she led submitted more than a quarter of the flawed forms.
Then there's Georgia's "use it or lose it" law. Passed by a Democratic Legislature and signed by a Democratic governor in 1997, it says that if a voter hasn't shown up at the polls or had contact with election authorities (say, by signing a petition or updating an address) in three years, the state must notify him that he's at risk of becoming "inactive." If he then doesn't return a postage-paid card or participate in either of the next two federal elections, he's purged from the rolls. It's at least a six-year process.
Mr. Kemp's office removed 1.4 million names from the rolls starting in 2012, erasing a backlog he inherited. Still, active registrations grew from 5,033,307 when he was elected in 2010 to 6,428,581 last fall, a 27.7% increase. Much of this bump came after Mr. Kemp implemented automatic voter registration for Georgians who update or apply for their driver's licenses. For her part, Ms. Abrams never worked to repeal the use-it-or-lose-it or exact-match law during her decade in the Georgia legislature. In fact, while she criticizes Mr. Kemp for reducing opportunities for early voting, she not only voted to require him to rein in early voting, but co-sponsored the 2011 law.
Upon examination, her "stolen election" claim is a sore loser's excuse. Ms. Abrams admitted as much to the New York Times last month: "I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes." That hasn't stopped her from smearing her state. Nor has it kept Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Robert Francis O'Rourke and Kamala Harris from echoing her scurrilous charge.
Like P.T. Barnum, Ms. Abrams puts on an entertaining show that's richly rewarding—for herself. She creates nonprofits with noble-sounding names, hires herself, and fills the payroll with campaign staffers who enjoy paychecks between elections. Before the 2018 contest, her perch was a voter-registration group called New Georgia Project. Now she has two nonprofits. One is Fair Fight, which files lawsuits and attacks Gov. Kemp. The other is Fair Count, which encourages her supporters in Georgia to fill out census questionnaires. But she gave away their real purpose, explaining: "We can win this fight long-term by changing the structure of power." That means putting her in office.
Ms. Abrams is attempting to build a political future on failure. It says something about our times that she'll decide by September whether or not to run for president—and that Democrats take her seriously.

Behavioral Ad Targeting Not Paying Off for Publishers, Study Suggests; Finding could affect where publishers line up in brewing privacy battles

Texto completo: Are creepy advertisements really necessary to support the free web?
A new academic study suggests they aren't.
Behavioral advertising, which involves collecting data about readers' online behavior and using it to serve them specially tailored ads, often through bits of code called cookies, has become the dominant force in digital advertising in recent years.
But in one of the first empirical studies of the impacts of behaviorally targeted advertising on online publishers' revenue, researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of California, Irvine, and Carnegie Mellon University suggest publishers only get about 4% more revenue for an ad impression that has a cookie enabled than for one that doesn't. The study tracked millions of ad transactions at a large U.S. media company over the course of one week.
That modest gain for publishers stands in contrast to the vastly larger sums advertisers are willing to pay for behaviorally targeted ads. A 2009 study by Howard Beales, a professor at George Washington University School of Business and a former director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission, found advertisers are willing to pay 2.68 times more for a behaviorally targeted ad than one that wasn't.
Much of the premium likely is being eaten up by the so-called "ad tech tax," the middlemen's fees that eat up 60 cents of every dollar spent on programmatic ads, according to marketing intelligence firm Warc.
The online ad ecosystem is complex and opaque, said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College, who conducted the study along with Veronica Marotta and Vibhanshu Abhishek. It is "hard to understand how much value each participant in the ecosystem is adding to the process, and whether the fees different intermediaries receive are commensurate to their value added," he said.
Publishers' inability to benefit much from behavioral targeting could have implications for policy as lawmakers in Washington, D.C., debate the shape of national privacy legislation. The ad industry is pushing for new federal rules, partly to head off the risk of a state-by-state patchwork of privacy laws, following the passage of California's own privacy regulations.
"It is a huge finding in terms of the policy debate," said Ashkan Soltani, one of the authors of the California Consumer Privacy Act who formerly served as the chief technologist for the FTC. (Mr. Soltani also served as a technical adviser to The Wall Street Journal's 2012 series on privacy, "What They Know.")
"All of these externalities with regard to the ad economy—the harm to privacy, the expansion of government surveillance, the ability to microtarget and drive divisive content—were often justified to industry because of this 'huge' value to publishers," Mr. Soltani said.
The shift toward behavioral targeting has come along with two other trends: the emergence of the Google-Facebook duopoly, which in 2018 accounted for 58% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer Inc.; and the stalling of digital display ad revenue growth for many digital publishers.
A 2015 report by marketing and e-commerce research firm Econsultancy found that 40% of digital publishers' display ad revenue was stagnant or shrinking. Over the past year, many of the largest digital publishers have been forced to cut staff and explore consolidation as growth has stalled.
Michael Zimbalist, the chief strategy and innovation officer at Philadelphia Media Network LLC who previously spent a decade working in digital advertising at New York Times Co., argues the value of behavioral advertising to publishers was always misrepresented.
"Behavioral targeting has been completely overhyped in its value for publishers from the day it was first invented," he said.

Texto completo: Bill Buckner, an outfielder and first baseman whose long, solid career was overshadowed by a crushing error that cost the Boston Red Sox Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the Mets, who went on to win the championship in seven, died on Monday. He was 69.
His death was confirmed in a statement by his family and shared on Twitter by the ESPN reporter Jeremy Schaap. The statement said Buckner had Lewy body dementia.
Buckner was tough on the field, battling injuries for much of his career, and dependable at the plate, registering a .300 batting average in seven seasons and amassing 2,715 hits and 174 home runs during his two decades in the major leagues.
Buckner came up through the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, starting in the minors under Tommy Lasorda, who would go on to manage the Dodgers themselves to great success. With Los Angeles, Buckner played in the 1974 World Series, which the team lost to the Oakland Athletics in five games.
Moving to the Chicago Cubs, he won the National League's batting title in 1980 with a .324 average, led the National League in doubles in 1981 (with 35) and 1983 (38), and was an All-Star in 1981.
Buckner began his career mainly as a speedy outfielder, but he had a bad ankle injury in 1975, and by the time he went to Boston, in a trade in 1984, he had become a full-time first baseman.
It was at first base that he made the error that would haunt him. Boston, facing the Mets, was looking for its first World Series championship since 1918.
[Video: WS1986 Gm6: Scully calls Mookie Wilson's epic at-bat Watch on YouTube.]
It was the bottom of the 10th inning at Shea Stadium in New York, and the Mets were down, 5-3, with two outs and nobody on base. Then Mets batters rallied, hitting three consecutive singles off pitcher Calvin Schiraldi, driving in a run and leaving runners on first and third.
Outfielder Mookie Wilson came to the plate to face the Red Sox reliever Bob Stanley, who took over for Schiraldi. The count was 2-2 when Stanley threw a wild pitch that allowed the runner on third to tie the game and put the winning run in scoring position at second. The switch-hitting Wilson, batting left-handed, reached a full count.
On the 10th pitch of his at-bat, a handful of them foul balls, Wilson hit a slow bouncer up the first-base line off Stanley, and to the fans at Shea and in the television audience, it looked like an easy third out. All Buckner had to do was scoop it up and touch first base, and the Red Sox would have had another chance to come to the plate in the 11th and possibly win the title that their fans had craved for 68 years.
It was not to be. The ball unaccountably skipped between Buckner's legs and into the outfield. Knight dashed home, scoring the winning run as Mets fans went wild and sending the Series to a seventh game in New York.
The Mets won that one, too, 8-5, ensuring that Boston's long dry spell would, to the bitter consternation of Red Sox fans, drag on, and cementing the most amazing Mets season in memory.
Buckner, who endured heckling for years as the goat in Boston's defeat, told The New York Times in 2011 that his error remained, unfortunately, unforgettable.
"You can never really forget it because it comes up all the time," he said. "I'm a competitive guy, so it's something I didn't enjoy. But for some reason, the stars were all lined up just right for the Mets that year, and here we are, 25 years later, still talking about it."
Buckner underwent ankle and foot surgery during the off-season and started the 1987 season slowly. The Red Sox released him partway through the campaign, and Buckner went on to play for the California Angels and the Kansas City Royals before ending his career back in Boston in 1990, when he was 41. By then the fans were more forgiving: On his return to Fenway Park, they cheered.
Released by the Red Sox that year, Buckner retired. He moved with his family to a ranch in Meridian, Idaho, in 1993.
Ten years later, he told The Boston Globe that his World Series error did not weigh too heavily on him.
"There could be somebody in my shoes who would think that life sucks," Buckner said. "I chose to look at it that life is great. You can make those choices. Everyone in life has things that don't go according to plan."
William Joseph Buckner was born on Dec. 14, 1949, in Vallejo, Calif., to Leonard and Marie Buckner. His father died when he was a teenager. His mother was a stenographer for the California Highway Patrol. Bill grew up in American Canyon, Calif., north of San Francisco.
Buckner excelled at football and baseball as a youth, and the Dodgers selected him in the second round of the 1968 amateur draft. He spent some years in the minor leagues, playing for a spell for Lasorda, and attended the University of Southern California before he spent a full season with the Dodgers in 1971.
He married Jody Schenck, who survives him, in 1980. They had two daughters, Brittany and Christen, and a son, Bobby. Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available.
After his playing days, Buckner invested in real estate and automobile dealerships in Idaho. He also worked as a hitting coach, including with the Toronto Blue Jays and the Chicago White Sox, and as a minor league manager.
In 2011, he played himself on an episode of Larry David's HBO sitcom, "Curb Your Enthusiasm," in which he was taunted by hecklers and later, surehandedly, caught a baby thrown from a burning building. Onlookers hoisted him on their shoulders and cheered.
The Red Sox finally ended their World Series drought in 2004, when they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. They won the title again in 2007, beating the Colorado Rockies. The following April, for Boston's home opener of the 2008 season, Buckner threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
He was greeted with a standing ovation.

China's Orwellian war on religion

Texto completo: Let's be blunt: China is accumulating a record of Orwellian savagery toward religious people.
At times under Communist Party rule, repression of faith has eased, but now it is unmistakably worsening. China is engaging in internment, monitoring or persecution of Muslims, Christians and Buddhists on a scale almost unparalleled by a major nation in three-quarters of a century.
Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch argues that China under Xi Jinping "poses a threat to global freedoms unseen since the end of World War II."
To its credit, China has overseen extraordinary progress against poverty, illiteracy and sickness. The bittersweet result is that Chinese people of faith are more likely than several decades ago to see their children survive and go to university - but also to be detained.
China's roundup of Muslims in internment camps - which a Pentagon official called concentration camps - appears to be the largest such internment of people on the basis of religion since the collection of Jews for the Holocaust. Most estimates are that about 1 million Muslims have been detained in China's Xinjiang region, although the Pentagon official suggested that the actual number may be closer to 3 million.
Muslims reportedly are being ordered to eat pork or drink alcohol, against their religious principles. China has also offered "free health checks" that are used to get fingerprints, photos and DNA samples from Muslims for a surveillance database.
While China hasn't established concentration camps for Christians, it has harassed congregations, closed or destroyed churches, in some areas barred children from attending services and last year detained Christians about 100,000 times, according to China Aid, a religious watchdog group (if one person was detained five times over the year, that would count as five detentions).
China has tried to install monitoring cameras in churches, including on the pulpit aimed at the congregation. With China's facial recognition software, that would enable security authorities to identify who shows up at services.
The country is also experimenting with even more Orwellian technology, including the Ministry of Public Security's mass surveillance system and a "Social Credit System" that can create a blacklist for those who don't pay debts or who cheat on taxes, break traffic rules or attend an unofficial church.
Blacklisted individuals can be barred from buying plane or train tickets: Although the system is still being tested in different ways at the local level, last year it barred people 17.5 million times from purchasing air tickets, the government reported. It could also be used to deny people promotions or assign a ring tone to their phone warning callers that they are untrustworthy.
The system isn't focused on religious people, and some argue that it isn't as menacing as it is sometimes portrayed, but it's easy to see how the Social Credit System could punish faith communities - especially if it is integrated with a mass surveillance network. The Xinjiang mass surveillance system explicitly targets people who collect money for a mosque "with enthusiasm."
Through it all, Chinese people of faith have shown enormous courage. One Catholic bishop, James Su Zhimin, 87, has been detained by China since he led a religious procession in 1996. Counting previous detentions, he has spent a total of four decades in prisons and labor camps.
The paradox is that for half a century before the communist revolution in 1949, Western missionaries traveled around China, operated schools and orphanages and had negligible impact on the country - yet these days missionaries are banned, ministers are persecuted and Christianity has grown prodigiously. There are many tens of millions of Christians, mostly Protestants, with some estimates as high as 100 million.
Some are part of officially recognized churches that pledge loyalty to the government, but most are part of the underground church that has been the main target of the crackdown.
Tibetan Buddhists have likewise suffered brutally. Most extraordinary is the fate of the Panchen Lama, the No. 2 figure in Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama.
The previous Panchen Lama died in early 1989. Following tradition, Tibetans in 1995 chose a 6-year-old boy as the next incarnation of the Panchen Lama. Shortly afterward, the Chinese authorities kidnapped the boy and his family, and they haven't been seen since. In his place, the Chinese helped pick a different person as a rival Panchen Lama.
We can't transform China, but we can apply levers like targeted sanctions on individuals and companies participating in abuses of freedom - plus we can certainly do more to speak up for prisoners of conscience of all faiths. It's as important to push for their freedom as to seek more soybean exports.
Nicholas Kristof writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Hope Hicks subpoena article in New York Times draws torrents of criticism

Texto completo: The New York Times is facing criticism from the left on social media for an article about former White House communications director Hope Hicks.
The Times and reporter Maggie Haberman were the target of some on social media for an article that said Hicks is “facing an existential question” about whether to comply with a congressional subpoena.
The article begins: “One of the best-known but least visible former members of President Trump’s White House staff is facing an existential question: whether to comply with a congressional subpoena in the coming weeks.”
Hicks, who was communications director from 2017 to 2018, was mentioned in 28 pages of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York subpoenaed both Hicks and former White House counsel Don McGahn aide Annie Donaldson last week.
Some left-wing social media figures and politicians weighed in on the piece, which also featured an image from a professional photoshoot of the 30-year-old Hicks.
“It’s not a decision. She was subpoenaed,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts tweeted Sunday.
Tweet
Democratic Trump opponent Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York responded by comparing Hicks to the media’s coverage of shootings.
“Yup. Where’s the 'no angel' take now? In the immediate aftermath of shootings, media routinely post menacing photos of people-of-color victims + dredge up any questionable thing they’d ever done. But when Hope Hicks considers not complying w a subpoena, it’s glamour shot time,” she tweeted.
Tweet
Nadler also subpoenaed McGahn to testify, but the White House directed him not to participate, setting the stage for Nadler to hold him in contempt. Attorney General William Barr was also held in contempt by the committee after he refused requests to release an unredacted version of Mueller’s report.

Texto completo: Memorial Day began as a day to honor and remember soldiers killed in the Civil War, but now, in every national and state military cemetery, American flags are placed on the graves of all who have served.
On this sacred day, walk around in one of those cemeteries and read the names etched on marble gravestones. Reflect for a moment of their service, and their all too often, very brief lives. Quietly thank them, or render a salute if you have also served.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.
— In Flanders Field, by Lt. Col. John McCrae
As you walk those hallowed grounds, you’ll see elderly siblings standing by the grave of a brother killed decades ago in the jungles of Vietnam in places too difficult for younger generations to pronounce – Ia Drang, Ap Bac, Khe Sanh. These siblings talk quietly with each other, still mourning, still loving.
Standing by another grave might be the surviving children of a World War II veteran who may have served in the Battle of the Bulge, Battle of Midway, Anzio or a thousand other battles of that war. Those children are eternally grateful for the good life of that veteran.
Not far off, in an area of newer burials, you’ll likely find the still tearful family of a loved one killed in Afghanistan or Iraq. They may quietly ask themselves “why,” but the answer is illusive in these divisive times.
A few months ago, The New York Times published an article titled “The Gift of Shared Grief,” the subtitle of which was, “It’s hard to know what to say to people in mourning. Say something anyway.”
I’ve found the essence of that subtitle to be true over and over again as I talked with grieving Gold Star families from the Vietnam War era to our present wars. I often didn't know what to say to those family members, but they deeply appreciated just talking with me about their loved one. Please listen, and let them share their memories and their grief.
Continue walking among these sacred graves and you’ll hear uncountable stories being told.
Pvt. Gilbert Vallett rests in loneliness among 140,000 other veterans in Fort Logan National Cemetery. He worked as a timberman in forests bordering Canada when drafted to serve in the trench warfare of World War I. Broken in body, mind and spirit, Gilbert lived the remaining 40 years of his life in the Veterans Hospital for the Insane in Sheridan, Wyoming. We remember and honor him.
On a quieter day, take a group of young people to see these graves, and the saying “Freedom isn’t free” takes on a poignant, real meaning. Staff Sgt. Robert Pruden, a 20-year-old native of St. Paul, Minn., was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He died on Nov. 20, 1969, in Quang Ngai Province, Republic of Vietnam, yet his efforts in combat that day saved the lives of his reconnaissance team members. We remember and honor him.
The cremated remains of Cpl. Andrew Wilfahrt rest beneath his gravestone. He felt called to serve his country in the Army and was beloved by his fellow soldiers and commanding officer. Andrew was killed in action by an IED (improvised explosive device) in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan on Feb. 27, 2011, and thus became the first openly gay service member to die after the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy was repealed. We remember and honor him.
There are millions of other stories waiting to be told and heard.
The young dead soldiers do not speak.
Nevertheless, they are heard in the still houses:
who has not heard them?
They have a silence that speaks for them at night
and when the clock counts.
They say: We were young. We have died.
Remember us.
They say: We have done what we could
but until it is finished it is not done.
They say: We have given our lives but until it is finished
no one can know what our lives gave.
They say: Our deaths are not ours: they are yours,
they will mean what you make them.
They say: Whether our lives and our deaths were for
peace and a new hope or for nothing we cannot say,
it is you who must say this.
We leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.
We were young, they say. We have died; remember us.

Texto completo: The major broadcast networks unveiled their upcoming schedules this week as part of the annual tradition known in the industry as upfront week. The moment marks an opportunity for TV execs to talk about the new and returning shows they're excited about - in the hopes that advertisers will share their enthusiasm. But it's also a time when network suits are confronted with questions about topics ranging from their decision to cancel beloved shows to how well the people appearing in network offerings reflect those watching them.

Let's explore some of the biggest takeaways.

• Disney basically owns everything.

The Walt Disney Company put on a whopper of a presentation introducing upcoming plans for its various properties, which have long included ABC, ABC News, Freeform and ESPN. Disney's reach expanded even more this year in the wake of the company's acquisition of Twentieth Century Fox, putting FX and National Geographic under Disney's vast umbrella.

On Monday, a conference call with reporters started with news of yet another asset in Disney's grasp: Hulu.

Ownership of the streaming network was previously split between Disney, Fox and the Comcast-owned NBCUniversal. The new agreement gives Disney full operational control of Hulu (though Comcast will retain its 33 percent financial stake in the streaming company for the next five years).

• Yes, Constance Wu will still be on "Fresh Off the Boat."

Disney's call with reporters took place less than a week after Wu's Twitter outburst over the renewal of ABC's "Fresh Off the Boat." Obviously, the actress's controversial tweets (and subsequent statement) came up. Karey Burke, the head of ABC Entertainment, shut down any speculation that Wu would leave the show.

"There's been no thought to recasting Constance. We love what she does in the show, and we love the show," Burke said, noting that she had been aware of the other project Wu had hoped to pursue in the event that the sitcom didn't land a sixth season.

"But we never really considered not bringing back ‘Fresh Off the Boat.' The show is just too strong for us, and we love it, " Burke said. "So, I'm going to choose to believe Constance's most recent communication about the show -- that she is happy to return."

• Fox faces questions about its commitment to diversity.

On Monday, Fox announced that "Empire" will end after its upcoming sixth season. The network reiterated that there are "no plans" for Jussie Smollett to return to the drama, but execs were mum on whether the actor's ongoing legal troubles contributed to the decision to cancel the show.

The "Empire" news, coupled with the cancellation of a slew of shows prominently featuring black actors -- including "Lethal Weapon," "Rel," "Star," "Proven Innocent" and "The Cool Kids" -- prompted some questions about diversity in Fox's fall line-up. In a conference call with reporters, Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier said diversity was an "important" issue at the network.

"If you look across our slate in terms of scripted and unscripted and sports, we really are, I think, doing a good job, but the job never stops," he said. "The effort continues."

• "Bull" is getting a fourth season despite sexual harassment claims against its lead star.

The future of CBS' legal drama "Bull" looked bleak at the end of last year. In December, the New York Times reported the network paid a confidential $9.5 million settlement to Eliza Dushku after the actress alleged she had faced sexual harassment from Michael Weatherly, the lead star of the popular series.

In a subsequent essay for the Boston Globe, Dushku said she was fired from the show in retaliation for confronting her co-star about sexually charged comments he made on set. Her claims, and CBS' reported attempts to keep them a secret, drew even more scrutiny to a network that had recently ousted its CEO, Les Moonves, and prominent news anchor Charlie Rose, amid allegations of decades-long misconduct.

Not surprisingly, CBS' upfront presentation put the network's turmoil into glaring focus. There was no Moonves, long the enthusiastic host of CBS' annual event. And CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl faced questions about the company's decision to renew "Bull" -- announced last week -- following Dushku's allegations.

"Michael made a mistake in his comments," Kahl said, according to Variety. "He owned that mistake. He was apologetic at the time, and he was remorseful," Kahl said. "He was willing to take any kind of coaching or training we deem necessary for him to create a positive environment on the set."

• CW doubles down on what it does best.

CW gave its current lineup a vote of confidence, renewing 14 shows including, in a first for the network, its entire freshman slate. It also announced three new series that fit into the comics-friendly network.

CW will expand its so-called Arrowverse with "Batwoman," starring Ruby Rose ("Orange Is the New Black"). The series will lead into "Supergirl" on Sunday nights.

In another well-suited pairing, "Nancy Drew," featuring newcomer Kennedy McMann in the title role, will follow "Riverdale" on Wednesdays.

And "Riverdale" has spawned another series featuring an Archie Comics character: Katy Keene. Lucy Hale ("Pretty Little Liars") will star as the fashion-forward Keene, who moves to New York City to (what else?) pursue her dreams. Josie (of Pussycats fame) will be her roommate, bringing "Riverdale's" Ashleigh Murray over to the spinoff, which premieres at midseason.

• Interracial couples/families take center stage in two new sitcoms.

ABC's "Blackish" is moving to the 10 p.m. slot to make room for "Mixedish." The previously announced spinoff explores the unconventional childhood of Johnson family matriarch, Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross, in her Golden Globe-winning role).

In the prequel, Rainbow struggles to navigate her adolescence as the biracial daughter of hippies (Tika Sumpter and Anders Holm), who trade their defunct commune for life in the suburbs. To top it all off, it's the 1980s.

Over at CBS, Chuck Lorre is introducing "Bob Hearts Abisola," which stars Billy Gardell of "Mike and Molly" fame. Gardell plays a middle-aged businessman who falls for his cardiac nurse, a Nigerian woman, while recovering from a heart attack.

Abisola (Folake Olowofoyeku) doesn't reciprocate Bob's feelings -- at least, not initially. (Man ends up with woman well out of his league isn't exactly a new formula for CBS.) But the network says the sitcom will focus on more than Bob's attempts to woo Abisola, calling the show a "comedy that examines immigrant life in America."

• Tiffany Haddish will host a reboot of "Kids Say the Darndest Things."

The comedian is also an executive producer of the ABC show, a revamp of the series Bill Cosby hosted in the late ‘90s. "I'm excited to hear what kids have to say these days because I can't understand what they are saying on social media," Haddish told Deadline. "They're using too many abbreviations!"

In other hosting news ...

• Melissa McCarthy is replacing Steve Harvey as the host of NBC's kid-centric variety show, "Little Big Shots," which will return after football season. The move followed the cancellation of Harvey's syndicated daytime talk show, prompting the Hollywood Reporter to quip that "Saturday Night Live's" Kenan Thompson "is the only version of Steve Harvey you'll be seeing on NBCU any time soon."

• In case you missed it, YouTube star Lilly Singh (aka Superwoman) will take over as the host of NBC's 1:35 a.m. ET time slot in September. Her show, "A Little Late With Lilly Singh," will replace "Last Call With Carson Daly" as "The Voice" host ends his 17-year-run in late night.

• Jimmy Kimmel is setting his late-night show on the path to a milestone 20 seasons. The comedian recently signed a three-year contract extension, keeping him at ABC through the end of 2022.

Texto completo: Four years ago Jane Gocha's best friend told her to apply to a science program in the medical laboratory sciences department with her at Marist College.
At first the East Fishkill resident said she needed time to research the program but eventually decided it was a good fit.
"I couldn't be more grateful," Gocha said.
On Saturday, Gocha and Hannah Johnson graduated with a Bachelors of Science and Medical Technology. They will soon start their jobs as medical technologists at Vassar Brothers Medical Center.
"I grew up around here and always wanted to go to Marist growing up so this is a dream come true," Johnson said. "I also always wanted to work at Vassar but I never thought I wanted patient contact. So this feels perfect for me."
As medical technologists, Johnson said they will look at "a slide of a patient and we know they might have cancer or they may be sick. We are the first people to see that and are able to point it out to the doctor for better treatment."
They were two of 1,208 Marist undergraduate students on Saturday to walk across the stage. Hundreds of people were in attendance Saturday morning to honor the students' accomplishments, including family, friends and Pete Davidson.
In total 1,719 students were celebrated between Friday and Saturday as Marist College President David Yellen presided over the ceremonies.
"And many of you did this while overcoming very significant obstacles," Yellen said about what all students accomplished in their time at Marist. "Illness, death in the family, economic struggles, language barriers and even homelessness. We salute you for the diligence it took for you to get here today."
Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic for the New York Times, told the graduates to innovate and adapt as jobs they take within the next year may disappear in the coming years.
"That old idea of a career ladder, something that exists in a straight line and you can climb it steadily, methodically, hand over hand to a mythical top," Friedman said in her commencement speech. "That, for most of us, no longer exists. If anyone tells you it does, you have my permission to tell them it's fake news."
Kay Geer, who graduated from the school of communication and the arts with a focus of games and emerging media, said as a game designer she has created about 20 video games.
She said in her last semester at Marist, she worked on a project to create a virtual reality horror game for people who have visual impairment. Although the project wasn't completed, she said she wants to continue to create games that are universally accessible.
"I don't want to keep making stuff that everybody's already doing," Geer said. "I want to try and innovate and make things that no one really thought of yet."

Uber and the trouble of taxi medallions

Texto completo: Observers have been flagellating Uber for its supposedly disastrous initial public offering because the ride-hailing giant fetched a market value of (only) $75 billion and because the stock has fallen further in the aftermarket.
The bankers at Morgan Stanley, a lead underwriter, were plainly overconfident, having initially forecast $120 billion. But what the IPO actually proved is the success of Uber's model.
Together with Lyft, which also went public, the ride-hailing industry is now worth more than $85 billion. Not bad for a business that didn't exist a decade ago and that still loses money on every fare.
Uber and Lyft owe their success to two transformational innovations. They use global positioning to pair drivers with passengers, and they let supply and demand determine fares.
The merits of that model, relative to the traditional taxi industry, were underlined recently by an exposé in the New York Times on predatory lending in the New York yellow cab industry.
The two-part series , by Brian M. Rosenthal, is worth the read. Rosenthal described a bubble market in the "medallions" that the city requires to drive a yellow cab. Prices for medallions soared to more than $1 million, thanks in part to lenders who hawked dubious loans to drivers, many of them recent immigrants. The loans were marked by abuses similar to those in the late housing bubble, such as vanishingly small deposits, lack of borrower documentation, terms that were not understood by borrowers and debt loads wholly out of proportion to income.
And as with housing, medallions crashed. Medallion prices in New York have plunged to as little as $150,000; last year, 139 medallions were offered at a bankruptcy auction. (Tragically, a spate of medallion owners killed themselves.) Similar busts in medallion prices occurred in other cities.
The short answer for why medallion prices plunged is that Uber and Lyft have taken a chunk of their business. But in New York, at least, fleets of yellow cabs still roam the streets. Uber and Lyft weren't the whole story.
New York City established medallions in 1937, with the aim of preventing an oversupply. Currently, the city has just over 13,000. That number is arbitrary. If the city wanted to, it could hand out medallions on the street corner.
Because people buy and sell medallions like other financial assets, some have likened them to the stock market. The analogy misses a key distinction. Medallions don't have any intrinsic value; their value derives from artificial scarcity. In New York and elsewhere, fixed supply was a major reason for the boom.
Notice that if shares of an ordinary business rise, the market is sending a signal about demand for the company's product and ultimately its profitability. The boom in medallion prices didn't say anything about the underlying demand. It's not as if fare prices boomed. They are regulated, too - necessarily, since, otherwise, the fixed supply of yellow cabs could charge almost anything.
The moral is that when a business is partially regulated, the other part - the part that is left to the "free" market - performs in uneconomic and often undesirable ways. This was also true in housing. Government support for mortgages, via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had a lot to do with the housing bubble.
This isn't to say that free market forces - speculation, predatory lending and so forth - don't contribute mightily to bubbles. In the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, the government had no involvement. Wall Street went nuts unassisted.
And in some cases, market intervention is preferable. Felix Salmon, a financial journalist, looked at million-dollar medallions in 2011 and concluded they didn't make economic sense. Nonetheless, he could see the point of regulation.
"If you deregulated cab fares," he noted , "utter chaos would result. New Yorkers would basically have to haggle over the cost of a fare every time they got into a cab." Which is something many New Yorkers might enjoy. Nonetheless, Salmon's dilemma was about to be solved - was then being solved - by technology. Uber and Lyft don't require you to haggle. You see the price before you get in, and accept it or not, just as one does with other products and services.
Advocates for the medallion business, including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, have responded to the ride-hailing business with a formula already proven to fail: They want to limit the number of Uber and Lyft drivers. The city council has legislated a cap on ride-hail drivers, which Uber has challenged. Because the ride-hail model is winning in the marketplace, they want to make it more like the medallion business: that is to say, a business with artificially fixed supply.
Across the country, the medallion industry has fostered (relative to ride hailing) inefficiency and cronyism and, sometimes, allegations of corruption. An article in the Yale Journal on Regulation called New York City medallions "an instance of inefficient private property rights sustained by political decision-making processes subject to pressures from powerful interest groups."
And now, the medallion market - half "free" and half controlled - has succumbed to the worst sort of Keynesian bubble. Its one unquestioned advantage - reliability and convenience in setting fares - is now redundant.
Why is this an industry society should protect?
Medallion owners, who bought scarcity from the city, have in effect been ripped off. They are entitled to some transitional help. But there is no public interest in furthering the pretense that rides for hire are in limited supply.

Texto completo: As Harvard University grapples with its failure to address decades of sexual misconduct by a former professor, some faculty and graduate students say they have been pressing for at least a year for greater urgency in changing a culture of tolerating “open secrets" on campus.
In particular, they have raised alarms and staged protests about the problems faced by graduate students at the hands of the powerful professors who are supposed to be their mentors.
One professor a full year ago said he was no longer comfortable staying silent, given his own concerns and those he was hearing privately from colleagues.
“We exhort students and other victims of harassment to come forward and speak up," Stephen Blyth, a statistics professor and the former head of Harvard's multibillion-dollar endowment, wrote in a May 2018 letter to then-president Drew Gilpin Faust. Yet Harvard has a history of failing to act, Blyth said: “Victims and witnesses need to have confidence that perpetrators will, when appropriate, be removed from the university."
A copy of the letter was obtained by the Globe in the wake of recent sanctions against Jorge Dominguez, a retired Harvard government professor who was found to have engaged in “unwelcome sexual conduct" with female students and junior faculty over four decades.
The Blyth letter was shared last year with other top Harvard officials, including president Lawrence Bacow after he took over in July, a university spokesman confirmed.
Blyth said he stands by his letter. “We have an urgent collective responsibility to tackle harassment at Harvard robustly and promptly, in order to deserve the full trust of our students," he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, graduate students at Harvard, who are in a labor dispute with the university, have been protesting for months, demanding greater protections against harassment as part of their negotiated contract.
Earlier this month, Harvard acknowledged — after a yearlong investigation — its findings against Dominguez, the retired professor and onetime vice provost. The school took the rare step of stripping him of the privileges granted to retired faculty and barred him from campus.
At the same time, Bacow agreed to an external review of the university's policies. The probe is meant to examine why alleged victims may be reluctant to report misconduct, and what barriers may prevent Harvard from effectively responding to complaints.
Harvard spokesman Jonathan Swain confirmed that Faust, Bacow, and other top Harvard officials had seen Blyth's warning letter. But he said Harvard has been tackling harassment on a number of fronts since 2015 and making vigorous changes in its practices, outreach, and training for at least the past two years.
“As President Bacow has said, the university's highest priority is providing a welcoming, healthy and safe community where all students, faculty, and staff can do their best work," Swain said in a statement. This includes “ensuring Harvard is an environment where individuals are empowered to come forward when misconduct occurs."
For graduate students, reporting misconduct by a professor can be particularly fraught. Professors and department chairs guide their research and apply for grants that can help fund their pay. They also provide important recommendations for future positions, and help students establish contacts that can propel their careers.
At Harvard, that power imbalance can be magnified even further: Professors are often superstars in their fields, known worldwide and teaching at one of the country's premier institutions, graduate students said.
“The power relationships in academia are difficult. Your supervisor has control over your whole career," said Ege Yumusak, a second-year graduate student in philosophy and a member of the graduate student worker union. “Harvard is a place where there are many powerful people."
Blyth, in his letter, said the bravery required for a doctoral student to complain about a top professor rivals what Hollywood actors had to summon in the face of Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual harassment.
Even younger professors, on whom students might lean for help if they are being mistreated, are often reticent to rock the boat, the letter said. “I encountered professors who would not speak on the record for fear of retribution or disruption to their own career."
Harvard is moving ahead in earnest, said Swain, the school spokesman.
He noted that in March of 2018, Faust had asked a committee that oversees Harvard's gender and sexual discrimination matters to look into harassment by faculty members, two months before the Blyth letter was written.
Harvard saw a 56 percent increase in reports of sexual or gender-based harassment in 2018 — from 266 incidents to 416, and the largest portion identified involve faculty or staff. Harvard officials attribute the rise in reports to more training and raising awareness among students, faculty, and staff.
Since 2017, under newly appointed Title IX officer Nicole Merhill, Harvard has offered students more ways to file complaints, officials say. Students can bring to her office reports of sexual harassment or assault by students or faculty members. Sometimes alleged victims don't want to file formal complaints and are informed of other options, officials say.
Harvard also has a formal complaint process handled by its Office of Dispute Resolution, which investigates allegations.
But Harvard officials would not say whether the spike in incident reports has led to more disciplinary actions against faculty or staff for violations. Sanctions against faculty are left up to each individual school on the campus and punishment for bad behavior can vary.
Recent publicized sexual harassment cases show that Harvard has not been good at policing itself, graduate students said.
“It's a systemic problem that needs a systemic solution," said Vail Kohnert-Yount, a Harvard Law School student and a founder of the Pipeline Parity Project, fighting to end sexual harassment and discrimination in the legal profession. She said a university wide examination is sorely needed and long overdue.
Aside from the Dominguez case, Harvard also is investigating complaints of sexual harassment by other professors. For instance, allegations have been made against Roland Fryer, a high-profile economist. Fryer is alleged to have discussed sex at work, sexualized female workers, and created a demeaning workplace at his research lab going back several years, according to an attorney representing a lab worker who filed a complaint.
In a letter to the editor of The New York Times, Fryer apologized for making “bad jokes," but denied retaliating against employees or fostering an environment where women felt alienated.
Fryer's attorney said recently the professor is still waiting for a ruling from Harvard.
The problem of graduate student sexual harassment has been gaining greater attention on campuses across the country and goes far beyond Harvard Yard.
At Dartmouth College, three former psychology professors have been accused of sexual assault and harassment in a high-profile case. Earlier this year, a Michigan State University professor was alleged to have exchanged sexual favors for academic guidance to graduate students dating back to 2002. And last month, Boston University fired a well-known geologist over allegations that he harassed two former graduate students during research trips to Antarctica. The geologist has denied the allegations.
Terry Karl, an professor emeritus at Stanford University who first raised the alarm on Dominguez in the early 1980s when she was a young professor at Harvard, said the university must confront what she calls institutional failings in dealing with faculty such as Dominguez.
The external review could be a step in the right direction, she said, and “could be a turning point and an example for all universities or one more effort to stonewall, protect faculty, at all costs and shove abuse of power under the rug."

Texto completo: El gobierno de Donald Trump reactivó una práctica de 2012 en la que avisa a los empleadores de inmigrates cuando sus nombres y los números de seguro social no coinciden
Por esta razón cientos de trabajadores de todo el país se están viendo obligados a dejar su empleo después de que sus patrones recibieran las llamadas cartas “no match” y no pudieran demostrar su presencia legal en Estados Unidos.
El “bombardeo” de misivas o “cartas de no coincidencia”, que advierten sobre discrepancias entre los registros de la Administración de la Seguridad Social, el nombre de la persona y los números de seguro social que figuran en el Formulario W-2 de un empleado, ha provocado preocupación entre los empresarios.
Por temor a recibir sanciones federales, los empleadores han optado por hacer una “limpieza” de sus plantillas laborales.
“Estas acciones colocan a los empleadores en una situación alarmante, debido a que dependen de la mano de obra de miles de inmigrantes para que sus negocios continúen funcionando en una época de ‘high employment’ (alto empleo”) , dijo a Efe la activista y analista en inmigración Carmen Cornejo.
El dueño de una mueblería en Phoenix, Arizona, quien solicitó el anonimato, recibió dichas cartas recientemente, y ante el temor de ser penalizado por el Gobierno, buscó asesoría legal.
Su objetivo, dijo, era proceder con el despido de sus empleados indocumentados de forma digna y apegándose lo más posible a la legislación.
“Nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, nada más quería saber cuáles era mis responsabilidades; no los puedes correr abruptamente, primero tienes que darles la oportunidad de comprobar que están trabajando legalmente”, dijo el empresario a Efe.
En carne propia lo vivió Sofía Andrade, quien trabajaba en una compañía que elabora ensaladas. Andrade narró que su patrón dijo de repente a un grupo que tenían cuatro días para la comprobación de su legalidad en el trabajo y poder conservar el empleo.
“Nos avisaron en una reunión de que tenían un reporte de Inmigración y nos dijo el patrón que le pidieron la lista y el nombre de todos los trabajadores y su seguro social” , explica a Efe Andrade.
“Cerca de 40 personas tuvimos que dejar nuestros trabajos”, comentó la inmigrante, que llevaba seis meses en la compañía.
Ahora, agregó, tiene que trabajar en una fábrica de carpintera con un pago de 11 dólares la hora, bajo condiciones “muy duras” y que considera fuera de la ley.
“El trabajo es muy pesado, el jefe abusa porque a veces trabajamos jornadas de 13 horas al día y no nos las paga (…) completamente, pero me tengo que aguantar, porque no tengo papeles”, indicó Andrade.
Durante el corriente año, la administración Trump, a través de la SSA, ha estado enviando más de 570,000 “cartas de no coincidencia” a empresas en todo el país, de acuerdo con datos del New York Times.
Cornejo señaló que se ha notado el incremento en estas prácticas gubernamentales, ya que frecuentemente recibe llamadas de trabajadores que piden asesoría por los despidos, que consideran “injustificados”.
“No saben exactamente lo que está pasando. Para ellos su prioridad es cumplir con el trabajo, pero tristemente no están cumpliendo con las leyes al ser indocumentados, explicó la activista.
Cornejo mencionó que estas cartas están causando ansiedad a las empresas, principalmente a las de hostelería, agricultura y la construcción, sectores que se han visto más afectados por estas medidas impulsadas por el Gobierno.
“La verdad es que nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, aunque sean buenos empleados tienen que corroborar su información y al final la mayoría se va por voluntad propia”, sostuvo.
Cornejo detalló además que las razones de las discrepancias de dichas cartas pueden ser por cambios en los nombres conyugales y errores tipográficos en los formularios, pero que actualmente se están utilizando para escudriñar el estatus migratorio del trabajador.
La SSA suspendió el envío de estas cartas a las compañías en 2012, pero la Casa Blanca reanudó esta práctica en marzo pasado.
Los críticos dicen que la reactivación de las cartas es parte de la línea más dura de la actual Administración republicana y de sus políticas de inmigración.
“Esto es totalmente planificado, las acciones por parte del Gobierno, son deliberadas y van en aumento. No solo están haciendo su trabajo habitual, sino que el Gobierno está exigiendo un incremento en el número de casos”, matizó Cornejo.

Michael Reagan: The Invasion of America is Not Fake

Texto completo: The Democrats running the House of Representatives have gone insane - and they prove it every day.
Despite the conclusions of the Mueller Report, Nancy Pelosi and her Deranged Democrat underlings in the House have not given up their fight to depose President Trump.
They have six kangaroo committees in the House subpoenaing anyone who ever played golf with the president and looking everywhere they can for whatever financial or personal dirt they can find to use against him and his administration.
The Mad House Democrats don’t care what irresponsible charges they make. When it comes to Trump, all’s fair in hate and war.
Meanwhile, while they make fools of themselves and waste time trying to over-ride the Mueller Report, the Deranged Democrats refuse to do a single thing about the invasion of migrants on our southern border.
No Democrat would be caught dead calling it “an invasion.”Neither would any journalist or pundit employed by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times or the Washington Post.
But when you have thousands and thousands of Central American asylum seekers over-running our border every day and overwhelming our ability to process and properly care for their families, it’s an invasion.
Overcrowding is so bad now at the Texas border that the Border Patrol has had to fly or bus migrant families to processing centers in towns like Santa Fe, Denver, San Diego, San Bernardino and Murrieta, a city of about 100,000 between LA and San Diego.
No one is quite sure where they go after they are processed, but it could be anywhere. And they have little or no money, no food, no place to stay - just a slip of paper telling them to show up at their asylum hearing two years from now.
When will Democrats in Congress wake up and acknowledge this invasion is real? Never. They don’t give a you-know-what.
There’s nothing planned. No Democrat is talking seriously about how to fix our broken immigration system - which hasn’t been addressed for 33 years by either party in Congress.
Democrats pretend the invasion is not happening and the liberal media either pretend along with them or mock the president and Republicans who call it a national emergency.
The mainstream liberal media are especially at fault because they have done such a biased, half-butted job of covering the migrant invasion.
They’ve shown us every misery suffered by the poor migrants after they get to American soil.
And they’ve made sure the whole country knows the details about the separated families and the tragic deaths of six kids in U.S. custody - all of which, of course, are entirely the fault of a man named Trump.
But the mainstream media is shameful.
They have consistently underplayed the scope of the invasion problem, its economic and social costs, its causes (bad immigration laws and a chicken Congress) and ignored its many other victims - the American ones.
The migrant invasion has hurt the overworked border patrol officers, the people and property owners in the towns at the border, American taxpayers and the poorest citizens of the USA whose unskilled jobs are most likely to be taken by migrants.
Now we have cities and towns far from the border becoming the latest victims of Washington’s failure to fix immigration.
It’s their citizens who are going to have to pay for a lot of the food, housing, policing, education and healthcare of the migrants.
The saddest part is that this politically created mess on our border is not going to change.
Congress isn’t going to do anything and it won’t let Trump do anything.
It should be up to the public to clean out the bums in the House and Senate, but voters won’t do anything because though most of them think Congress is a cesspool of incompetent cowards they also think their home congressperson is just great.
Since the invasion of migrants from Central America is not going to stop anytime soon, you might as well go down to your town square or bus station and put up a “Welcome to America” sign.
Just make sure you write it in two languages.

Ousted professor fights for his job; Hearing on Naval Academy teacher Bruce Fleming's employment full of tension

Texto completo: The midshipman stared across the courtroom at his fired English professor. With anger in his voice, the young man said it three times:
"I don't want to be anything like him."
Midshipman Matthew DeSantis saw no role model in Professor Bruce Fleming and he told the court so. His testimony brought tense moments Wednesday to the reinstatement hearing for one of the U.S. Naval Academy's most senior and controversial professors.
DeSantis' 16-page complaint in January 2018 - he notes Fleming called him a "right-wing extremist" - launched a seven-month investigation that resulted in Fleming being fired after 31 years at the Annapolis institution.
The student and teacher - as well as professors, classmates and academy administrators - appeared in Philadelphia Wednesday where attorneys for Fleming and the academy argued over whether the professor should get his job back. The judge is expected to hand down his decision in the coming weeks.
"One 18-year-old who my client had a visceral effect on is not sufficient basis to terminate somebody," Fleming's attorney, Jason Ehrenberg, told the judge.
But the academic dean had found Fleming guilty of "conduct unbecoming a federal employee," citing a pattern of profane and unnerving behavior that flouted the personal boundaries of his students.
Students reported their professor was frank and graphic in discussing sex acts. One wrote that Fleming's disdain for the academy felt excessive. Some said they were unnerved by his hugs. Some found his blunt "life lessons" refreshing; others, sickening.
"The most memorable life lesson is when he went into detail as to how transgender surgery works," DeSantis said. "How the male appendage is cut off."
A handful of midshipmen testified and struck a softer tone under questioning from Fleming's attorney and the administrative judge. Naval Academy administrators had faulted Fleming for rubbing the back of Midshipman Andrew John Buckley.
Buckley testified the class would sit in a circle for discussions and he found himself next to the professor.
"He would reach over and touch my back, pat it," Buckley said.
"How many times did this happen?" asked Terrence Cook, the academy's attorney.
"No more than twice," Buckley said. "More of a rub, I would say."
The midshipman said he felt uncomfortable, but he went on.
"I didn't have a problem with him," Buckley said. "I enjoyed his class. I didn't think he was malicious."
Midshipman Justine Ransdell said Fleming showed the class a photo of his teenage son with his prom date. Fleming discussed the girl's dress and spoke of her supposed intentions for wearing it short.
"I think it was inappropriate," Ransdell said.
"Were you personally offended?" Administrative Judge Mark Syska asked her.
"I was not offended," she said.
But Midshipman Richard Jin said he was when Fleming purposely called him the wrong last name, say, Kim, Jong or Lim.
"I attempted to correct Professor Fleming three or four times," Jin told the court. "There was one incident where he told me to f--- off."
In his 16-page letter, DeSantis also accused Fleming of obscene, sexually explicit and "x-rated" discussions. When questioned, he said he was referring to Fleming's talks on transgender surgery, the use of condoms and an academy policy forbidding sex in the dormitory. The judge asked him if he grew up in a religious family and attended a religious high school; DeSantis said "yes."
The young man also said he felt Fleming had unfairly given him a "C" in the class. The judge asked about his grades and De Santis said he had been an "A" student.
Fleming has appealed his firing to the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, which hears federal employment cases. He wants to return to the classroom. He did not testify.
Academic Dean and Provost Andrew Phillips testified that Fleming earned high marks for his classroom instruction. The dean, however, said he couldn't overlook the professor's behavior.
"I grant that the professor can be - often is - a very effective teacher of writing," Phillips told the judge, "while at the same time he's disrespectful."
Since 2013, administrators twice sent Fleming for counseling and issued him two letters of reprimand. Fleming sent a shirtless photo of himself to students in 2015 and again two years later. Fleming has said he was trying to make relevant the 200-year-old poem "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and the theme of reality vs. an ideal.
"He's made it quite clear that he intends to continue that behavior," Phillips testified. "He doesn't see anything wrong with what he's done."
Fleming's criticism of the Naval Academy has grown louder and louder. By 2009, he was telling a CNN reporter that admissions standards were weakening. In a 2010 Op-Ed in The New York Times, he wrote the Naval Academy "lost its way." He blasted the academy with articles in Salon, The Atlantic, The Federalist and Inside Higher Ed.
"Fleming's at it again," wrote Cmdr. John Schofield, the spokesman, in one email presented to the court. "Almost comical how he regurgitates the same argument."
Fleming's friend and fellow English professor Anne Marie Drew testified in his defense. Drew said Fleming irked a series of academy superintendents over the years.
"They had a blind spot when it came to Bruce," she said. "From a military standpoint, they think he should just shut his mouth."
Drew has taught English nearly 30 years at the Naval Academy, and she said students today are less tolerant of uncomfortable lessons.
"The student body is shifting," she told the judge. "I'm speaking in huge generalities, they are more - I've had students in my class say, 'That makes me uncomfortable.' I say, 'Good! Good! Tell me why...' - more sensitive maybe?"

Texto completo: Ratcheting up an investigation that has been criticized by news organizations and press-freedom groups, the San Francisco Police Department said a freelance journalist who had obtained a leaked police report was a suspected "co-conspirator" in the purported "theft" of the document.
The allegation, contained in a statement issued by the Police Department late Tuesday, was the first instance of law enforcement authorities describing the journalist, Bryan Carmody, as a subject of their investigation, according to Mr. Carmody's lawyer, Tom Burke.
Mr. Carmody has covered news events in the Bay Area -- crime scenes, fires, car crashes -- for nearly 30 years as a self-employed journalist. In February, he obtained a police report from an unidentified person, or persons, related to the death of San Francisco's longtime public defender, Jeff Adachi.
Mr. Carmody said the document was among the supporting materials he sold to three local news programs that aired reports based on his work the day after Mr. Adachi's death. Mr. Carmody's reporting indicated that Mr. Adachi, who was 59 when he died in February, collapsed at the apartment of a woman who was not his wife. (In addition to the police report, Mr. Carmody obtained photographs of the apartment showing alcohol bottles and marijuana gummies.)
The Police Department said Tuesday that it viewed the manner in which Mr. Carmody obtained the report with suspicion. "As the investigation developed," it said in its statement, "Mr. Carmody was and continues to be viewed by investigators as a possible co-conspirator in this theft, rather than a passive recipient of the stolen document."
William Scott, San Francisco's police chief, told reporters that investigators believed that Mr. Carmody's contact with whoever had provided him with the police report "went past just doing your job as a journalist."
The police obtained search warrants and raided Mr. Carmody's home this month, taking a sledgehammer to his door and seizing his equipment and archives, after he refused to divulge the identity of his source.
At a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday, a judge set a schedule for the filing of briefs related to Mr. Carmody's motion to quash the search warrants, which would prevent the information the police obtained in the raid from being used against him or anyone else. The government's briefs are due by the end of the month. Mr. Carmody was allowed to retrieve his equipment and archives after the hearing.
The police said the sharing of the report could have constituted several crimes, including "the unlawful dissemination of official information," "the willful obstruction of justice" and "receiving stolen property."
The police have not taken a similarly aggressive stance toward Evan Sernoffsky, a crime reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle who relied on unnamed sources familiar with the same report for an article he wrote about Mr. Adachi's death.
Law enforcement authorities have not taken any apparent action against Mr. Sernoffsky, the newspaper that employs him or others in the same newsroom who have covered the story, according to Audrey Cooper, The Chronicle's editor in chief.
The raid of Mr. Carmody's apartment took place in the wake of President Trump's frequent anti-press remarks and the federal government's prosecutions of the whistle-blowers Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner. The Police Department's statement on Tuesday sought to characterize Mr. Carmody as someone hoping to profit from ill-gotten official materials in his possession, rather than as a journalist.
"Investigators learned that Mr. Carmody was offering to sell the stolen report to various Bay Area news organizations," the statement said. "Mr. Carmody's LinkedIn profile shows that he is a 'Freelance Videographer/Communications Manager, USO Bay Area' and that he was not employed by any of the news organizations who received the stolen report."
It is common for self-employed journalists to sell their work to news outlets that do not employ them. Those engaged in the kind of quick-hit journalism practiced by Mr. Carmody are commonly known as stringers.
Investigators believe that whoever leaked the police records to Mr. Carmody is employed by the Police Department, the statement said. As a public defender, Mr. Adachi often challenged the department over allegations of abuse.
The raid of Mr. Carmody's apartment prompted criticism of what free-press advocates have characterized as a trampling of First Amendment rights and a California shield law that protects journalists. Several dozen news organizations, including The New York Times Company and Dow Jones & Company, have filed a friend-of-the-court letter in support of Mr. Carmody.
Mayor London Breed, after initially supporting the police, shifted her position over the weekend. "The more we learn," she said of the raid, "the less appropriate it looks to me." George Gascón, the city's district attorney, has been less equivocal is his public criticism of the search.

Is art dead, or is Jeff Koons' Rabbit really worth $91 million?

Texto completo: A stainless steel bunny just became the most expensive work by a living artist — at the price of $91 million.
So what makes Jeff Koons’ Rabbit so special?
Tweet
The piece sold at auction last week for $91.1 million with fees, which may not have been a surprise to some followers of Koons. The artist is famous for his pop culture subjects, including balloon animals such as Rabbit. He also holds the record for the third most expensive work by a living artist, for his $58.4 million balloon dog.
Christie Koons RabbitKoons' style, with its reimagining of the mundane, has been compared to that of Marcel Duchamp. But not every art critic is buying it.
In fact, it’s popular in the art world to critique the sculptor and painter, especially for his terrible '90s phase, which included pornographic artwork he created of himself and his wife at the time. Former chief art critic for the New York Times Michael Kimmelman wrote a scathing review of the artist in 1991.
“Mr. Koons delivers an unabashedly cynical message,” Kimmelman said. “His works continue to celebrate the emptiness, meaninglessness and Disneylike unreality of contemporary life, now extended to the arena of love. But the hollowness the artist reveals seems fundamentally his own.”
Of Koons’ work, Rabbit may be his best. The 1986 sculpture, designed to look like a balloon animal, embodies the excess of the '80s; it’s over-the-top, glitzy, even tacky, but still aspirational. But is it worth $91 million? To someone, it is.
Robert Mnuchin (that’s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s father) delivered the winning bid on Rabbit, but he hasn’t revealed on whose behalf he was bidding. Artnet reported Tuesday that the work’s mystery buyer was hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, who presumably has a large, semi-empty living room somewhere, just waiting for a centerpiece to spice up his next dinner party.
As a symbol of American excess, Koons’ Rabbit becomes somehow more poetic through its $91 million purchase. If beauty is relative, and if the value of art is relative, then so is its price. The most important thing to remember about the extravagantly priced Rabbit is that the money doesn’t mean it’s good. It just makes it a billionaire's conversation piece.

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr. is the newest member of the first family to land a book deal, joining father Donald, mother Ivana and sister Ivanka.
Center Street Books announced Wednesday that it would publish an as-yet-untitled book by the president's eldest son later this year.
Center Street, which is part of Hachette Book Group, has also published books by Fox News personalities Jeanine Pirro and Gretchen Carlson.
In a statement to the Associated Press, Trump Jr. , who frequently introduces the president at his political rallies, said his upcoming book would highlight “the great achievements” of his father's administration. He said he would also write about his father's supporters and critics.
Speaking of those critics, they didn't hesitate to offer up title ideas for Trump Jr. 's as-yet-unnamed book.
One in particular got the future author's attention.
"The Brat In The Hat," tweeted @indianaoldsoul, complete with a photo of Trump Jr. in a Make America Great Again hat. The president's son retweeted the title, adding, "Ok, that's actually pretty funny. Bonus points for the photoshop work" and a laughing crying emoji.
Other Twitter users focused their attention on politics.
"Twelve Years a Slave to Russian Banks," suggested @Undershafted, in a reference to a 2008 remark by Trump Jr. in which he said "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section" of the Trump Organization's assets.
"Unfortunate Son," proposed Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant and author of "Everything Trump Touches Dies. "
"‘I Love It!’: The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Collusion," offered @NotARaja, a callback to Trump Jr. 's email communications with publicist Rob Goldstone, who helped facilitate the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who had offered dirt on Hillary Clinton.
@cassandra17lina came up with "The Spy Who Duped Me" – "with a special introduction by #NataliaVeselnitskaya. "
Not all of the titles were references to Russians.
@sylviatx came up with "Gone With the Wind: How Dad Lost All of Grandpa's Money. " A May 5 New York Times story analyzed nearly a decade's worth of tax documents and concluded that Trump Sr. had lost over $1 billion between 1985 and 1994.
@Joys_Desk submitted several title ideas, including "Children of a Lesser Man" and "I Know Why the Caged Bird Was Trophy-Hunted," a reference to Trump Jr. 's big-game-hunting hobby.
Not surprisingly, lots of the title pitches focused on nepotism and genetics.
From @farbiez came the Dr. Seuss-inspired "Hop on Pop's Coattails - Thoughts from a Loser. "
"The Fault In Our Genes," suggested @daveabrown, playing off the popular John Green book, "The Fault in Our Stars. "
"The Son Never Rises," offered @grandmalaurie, riffing on the Ernest Hemingway classic, "The Sun Also Rises. "
@cptfunkadunk also went with a literary reference, pitching, "The Not Even Remotely Decent Gatsby. "
Even Trump Jr. 's siblings were enjoying watching the title ideas come in.
Half-sister Tiffany could only manage a crying-from-laughter emoji: "��"
Ivanka wrote, "When #DonJrBookTitles is trending on Twitter. . . @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @TiffanyATrump @kimguilfoyle and I are having some fun with this one!"
Sadly, the Trump siblings and their significant others didn't share any of their own ideas for what to call the book.
But Don Jr. was quick to remind Ivanka that turnabout is fair play.
"Apparently I'm due for some little sister revenge. . . just remember @IvankaTrump he (or she) who laughs last, laughs longest. I guess it's time to write an Ivanka childhood stories chapter, lots of great material. "
Whether or not Don Jr. 's book contains an Ivanka chapter, The Daily Caller is excited.
"If Twitter is any indication, this should be good," the conservative news site said.

Texto completo: Wanda Sykes is ready to make audiences laugh again with her new Netflix stand-up special, "Not Normal," now streaming. She's reflecting on some of her memorable and humorous life moments, including when she tried to ignore former first lady Michelle Obama at the White House Correspondents' Dinner way back in 2009.
"I still kick myself about it," she told the New York Times as part of a lengthy Q-and-A to promote the Netflix special. "When I did the dinner, I was sitting pretty much right next to Michelle Obama. She kept trying to make conversation, but I was so focused on having to go up and perform that I was blowing her off. I think I even looked at her one time like: 'Will you shut up? Don’t you see I’m sitting here going over my notes?' "
Luckily for Sykes, Obama had a sense of humor about the awkwardness.
"I saw her on her book tour, and we laughed about it. She was like, 'I was just trying to make conversation, and you wanted nothing to do with me. ' "
During the chat with the Times, Sykes, 55, also explained how she first got into comedy, when she was in her 30s, working in Washington, D. C. , as a procurement specialist for the National Security Agency.

"I just remembered everyone telling me I should do stand-up. I’m looking through my high school yearbook, looking through my college yearbook, and it’s all blackface," she quipped, "no, it was all people saying, 'You should be onstage. ' Even at work, at the N. S. A. , my co-workers were like: 'You need to be onstage. You are so funny. ' "
The star also touched on her departure from the "Roseanne" reboot after star Roseanne Barr issued a racist tweet. (Sykes was a consulting producer for the ill-fated sitcom that eventually became "The Conners" after Barr was let go. )
She explained that she noticed early-on that Barr's tweets were a concern and told her producing partner, "We’ve got to get Roseanne off of Twitter. She’s going to kill us. ”
When Barr tweeted a racist message about former President Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, Sykes said she was quick to contact the producers of "Roseanne" and explain she needed to disconnect from the show and its star. Sykes posted about her departure on Twitter shortly after news of Barr's tweet made waves.
She recalled thinking, " 'I’ve got to get ahead of this. I can’t just be silent. ' That’s why I said I wouldn’t be going back. "

THE BIG STORY YOU DON'T READ ABOUT JOURNALISTS FOCUS TOO MUCH ON PROBLEMS AND NOT ENOUGH ON PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING SOLUTIONS

Texto completo: My colleague David Bornstein points out that a lot of American journalism is based on a mistaken theory of change. That theory is: The world will get better when we show where things have gone wrong. A lot of what we do in our business is expose error, cover problems and identify conflict. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="35735">
The problem with this is that we leave people feeling disempowered and depressed. People who consume a lot of media of this sort sink into this toxic vortex - alienated from people they don't know, fearful about the future. They are less mobilized to take action, not more.
Mr. Bornstein, who co-founded the Solutions Journalism Network, says that you've got to expose problems, but you've also got to describe how the problems are being tackled. The search for solutions is more exciting than the problems themselves.
But many of our colleagues don't define local social repair and community-building as news. It seems too goody-goody, too "worthy," too sincere. It won't attract eyeballs.
That's wrong.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="35740">
I've spent the past year around people who weave social fabric, and last week about 275 community weavers gathered in Washington for a conference called #WeaveThePeople, organized by the Weave project I've been working on at the Aspen Institute.
The people gathered were some of the most compelling people I've ever met. Charles Perry was incarcerated for nearly two decades and now connects community members to health care systems in Chicago. Dylan Tête was an Army Ranger who served in Iraq, suffered PTSD and has built communities in New Orleans for vets. Sarah Adkins came home one Sunday to find that her husband had killed their kids and himself, and she now runs a free pharmacy and leads a life of service in Athens, Ohio.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="35743">
Pancho Argüelles works in Texas, accompanying workers who have suffered spinal cord injuries on the job. He helps find diapers, wheelchairs and other things that will allow them to live with dignity. Pancho radiates a deep wisdom. As he and the others spoke about their values, the same thought kept pounding in my head: How is this not a story?
At most conferences, people lead with their bios, but at this gathering people led with their pain.
A prominent researcher described how she was abused as a child and how this led her into her research into children's emotional development. A woman from South Carolina talked about loved ones she had lost and the time she tried to talk a man out of jumping off a bridge, finally confessing: If you jump, I'm going to jump, too. A man admitted that all the people he had loved had left him, and that he had lived with the trauma believing that his wife will leave him, too.
It was emotionally gripping through and through. The weavers know how to open relationships with vulnerability and they know how to build connections and move to action. Their defining feature is that they are geniuses at relationships.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="35748">
This was a gathering in which it was permissible to be an angry black person. Some of the African American participants fully ventilated their anger at injustice. It was uncomfortable and searing, but the discomfort broke through barriers and moved us closer.
Martha Welch, a professor and researcher at Columbia, pointed out that our emotional health is dependent on connection with others. We don't just regulate emotions ourselves. We co-regulate with others and need connection with others to keep from spinning out of control.
The weavers are acutely sensitive to states of mind that can build or mar relationships: how people can feel more or less efficacy, depending on the emotional conditions in a room; how words like "social justice" and "biblical" can be good or bad depending on whom you are speaking with; and how much damage is done when people demand you use words their way, instead of asking: Well, what do you mean by that word?
Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out that associational life is the central feature of American life. But somehow we in the media under-cover this sector. We barely cover the most important social change agents. These people are not goody-goody. They are raw, honest and sometimes rude.

Texto completo: Thousands of Syrian government documents recovered amid the country's civil war provide a paper trail showing widespread and systematic human rights violations by its powerful security agencies, according to a Syrian-led organization that analyzed the papers, the Syria Justice and Accountability Center.
In a report released Tuesday, the center said the documents reveal the government's own record of practices long described by numerous ordinary Syrians, including sweeping arrests for nonviolent dissent, the detention of women and children, the imprisonment of relatives of wanted people, the ordering of military attacks without apparent regard for the danger to civilians, and the harassment of the Kurdish minority.
The documents bolster reporting by The New York Times and others on the sprawling network of torture prisons where at least 14,000 people have died and nearly 128,000 remain imprisoned or unaccounted for. They provide an additional glimpse of the broad array of offenses for which the Syrian security agencies made arrests, such as attending a protest (or simply being rumored to be planning to attend one), spitting near a statue of the former president, or making a critical remark at a dinner party.
While such practices are familiar to many Syrians, the center's executive director, Mohammad Al Abdallah, called the report the first broad, public analysis of official government documents that "expose clear patterns of widespread, systematic human rights violations" and show that "security agencies operate above the law."
The Washington-based center, known as S.J.A.C., analyzed a sample of 5,003 documents drawn from about 483,000 papers retrieved from Syria during the civil war, now in its ninth year. The files were collected from government offices that were taken by rebels or abandoned during the fighting. Some were gathered by S.J.A.C., and most by another group, the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, or C.I.J.A., which has cataloged 800,000 government documents that it hopes will be used in future war-crimes prosecutions.
Additional government documents in C.I.J.A.'s possession show that top officials reporting directly to President Bashar al-Assad ordered crackdowns and knew of widespread deaths in detention. The documents made public by S.J.A.C. are just a portion of C.I.J.A.'s documents showing similar practices, and S.J.A.C.'s analysis is broadly in line with C.I.J.A.'s findings in legal briefs that have been viewed by The Times.
The documents could aid any future efforts toward accountability for war crimes, a truth and reconciliation process, or reform of Syria's security agencies, said Mr. Al Abdallah, whose father was imprisoned for more than seven months for political activities before the 2011 uprising.
But any such prosecution, reconciliation or reform process is likely to come years in the future -- if ever -- since Mr. al-Assad, with the military help of his allies Russia and Iran, has remained in power and appears to be intensifying the system of repression that helped keep him there.
Even people who have remained in government-controlled areas and signed so-called reconciliation agreements with the authorities, promising not to engage in anti-government activities, continue to be arrested, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Tuesday. It documented 11 cases of what it termed "arbitrary detention and disappearance" of people who had signed the agreements last year in areas retaken by the government from rebels, among hundreds of other arrests.
The thousands of documents analyzed by S.J.A.C. were collected from all across Syria. They came from its four main intelligence agencies, as well as other security bodies. Around 214 of the documents, S.J.A.C. said, amounted to "confessions" to human rights violations or war crimes.
Among the documents reproduced in the report were records of detained teenagers; orders to dilute populations of minority Kurds through property confiscation, population transfer and other measures; and an order to ban a French-Lebanese journalist whose writing was considered "offensive" and to surveil her phone.
There was also a warning that civilian cars could be used for attacks, with an order for forces to "engage any suspicious target with immediate destruction," but without any description of what constituted a "suspicious" vehicle or any instructions to avoid harm to civilians.
Other documents described in the report painted a broad picture of disregard for civilian safety and well-being -- something that has been well documented in the war but now appears to be detailed in the government's own files.
Arrests into a violent, crammed, filthy prison system were often made solely on the basis of vague tips, the documents showed. Children were killed in demonstrations, or arrested for speaking against the president. There were frequent orders to "do the necessary" to deal with protesters, which defectors have called a code for permission to use lethal force.
One man, under surveillance for speaking to foreign journalists, was shot in the stomach during a security raid and arrested in stable condition, according to the S.J.A.C. report. He was taken to a military hospital -- known to be a torture site -- and died a week later with bruises on his body.
Then there was the case of an education official in the contested province of Idlib, who warned the government that its bombing and shelling of rebel-held areas were damaging schools, where civilians often sheltered. As a result of his warning, the files suggest, he became a target of surveillance. The bombings in Idlib have continued.

Texto completo: The Trump administration will hire conservative firebrand and former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II to coordinate immigration policy at the Department of Homeland Security, three administration officials said Tuesday.
Cuccinelli will work at DHS in a senior role and will report to acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan, while also providing regular briefings to President Trump at the White House, according two officials briefed on the appointment.
The hiring is the latest DHS leadership shuffle by the White House, which is desperate to contain a record-breaking influx of Central American families that has pushed border crossings to the highest level in a dozen years. Frustrated with his administration's inability to stem the crisis, Trump has sacked top Homeland Security officials and demanded a "tougher" response.
Cuccinelli, who has been hawkish on immigration policy during television appearances that also praise Trump, appears to fulfill the president's desire to have a forceful personality and a loyalist at the highest levels of DHS. But his arrival risks new instability at the agency, coming six weeks after Trump ousted Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and replaced her with McAleenan, a long-serving official who was confirmed by the Senate last year as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and who is one of the few administration figures who retains a favorable reputation with lawmakers from both parties.
Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank whose immigration-reduction agenda has had significant influence in the White House, called Cuccinelli "an unusual choice."
"He doesn't have any immigration experience, but he does have law enforcement experience," said Krikorian, who said he was "cautiously optimistic" that the appointment would make a difference. The crucial factor, he predicted, would be access to the White House.
"If he does not answer directly to the president, he's not likely to be able to get much done," he said.
Before leaving DHS, Nielsen had advocated for the designation of a policy coordinator at the White House who would streamline communications and planning among the various federal agencies responding to the situation at the border, including the Departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security.
The official said Nielsen wanted the coordinator to work out of the White House, not at DHS. "There is no one coordinating policy across the government," the official said. "You have 10 people coordinating it."
The White House offered the job to Cuccinelli after it was turned down by Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to two officials. Trump also soured weeks ago on Kris Kobach, the Kansas Republican favored by immigration restrictionist groups, according to one senior administration official.
Cuccinelli will do the job from DHS, filling a role that would otherwise be McAleenan's, which sets up potential conflicts.
"It is bad news for [McAleenan]," said one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide candid views. "You have someone at the agency that the White House might have in mind to be the next DHS secretary."
Another former department official predicted Cuccinelli's lack of authority at the agency and distance from the White House would leave him in a weak position from the outset.
"Putting an immigration czar at DHS is a total waste," the person said.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about Cuccinelli's role. Cuccinelli, who was at the White House on Monday, could not be reached for comment. His expected hiring was first reported by the New York Times.
If the White House is grooming him as a possible replacement for McAleenan, he would face a difficult path to confirmation.
Cuccinelli is deeply disliked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has vowed to block Cuccinelli from any Senate-confirmed post for leading efforts in 2014 backing insurgent candidates that hurt the Senate GOP majority, McConnell advisers said.
Two years ago, Cuccinelli signed a letter drafted by GOP activists calling on McConnell to step down.
When Cuccinelli's name surfaced last month as a potential Nielsen replacement, McConnell told reporters he'd conveyed his unease to the White House. "I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them . . . Ken Cuccinelli," McConnell said.
The Virginia conservative, who has a long record of combative television appearances, is even less popular with Democrats. "This is absurd and outrageous," Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) wrote on Twitter. "He doesn't deserve a taxpayer-funded salary."
Others more supportive of the move noted that the DHS secretary's role is challenging enough when there isn't a migration crisis - and with hurricane season approaching, McAleenan could benefit from a strong personality fully devoted to the border.
In April, more than 100,000 migrants were taken into custody along the U.S.-Mexico border for the second consecutive month, and the numbers in May are on pace to go even higher. McAleenan warned in late March that U.S. agents and infrastructure at the border had hit a "breaking point," and since then the situation has worsened, leaving holding cells so overcrowded that DHS officials have been transferring migrants out of South Texas by aircraft simply to make room for ever-growing numbers of new arrivals.
Cuccinelli has been a vocal advocate for Trump's proposed border wall and other measures popular with hard-liners. He has backed constitutional changes to restrict birthright citizenship, urged lawsuits against employers who hire undocumented immigrants and at one point supported denying immigrant workers - including those in the country lawfully - from collecting unemployment benefits if they are fired for not speaking English on the job.
His appointment to DHS has others in the administration worried there will be too many players fighting to establish control over an immigration agenda, with White House adviser Stephen Miller chafing officials at DHS.
One White House adviser said Cuccinelli would advocate for the White House's aggressive position at the agency. Miller has argued to Trump that others within DHS are trying to stall him.
McAleenan last week pushed back at an attempt by Miller to have Trump's pick to lead ICE installed at CBP instead. In a tense White House meeting Thursday, McAleenan said he needed control over DHS to remain in his job, administration officials said.
The animus between Cuccinelli and Senate Republicans stems from his leadership of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which organized anti-incumbent efforts, and from his role at the 2016 Republican convention, when he derided "petty, tyrannical rules" and threw his ID badge on the floor in protest of Trump's nomination. He was a strong supporter of the presidential bid by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has become one of Trump's most ardent defenders.
Another senior administration official who welcomed the appointment said there was an acute need for someone to be an immigration policy field marshal.
"The president's frustration is not directed at DHS alone," the official said. "It's DOJ, DOD, State. So this job will ensure closer coordination at a senior level, and it's an effort to acknowledge you need someone who can have conversations with department heads about policies and drive them to the same place."
But the official also acknowledged that Cuccinelli's appointment risked undercutting McAleenan at a time when the acting secretary has been making inroads with lawmakers, including Democrats who see him as a neutral law enforcement official rather than a White House political operative.
"I don't see how this appointment makes things better on the Hill," the official said.

Texto completo: Sports columnist John Feinstein spent some time on the road after Virginia won the Final Four.
The author of 35 books, including the New York Times bestseller "Season on the Brink," prefers driving to flying. I enjoyed a nearly 30-minute phone call during which he made me laugh often, but I elicited exactly one chuckle from him: when I told him he had given me three columns' worth of material. I also told Feinstein I am devoted to his wonderful Washington Post work, while still missing him on ESPN's now defunct "The Sports Reporters."
"I can honestly say I don't miss much of television," he said. "Television, to me, was always more of a headache than it was worth, but I loved doing 'Sports Reporters.' It was a lot of fun."
This is Part 1 of our interview.
Q: Is "Quarterback" your latest nonfiction book?
A: It's cleverly enough about playing quarterback in the NFL. My most recent book is fiction, "The Prodigy," which is set at the Masters about a 17-year-old kid.
Q: Your youngest child is an 8-year-old who expects face time with Dad. Between her, your broadcasting schedule and columns, when do you have time to write books?
A: The good part about writing books is that when you finish your research -- I just finished researching a college basketball book, for example -- you get to be home for a few months, most of the time. When I am at home, I work at home, so I can take her to school. I'm there when she gets home. My wife teaches at the same school so [I] get big stretches of time with her.
But you're right. Right now she's quite annoyed with me because I've been away so much this past month. [After the Masters] I'm going to meet her and my wife in Orlando and we are going to spend a week there doing Disney, Universal Studios and stuff like that. Hopefully that makes up for some of it.
Q: Do you parent the third one different from the two kids from your first marriage?
A: Yes, because I'm older. Because I've experienced being a father now for the third time. Because I appreciate it more. I'm not going to say it came as a surprise because when I remarried you hope that we'd get pregnant. But it was a surprise in that, who knew I'd be a father again? It's just been tremendous fun. I'm lucky because she's got an amazing personality and is just a lot of fun.
Q: When kids get to be 13 or 14, you know, they don't want to be seen in public with the parents.
A: You're 100% right. I've had it happen twice already. The good news is that my son is now 25, has come through that stretch and decided he likes me again. I see my oldest daughter, who is 21, kind of going in that direction. She's not there yet.
I remember vividly when my son was in high school, I drove him to school one morning. I would drop him off and then go work out. So I was in my sweats and had to go into the school office to sign some paperwork, and we are walking toward the door, and he says to me: "What are you doing?" And I said, "I have to go sign this paperwork." And he said, "No, no, no. You can't walk into school with me. If a good-looking girl comes around the corner and sees me with you, I'm dead. You have to wait."
He was completely serious. You know the Mark Twain line about how much smarter parents become between the ages of 18 and 22? It's true, and I'm sure it will happen with Jane.
Q: You're a rich man. Why don't you have a driver?
A: Well, first of all, my ex-wife is rich, not me. As I said to a cop in Mississippi when he asked why I wasn't retired yet: "I have a wife, I have an ex-wife and three children. So I'm not retiring anytime soon."
But the flip side, I prefer to drive myself. I like the solitude. I enjoy it. I listen to Books on Tape all the time; it allows me to keep up with my reading. I do phone calls like this. I do radio shows, things like that. That helps the time pass. I just don't like to fly unless I absolutely have to, and while this is as long a trip as I'll make in a day, I don't really mind it that much. I wish I'd had more than five hours sleep last night.
Q: You'll pull over if you feel sleepy?
A: Absolutely. My first step if I start to feel tired is that I pull over and get a cup of coffee. If that doesn't revive me, then I'll pull over and close my eyes for 10 or 15 minutes. That almost always works.
Q: Do you think your travel schedule had a negative impact on your first marriage?
A: Oh, there's no question. It's not a coincidence that a lot of people who are in sports -- coaches, athletes, sportswriters -- get divorced. It's hard on marriages, on the spouse. We had two kids who needed a lot of my time and attention, and I did everything that I could to be there, but I know at times it was difficult for my wife.
It's difficult for my wife now. I think the biggest difference, to be honest, is my first wife, Mary, stopped working when we had children, and I think smart people need something in their lives besides their children, no matter who they are. My current wife, Christine, is a teacher, and I think that keeps her occupied and a lot happier when I'm away. She misses me; I hope she misses me. I know Jane, my daughter, misses me, and I miss them like hell. But, as I have often said, I have not reached the point yet where the athletes will come to my house. So I have to go to them.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump's Iran policy appears to be careening between diplomacy and belligerence. One day Trump tweets, "I'm sure that Iran will want to talk soon." The next he warns that "if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran." Confused? Well, there is a method to the madness.
The Trump administration understands that Iran doesn't want war because Iran knows it will lose. That's why Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear via a government Twitter account "no war is to happen."
Trump's goal is not to start a war. His administration has three objectives: First, restore deterrence and contain Iran's expansionism across the Middle East. Second, roll back Iran's gains and force it back within its borders. And third, give Iran's leaders a clear choice: They can come to the negotiating table and give up their nuclear and missile ambitions — or their regime can implode, just like the Soviet Union.
When Trump came into office, Iran was on the march across the Middle East — in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen — thanks in part to the massive infusions of cash it received from sanctions relief under President Barack Obama's Iran deal. Trump did not simply restore sanctions imposed before the deal; he ramped them up to unprecedented levels. The sanctions have already "wiped $10 billion from Iranian revenue since November," The Washington Post reported, citing administration officials.
This month, the administration tightened the screws even further, eliminating waivers for eight countries that had previously been allowed to continue importing Iranian oil. The goal, according to American officials, is to reduce Iranian oil exports to "zero." It's working. Bloomberg News reports that "Iran's oil shipments tumbled this month after the U.S. ended sanctions waivers. ... So far, not a single ship has been seen leaving Iran's oil terminals for foreign ports."
The new sanctions are forcing Tehran to cut funds to its terrorist proxies. According to The Post, "Iran's ability to finance allies such as Hezbollah has been curtailed," while in Lebanon, The New York Times reports, "Syrian militiamen paid by Iran have seen their salaries slashed." On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that "Iran's proposed defense budget has been reduced by 25 percent and the (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps') proposed budget by about 10 percent."
Iran is obviously unhappy with this, and U.S. intelligence saw signs that Iran was preparing to respond with attacks on Americans using terrorist proxies — just as it did in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and by supplying Shiite militias in Iraq with armor-penetrating roadside bombs that killed hundreds of American soldiers.
So the Trump administration delivered a clear message that America will hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, even if they are carried out by surrogates — and offered a show of force to back those threats — providing clarity that makes it less likely Iranian leaders will miscalculate.
Sanctions are inflicting major pain. But if the goal is to roll back Iran's expansionism, then sanctions alone are not enough. We must also aggressively confront Iran throughout the region, building up our allies inflicting defeats on Iran in critical theaters, just as President Ronald Reagan did to the Soviets. A major drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria is incompatible with a "maximum pressure" approach.
Will Iranian leaders come to the table? Far less draconian sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table under Obama. But Trump has rightly paired tougher sanctions with tougher demands. Pompeo has laid out 12 requirements for a deal with Iran — including an end to support for Middle East terrorist groups and a complete withdrawal from Syria — that Iran is unlikely to meet.
If if doesn't come to the table, then what is our strategy? Does Trump really want to bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime? It's not clear. If he does, then, as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Frederick W. Kagan points out, this task may be even harder than it was with the Soviet Union. As North Korea has shown, tyrannical regimes can survive even crippling sanctions. Certainly, the world will be better if Iran is focused on survival rather than expansion and terror. But it will take more than sanctions to leave the Iranian regime on the ash heap of history. That requires a strategy.

Texto completo: Michael Cohen, the former longtime personal attorney for President Trump, told a House panel during closed-door hearings earlier this year that he had been instructed by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow to falsely claim in a 2017 statement to Congress that negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow ended in January 2016, according to people familiar with his testimony.
In fact, Cohen later said discussions on the Moscow tower continued into June of the presidential election year, after it was clear that Trump would be the GOP nominee. Cohen is serving three years in prison for lying to Congress, financial crimes, and campaign finance violations.
House Democrats are now scrutinizing whether Sekulow or other Trump attorneys played a role in shaping Cohen's 2017 testimony to Congress. Cohen has said he made the false statement to help hide the fact that Trump had potentially hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in a possible Russian project while he was running for president.
"We're trying to find out whether anyone participated in the false testimony that Cohen gave to this committee," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in an interview. He did not comment on who, if anyone, might have instructed Cohen to lie.
Jane Serene Raskin and Patrick Strawbridge, attorneys for Sekulow, said in a statement that "Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong.' "
"That this or any Committee would rely on the word of Michael Cohen for any purpose — much less to try and pierce the attorney-client privilege and discover confidential communications of four respected lawyers — defies logic, well-established law and common sense," they added.
Cohen's assertions about Sekulow are laid out in transcripts of his February and March appearances before the House intelligence panel that could be released as soon as Monday evening.

Would-be Trump aide seeks jet, cabinet post, and more
Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November.
Those were among a list of 10 conditions that Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, has given to the White House if he is to become the administration's “immigration czar," a job President Trump has been looking to create to coordinate immigration policy across government agencies. The list was described by three people familiar with it.
Mr. Kobach, who once served as an adviser to the hard-line immigration Sheriff Joe Arpaio and helped write an Arizona law requiring local officials to verify the citizenship of anyone they had “reasonable suspicion" to believe was an unauthorized immigrant, said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be.
The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, “walk in" privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president.
He would need access to the jet, he said, for weekly visits to the border and travel back to Kansas on the weekends. The existence of the list has become known among officials in the Trump administration, some of whom were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the list. Mr. Kobach did not respond to e-mails and text messages seeking comment.
Mr. Kobach, a graduate of Harvard, Oxford, and Yale Law School, served as Kansas's secretary of state from 2011 until January.

Officials: DeVos personal e-mail use for work 'limited'
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has sometimes used her personal e-mail accounts for government business and has not always properly saved the messages, according to an internal investigation released Monday.
The agency's Office of Inspector General, which was investigating at the request of House Democrats, said it searched the department's e-mail system and found a "limited" number of messages to or from DeVos's personal accounts. In total, it said there were "fewer than 100" e-mails linked to four personal accounts.
Most of the e-mails were from the first six months of 2017, soon after DeVos took office, and most were from a single person, the inquiry found. The person, who was not identified in the report, was writing to recommend candidates for agency jobs. Other e-mails were from people who congratulated DeVos on her confirmation or offered other job advice.
In total, investigators said they identified six e-mails sent by DeVos on private accounts, including five that involved official agency business. The inquiry concluded that there was no evidence of "active or extensive" use of DeVos's personal accounts.
The secretary's office told investigators it was taking "additional steps to identify and preserve" e-mails in her personal accounts. A department spokeswoman declined to comment for this story.
Under department rules, employees are forbidden from using personal e-mails for government business except in rare circumstances when their work accounts are unavailable. In those cases, employees are required to forward the messages to their work accounts within 20 days. But in DeVos's case, the report said, that never happened.
During his 2016 campaign, President Trump repeatedly attacked Democratic rival Hillary Clinton over findings that she used a private e-mail server for work while she was secretary of state. Associated Press
Trump wants inquiry into Biden family, China ties
President Trump on Sunday night called for an investigation into financial ties between China and the family of Joe Biden, the former vice president and current front-runner in a crowded Democratic field of presidential hopefuls, and the candidate Trump's advisers believe could pose the biggest potential threat to his re-election in 2020.
“One hundred percent — it's a disgrace," Trump said in an interview with Steve Hilton, a Fox News host, when asked whether the Biden family's supposed financial ties with China should be investigated. “And then he says China's not a competitor of ours," he added. “China is a massive competitor of ours. They want to take over the world."
The accusation of financial ties was made by the conservative author Peter Schweizer, who claimed that Biden's younger son, Hunter, made millions from the Chinese government at a time when his father was negotiating with Chinese officials over government issues. Schweizer was also the author of “Clinton Cash," which looked at donations to the Clinton Foundation made by foreign entities, and was bankrolled in part by the family of Robert Mercer, the wealthy conservative donor.
The Bidens have denied the charge.
It was not the first time that Trump has threatened investigations of his political enemies, raising questions from his critics about whether he is abusing his position as president. Some of those threats were revealed by the special counsel's report. Others, Trump has made in public.
His favorite target — dating to the 2016 campaign — has been Hillary Clinton, whose name generated chants of “lock her up" at Trump rallies. In 2017, the president asked Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, to order the prosecution of Clinton, according to the special counsel's report.

The Tales of Parson Comey; Apparently the former FBI chief can see into other men's souls.

Texto completo: When in 1800 Parson Weems published "A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington," this and later editions would become the source of treasured chestnuts such as the tale of the 6-year old George killing his father's cherry tree or the older Gen. Washington kneeling in the snow to pray at Valley Forge.
With its saccharine moralizing and portrait of larger-than-life integrity, it isn't unlike today's tales about former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey. Except that the glowing picture of Parson Comey as a paragon of virtue is a self-portrait.
Like the itinerant preachers who once brought the Gospel to the vast American countryside, Parson Comey periodically rides the circuit. In his case, this means appearing on CNN, penning an op-ed for the New York Times, or posting his pensées on Twitter, where he preaches the moral turpitude of anyone who may question, say, using a dossier he himself characterized as "salacious and unverified" to get a warrant to spy on an innocent American. But as with Parson Weems before him, Parson Comey's tales aren't holding up under the light.
Parson Weems, for example, gave us Washington telling his father, "I cannot tell a lie . . . I did cut it with my hatchet." In the Parson Comey version, the then-FBI director tells the president "I don't leak, I don't do weasel moves"—only later to leak to the Times FBI memos detailing private conversations with the president. To avoid leaving his fingerprints, Mr. I Cannot Tell a Lie leaked via a law-professor friend.
Or what about the parson's tall tale about the FBI agents who'd interviewed national security adviser Michael Flynn at the White House? When Bret Baier of Fox News asked him if he'd told Congress that the two agents who'd interviewed Mr. Flynn "didn't believe [he] was lying intentionally," he insisted he hadn't said it.
But when the House Intelligence Committee got the redaction lifted from their report on Russia, there it was on page 54: Parson Comey testifying that the FBI agents saw "nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them."
We now know too that Parson Comey briefed Mr. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, about the Steele dossier. Yet though this exemplar of truth and transparency told the president-elect about the accusations involving Russian prostitutes, he withheld information that the FBI had used the unverified dossier to get a warrant on a former member of Team Trump because it believed the campaign was conspiring with Russians to steal the election. This week former FBI counsel James Baker said in a Yahoo News podcast that he worried that when Director Comey was assuring Mr. Trump he wasn't the subject of an investigation, it wasn't quite true.
Alas, the parson hasn't stopped trading on his former job to advance unsupported insinuations. When CNN's Anderson Cooper recently brought up the Russian prostitutes again and asked if it is possible the Russians have leverage over President Trump, he replied, "Yes."
In wake of the exhaustive FBI/Mueller investigation, the honest answer would be: "It's possible. But the FBI relies on evidence. And in more than two years of investigations, no one's found any."
For the past few years the auto-hagiography of Parson Comey has been uncritically received because it has been thought useful to the anti-Trump cause. In its review of his book, for example, the Times indulged in a riot of Weemsian excess: "nonpartisan and well-intentioned"; "boy-scout polite"; "fierce, go-it-alone independence"; "straight-arrow bureaucrat"; "apostle of order and the rule of law"; and so on.
Yet now there's a new team in the parsonage, and they are taking an objective look at what happened at the FBI during the Comey years. The question is whether the mistakes were simply a result of sloppiness and overzealousness or a deliberate abuse of power.
This may explain why Parson Comey has of late been casting more first stones than usual. In recent days he's informed former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that President Trump has "eaten" his soul, sermonized that Attorney General William Barr lacks the character needed to run "an organization based on truth," and assured America that the president had "corrupt intent" when he asked the White House counsel to sack Robert Mueller. Apparently the former FBI director's abilities include not only upholding the law and fighting off foreign foes but seeing into other men's souls.
Yet, say this for Jim Comey: The parson knows his congregation. And he feeds it from Mount Self-Righteous, with a mix of Democratic talking points, proclamations about the wickedness of anyone with a different point of view, and the occasional lofty quotation from Reinhold Niebuhr. Ralph Waldo Emerson never met Parson Comey, but plainly he was well-acquainted with the type: "The louder he spoke of his honor," Emerson wrote, "the faster we counted our spoons."

Rihanna talks race, size in fashion: If I can’t wear my own stuff, that’s not gonna work'

Texto completo: Possibly the busiest woman in the music and fashion worlds, Rihanna gave a rare interview to The New York Times' Magazine, in which she updated fans on her new music and talked about her groundbreaking new line for LVMH.
The majority of the interview focused on Rihanna's new line for LVMH – short for Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury conglomerate that owns and operates Dior, Celine and other fashion houses – which, upon its debut, will make the 31-year-old Barbados native the first black woman to run a major luxury fashion brand.
The new Fenty line, which launches with a pop-up in Paris on May 24 and becomes available on Fenty's website on May 29, will release new products via innovative monthly drops, in which several new items at a time will be available exclusively online.
When asked whether her superstar status made it easier to be a black woman in fashion, an industry dominated by white men, Rih forcefully shut down the idea that her success has come from tokenism.
"It’s never alleviated, you know? You’re going to be black wherever you go. And I don’t know if it’s unfortunate or fortunate, because I love being black. So, sorry for those who don’t like it – that’s the first thing you see before you even hear my voice," she said "There are also other factors: I’m young. I’m new to the family. I’m a woman. Those factors do come into play, but I will not apologize for them, and I will not back down from being a woman, from being black, from having an opinion. I’m running a company and that’s exactly what I came here to do. "
She emphasized, "I do know that the reason I’m here is not because I’m black. It’s because of what I have to offer. That’s what they’re invested in. And the fact that I’m black is just that: a fact. "
Rih also addressed how her body has changed over the years and revealed her new line will be sized roughly up to a U. S. size 14, with Harris jokingly calling her fluctuating size her "thicc" journey. "
"It just changed how I dress in terms of my proportions," she said about her body's changing proportions. "You wear what looks good on you, and that’s it. "
She reasoned, "I’m thick and curvy right now, and so if I can’t wear my own stuff then, I mean, that’s not gonna work, right? And my size is not the biggest size. It’s actually closer to the smallest size we have: We go up to a (U. S. size 14). We’re saying we can meet you at any one drop that we put out. "
Her interviewer, playwright/actor Jeremy O. Harris, also peppered the singer/actress/mogul with questions that her Navy fanbase has , about her new music.
Rih confirmed that she is making a reggae album, but disputed the rumors that she is collaborating with Lady Gaga and Drake. As for the Gaga project, she said, "It isn't in the books right now, but I’m not against it. "
She was less enthusiastic about working with rumored ex-boyfriend Drake. Any such collaboration is not happening "anytime soon," she said, adding, "I don’t see it happening. Not on this album, that’s for sure. "

Texto completo: Billionaire's grant will wipe out Morehouse class's student debt
ATLANTA -- A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College -- an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year's commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus," Smith told the graduates. "This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans."
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college.
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school.
The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans -- 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept.

Report: Trump, Kushner bank transactions raised red flag
NEW YORK -- Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" about the transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals.

Report: Navy submariners kept list rating female crew, sex acts
Sailors aboard a U.S. Navy submarine circulated sexually explicit lists that ranked female crew members, an investigation found. The lists, first reported Friday by Military.com, were uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The 74-page investigative report reveals two lists -- one with Yelp-like star ratings on the women and another containing "lewd and sexist comments" beside each woman's name, according to Military.com.
In February 2018, the USS Florida became the second to integrate female members. The misconduct came to light four months later, when two sailors aboard the Florida brought the lists to a superior officer, reporting that they were stored on an internal computer network and updated regularly, Military.com reported.

In oil-rich Venezuela, mile-long lines to buy gas in major city
MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- U.S. sanctions on oil-rich Venezuela appear to be taking hold, resulting in mile-long lines for fuel in the South American nation's second-largest city, Maracaibo.
Some drivers said they'd had to wait almost 24 hours to fuel up, and people have been grabbing catnaps on the hoods of cars or in truck beds.
Nearing empty and stuck in line, infectious diseases doctor Yoli Urdaneta said she couldn't make her shift to treat patients.
"I've spent four days trying to get gasoline," Urdaneta said. "But I couldn't."
Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets, said Sunday that stiff U.S. sanctions on top of Venezuela's decaying refineries has begun to hit home.

11 people reportedly killed in bar attack in Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Gunmen roared up to a bar in Belem city in Brazil's northern Pará state and opened fire, killing six women and five men Sunday afternoon, media reports said.
A state spokeswoman would confirm only "a massacre" occurred but gave no details.
The G1 news website said police reported that seven gunmen were involved in the attack, which also wounded one person. The news outlet said the attackers arrived at the bar on a motorcycle and in three cars.
In late March, the federal government sent National Guard troops to Belem to reinforce security for 90 days.
State communications officials stopped answering phone calls. Military and civil police in Pará state also did not answer phone calls or respond to emails.

Plane crash in Honduras kills 4 Americans, 1 Canadian
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- Four Americans and a Canadian pilot were killed when a small plane went down off the coast of Roatan island in Honduras, officials said Sunday.
Armed Forces spokesman Jose Domingo Meza confirmed the nationalities of those who died in Saturday's crash.
The Piper Cherokee Six plummeted into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from the popular tourist destination of Roatan en route to the port of Trujillo. The military said in a statement that rescue boats with police divers and firefighters recovered four bodies within minutes of the crash, and transported another to a hospital, where he later died.
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the deaths of four U.S. citizens. They did not release names.

In Indiana: An explosion leveled a home in southern Indiana early Sunday, killing one person, injuring two others and leaving several nearby homes uninhabitable, authorities said.
Hours after the explosion shattered windows across a Jeffersonville neighborhood and sent debris flying onto roofs, lawns and cars, officials had not said what they believe caused the explosion.
Indiana State Police, Jeffersonville police and firefighters were at the scene, along with crews from Vectren, a natural gas provider.
Jeffersonville police Lt. Isaac Parker told The Courier-Journal that the house exploded just before 5 a.m. Sunday in the Ohio River city.

Texto completo: Celebrity chef David Burke doesn't have any requisite chef tattoos. Nor does he have a fashion-must beard. He doesn't even have a crisp $150 apron. What the "newly 57"- year-old Fort Lee resident does have is skill, talent and lots of experience. He is putting it to use to build a small empire of restaurants, primarily in New Jersey.
His latest — Ventanas at The Modern — is in his adopted hometown Fort Lee.
The chef who made food Insta-friendly before Instagram existed (seen his bacon hanging on a miniature clothesline?), the chef who won a handful of James Beard awards (including Best Chef New York — twice), the chef who received the coveted Meilleurs Ouvriers de France Diplôme d'Honneur (the only American chef to do so) along with many awards and accolades, does not want to keep crossing the George Washington Bridge to perform his culinary magic.
"At my age, I don't need to fly all over the world," said Burke, the father of three. "I'm a Jersey guy." Burke was born in Brooklyn but raised in Hazlet.
And New Jersey is as good a place as any to open and run innovative, inspired restaurants, he believes.
"There are a lot of good restaurants in New Jersey. New Jersey diners are willing to pay the money almost as much as New York diners. No one is using expense accounts anymore."
Burke has partnered with New Jerseyan Alex Duran to open Ventanas (the two are hoping to work together on another North Jersey restaurant in the coming year). He has taken over the kitchen at the 140-year-old Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, (it has been renamed David Burke at Orange Lawn). And he launched Drifthouse by David Burke in Sea Bright, where his younger brother Robert is the chef.
Burke still heads two restaurants in NYC, two in Saratoga Springs, NY, two in Garden City, NY, and one in DC, the steakhouse BLT Prime. This one caused a minor brouhaha when it opened in the Trump hotel in DC after celebrity chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of the space due to Trump's controversial remarks about Mexicans.
"It's business," Burke said. "I'm not going to discuss what I think of Trump."
He'd much rather talk about food and the restaurant business, a business he's been in for more than 30 years, managing to dazzle critics, diners and bosses alike.
Michael "Buzzy" O'Keefe, owner of The River Cafe, is among them. At The River Cafe — The New York Times titled an article about the cafe "The Restaurant That Launched a Thousand Chefs" — Burke succeeded American culinary titans Larry Forgione and Charlie Palmer.
"[Burke] was the most creative chef of them all," O'Keefe said. "And the other chefs know it, too. He's a big talent — and a nice guy beside."
Burke's ideas are fun, whimsical and ingenious. Among them: swordfish chop, a swordfish steak with its collar bone sticking out ("I was cutting a small fish and saw the collar bone and thought, 'Little fish, little collar bone, big fish, big collar bone'"); lobster steak ("Men in Armani suits don't want to wear bibs to eat lobster, so I took all the lobster meat out and shaped it into a steak"); and lobster dumpling "(I used a small piece of the lobster claw as a handle for the dumpling").
And of course, his clothesline bacon, thick-cut candied bacon hang from a miniature clothesline secured by wooden clothespin. "Bacon is fatty, you want the fat to drip," he said, adding: "It horrified vegetarians."
He's been in the restaurant business since age 15, when he landed a job as a dishwasher at the Sheraton Hotel in Hazlet — "My nickname was 'chef de la plunge,' slang for dishwasher" — and worked his way up.
When he told his dad, a retired subway engineer, he wanted to be a chef, dad wasn't pleased. "I know you smoke pot," Burke recalled his dad saying, "I didn't know you smoked that much."
His dad, today 84 and with whom he's close, signed him up for cooking classes at the local Williams Sonoma because, Burke said, "he thought I'd hate it."
He thought wrong. "It was great," Burke said. The instructors included legends-in-the-making Paula Wolfert and Marcella Hazan.
In 1979, then 17, he worked as a cook in the kitchen of the Navesink Country Club and went to school only in the mornings. His dad, furious, made him pay rent.He graduated high school in 1980 and two years later, graduated No. 2 in his class from the prestigious Culinary Institute of Art.
He went on to work as a private chef in Norway, traveled through Europe, then returned to the U.S. to work for legendary chef Waldy Malouf at renowned French restaurant La Crémaillière in Banksville, NY. Burke was 20.
After two years, he joined heralded French chef Daniel Boulud at Daniel in Manhattan and eventually Charlie Palmer hired him as his No. 2 at The River Cafe, known not only for great food but for its glorious Hudson River views. Two years later Palmer left to open Aureole and Burke became executive chef.
He was a sensation. "Every day was something else," O'Keefe said. One day it was a chocolate cake in the shape of the Brooklyn Bridge, still the restaurant's No. 1 bestselling dessert. (At Ventanas, he offers one in the shape of the GWB.)
"I wanted the food to take diners' eyes away from their lover's eyes and the river," he said.
In the years that followed, he opened ark Avenue Cafe, davidburke & donatella, Fishtail by David Burke, The Fromagerie in Rumson, David Burke's Primehouse in Chicago, Prime in Las Vegas. Those restaurants are closed now. Today, as he put it, "I'm a brand."
The brand however is still in the kitchen. "I'm not just a coach. I'm a cook too."

A giant yellow umbrella in Lincoln Park

Texto completo: Chicago author Amy Krouse Rosenthal invited a bunch of strangers to meet her at "The Bean" in Millennium Park at 8:08 p.m. on Aug. 8, 2008.
The strangers would make something together. The strangers would recognize Rosenthal, she told them at the end of a three-minute video called, "17 things I made," because she'd be holding a yellow umbrella.
"Come join me as we gather to make a cool 18th thing together," she said.
They joined her by the hundreds that night. In under an hour, they made things: A grand entrance. A friend. Someone's day. It's all captured in a seven-minute follow-up video, "The Beckoning of Lovely," which inspired a 45-minute movie, "The Beckoning of Lovely Story: From Start to Finish-ish."
Rosenthal, you may know by now, died in March 2017 from ovarian cancer. She was 51.
She wrote more than 40 books -- children's books ("Little Pea," "I Wish You More" and "Duck! Rabbit!" among others) and memoirs, including "Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life," which was named a top 10 memoir of the decade by Amazon. She was a prolific speaker, frequently appearing on NPR and in Ted Talks.
She was married to Jason Rosenthal, with whom she had three children. Maybe you read her gorgeous, gut-wrenching essay in The New York Times, "You May Want to Marry My Husband," published 10 days before she died.
"I want more time with Jason," she wrote. "I want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet."
On Sunday, a new piece of public art will be unveiled in Lincoln Park's Grandmother's Garden, near the intersection of Fullerton Avenue and Stockton Drive, in celebration of Rosenthal's life. It was commissioned by her husband. It will be a yellow glass umbrella.
"The yellow umbrella has become her legacy or her symbol," Jason Rosenthal told me Monday. "It's something that's been associated with her and her message and her work. Right away, in one form or another, I knew that's exactly what I wanted to do."
He worked with Chicago artist Susan Giles and Space Haus, a Chicago-based design and production studio to bring the umbrella to fruition. He raised private dollars. He got the blessings of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago Park District and a committee overseeing public art installations in the parks.
It took awhile.
When it's unveiled Sunday, Rosenthal said, the umbrella will stand 9 or 10 feet tall.
"It's big enough to be used by people to gather, reflect, read, take a selfie, whatever they want to do," he said.
The Rosenthal children, now 22, 24 and 26, went to school near the site where the umbrella will live, and the family spent many days playing and strolling in Lincoln Park.
"The park was pretty much our stomping grounds," Jason Rosenthal said.
Amy has been gone a little more than two years now. Jason hears from people whose lives she touched daily.
"She was so giving with her time and her resources and she meant so much to people," he said. "Her spirit was infectious. So many people continue to remind me how bright she shined."
He still receives letters and emails from all over the world about her New York Times essay.
"Not just about Amy, but about things that people have gone through in the wide category of loss," he said. "But it all comes from her talking and writing publicly about what she went through."
After she passed away, Jason Rosenthal founded the Amy Krouse Rosenthal Foundation to raise money and awareness around two causes: early detection and treatment for ovarian cancer and childhood literacy.
Another thing she's helped make: Progress.
Jason Rosenthal answered his wife's New York Times essay with an essay of his own, "My Wife Said You May Want to Marry Me," published in June 2018.
"I want more time with Amy," he wrote. "I want more time picnicking and listening to music at Millennium Park. I want more Shabbat dinners with the five of us Rosies (as we Rosenthals are referred to by our family)."
And this:
"One thing I have come to understand, though, is what a gift Amy gave me by emphasizing that I had a long life to fill with joy, happiness and love. Her edict to fill my own empty space with a new story has given me permission to make the most out of my remaining time on this planet."
Maybe a giant yellow umbrella can be a nudge for each of us to do the same.

Violence in Sudan derails power-sharing deal

Texto completo: CAIRO - Power-sharing talks in Sudan between the ruling military junta and the leaders of a powerful protest movement collapsed Wednesday after violent clashes erupted in the capital, Khartoum, for the second time this week.
The leader of the ruling Military Transitional Council, Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a televised address that the talks, which only hours earlier appeared to be going well, would be suspended for 72 hours. He laid down several conditions for a resumption of negotiations.
The announcement came hours after security officials opened fire on protesters, apparently in an attempt to clear checkpoints from the city center, wounding at least nine people and leading to recriminations on both sides.
The events marked another turbulent day in the political crisis that has enveloped Sudan since last month's ouster of President Omar al-Bashir.
Early Wednesday, military and civilian leaders had held a joint news conference to announce an apparent breakthrough: After weeks of tense talks, they had agreed on a three-year transition to democratic rule. Sitting together, representatives from both sides said they expected to sign a final deal within 24 hours. But they admitted that an important point remained unresolved: the composition of the ruling body that will wield ultimate power until elections are held.
Thousands of protesters demanding an immediate transition to civilian rule have been camped at the gates of the military headquarters since al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for 30 years, was toppled on April 11.
The first violence occurred Monday when members of the security forces fired tear gas and live rounds at protesters, killing at least four people and wounding dozens. The United States squarely blamed the military for the violence.
The deaths were "clearly the result of the Transitional Military Council trying to impose its will on the protesters by attempting to remove roadblocks," the U.S. Embassy said in a statement on its Facebook page.
The violence suggested perilous divisions in the ranks of Sudan's security forces, which devolved into a fractious mix of regular and paramilitary forces under al-Bashir, and it appeared to give fresh momentum to the power-sharing talks that culminated in the news conference early Wednesday.

Huston has a key role in the Keanu Reeves action movie, which premiered in Hollywood on Wednesday. She's been talking about her past while promoting the movie, making pointed jabs about Robert De Niro's acting choices and a new Diane Keaton movie in the process.
"You know we all live life, and at a certain point you have to claim your life. You know, I could apologize for a lot of things. But you know, all in all I've tried not to hurt people. Once in a while, I think maybe I'm a little politically incorrect - but that's part of who I am," Huston said.
The 67-year-old actress also commented on the size of her ex Jack Nicholson's genitalia during an interview earlier in the week. She says she's happy to keep speaking her mind - but doesn't want to be seen as a role model for younger actresses.
"Oh God, no. I don't want to be an example to anyone who, you know, who doesn't know their own mind yet," she said. "I've always known what I liked and what I didn't like and where I wanted to be. And so far, that served me pretty well."

Big-bucks bunny: A stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit by Jeff Koons has set an auction record in New York, fetching over $91 million. The sale of Koons' 1986 "Rabbit" at Christie's was the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction. The previous record was set by British artist David Hockney. His 1972 "Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)" brought in $90.3 million at Christie's last year. The New York Times says Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was the winning bidder for "Rabbit."
Shakira cleared: A Spanish court has cleared Colombian singers Shakira and Carlos Vives of a plagiarism claim after rejecting a lawsuit brought against them by a Cuban-born singer and producer. Livan Rafael Castellanos had accused Shakira and Vives of plagiarizing his 1997 song "Yo te quiero tanto" in their award-winning hit "La Bicicleta."

Texto completo: I was talking to an acquaintance recently about Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.
He liked the Massachusetts Democrat’s detailed policies and was impressed with her recent CNN town hall presentation.
But he couldn’t back the senator because she doesn’t really stand a chance in the 2020 contest. Why not, I asked.
He answered me with a rueful shrug, accompanied by one word: “Pocahontas.”
That, of course, is the nickname President Donald Trump has tagged Warren with — a reference to her having claimed American Indian ancestry, including on law school faculty forms in the 1980s. (She does have some such ancestry, but not very much, a DNA test revealed; Warren says she was merely repeating family lore.)
This episode was certainly not Warren’s finest hour — but hardly something that should be disqualifying, especially when compared to the horror show of deceit that is Trump himself.
But the nickname has stuck. And some people can’t get beyond it — any more than they can get beyond “Crooked Hillary” or the multitude of other slams from “Crazy Bernie” for the Vermont senator to “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz of Texas. Or, for that matter, the “Failing New York Times” — which, of course, it isn’t.
Trump has a kind of dark intuitive genius for these coinages, something he’s been plying for decades. (Back in the 1980s, Trump-the-developer referred to then-state assemblyman Jerry Nadler, now House Judiciary chairman, as “Fat Jerry” or “Waddler.”)
“Consciously or not, Trump is feeding us nuggets packed with enormous linguistic power,” Jon Allsop wrote in 2017 in Columbia Journalism Review.
“They appeal to a childlike desire to make an easily digestible morality tale of a complicated world.”
They are often false and always meant to bully. And the news media must stop trafficking in them.
Journalists may not be able to ignore these nicknames altogether, but they should stop doing Trump’s dirty work for him: amplifying their power through prominent placement and frequent, unquestioning repetition.
When Trump recently tagged Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., with the nickname “Alfred E. Neuman” — an effort to make the Rhodes scholar and Afghanistan war veteran into a buffoon — the news media responded as it often does to Trumpian distractions: with a full round of breathless, clickable coverage.
Some of media attention focused on the presidential candidate’s response — that Buttigieg had to research the name of the Mad Magazine cover boy. That was followed by Mad Magazine’s riposte that they had to look up who Buttigieg was. And on it went.
All told, it was all less harmful, probably, than Trump’s recently coined name for former Vice President Joe Biden — “SleepyCreepy Joe.” The worse the perceived political threat, perhaps, the more vicious the nickname.
The media, though, largely treats these labels as entertainment, wrote Allsop more recently — “not the subtle, dangerous manipulation of political discourse they actually represent.”
And while Trump’s legion of critics see his risible hair and puffed-up ego as fodder for taunts (like “Cheeto Jesus,” in author Rick Wilson’s phrase), the news media rarely stoop to repeating them.
It’s high time to recognize what’s going on here, and to do something about it.
I often hear from readers and from anti-Trump voters that news organizations should ignore Trump’s tweets, or give him far less attention. In other words, they should cut off his oxygen supply of attention.
I can’t agree. What the president of the United States says, even in a tweet, amounts to an official statement. We need to cover them, and him, rigorously and thoroughly.
But just as we’ve learned to fact-check Trump — and call out his lies when appropriate — we need to learn to stop amplifying these poisonous nicknames.
Cover them as part of a story? Examine and analyze them? Sure.
But don’t constantly repeat them, don’t treat them as “all in good fun.”
And don’t give them prominence without context.
Never again should one of these nicknames appear in the following ways: In a headline. In a media organization’s tweet. In a bottom-of-the-screen TV chyron. In a news alert.
It’s in those minimalist settings that they do the most harm.
Trump, of course, has his own powerful megaphones on social media and in his rallies and speeches.
And, granted, politics is a rough-and-tumble business, not known for its emphasis on civility and decency. The knives are always out.
But when the news media turn on their brightest spotlights, these nicknames take on greater credibility and power. As propaganda always does, they sink into our consciousness as something that feels like a kind of truth.
That makes journalists complicit in Trump’s insidious ways. His jokes were never funny, and shouldn’t be treated as if they are.

Texto completo: By any measure of a presidency, how our president leaves the books is certainly a fair assessment of his success or failure. Our president's tax cut leaves our country borrowing $2.75 billion a day. This is during relatively good times with regard to the U.S. economy. You could argue that this kind of borrowing could fund quite a party. In past generations, Republicans were somewhat concerned about deficit spending. Not any more. A day of reckoning is coming for Social Security and Medicare, though there seems to be no real desire by our president, Deficit Donald Trump, to drive forward the necessary changes to safeguard these programs for working people. His inaction will actually result in the long-sought Republican desire to destroy these social programs -- accomplished by doing nothing at all. Let the good times roll.
You are posing columnist Ross Douthat as balancing the scale to the right. Well, maybe in New York City, with The New York Times, that is true with the help of one's thumb. In "Questions need answering still about anti-Trump probe" (Opinion, May 7), he meekly attempts to determine if any U.S. government agency attempted to entrap anyone in the Trump presidential campaign, and if the Steele dossier is a valid document. Enough information has come out to conclude the U.S. government did try to infiltrate and entrap Trump folks. Steele himself has testified his dossier was derived from third-party sources, including internet searches, and was absolutely unverified. Gossip at best. Mr. Barr's investigations, combined with the Mr. Horowitz's investigation, should help Mr. Douthat reach a firmer and more absolute conclusion about federal government agencies' intrusion into a presidential campaign and presidency.

Texto completo: Intelligence collected by the U.S. government shows Iran's leaders believe the U.S. planned to attack them, prompting preparation by Tehran for possible counterstrikes, according to one interpretation of the information, people familiar with the matter said.
That view of the intelligence could help explain why Iranian forces and their allies took action that was seen as threatening to U.S. forces in Iraq and elsewhere, prompting a U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf region and a drawdown of U.S. diplomats in Iraq .
Meanwhile, administration officials said President Trump told aides including his acting defense chief that he didn't want a military conflict with Iran, a development indicating tensions in the U.S.-Iran standoff may be easing.
However, there are sharply differing views within the Trump administration over the meaning of intelligence showing Iran and its proxies making military preparations, people familiar with the matter said.
Intelligence officials on Thursday briefed House and Senate leaders, along with the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate intelligence committees, on the Iran situation.
Some within the Trump administration argue that the intelligence indicates Iran is, or was, planning to strike first. On a trip to Baghdad last week , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an Iran hawk, said there were indications Iran was planning imminent attacks.
"I am convinced that the information and warnings that we have collected are of greater concern than the normal Iranian harassment activity that we've seen in the Persian Gulf and surrounding area," Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas) said on Thursday. "So I don't think it's business as usual. It's cause for greater concern."
Iran repeatedly has denied it has plans to attack U.S. forces, calling the information cited by Mr. Pompeo and others "fake intelligence."
One U.S. official said the view of Iran's movements and actions as defensive in nature came from new intelligence in recent days. This unspecified intelligence has affected how American officials see Iran's actions, the official said.
"I don't think there's faulty intel here necessarily. I think the intel may be accurate," Sen. Angus King (I., Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Thursday after he was briefed on some of the intelligence. "But the unanswered question, again, is: Are they reacting to our assertions of action in the Middle East or are we reacting to them? That's an unanswered question for me."
These assessments of the intelligence information were separate from Mr. Trump's comments to top aides including acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan that he doesn't want tensions between the U.S. and Iran to lead to war.
During a meeting on Wednesday at the White House, Mr. Trump made the comments to Mr. Shanahan as part of a conversation, the officials said, adding that Mr. Trump didn't issue a specific order.
The New York Times had earlier reported on those comments.
Mr. Trump in recent days has also told advisers that he is reluctant to start any kind of unilateral conflict with Iran, one administration official said.
Instead, he has expressed his interest in a negotiated solution, even if that means speaking to the Iranians directly, this person said, a move that would be counter to the recommendation of some top advisers.

Last week, Mr. Trump suggested Iran's leaders also consider talks.
"What I'd like to see with Iran, I'd like to see them call me," he said in remarks at the White House then. Iranian officials have said they don't see a reason to hold talks with Mr. Trump, who has pulled out of an international nuclear agreement with Iran and reimposed punitive economic sanctions.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump again steered around talk of a confrontation. Asked at the White House if the U.S. would have a war with Iran, he replied: "I hope not."
The comments came amid other signs that tensions between the U.S. and Iran may be easing after the U.S. over the preceding days undertook a series of military deployments in response to what officials described as intelligence showing increased Iranian threats.
On Thursday, two U.S. military destroyers, the USS McFaul and the USS Gonzalez, transited without incident through the Strait of Hormuz near Iran, officials said.
"It was the quietest transit we have seen in a long time," a defense official said. U.S. military vessels traveling through the area often encounter challenges from aggressive Iranian fast boats and other vessels, even though there rarely have been armed confrontations.
The Pentagon said the recent U.S. military deployments, consisting of an aircraft carrier, U.S. bombers and other ships and personnel, may have helped quell hostilities.
"The deterrence part of this is going pretty well from our perspective," the defense official said, citing the "effects we have seen."
The deployments, sought by military officials, were intended to deter any prospect of Iranian hostility, not as an offensive threat, military officials stressed.
"This is a case where credible intelligence drove measured, appropriate operations," a senior defense official said.
Mr. Trump on Thursday also met with President Ueli Maurer of Switzerland, holding talks that included a discussion of the crisis in the Middle East, the White House said. In Iran, Switzerland serves as a protecting power on behalf of the U.S. It also serves as a channel for diplomatic communication between the U.S. and Iran, since official diplomatic relations ceased between Washington and Tehran in 1979.
"President Trump expressed his gratitude for Switzerland's role in facilitating international mediation and diplomatic relations on behalf of the U.S.," the White House said.

Iran says Trump playing 'very dangerous game,' risking 'devastating war'

Texto completo: LONDON – The United States is playing a "very dangerous game" as it attempts to "drag Iran into an unnecessary war," a senior Iranian official said Tuesday.
Hamid Baeidinejad, Iran’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, said the Trump administration made a "serious miscalculation" in deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers and other military personnel and equipment to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged, unspecified Iranian threats.
Baeidinejad denied that Iran or its "proxies" were behind what Washington described as the "sabotage" of oil tankers in the Gulf belonging to Saudi Arabia, Norway and the United Arab Emirates. Tuesday, Saudi Arabia said drones attacked one of its oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure, an incident that caused global oil price benchmarks to jump.
"We are prepared for any eventuality, this I can tell you," Baeidinejad said. The United States and Iran have no formal diplomatic channel of communication.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said neither country wants a war.

"This is not a military confrontation because no war is to happen," he said, according to Iran's state television and a government Twitter account. "We don’t seek a war nor do they. They know a war wouldn’t be beneficial for them. "
Baeidinejad said that from the Iranian perspective, it appears that some of President Donald Trump's closest advisers, such as national security adviser John Bolton, are "trying to convince" Trump to start a military confrontation that neither country wants and would be "devastating" for Iran, the United States and the region.
'They're not going to be happy': Trump threatens Iran over reports of 'sabotage'
Acting U. S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a military plan at a meeting of top national security officials that would send as many as 120,000 U. S. troops to the Middle East in the event Iran strikes U. S. forces in the region or speeds up its development of nuclear weapons, according to a report published in The New York Times on Monday. The plan was partly ordered by Bolton, the report said. It does not call for a land invasion of Iran.
Trump dismissed the report but said he would send U. S. troops if needed.
Since last week, the Trump administration has insisted it has "specific and credible" intelligence indicating Iran or its regional supporters may be preparing attacks against American forces or targets in the region. "It's going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens," Trump said Monday outside the White House.
The details of that intelligence remain murky; some seasoned Iran experts fear the Trump administration's focus on possible threats from Iran are being driven by hawks looking for a pretext for military conflict.
"We should remind ourselves that this is a TOTALLY UNNECESSARY CRISIS!" Trita Parsi, a professor at Georgetown University and an Iran specialist, wrote on Twitter.
Last year, Trump withdrew from a landmark deal reached between Iran and world powers in 2015 under which Iran promised to curtail its nuclear program in return for relief from crippling sanctions. President Barack Obama viewed the accord as one his signature foreign policy accomplishments. Trump campaigned on abolishing it.
"We're only here cuz Trump quit the deal and put Bolton in charge of Iran policy," Parsi tweeted.
On Wednesday, the U. S. put its military on high alert in neighboring Iraq amid what it said were "imminent threats to US. forces" in the nation. Iran aids a number of Shia militant groups in Iraq, in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen – who are at war with close U. S. ally Saudi Arabia – and elsewhere across the Middle East region.
The U. S. Embassy in Iraq ordered all non-essential, non-emergency government staff to leave the country right away amid escalating tensions with Iran.
But the threats have drawn skepticism from U. S. allies.
British Army Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, a deputy commander with the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition, said Tuesday during a video briefing from Iraq that "there’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria," a statement that was subsequently disputed by the Pentagon.
Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief, called Monday for "maximum restraint" from the U. S. after meeting with U. S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels on Monday.
"This is politics, and this is about Bolton and others who have had a bee in their bonnet about Iran for as long as they have been in politics," said Robert Muggah, a specialist in international security and co-founder of the SecDev Group, an Ottawa, Canada-headquartered consultancy that analyzes open source intelligence.
Trump has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on Iran, slapping the Middle Eastern country with a series of increasingly onerous sanctions that crippled its economy, led to runaway inflation and caused food and medicine shortages. Last week, Tehran announced that it was abandoning two of its obligations under the nuclear deal: exporting excess uranium and "heavy water" used in nuclear reactors. The Trump administration characterized the move as an attempt by Iran to hold the United States "hostage" through "nuclear blackmail. "
But Iran's partial breach of the accord was a direct response to the United States ending exemptions from nations that purchase these stockpiles. In other words: Iran took that step to comply with U. S. sanctions.
"The (nuclear deal) is becoming meaningless because of the U. S. ," Baeidinejad said, noting that Iran gave the three Western European signatories to the deal – the United Kingdom, Germany and France – 60 days to "salvage" it.
Otherwise, he said, "there will be consequences from our side" that could include suspending modernization of Iran's Arak nuclear facility. Modernization of the "heavy water" plant ensures it will produce less plutonium, which is needed for a nuclear bomb. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog verified 14 times that Iran was complying with the terms of the agreement – even after the United States withdrew last May.
Baeidinejad wouldn't say whether Iran would consider Trump's possible offer to hold talks with Tehran. "I'd like to see them call me," Trump said last week.
Tuesday, Pompeo, who was in Moscow where he met with his Russian counterpart, reiterated that the United States doesn't seek a war with Iran.
That's not how the U. S. military moves looked to some in Iran.
"You wanted a better deal with Iran. Looks like you are going to get a war instead," Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on Twitter.
Ashena also found room for a moment of levity on the social media platform.
"That’s what happens when you listen to the mustache," he added in the tweet, referring to Bolton, who has bushy white whiskers.

Texto completo: The TV industry is unveiling its coming season to advertisers in Manhattan this week at a series of events known as the upfronts. Three New York Times media reporters -- John Koblin, Michael M. Grynbaum and Edmund Lee -- assess the Fox presentation at the Beacon Theater on Monday . Fox was the second of the four major broadcast networks to hype its fall wares.
JOHN It was the worst day on Wall Street in four months, the coldest May afternoon in New York in nine years. Who's ready for a Fox party! And not just any Fox upfront -- new Fox. The Fox that's a slimmer, scrappier version of the old Fox. I think the network's new entertainment chief executive, Charlie Collier, described Fox as a "start-up" at least a half a dozen times?
EDMUND This was a more intimate, off-the-cuff affair than NBC's glitzy presentation earlier today. It felt closer to Fox's early days, when Rupert Murdoch took on the big three. Speaking of which, Rupert was in the audience, orchestra center -- a rare public sighting. I happened to bump into him on the way out of the theater. He looked his usual self, in sneakers and a blazer, with a bodyguard in tow.
MICHAEL Did the bodyguard give you guff?
EDMUND He gave me a look, which was enough.
[The scrappier Fox broadcast network will thrive, says its new entertainment president, Charlie Collier.]
JOHN Was Rupert the one screaming for "90210"? Yes, there's a "Beverly Hills: 90210" reboot coming this summer. (Hopefully with better luck than CBS's just-canceled revival of "Murphy Brown.") The announcement struck a nerve with the Gen X advertiser crowd, who let loose the loudest ovation we've heard in some time when Jennie Garth, Gabrielle Carteris, Ian Ziering and company took the stage. Shannen Doherty did not show. Keeping on brand.
[Video: Preview: They're Back! | BH90210 Watch on YouTube.]
EDMUND Sports was big, no surprise. It's the costliest part of Fox's lineup and draws the most viewers, so it's an easy pitch. Terry Bradshaw, the N.F.L. mainstay, was in rare form, ad-libbing about his appearance on another Fox series, "The Masked Singer." Apparently, it's a game show that involves costumes and singing?
JOHN Yes, that's it, with the hippo, the poodle and the rabbit masks. It's also tied for first place with "This Is Us" and "The Big Bang Theory" for top-rated entertainment shows.
MICHAEL In an unfortunate moment, Bradshaw lamented that he was kicked off "The Masked Singer" by -- his words -- "Alan Thicke and the little short guy from Japan." Alan Thicke ... is dead. Bradshaw was thinking of his son Robin Thicke.
EDMUND And the "short guy from Japan" was likely the comedian Ken Jeong, who is Korean-American.
JOHN The sports portion of these proceedings are always a source of embarrassment to the entertainment folks. And because Fox no longer has a TV studio -- that now belongs to the Walt Disney Company -- it is very excited to do business with other studios like Warner Bros. And television's most prolific producer, Greg Berlanti!
EDMUND It's a gritty drama lineup. "Prodigal Son," Berlanti's show about a serial killer and his son, looked dark. "Deputy," a modern-day cop drama in the vein of an old Western, came across a little too serious for its own good, but it does star Stephen Dorff, who was outstanding in the latest season of HBO's "True Detective."
[Video: PRODIGAL SON | Official Trailer | FOX Watch on YouTube.]
MICHAEL "Not Just Me" stars Timothy Hutton as the Bernie Madoff of fertility: a fraudulent doctor who "solves" his patients' fertility problems by replacing the fathers' sperm with his own. Then it unravels, and his daughter meets a bunch of half-siblings she didn't know she had. I mean, who among us?
[Video: NOT JUST ME | Official Trailer | FOX Watch on YouTube.]
EDMUND The one I couldn't quite get was "neXt," about an out-of-control A.I. program that takes the form of a disembodied Alexa-like home speaker. You can bet Amazon won't be advertising there anytime soon.
MICHAEL I have to admit to a weakness for the "evil-robot-takes-its-sweet-revenge" genre. "NeXt" stars John Slattery, who is never not charming. He is also pals with Collier from the days when they were at AMC.
[Video: neXt | Official Trailer | FOX Watch on YouTube.]
JOHN They had nice chemistry on stage. It was much better than the awkward exchange between Collier and Justin Timberlake (who is producing a game show on Fox), who "jokingly" suggested that Collier should be fired for missing a cue.
MICHAEL I was waiting for Timberlake to lambaste Rupert from the stage, but it didn't happen. As for "neXt," I like that the Alexa-like evil robot -- "Iliza," har har -- has a sinister HAL thing going on. I assume my own Alexa resents a lot of my banal requests for weather updates and would not hesitate to wreak havoc on my life.
JOHN Michael, you burst into laughter in the middle of the evil Alexa trailer (I did, too), and a few advertisers gave us the stink eye.
MICHAEL Maybe they were Amazon execs?
JOHN Fox executives were highest on a soapy Southern drama, "Filthy Rich," starring the "Sex and the City" alum Kim Cattrall, and "Bless the Harts," an animated show with voice work from Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph. We also had our second Amy Poehler sighting of the day -- she jogged over from the NBC event to promote another Fox animated show.
[Video: FILTHY RICH | Official Trailer | FOX Watch on YouTube.]
EDMUND Can we discuss the rain? I overheard several advertisers deciding to bail on the after-party in Central Park. We almost did, too.
JOHN It was harder than usual to get a read on the room, and whether Fox's new campaign -- advertiser-friendly, outside-producer-friendly -- was viewed as a triumph. Everyone was so angry about the rain. And the frigid and soaked trek to Central Park.
EDMUND But the tents at Wollman Rink were waterproof. Collier looked like a Hollywood pro, holding court as people lined up to pay their respects.
JOHN For his first network rodeo, the career cable man definitely seemed in his element.

Scrutiny of F.B.I. Actions Is Said to Be a Review, Not a Criminal Inquiry

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The federal prosecutor tapped to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation is conducting only a review for now and has not opened any criminal inquiry, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The prosecutor, John H. Durham, the United States attorney for Connecticut, is broadly examining the government's collection of intelligence involving the Trump campaign's interactions with Russians, the person said. The additional details about the scope and limits of his role emerged a day after The New York Times reported that Attorney General William P. Barr had put Mr. Durham in charge of scrutinizing the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation during the 2016 election.
While Mr. Durham has conducted criminal investigations into allegations of high-level wrongdoing by law enforcement and national security officials, including the F.B.I.'s handling of organized crime informants and the C.I.A.'s torture of detainees, his new review does not rise to that level, the person said.
The distinction means that Mr. Durham for now will not wield the sort of law enforcement powers that come with an open criminal investigation, such as the ability to subpoena documents and compel witnesses to testify. Instead, he will have the authority only to read documents the government has already gathered and to request voluntary witness interviews.
That distinction could have political consequences. Earlier on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters he would "pull back" a proposed inquiry by his committee into what Mr. Trump's allies have portrayed as surveillance abuse because he did not want to get in the way of a criminal investigation by Mr. Durham.
But later on Tuesday, told by a Times reporter that Mr. Durham was for now conducting only a review, Mr. Graham said, "That is completely different." He said he wanted the inquiry to be run by a prosecutor with the same power as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who scrutinized Trump-Russia links.
Mr. Graham said he was likely to wait for the completion of a review by the department's independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, which is expected within weeks, to see whether it generated a criminal referral. "If there is not a criminal investigation, then oversight will be different" by his committee, he said.
But the fact that Mr. Durham is conducting only a limited review, not a criminal investigation, also suggests the Justice Department has still not identified sufficient facts to open such an inquiry. The legal standard is whether facts exist that reasonably indicate that a specific crime has been committed.
As part of the F.B.I.'s original Russia investigation, known as Crossfire Hurricane, agents used informants and at least one government investigator to attempt to determine whether Trump campaign associates were in contact with Russia.
The F.B.I. also obtained a wiretap order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court targeting Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. Its application partly relied upon unverified information about Trump ties to Russia generated by an investigator who was indirectly paid by Democrats.
The review is also likely to entangle the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, who was the agency's London station chief at a seminal moment in the F.B.I.'s investigation. In late July 2016, the Australian government told the United States Embassy in London that George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, had told an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton in the form of stolen emails before WikiLeaks published them. It remains unclear if Ms. Haspel was aware at the time of the information the Australians had provided to the United States.
That information partly formed the basis for opening the Russia investigation. F.B.I. agents traveled the following month to London to interview the diplomat and then mounted an operation targeting Mr. Papadopoulos and several other Trump campaign aides with personal ties to Russia. The following spring, Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel to take over the investigation after Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director.
Mr. Durham's assignment is to review all intelligence collection activities related to the Trump campaign, the person said.
Mr. Barr, who asked Mr. Durham to oversee that review several weeks ago, is also taking a personal role in it, the person said. He has been discussing it with Ms. Haspel; Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director; and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence.
When the FISA wiretap targeting Mr. Page came to light and Mr. Trump's allies portrayed it as an abuse of power, the Justice Department -- under Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general -- referred the matter to Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general, for a review.
Mr. Rosenstein also asked John W. Huber, an Obama administration holdover whom Mr. Trump had reappointed as the United States attorney for Utah, to look at the FISA issues, along with several other politically charged matters. But it is not clear that Mr. Huber has done much on the issue yet, possibly waiting for Mr. Horowitz to complete his review first. Mr. Durham will now take over the FISA review assignment from Mr. Huber as part of his broader review, the person said.
Mr. Barr has signaled his concerns about the Russia investigation during congressional testimony, portraying the surveillance of Trump associates as "spying" and saying he wanted to make sure it was legal, though he also said he was not suggesting he had any basis for saying the inquiry was not lawfully predicated.
His use of the term "spying" to describe court-authorized surveillance aimed at understanding Russian outreach to the Trump campaign touched off criticism that he was echoing insinuations by Mr. Trump and his allies that the F.B.I. was unfairly spying on his campaign for political purposes.
In congressional testimony last week, Mr. Wray defended the bureau, saying he was unaware of any illegal surveillance, and refused to call agents' work "spying."
The attorney general, he said, "is trying to get a better understanding of the circumstances at the department and the F.B.I. surrounding the initiation of this particular investigation. He and I have been in fairly close contact about it, and we're trying to work together to help him get the understanding that he needs on that subject. I think that's appropriate."
In a speech in Baltimore late on Monday, Mr. Rosenstein, who stepped down as deputy attorney general last week, defended his decision to appoint Mr. Mueller to continue the investigation of people linked to the Trump campaign in relation to their connections with Russian agents.
"Based on what I knew in May 2017, the investigation of Russian election interference was justified, and closing it was not an option," he said. "The Department of Justice inspector general is reviewing aspects of the counterintelligence investigation. If the inspector general finds significant new facts, I would reconsider my opinion. But I always need to base my opinions on credible evidence."

Texto completo: The TV industry is unveiling its coming season to advertisers in Manhattan this week, at a series of events known as the upfronts. Three New York Times media reporters -- John Koblin, Michael M. Grynbaum and Edmund Lee -- assess the NBC presentation at Radio City Music Hall on Monday, the first from the four major broadcast networks.
JOHN What a strange start to upfront season. Usually the springtime ritual means 70 degrees, a little sun. Today we were greeted with downpours and a belated winter chill. Advertisers in front of me were complaining that they bothered to wear suits and dress shoes. And while NBC trotted out the Kardashians, "S.N.L." cast members and Rachel Maddow at Radio City, TV writers were at war with their talent agents, which prompted a string of party cancellations.
EDMUND I've been covering upfronts for a decade, and I have to say NBC's extravaganza looked the same as always. But compared with other blowout media affairs I've seen recently, NBC made the best use of the Radio City stage. Google's YouTube did its version of an upfront on May 2 -- full of young fans -- and HBO premiered the final season of "Game of Thrones" there last month with a wonky sound system. Score one for the National Broadcasting Company.
MICHAEL While NBC's ad sales chief, Linda Yaccarino, promised to "future-proof this industry" -- whatever that means -- the prevailing mode was nostalgia. It opened with a tribute to legendary TV ads (few of which aired after 2005) and a pledge to syndicate old friends like "Jerry and Elaine" on NBC's as-yet-untitled streaming service. In other words, "Make It 1997 Again Through Science or Magic." One pitch that got ad execs buzzing was "Para-Norma," a new Tina Fey project about a woman who investigates ghost murders. Oh, wait! Tina was just kidding. But let's face facts: We'd watch that.
JOHN Speaking of nostalgia: How 'bout Brian Williams!
EDMUND He was there! For the first time in at least five years! That's a notable signal of his rehabilitation since he got suspended in 2015 for exaggerating a few personal anecdotes. (How quaint.) Worth adding that Andy Lack, the head of NBC News, is friends with Williams.
MICHAEL I liked seeing the freshly Oscared Rami Malek effusively praise "Mr. Robot," on NBCUniversal's USA channel, for jump-starting his career and say he can't wait for the next and final season. Showing Constance Wu how it's done!
EDMUND What's with all the musicals? Two of the fall-season shows featured song-and-dance schtick. The title character in "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist" can hear other people's thoughts -- as full-on choreographed musical numbers. There's also "Perfect Harmony," a Bradley Whitford vehicle where he plays a sad-sack former Princeton music professor who teaches a down-on-its-luck choir group to -- well, you get the idea.
[Video: PERFECT HARMONY | Official Trailer | NBC Fall Shows 2019 Watch on YouTube.]
MICHAEL I'll look for the infringement suit from "Mr. Holland's Opus." Meanwhile, judging by the Beatles song in the sizzle reel, the licensing rights alone must make "Zoey" the season's priciest new show.
JOHN NBC went with the same message it always does: feel-good programming that can make you laugh, cry, etc., etc. For a second straight year, the network also went hard on the Olympics, this time trotting out 13 female medal winners, including Lindsey Vonn and Tara Lipinski. That was good enough for a standing ovation (last year's standing O went to the U.S. women's hockey team).

EDMUND I was struck by Yaccarino's announcement of a new start date for the NBC streaming service: mid-2020. Back in January, the target was the end of 2019. But the network made an important point: It will be one of the few ad-supported streaming services. Yaccarino also said that NBCUniversal spent $ 24 billion last year on content. That's a lofty sum, given that Netflix spent somewhere between $ 8 billion and $ 10 billion, and CBS reached about $ 8 billion. It's a content arms race.
JOHN Wonder if that'll be the stat of the week -- other than hearing who's No. 1 -- "We spend billions!" We hadn't seen Jimmy Fallon at an upfront since his ratings slide began in earnest in 2017. He opened today's proceeding with a spoof of the Apple "1984" commercial. But he didn't say much: He introduced Yaccarino and promptly exited the stage, leaving Seth Meyers, a late-night host who's No. 1 in his time slot, to get laughs from the crowd.
MICHAEL Were any of the new shows DVR-worthy? I was disappointed to learn that "Lincoln," described as "a unique forensic procedural," was not about Abraham Lincoln solving crimes.
JOHN It is based on the crime novel "The Bone Collector," which was published in 1997 and made into a movie starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie in 1999. Must See TV!
MICHAEL Fran Drescher of "The Nanny" (1993-99) is returning for a show called "Indebted." I'll swear by Fran till the day I croak, but I suspect this one won't make it that long.
JOHN NBC executives are highest on that one! It's a multi-cam show that looks like it could be on CBS ...
EDMUND Do you guys still use a DVR? I think almost every NBC show I watch, I watch on Hulu: "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," "The Good Place," "Superstore." All returning.
MICHAEL You don't use a DVR? (Says the older millennial who refuses to cut the cord.)
JOHN I use a DVR!
EDMUND I never use it, since I'm usually catching things on Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go or Amazon. Speaking of which, Amazon was promoting its Emmy-winning "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" just outside the Radio City marquee. A woman in period costume was handing out black-and-white cookies. When I asked her why Amazon was promoting a show with no advertising outside an event packed with ad executives, a security guard interrupted, asking her to move along.
JOHN Whoa, dirty tricks from Amazon! And if we leave now, we can make it to the Beacon Theater for the Fox upfront.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: A shooting at a school in Highlands Ranch, Colo., last Tuesday in which one student was killed and eight others were injured swiftly drew comparisons to the 1999 attack on nearby Columbine High School and the dozens of shootings like it in the years since.
The attack was the fourth such school shooting in the Denver area and at least the 111th in the country since 1970, according to a New York Times analysis -- the latest in a decades-long series of violent episodes that have shocked the nation and traumatized generations of students.
The Times examined hundreds of episodes in a database of shootings at elementary, middle and high schools to identify those cases in which, like at Highlands Ranch and Columbine, the assailants planned their attacks and fired indiscriminately.
A total of 202 people were killed in those attacks, and 454 were injured, including the shooters. In 16 cases, shots were fired, but no one was injured.
Last year was particularly violent: 29 people were killed and 48 were injured in three shootings in Parkland, Fla.; Santa Fe, Tex.; and Benton, Ky.
Shootings of this type are rare relative to the larger universe of gun violence at schools, but they are common enough that lockdown drills and "run, hide, fight" exercises are part of the school experience all over the country. Before Highlands Ranch there was Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Before Marjory Stoneman Douglas there was Sandy Hook. Before Sandy Hook, Columbine, and before Columbine, Cleveland Elementary in Stockton, Calif.
The school shooting database, compiled by the Naval Postgraduate School's Center for Homeland Defense and Security, is the most comprehensive and detailed of its kind. Researchers aimed to document all instances of gunfire at schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade since 1970 and recorded a total of more than 1,300 cases. The database does not include shootings at colleges.
The Times's analysis identified the 111 cases that met the F.B.I.'s definition for an active-shooter scenario, in which an assailant is actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people, on school property or inside school buildings. It excluded episodes that fit more typical patterns of gun violence, such as targeted attacks, gang shootings and suicides.
These events have stunned much of the country and, in the case of the Parkland shooting, inspired a national student-led movement to tighten the nation's gun laws. But they account for only a small fraction of the episodes of gun violence that children experience in American schools.
Other cases might include a student showing off a gun to friends in the hallway, the accidental discharge of a school resource officer's gun, or a gang-related drive-by shooting at a school bus stop.
"There are shootings that occur in very wealthy counties and very poor counties, ones that happen in very diverse areas and very homogeneous areas," said David Riedman, a creator of the database.
Active shooters may attack anywhere, but a demographic analysis shows that they tend to have traits in common. The majority of shooters were young white men or boys, many of them current or former students of the schools where they opened fire.
Some shooters followed a now-familiar blueprint. Peter Langman, a psychologist who studies school shooters, said younger assailants are especially likely to find inspiration in earlier events. "More than anyone else, people cite the Columbine killers," Mr. Langman said.
That episode intensified a debate over gun violence that continues to divide the nation and drove districts to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to "harden" schools against threats.
The Highlands Ranch shooting similarly renewed old questions about gun access and how best to protect students.
Mr. Riedman, who spent hours poring over news reports and public records on hundreds of shootings to build the database, said school safety measures should take into account not only the events like Columbine but also the many other ways guns and schools can intersect in America.
"These shootings have been carried out by all sorts of people, from students to total strangers," Mr. Riedman said. "They've happened in any part of the country, and they've happened for just about every reason, and that makes prevention very difficult. There can't be any one single or simple solution that's going to address this problem."

Losing income tax privacy is a real danger: Ron Paul

Autor: Paul, Ron. 

Información de publicación: Pasadena Star - News ; Pasadena, Calif. [Pasadena, Calif]. 13 May 2019.

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

The man of 10,000 lies

Texto completo: "The first thing we do, let's kill all the referees."
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare's "Henry VI" goes. As you may recall, it was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy conservatives have long used against the so-called "liberal media. Namely, undermine them - and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth - with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much in a 2016 interview with journalist Oliver Darcy. "We've basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers, he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
"We've created this monster, said Sykes, adding that, "At a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible [news] outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that.
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency last month. This, according to The Washington Post, which maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
Feels like there ought to be a statue, or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn't.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn't.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn't.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to "determine whether or not they will execute the baby.
And how did The New York Times respond to this flaming canard? It called it "inaccurate, which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That's not surprising. Calling that hogwash "inaccurate is like saying the Titanic was "delayed.
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump's lies lies. Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect it's not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you'd call him a liar. You wouldn't hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That's something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely "inaccurate.
It makes you wonder if all the effort conservatives put into neutering the referees was not a waste of time.
Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Texto completo: Chuck Kinder, a writer and teacher at the University of Pittsburgh whose party-giving and endless procrastination as a writer formed the basis of Wonder Boys, a novel by one of his students, Michael Chabon, and a later film of the same name, died May 3 at a hospital in Miami. He was 76.
He had heart ailments, said his wife, Diane Cecily.
For years, Kinder led the creative writing program at the University of Pittsburgh, where he became renowned for his generosity as a teacher and as a host whose house became the literary heart of a city he called “the Paris of Appalachia.”
In the 1970s, he published two novels set in his native West Virginia, but for years afterward he toiled on a manuscript that grew to more than 3,000 pages and never seemed to reach a conclusion. Chabon, who was Kinder’s student in the 1980s, used him as the model for Grady Tripp, the narrator and central figure of the 1995 novel Wonder Boys. The character was played by Michael Douglas in a well-received 2000 film, directed by Curtis Hanson.
The novel Kinder could not finish was called Honeymooners, which centered on his friendship in the 1970s with short-story writer Raymond Carver while they were both studying at Stanford University. By the early 1980s, colleagues, the publishing world and even Kinder’s students knew about the book that seemingly had no end.
“I remember one night being at Chuck’s home for an impromptu party,” Chabon said in a telephone interview. “I saw a light coming from his writing room, and on the desk was a crook-necked desk lamp, shining down on this monstrous stack of white paper. It must have been four reams. Chuck used to take people to look at it.”
Like his fictional alter ego, Kinder was a shambling character who smoked a lot of marijuana but was attentive to his students, offering encouragement and hard-won wisdom about literary life. Students and famous writers constantly dropped by his house in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.
“His teaching didn’t stop at the classroom,” Chabon said. “He was open with his struggles as a writer. I remember him saying to me, ‘The book defeats me daily.’ But the thing that made him so remarkable and so inspiring as a teacher was that he just loved literature.”
In Chabon’s novel and the film, Grady Tripp’s mountainous manuscript is titled Wonder Boys. Throughout the book, Tripp deals with romantic entanglements, fends off the demands of his editor and nurtures a promising student (played in the film by Tobey Maguire) — who pilfers a jacket once worn by Marilyn Monroe from the home of the university chancellor.
In one madcap scene, Tripp has a gun pointed at him as he tries to recover his stolen car and the jacket inside it. His editor, Terry Crabtree (played by Robert Downey Jr. in the film), attempts to come to his rescue in another car.
Kinder was not quite so comically beleaguered as Grady Tripp. After years of editing, his manuscript was trimmed to 358 pages and published in 2001 as Honeymooners: A Cautionary Tale, which followed the friendship and rivalry of two hard-drinking writers.
“Kinder’s prose has the range to encompass the tenderness of romantic love and the longing for the infinite that haunts these men,” novelist Jay McInerney wrote in a New York Times review. “If Honeymooners doesn’t make you laugh, cry and cringe with sympathetic embarrassment, then you should probably adjust your medication immediately.”
Charles Alfonso Kinder II was born Oct. 8, 1942, in Montgomery, W. Va., and moved around the state during his childhood. His father worked in the insurance business; his mother was a nurse.
Kinder was an early admirer of Jack Kerouac and other Beat writers of the 1950s and studied English at West Virginia University, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1967 and a master’s degree in 1968. (He was not related to another Chuck Kinder, who was the punter and place-kicker for the WVU football team in the mid-1960s.)
After teaching at what is now Waynesburg University in Pennsylvania, Kinder went to Stanford University, where he studied and taught writing and became friends with Carver, Tobias Wolff, Scott Turow, Larry McMurtry and other writers.
Kinder’s first two novels, Snakehunter (1973) and The Silver Ghost (1978), were coming-of-age novels set in hardscrabble quarters of West Virginia. He taught in California and Alabama before joining the University of Pittsburgh faculty in 1980. After Honeymooners, he published another book, Last Mountain Dancer: Hard-Earned Lessons in Love, Loss, and Honky-Tonk Outlaw Life, in 2004.
“The border between fact and fiction is a porous one I cross over and back easily,” Kinder told the Pittsburgh Current last year, when Snakehunter and Last Mountain Dancer were republished. “I have always told my students that my work is literally as true as the Bible.”
After several strokes and a heart attack, he retired from teaching in 2014 and moved to Key Largo, Fla. He published several volumes of poetry in recent years.
His first marriage, to Janet Weaver, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 44 years, Diane Cecily of Key Largo; a brother; and a sister.
“Of all the characters I’ve created,” said Chabon, who the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for his 2001 novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, “Grady is one of my very favorites, and I couldn’t have done it if Chuck hadn’t been there.”
Chabon did not ask permission before basing the character on his onetime mentor, but several years after Wonder Boys was published, he learned that Kinder was teaching it in his class to a new generation of aspiring writers.

Texto completo: His face slightly flushed by the Honolulu heat, Simon Winchester, author of the New York Times best-seller “The Professor and the Madman,” now a feature film being released this month, ducked into the air-conditioned restaurant at the Hawai‘i State Art Museum.
He asked for an iced coffee and was told it wasn’t on the menu.
“Have you got ice? If you have, I can make it,” Winchester, 74, said politely in his native English accent.
The young server gave Winchester a kindly smile and said he’d make it for him.
The lighthearted interaction over ice, on a hot May day in a warming world, brought to mind the weighty reason for Winchester’s Hawaii visit — the risks of climate change. On Tuesday he will give a keynote presentation, “The Pacific: Where Geopolitics and Nature Intersect,” at Honolulu’s historic Liljestrand House.
The talk will kick off a “Margins of the Sea” preview summit on peace, global understanding and climate change at the Liljestrand House, designed by renowned modern architect Vladimir Ossipoff. Winchester will be introduced by Davianna McGregor, author of “Na Kua‘aina: Living Hawaiian Culture” and professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
“When I was at the East-West Center researching my Pacific book (‘Pacific: Silicon Chips and Surfboards, Coral Reefs and Atom Bombs, Brutal Dictators, Fading Empires, and the Coming Collision of the World’s Superpowers’), I saw how certain natural events seemed to precipitate political and military consequences,” said Winchester, who has focused on Oceania, China, Korea and the U.S. West Coast in many of his 30-some books.
“It began with the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1990, when they closed the U.S. Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base, denying much of the South China Sea to the U.S. Navy in terms of patrolling,” which left an opening to Chinese military development in the area, he said.
Since then, natural disasters triggered by climate change — more frequent and extreme storms, crop failures, threats to coastlines and low-lying island nations and dislocation of populations — have further threatened the stability of the region. “As Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, then-U.S. Pacific commander, said (in 2013), climate change is a much more long-term dire political threat than North Korea or China,” Winchester said.
“There’s a difference between a proximate threat like (those posed by) North Korea and China, and an ultimate threat like climate change.”
Added to the human toll are the loss of species and habitat in the Pacific Ocean. “The biggest natural phenomenon in the world is dying due to warming and acidification, and physical damage caused by ships carrying coal from Australia to China,” said the former international correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, describing the vibrant colors of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef when he first visited it in the 1970s. “Now it’s a graveyard.”
WINCHESTER’s wife Setsuko Winchester, 57, an artist and former journalist, came over to his table with tiny cubes of silver and gold she’d found in the museum gift shop. “They’re a perfect illustration of your new book,” she said. (“The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World,” is out in paperback this month.)
Winchester showed how each cube pulled apart into a pair of laser-cut earrings.
“They really are precise. I don’t suppose you’re going to buy them,” her husband teased.
Last week, as part of the Liljestrand Foundation’s ongoing “Design Conversation” series, Setsuko Winchester presented her “Freedom From Fear/Yellow Bowl Project,” a collection of 120 yellow tea bowls she made by hand and showed on the grounds of the Liljestrand House. Each bowl represents 1,000 individuals interned under President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor.
On Monday, Winchester, who has placed and photographed her bowls at 10 U.S. internment camps, Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island and other locations, will do so at Honouliuli National Monument, the site of an internment camp on Oahu.
“Part of my struggle with this story is I was considered the enemy,” she said, explaining that her family moved from Japan to the U.S. after the war.
On a cheerier note, the Winchesters, who live in Massachusetts, said they’d enjoyed the film of his book “The Professor and the Madman,” which they’d seen on the plane to Hawaii. It portrays the relationship between James Murray, the founding editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, played by Mel Gibson, and one of his most prolific contributors, William Minor, a murderer and insane asylum inmate played by Sean Penn.
While mostly faithful to his book, the film had taken a few liberties, Winchester said. “There’s no evidence that Minor and his victim’s wife formed a romantic relationship, but it’s implied in the film.”
HAWAII’S diversity of species is featured in Winchester’s 2015 Pacific book, along with surfing, “what one might these days fairly term the Pacific Ocean’s greatest gift to the outside world beyond,” he wrote, noting that Duke Kahanamoku “spread the message of surfing, far and wide.”
Today, Winchester said, he would include the sailing canoe Hokule‘a and its 2014-2017 Malama Honua circumnavigation of the globe to raise consciousness about the need to stop global warming and pollution. For the oceanic environment, “Nainoa Thompson might be the next Duke Kahanamoku,” he said.
Winchester expressed hope that Hawaii would build on the legacy of Hokule‘a and become a world leader in awareness and stewardship of the ocean that surrounds us. “If this ‘Margins of the Sea’ summit becomes established, it could become permanent, an independent Pacific Ocean studies center,” he said.
In a later interview at the house, Bob Liljestrand, whose parents, Betty and Howard Liljestrand, built the dwelling in 1952, agreed. “We’d like to make ‘Margins of the Sea’ an annual, international summit,” said Liljestrand, who is a co-founder, with his wife Vicky Durand Liljestrand, of the Liljestrand Foundation. The nonprofit’s mission is to “preserve and steward the house and make it beneficial to the community with charitable events,” he said.
International cooperation to cut greenhouse gas emissions is essential because ultimately, “nature wins,” said Winchester, who holds a degree in geology from Oxford University. His next book will be about the Mississippi River, which continually seeks to revert to its much-diverted course.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the East-West Center as part of the University of Hawaii. The Center is an independent nonprofit institution adjacent to the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Texto completo: NASHVILLE, Tenn. – The unexpected death of Christian author Rachel Held Evans on Saturday has led to an outpouring of support from those touched by her writings, with many saying she is the reason they kept their faith in God and the church.
In mid-April, Evans was hospitalized and put into a medically-induced coma when doctors found she was experiencing seizures while treating her for an infection.
On Saturday, her husband, Dan Evans, announced her death on her website and shock and grief overtook many at the news.
A GoFundMe campaign, launched to help cover medical expenses during her hospital stay, had a goal of $70,000. By Sunday morning, it had exceeded $179,000.
Rachel Held Evans was known for her progressive Christian voice. She was a speaker, writer and author of numerous best-selling books, including "Faith Unraveled," "A Year of Biblical Womanhood," "Searching for Sunday" and "Inspired."
Her writings resonated particularly with those struggling with their faith, traditional evangelicalism and the treatment of women and LGBT persons within the church.
"Yet instead of throwing out God or church, Rachel demonstrated a robust Christian faith outside the bounds of evangelicalism," Katelyn Beaty, author of "A Women's Place," wrote in a tribute column for the Religion News Service.
Beaty wrote that Evans, in her "Searching for Sunday" book, traced her own personal journey through the Episcopal church.
"Along the way, she helped many readers stay tethered to faith when they wanted to bolt," Beaty wrote.
Indeed, after her death, the #BecauseofRHE hashtag began trending as people told their own stories about how Evans inspired them to keep their faith and remain active in their churches.
"When I was still struggling with my faith, this woman was one of the voices who made me feel like no one had the right to reject me," wrote one woman under the name Jamie Holderman. "She held space for me to feel loved."
The Rev. Emmy Kegler, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Minneapolis and the founder of Queer Grace, an online resources guide around LGBTQ life and faith, told of how Evans inspired her.
"She taught me how to hold my faith upside down and shake it till grace fell out," Kegler wrote Sunday. "I'll do the same again today, not just for myself but for all in need. #BecauseOfRHE."
Others paid similar tributes.
But it wasn't just progressive Christians who felt touched by Evans, her writings and her life.
Most notably, Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, took to Twitter to urge people to support her family and donate to the GoFundMe campaign.
Evans "leaves behind a husband and two small children, one 3 and one less than one year old. As many as can, let's please help this grieving young family with the overwhelming medical bills," Moore wrote.
Moore regularly tangled with Evans online but said conservative Christians are better off because of her.
"I was on the other side of her Twitter indignation many times, but I respected her because she was never a phony," Moore told The New York Times. "Even in her dissent, she made all of us think, and helped those of us who are theological conservatives to be better because of the way she would challenge us."
Evans, 37, was from Dayton, Tennessee, and in addition to her writings, served on former President Barack Obama's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. She was a regular speaker across the nation.
Funeral arrangements are pending.

Marc Thiessen: There’s trouble brewing in Joe Biden’s presidential campaign

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Joe Biden’s presidential campaign is in trouble. That may sound crazy. The former vice president just opened up (according to one poll) a 32-point lead over the rest of the Democratic field. But beneath the surface, trouble is brewing.
Biden will be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021. That would make him older, if elected, on the day he takes office than President Ronald Reagan was on the day he left office.
With old age comes old baggage — in Biden’s case, his handling of Anita Hill’s testimony during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings. Polls show that 30% of Democrats don’t approve of Biden’s handling of Hill’s testimony; 44% said they didn’t know or had no opinion. That’s not surprising. The Thomas hearings took place in 1991, when the Soviet Union still existed, the last apartheid president of South Africa was still in office and something called the World Wide Web was made available to the public. Tens of millions of American voters have been born since 1991, and have no living memories of these events.
But Biden’s Democratic rivals are going to make sure they do know about Anita Hill. The more Biden’s primary lead expands, the more desperate his Democratic opponents will be to bring him down. And Hill is their most powerful weapon.
Biden knows this, which is why he recently tried to reach out to Hill and smooth things over. It didn’t work. Hill told the New York Times that “she was not convinced that he has taken full responsibility for his conduct at the hearings — or for the harm he caused other victims of sexual harassment and gender violence.” She said “she was troubled by the recent accounts of women who say Mr. Biden touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.” And she said that Biden’s handling of her testimony “set the stage” for the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Those words could prove devastating with Democratic primary voters. The Thomas hearings may be ancient history, but Kavanaugh’s confirmation is an open wound for Democrats.

Biden said in a speech in March that “to this day, I regret I couldn’t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved.” Democrats won’t buy that. He was chairman of the committee before which she testified. Perhaps he didn’t do more to support Hill because most Americans did not believe her. After three days of hearings, a New York Times poll showed that 58% believed Thomas, while just 24% believed Hill. Even 46% of Democrats believed Thomas over Hill. Far from hurting Thomas, Hill’s testimony moved public opinion in his direction. The number of people who supported Thomas’s confirmation rose from 38% before Hill testified to 45% after, with just 20% opposed to his confirmation.
Even Biden didn’t believe some of Hill’s testimony. At one point, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked whether Hill was told by Senate Democrats that her charges would be kept secret and used to force Thomas to withdraw. She denied it. Specter recalled in his memoir that Biden said, “It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, she was lying.”
Biden bowed to the public mood of the times. But in 2019, the public mood of the Democratic electorate has changed. He is running for president in the #MeToo era, against female Democratic rivals such as Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, N.Y., Amy Klobuchar, Minn., Kamala Harris, Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, Mass. Think they are going to give Biden a pass on his handling of Hill’s testimony? Biden is the living embodiment of the era they are running against — a guy who is all too “handsy” with women in professional situations (as captured on video and parodied by late-night TV) and who did not stand up for a woman when she came forward.
The mantra on the left today is that even completely uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct must be believed and should be enough to destroy a man’s career. Democrats tried to use such uncorroborated accusations to stop Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and failed. That failure is a source of continuing frustration for the Democratic base. Biden’s rivals are going to harness those frustrations by pinning their party’s failure to defeat Kavanaugh on Biden through the prism of the Thomas hearings.
Biden may be the Democratic front-runner. But that does not mean he will be the Democratic nominee.

Nothing compares to the magic of joy

Texto completo: On Monday I was honored to speak to the graduating students at Arizona State University. It was an intimidating occasion. ASU is the most innovative university in the world. Plus, there were 35,000 people in the football stadium.
Anybody speaking to college students these days is aware of how hard it is to be a young adult today, with rising rates of depression, other mental health issues, even suicide.
So while these talks are usually occasions to talk about professional life, my goal was to get them thinking about the future of their emotional lives, which is really going to be at the center of everything.
There are two kinds of emotion present at any graduation ceremony. For the graduating students there is happiness. They've achieved something. They've worked hard and are moving closer to their goals.
There is a different emotion up in the stands among the families and friends. That emotion is joy. They are not thinking about themselves. Their delight is seeing the glow on the graduate's face, the laughter in her voice, the progress of his journey, the blooming of a whole person.
Happiness usually involves a victory for the self. Joy tends to involve the transcendence of self. Happiness comes from accomplishments. Joy comes when your heart is in another. Joy comes after years of changing diapers, driving to practice, worrying at night, dancing in the kitchen, playing in the yard and just sitting quietly together watching TV. Joy is the present that life gives you as you give away your gifts.
The core point is that happiness is good, but joy is better. It's smart to enjoy happiness, but it's smarter still to put yourself in situations where you might experience joy.
People receive joy after they have over-invested in their friendships. The thing the wisest people say about friendship is this: Lovers stand face to face staring into each other's eyes. But friends stand side by side, staring at the things they both care about. Friendship is about doing things together. So people build their friendships by organizing activities that are repeated weekly, monthly or annually: picnics, fantasy leagues, book clubs, etc.
A friend of mine organized a giving circle when he graduated. He and his friends put money into a common pot every year, and every year they gather to decide what cause they will give the money to. The philanthropy is nice, but it's really just a pretext to get them together each year, so they can live life shoulder to shoulder.
They say that love is blind, but the affection friends have for each other is the opposite of blind. It is ferociously attentive. You are vulnerable, and your friend holds your vulnerability. He pauses, and you wait for him. You err, and she forgives.
"You will be loved," Italian novelist Cesare Pavese wrote, "the day when you will be able to show your weakness without the other person using it to assert his strength."
Transparency is the fuel of friendship. We live in an age of social media. It's very easy to create false personas and live life as a performance.
We live in a cruel time, when people attack you when they see a hint of vulnerability. So, it's extra important to stick with emotional honesty even after people take advantage of your vulnerability to inflict pain. Vulnerability is the only means we have to build relationships, and relationships are the only means we have to experience joy.
My friend Catherine Bly Cox observed that when her first daughter was born, she realized she loved her more than evolution required. I love that phrase because it speaks to what is distinctly human, our complex and infinite caring for one another.
There are some things we do because biology demands it. There are some things we do to pay the rent. But material drives don't explain the magic of our friendships and the way our soul sings when we watch loved ones glow.
Sometimes when you're out with your friends, you taste a kind of effervescent joy. Several years ago, writer Zadie Smith was dancing at a club with her friends when a song from A Tribe Called Quest came on. At that point, she wrote, "A rail-thin man with enormous eyes reached across a sea of bodies for my hand. He kept asking me the same thing over and over: You feeling it? I was. My ridiculous heels were killing me, I was terrified I might die, yet I felt simultaneously overwhelmed with delight that Can I Kick It?' should happen to be playing at this precise moment in the history of the world, and was now morphing into Smells Like Teen Spirit.' I took the man's hand. The top of my head flew away. We danced and danced. We gave ourselves up to joy."
When you have moments like that, you realize there is magic in the world. You can't create the magic intentionally, but when you are living at that deep affectionate level, it sometimes just combusts within you. A blaze of joy.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Within a day of the release of the Mueller report last month, President Trump sought to have former White House counsel Don McGahn declare he didn't consider the president's 2017 directive that he seek Robert Mueller's dismissal to be obstruction of justice, but Mr. McGahn rebuffed the request, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Trump has publicly denied asking Mr. McGahn to fire the Russia probe special counsel since the release of the report . Mr. Mueller's report detailed that directive, and a subsequent request by Mr. Trump that Mr. McGahn deny that conversation ever happened, and said that Mr. McGahn rebuffed both. Last month, Mr. Trump tweeted: "If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn't need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself."
Privately, Mr. Trump asked White House special counsel Emmet Flood to inquire whether Mr. McGahn would release a statement asserting that he didn't believe those interactions with the president—and Mr. Trump's subsequent efforts to have Mr. McGahn deny news reports about that request—amounted to obstruction, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Flood didn't respond to a request for comment.
William Burck, a lawyer for Mr. McGahn, said in a statement about the request: "We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister. It was a request, professionally and cordially made."
Mr. McGahn turned down the request because he didn't want to weigh in on the totality of evidence in the report beyond his own testimony, and didn't want to comment on his own testimony in isolation, the people said. Mr. McGahn also didn't view his personal opinion as relevant, because Attorney General William Barr had already said he didn't believe the evidence in Mr. Mueller's report amounted to obstruction of justice , the people said.
Mr. Flood, as he sought the statement from Mr. McGahn, pointed to previous assertions by Mr. Burck that if Mr. McGahn believed Mr. Trump had committed a crime, he would have resigned his post, the people said.
Share Your Thoughts
What sort of statement, if any, would it be appropriate for Don McGahn to have issued after the release of the Mueller report? Join the conversation below.
Last August, following reports that Mr. McGahn had spent 30 hours talking to Mr. Mueller's investigators, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow reached out to Mr. Burck to inquire about the scope and nature of Mr. McGahn's testimony to Mr. Mueller, according to people familiar with the conversation. John Dowd, who headed the president's legal team, had also contacted Mr. Burck previously to inquire about Mr. McGahn's testimony and whether he had told Mr. Mueller that Mr. Trump committed any crimes, the people said.
Mr. McGahn told investigators that he prepared to resign in June 2017 rather than follow Mr. Trump's directive to call the deputy attorney general and ask him to dismiss Mr. Mueller, but stayed in his post when Mr. Trump didn't press him on the matter. Mr. McGahn left his White House position in October 2018.
Mr. Trump's effort to have Mr. McGahn make a public statement after the report's release could intensify efforts by Democratic lawmakers to compel him to testify about his interactions with Mr. Trump. The White House on Tuesday directed Mr. McGahn to rebuff a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee for documents related to Mr. Mueller's investigation, saying the requested documents implicated executive privilege.
Mr. Trump has said he will fight all congressional subpoenas to his current and former aides, telling reporters last month: "It's enough."
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), in a letter to Mr. Burck on Tuesday evening, said he expected the committee would vote to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt if he didn't appear before the panel on May 21. If that were to happen, the matter would be likely be litigated in the courts.
Mr. Trump and his allies have criticized Mr. McGahn since the report's release. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani called Mr. McGahn "hopelessly confused" in a CNN interview. Mr. Burck has defended the episodes in the report involving his client as "accurately described" and called Mr. Giuliani's comments a "mystery."
A statement from Mr. McGahn declaring that he didn't believe Mr. Trump committed a crime could have bolstered the White House's broader public argument for Mr. Trump's innocence, particularly as Congress continues to investigate Mr. Trump for obstruction and other matters related to the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and Moscow's ties to the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has publicly declared the Mueller report exonerates him and has denied obstructing justice.
Mr. Mueller in his report said he wasn't exonerating Mr. Trump and wrote: "The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred." He said he decided not to make a decision on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in part because of a Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
According to the Mueller report, Mr. Trump called Mr. McGahn at home in June 2017—a month after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had appointed Mr. Mueller—and directed him to call Mr. Rosenstein and say Mr. Mueller had conflicts that precluded him from serving as special counsel. "You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod," the president said.
Mr. McGahn was "perturbed" by Mr. Trump's order, according to the report, and prepared to resign rather than carry it out, telling then-chief of staff Reince Priebus the president had asked Mr. McGahn to "do crazy shit." He told Mr. Mueller's investigators that he and other White House aides saw the alleged conflicts—which included Mr. Mueller's effort to obtain a refund from one of Mr. Trump's golf clubs in 2011—as "silly" and "not real," and that they had said as much to Mr. Trump, according to the report.
After the New York Times reported in January 2018 that Mr. Trump had directed Mr. McGahn to have the special counsel dismissed, Mr. Trump publicly denied it and sought to have aides, including his personal lawyer, his press secretary and his staff secretary, ask Mr. McGahn to dispute the reports, at one point threatening to fire Mr. McGahn, according to the Mueller report. The next month, he met face-to-face with Mr. McGahn and asked him: "Did I say the word fire?" Mr. McGahn told Mr. Trump that he understood the conversation as "Mueller has to go."

'No Visible Bruises' examines domestic violence

Texto completo: If you've ever been witness to violence in your family, in your home, if you've ever been its victim, Rachel Louise Snyder's new book may chill you to the bone. It may also feel like welcome reassurance that you are not alone.
And if this violence we call "domestic" seems alien to you, something that happens only to an unfortunate few others? This book will teach you how prevalent it is.
It's called "No Visible Bruises: What We Don't Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us." A New York Times reviewer has called it "extraordinary."
After its release this week, I called Snyder, an American University professor who spent many years in Chicago, to talk about it. This is a slightly edited version of our conversation.
Why did you call the book "No Visible Bruises?"
It came from a New Yorker piece I wrote on traumatic brain injury in domestic violence victims. They titled it. I realized the title was perfect because so much of the problem of domestic violence isn't physical violence, it's the anticipation of violence.
How do you define "domestic violence?"
Terrorism.
For a lot of people, the term "domestic violence" rings wrong. Why?
It doesn't get at the psychological forces. Research points to the same psychology in domestic violence victims that exists in prisoners of war. It is a form of terrorism. A lot of researchers in the field of domestic violence call it "intimate partner terrorism." The woman I open my book with -- her husband brought a rattlesnake home and kept it in a cage in order to keep her compliant.
You write that we didn't recognize domestic violence as a wrong for most of human history. Give me the short version of our evolution.
Wives were property for millennia. The state condoned the beating of a spouse because it was believed that she was the property of her husband. It wasn't until the 19th century that we began to even recognize spousal abuse.
There were a few states in the mid-to-late 19th century that passed anti-wife-beating laws, but they were rarely enforced. It really wasn't until the women's movement of the 1970s and '80s that there was a concerted effort to say, hey, this is not OK. We did not have a federal law in this country against beating one's spouse until 1984.
What surprised you in your reporting?
So many things. No. 1: that shelter was not an adequate response. No. 2: that domestic violence -- and domestic violence homicides -- is something we can address as a public health crisis. And three, that a lot of men who are abusers want to be better men.
People often ask: Why did she stay? You say we need to be asking: Why is he violent?
Imagine any other crime where we put the impetus for change on the victim. Why didn't she leave is such a gendered question. I find it offensive. Wait a minute: Why is he hitting her? Why is he violent and staying in a relationship in which he is violent?
One of your chapters is called "This Person You Love Will Take Your Life." What's love got to do with it?
Love has everything to do with it. It's the only crime I can think of where love is the central force in the relationship. It's not like you're walking down the street and getting mugged. It's very confusing. Wait a minute: This person is supposed to love me. Is this love? Can this be love?
You spent time with men in batterers' intervention groups and you raise the question: Can violent men become nonviolent? Can they?
If we dismiss the abusers, we get nowhere. We cannot do this without the involvement of men. I know that batterers' intervention groups have questionable efficacies, but it's so new as a social science. Give people doing this important work some time to figure it out. When we first recognized domestic violence, we built shelters. It took us decades to realize that that was an inadequate response, a totally disruptive response to someone's life.
You note that a lot of these men -- and most abusers are men, mostly abusing women -- are highly dependent on their partners.
A researcher said it really beautifully to me. He said women inhabit the world of emotions that these men cannot access. The women are their conduit.
You talk about how the violence usually stems from a combination of risk factors -- like substance abuse, gun ownership, extreme jealousy. One risk factor is strangulation. It's a more significant predictor than a punch or a kick. Did that surprise you?
Oh God, yeah. Think about your neck. It's one of the most vulnerable places in your body. I remember being blown away by that.
So what works?
There are a ton of tiny incremental things that work. There's no one-size-fits-all solution.
Police being trained on how to look for signs of strangulation.
Hospitals screening for traumatic brain injury as they do for athletes or car accident victims.
There are some states where if someone is arrested for domestic violence -- Montana being one of them -- a perpetrator cannot bail out until after lunch. It gives advocates some time to create a safety plan. Maybe that means changing locks. Maybe it means packing up and taking the woman to a shelter.
And what works for abusers?
Abusers education needs to have at least three components: accountability, gender education and education on intimacy and human emotion. The most successful programs I saw took into account not just what an abuser was doing but the way that abuser fits into cultural norms.
I think change will be a challenge, but what's our alternative? Just continue to lose women and children and families to this scourge?
Snyder will talk about "No Visible Bruises" at Women & Children First bookstore in Chicago on May 15 and at Anderson's Bookshop in Naperville on May 16. Both events start at 7 p.m.

Texto completo: Chris Hughes, who helped Mark Zuckerberg create Facebook Inc., is calling for the social-media giant to be broken up. In a nearly 6,000-word essay published online Thursday in the New York Times, Mr. Hughes said the Facebook CEO has gained power that is "unprecedented and un-American." Mr. Hughes said if Facebook remains intact its dominance of online social interaction "will become even more entrenched."
Facebook said accountability comes with success but that the right way to enforce it is by crafting new rules for the internet.

Texto completo: At his contentious hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General William Barr dropped a big hint about his investigation into the conduct of the Trump-Russia investigation.
"Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant," Barr said. "I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop the threat as it is being represented."
Here is what he meant: There has been a lot of discussion on the right about the FBI’s use of a confidential informant, an England-based college professor named Stefan Halper, to spy on some Trump campaign figures, including the sometime foreign policy volunteer advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. There has also been talk about the FBI’s use of a so-called FISA warrant — a court-approved permission to wiretap — against Page.
There was also speculation about other possible FBI surveillance, but the Halper operation and Page FISA case were the only ones definitely known. So Barr was saying that if the FBI really took the Trump-Russia matter seriously, if they thought it was a threat to the republic, would that be all they would do? No other wiretaps or other surveillance? No other confidential informants? Nothing?
Given that Barr was already looking into the question, his phrasing suggested he suspected there was more.
Sure enough, just days later, The New York Times reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI sent an undercover agent, a woman who went by the alias Azra Turk, to London to pose as Halper’s research assistant and tease information out of Papadopoulos. (The Times was so reluctant to call Turk a spy that it referred to her, in a headline, as a "cloaked investigator.") So now there are Halper, Turk and the Page FISA warrant. If they represent the totality of the FBI’s surveillance, that would still be a pretty anemic response to what some in the bureau viewed as a full-scale Russian attack on American democracy.
So the key question of the Barr investigation will be: Is there more? The answer is not publicly known. But consider this: The Mueller report noted that on Aug. 2, 2017, the Justice Department authorized the special counsel to investigate specific allegations against four Trump campaign officials: Page and Papadopoulos, plus former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former security adviser Michael Flynn. Is it reasonable to believe that the FBI pulled out the big investigative guns, the spies and the wiretap warrant, against the two smaller figures — Page and Papadopoulos — and not against the far more important figures of Manafort and Flynn? Or if not against them, perhaps against others?
It wasn’t that long ago, on April 10, when, during another Hill appearance, Barr set off a firestorm by declaring that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. Democrats pounced; how dare Barr call the FBI’s investigation "spying"?
"Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of attorney general," tweeted Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.
It is abundantly clear that Barr was correct. He was careful to add that the unknown factor about the spying was "whether it was adequately predicated" — that is, whether the FBI had a legitimate reason to do it. But there was no doubt that spying happened.
Now, the question is whether there was more than is now publicly known. Congressional investigators are anxiously awaiting the results of an investigation into at least some of the surveillance by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. That report is thought to be coming in the next couple of months. They are also watching to see what Barr will investigate on his own.
Both are deeply important efforts. Just as the public needed to know what is in the Mueller report, it needs to know about the FBI’s secret political operations in the 2016 campaign.

Texto completo: ALBANY - The state Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would allow the state Tax Department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, introduced the measure last month in a bid to aid Democrats who control the U.S. House in their efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns. It passed along party lines, 39-21.
Because Trump is a New Yorker, the state Legislature "has a special role and responsibility to assist Congress in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities," Hoylman said Tuesday after the bill passed a Senate committee.
He added Wednesday, "Simply put, no one is above the law, and we have a situation in Washington where a co-equal branch of government has requested tax information from the White House and it is being stonewalled."
The Democrat-controlled Senate passed another bill Wednesday aimed at Trump.
It would allow New York to prosecute Trump associates even if they are pardoned by the president on the federal level.
What happens next? With the Senate approval, the bills now go to the Democrat-led Assembly, where leaders haven't indicated whether it would pass them.
Then they would need the signature of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who, despite being a harsh Trump critic, has indicated he would back the proposal to let the state release Trump's taxes to Congress if it would apply to more than just the president.
The Trump administration has rejected requests by House Democrats to get Trump's federal tax returns.
Since Trump files his taxes in New York, the bill would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request the state Department of Taxation and Finance to provide the president's state tax returns.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler praised New York's bill, saying it would aid his investigation into the White House.
"This bill is a workaround to a White House that continues to obstruct and stonewall the legitimate oversight work of Congress," he said in a statement.
Republicans ripped both the tax bill and the so-called "double jeopardy" bill, saying they are politically motivated and set dangerous precedents.
"I truly believe that this is pure and simple a political maneuver to attack a sitting president of the United States to score political points in your individual districts," Sen. Thomas O'Mara, R-Big Flats, Chemung County, said on the Senate floor.
The "double jeopardy" bill would let state prosecutors bring charges — even if a presidential pardon was issued. Attorney General Letitia James, a Trump critic, has pushed for the measure.
The bill appears to have the support of Cuomo and the Assembly.
Changing the law Under New York law, sharing state tax return information is prohibited, except under rare circumstances.
The bill would create an exemption when the returns are sought by congressional committees in any investigations.
Democrats dismissed Republicans' concerns that it would open all New Yorkers to tax scrutiny by Congress, saying the measure is limited in scope and the IRS already has access to state tax returns.
The bill is one of three Hoylman has introduced to get at Trump's taxes.
One would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year.
Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes.
Hoylman said the Senate focused on the tax bill passed Wednesday because it appears to be more urgent, since Trump is fighting with the House over release of his taxes to the congressional committees.
Scrutinizing Trump's taxes The bill's passage in the Senate came a day after The New York Times reported on details of Trump's tax returns from 1985 through 1994, saying he lost more than $1 billion through his business dealings over that span.
On Wednesday, Trump blasted the report, saying the tax filings demonstrated "write-offs" and "depreciation."
"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted early Wednesday.

Texto completo: Amazon barreled into the children's smart-speaker market last year with a brightly colored device called Echo Dot Kids Edition. The tech giant played up the device as a simple way for youngsters to converse with Alexa, the company's voice-activated virtual assistant, and obtain age-appropriate apps.
But recent research commissioned by two prominent advocacy groups found that the device also enabled children to easily divulge their names, home addresses, Social Security numbers and other intimate information to Alexa. In addition, the researchers reported that Amazon made it cumbersome for parents to delete their child's personal details from the system.
On Thursday, the two groups -- the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy -- joined more than a dozen others in lodging a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. The groups say that Amazon's practices violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law protecting the personal information of people under 13.
Among other things, the complaint said that Amazon had failed to obtain verified consent from parents before collecting their children's voice recordings and had kept such records unnecessarily after extracting the data to respond to children. The groups also complained that Amazon had not sufficiently disclosed how it collected and used children's data.
"It seems pretty clear from our findings that the only control that parents really have is not purchasing this device," Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said in an interview. "Once they purchase it, they are essentially ceding control of their children's data -- which could be really sensitive when you're talking about a voice-activated device that lives in a home -- to Amazon."
Amazon said in a statement that the device and a related subscription service for children, called FreeTime Unlimited, "are compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act." The company added that its site provided information about Alexa-related privacy practices. Before children's services can be used on Alexa, a user must consent and provide a credit-card number or a code number sent by Amazon via text message.
Amazon is seeking to capture children's attention at a time of heightened public concern over the data-mining of youngsters.
The children's online privacy law requires digital services aimed at those under 13 to obtain a parent's verifiable permission before collecting their child's name, home address, precise location, phone number, video, voice recording and other personal information.
Over the last year, however, state and federal regulators have charged numerous tech giants and start-ups with failing to comply with that law. An investigation by The New York Times last year found that app stores had allowed children's services to track youngsters' locations without their parents' permission.
Because many parents, advocacy groups and regulators consider voice recordings to be among the most sensitive types of children's data, Amazon's Echo Dot Kids device has found itself under particular scrutiny.
This gadget records children's voice commands and uses artificial intelligence to respond. Children can ask the system to play music, answer questions, tell jokes or remember information they tell it. The device also comes with a subscription to an Amazon service that gives children access to thousands of apps while enabling their parents to manage screen time.
But the advocacy groups say that the device failed to comply with provisions in the privacy law requiring digital services for children to provide parents with clear explanations of their data practices and to delete a child's information as soon as it is no longer needed to fulfill the service for which it was collected.
In particular, researchers tested the device last month by having a child ask Alexa to remember a made-up phone number, Social Security number, home address and phrases like "I am allergic to peanuts."
After the testers used parental controls to delete the voice recordings, they found that Alexa still remembered and was able to repeat the personal information included in the recordings. In order to delete the underlying data, researchers had to contact Amazon customer service and ask to have the child's entire profile deleted.
In a response to questions about the device last year from concerned members of Congress, an Amazon executive said that the company kept a child's voice recordings indefinitely by default, saying they were "retained for the parent's review until the parent deletes them."
Amazon also retained the recordings to improve its services, such as training its speech recognition system to better understand children's requests, the executive said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Last Nuclear Reactor on Three Mile Island, Site of 1979 Disaster, Will Shut Down

Texto completo: Forty years after the worst commercial nuclear power plant accident in United States history unfolded on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the only nuclear power reactor still operating there is preparing to shut down.
The facility, which is in Londonderry Township, Pa., has been losing money, and in a statement on Wednesday, Exelon Generation, the company that owns the plant, said it would be closed by Sept. 30. The company and its employees had been hoping for a subsidy from the state, and when that fell through, a shutdown was the only option, that statement said.
"Today is a difficult day for our employees, who were hopeful that state policymakers would support valuing carbon-free nuclear energy the same way they value other forms of clean energy in time to save TMI from a premature closure," Bryan Hanson, Exelon's senior vice president and chief nuclear officer, said in the statement.
A company spokesman said the cost of decommissioning the site was estimated at around $ 1.2 billion.
The reactor where the accident occurred 40 years ago is not owned by Exelon, and it was dormant long before the company began operating a nearby reactor around two decades ago. But for many residents of the area around Harrisburg, Pa., the words "Three Mile Island" will always evoke memories of that panic.
It was, as The New York Times reported in the aftermath, "an accident that would generate a week of doomsday fear, panicky flight, conflicting statements, noisy demonstrations and intense confusion."
Disaster struck in the early morning hours of March 28, 1979, when water-coolant pumps failed and a reactor overheated. The temperature kept rising after a stuck valve misled the operators into stopping the flow of emergency cooling water. There was a partial meltdown, and the plant was in crisis for several days. Radiation was purposefully released into the air to relieve pressure within the system.
Public panic was fueled, in part, by the sense that people weren't getting enough information about what had happened -- and what they should do to stay safe.
No immediate deaths or injuries were reported, and studies suggest that long-term physical health effects from the accident have been negligible, though this has been contested. What is clear is that the accident spurred sweeping safety regulations. The damaged reactor on Three Mile Island was never restarted.
Nuclear plants often face opposition from environmentalists, as well as from representatives of competing industries like natural gas. But some Pennsylvania residents, including the nearly 700 workers at the facility, were not happy about the pending closure.
"I think it's a sad moment for all," said Richard Drey, the business manager for a local chapter of an electric workers' union, which represents about 200 people who work at the facility. "We thought there was still hope in keeping the place open. It's going to have a devastating effect on some of the families." (Exelon said it would offer jobs to workers who were willing to relocate.)
The plant on Three Mile Island, which sits in the Susquehanna River near Middletown in central Pennsylvania, has been struggling financially for years. Exelon announced as early as 2017 that it would close down the plant "absent needed policy reforms." Supporters of nuclear energy went after those reforms: Two bills were introduced in the State Legislature that would have steered about $ 500 million to clean power producers in Pennsylvania, with nuclear plants as the main beneficiaries.
That might have kept Three Mile Island open, but no action was taken on the measures.
Accidents like the one at Three Mile Island make it difficult for nuclear power facilities to present themselves as clean and safe, even though they do not generate planet-warming greenhouse gases. And cheap natural gas from hydraulic fracturing has forced some American nuclear reactors to cease operations.
With these closures comes a new problem: What to do with all of the hazardous waste?
"Nobody believes an island is a suitable site to store radioactive waste," said Eric Epstein, the chairman of Three Mile Island Alert, a nuclear watchdog group based in Harrisburg, Pa., that was founded two years before the 1979 accident. He said the cleanup efforts on the island should be prioritized, which could bring employment opportunities to people losing their jobs.
"This is not a time for celebration," he said. "It's a time for a reality check. When it comes to nuclear, and cleaning up plants, we're entering a really long and challenging phase."
According to the World Nuclear Association, a London-based group that promotes nuclear power, there are 98 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. Last year, they accounted for 20 percent of the country's total electricity output. In Pennsylvania, there are four other power plants operating outside of Three Mile Island.
After the shutdown on Three Mile Island, fuel -- the radioactive material generating heat inside of the nuclear reactor -- will be moved into a pool of water. A few years after that, the fuel will be moved into dry storage, where it could stay indefinitely or until the federal government takes ownership of the material.
The facility itself will be given decades to cool down, until it is safe for people to dismantle the structures. Exelon estimates that the plan to dismantle large components won't begin until 2074.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: White House launches new uphill battle to overhaul immigration
WASHINGTON — Reviving a deeply contentious issue that has stymied both Congress and the administration, the White House launched a new bid on Tuesday to overhaul a legal immigration system that President Donald Trump has long railed against.
Though similar efforts have failed to garner anywhere near the support necessary, Trump hopefully invited a dozen Republican senators to the White House to preview the plan, which was spearheaded by senior adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
It’s the result of an unusually methodical approach for an administration known for hastily written executive orders and Trump’s declarations by tweet. Kushner’s team has pulled in officials with experience in legislation-writing from outside the White House, including the Department of Homeland Security, to help with the drafting.
Still, the road to passage remains uphill. Democrats are likely to strongly disapprove of parts of the plan without significant concessions.
Newspaper: Trump lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994
WASHINGTON — The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Donald Trump’s businesses lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994, based on tax information the newspaper acquired.
The Times said it has acquired printouts from the future president’s official IRS tax transcripts, including figures from his federal tax form.
The newspaper said Trump reported business losses of $46.1 million in 1985, and a total of $1.17 billion in losses for the 10-year period.
After comparing Trump’s information with that of other “high-income earners,” the Times concluded that Trump “appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer.”
Because of his business losses, the newspaper reported, Trump did not pay income taxes for eight of the 10 years.
The House Ways and Means Committee has asked the IRS to provide Trump’s personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday refused to do so, saying the panel’s request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.”
U.S. official: Intel indicates Iran moved missiles by boat
WASHINGTON — The decision to send an aircraft carrier and a group of Air Force bombers to the Middle East was based in part on intelligence indications that Iran had moved short-range ballistic missiles by boat in waters off its shores, an American official said on Tuesday.
The movement, first reported by CNN, was among a range of recent indications that Iran might be considering or preparing to attack U.S. forces in the region, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive intelligence.
The official said it was not clear whether the boats with missiles represented a new military capability that could be used against U.S. forces or were only being moved to shore locations.
When the White House announced on Sunday that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force were being deployed to the Middle East, John Bolton, the national security adviser to President Donald Trump, cited “troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” but did not explain what they were.
Bolton said the movement of additional military firepower to the Middle East was meant to send a “clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on the United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.”
Can U.S., China salvage their talks and end trade war? WASHINGTON — Heightened trade tensions between the United States and China are spooking financial markets and putting a chill on prospects for the global economy.
Chinese officials are heading to Washington to try to salvage negotiations aimed at breaking an impasse between the world’s two biggest economies over Beijing’s aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance. The 11th round of talks is set for Thursday and Friday in Washington.
But their arrival is unlikely to stop the United States from going ahead with plans to raise import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese goods at 12:01 a.m. Friday, Eastern time, in a dramatic escalation of a yearlong trade war.
The dispute is upsetting investors. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 500 points on Tuesday afternoon after slipping modestly on Monday.
Here’s a look at what’s happening:
Top US diplomat makes secret Iraq trip amid Iran tensions
BAGHDAD — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a lightning visit Tuesday to Baghdad aimed at showing support for the Iraqi government as the United States has been picking up intelligence that Iran is threatening American interests in the Middle East.
The top American diplomat’s unannounced trip to the Iraqi capital began and ended after nightfall under heavy security following the abrupt cancellation of a visit to Germany.
Journalists from The and other organizations accompanying Pompeo were not told of his new destination until his plane left for Baghdad and were not allowed to report on his whereabouts until after his plane had taken off for London.
The secretary told reporters on the flight that his meetings with Iraq’s president and prime minister were intended to demonstrate U.S. support for “a sovereign, independent” Iraq, free from the influence of neighboring Iran.
Pompeo also said he wanted to underscore Iraq’s need to protect Americans in their country.
Cash is still king: San Francisco bans credit-only stores
SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco officials voted on Tuesday to require brick-and-mortar retailers to take cash as payment, joining Philadelphia and New Jersey in banning a growing paperless practice that critics say discriminates against low-income people who may not have access to credit cards.
The vote by the Board of Supervisors was unanimous.
Supervisor Vallie Brown, who introduced the legislation, said it “will go far in ensuring all San Franciscans have equitable access to the city’s economy.”
Brown said she thought it unfair that someone couldn’t buy a sandwich just because they had cash. She said young people, victims of ID theft, immigrants and homeless people are among those who don’t have bank accounts or credit cards.
In many ways, the legislation was an easy call for San Francisco officials, who strive to make life more equitable in a city with an enormous wealth gap.
FCC warns of late-night phone scams
In the middle of the night, the calls come in waves, going silent after a ring or two. It’s no one you know, just someone who really wants you to call back. That’s the scam.
The Federal Communications Commission is warning consumers about robocallers who ring up targets, then abruptly hang up. Those who call back end up racking up charges that are mostly paid out to the scammers. It’s known as a “Wangiri” scam, Japanese for one-ring-and-cut.
“These calls are likely trying to prompt consumers to call the number back, often resulting in per minute toll charges similar to a 900 number,” the FCC said in an alert on Friday. “Consumers should not call these numbers back.”
To the unsuspecting person, the one-ring calls appear to be from someone in the United States, because the phone numbers begin with three digits that resemble American area codes. But the FCC says the scammers are using international numbers whose country codes also begin with three digits, making it easier to trick people.
The agency said the callers are using the country code of Mauritania, which shows up on phone screens as 222, and Sierra Leone, which is 232. The robocallers appear to be concentrating their efforts in New York and Arizona.

Texto completo: What started as a little ice cream shop with a cult following in Fort Myers is growing this month to its third location across Lee County.
Three years ago, Alicia Perez brought her particular brand of liquid nitrogen-made ice cream to Southwest Florida with the launch of Best Ice Cream Fort Myers near the Edison Park 8 cinemas on Winkler Avenue. In late 2017 she opened a second shop off Dani Drive once again showcasing her cool treats and whimsical style.
Now, she's started a third location in the Publix-anchored Summerlin Beach Place on Summerlin Road in south Fort Myers.
And this time she's got a new treat up her sleeve.
"Every single shop is a work of art," Perez said of the three locations. "Each one means something different. This new one is spreading love through travel."
In the new shop, Best Ice Cream Land, Perez has a map of the world on one wall where she encourages people to point out where they're from.
"In Fort Myers, there are so many people from so many places around the world," she said, "and ice cream is all over the world."
At the new shop, Perez continues to serve her original flavors using liquid nitrogen to make them on-the-spot. The liquid nitrogen technique means the ice cream doesn't sit around in frozen tubs, Perez said, which equals greater freshness.
In addition to favorite flavors from the other two locations, then new Best Ice Cream Land is debuting several unique flavors that Perez is still in the process of naming.
"I want to come up with something really catchy," she said.
The new shop will have an orange-dark-chocolate ice cream which features a vanilla base infused with pure orange extract and sprinkled with Ghirardelli chocolate chips. The "Rich and Famous" showcases a vanilla base swirled with thick caramel, chocolate chips and 24-karat edible gold leaf. The "Kaleidoscope" is vanilla bean ice cream swirled with rainbow sprinkles and edible glitter.
"That one's going to be really neat," Perez said.
In addition to her new ice cream flavors, Perez has a brand new treat at Best Ice Cream Land: homemade cinnamon rolls. Made from her own recipe, the cinnamon rolls are the product of lots of experimentation.
"I made batches and batches," Perez said. "I gave out a out a lot of free cinnamon rolls so people could try them."
And the result?
"They're so delicious, they're dangerous," she said, laughing. "They literally told me, 'This is the best cinnamon roll I've ever had.'"
The new shop's location is near two hotels, and Perez plans to offer a limited breakfast menu for travelers.
"When I'm traveling I usually look for a place nearby where I can have breakfast, something unique and different," she said.
The breakfast menu has Perez's homemade cinnamon rolls and fresh-baked cookies, plus strawberry-waffle kebabs sprinkled with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate or caramel. To drink, the shop offers fresh-squeezed orange juice as well as lattes and other coffee beverages.
"I think it's going to be really cool," she said. "People are going to love it."

Do Bennet or Hickenlooper even stand a chance in '20?

Texto completo: If two Colorado Democrats walk into an Iowa Pizza Ranch, and a dozen other Democrats also running for president have been there already, does anybody notice?
With Sen. Michael Bennet fending off prostate cancer following successful surgery in April, the Democrat is all in on his quest for the White House. So is former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.
Following Bennet's Thursday campaign announcement, two of Colorado's top Democrats are joining a intraparty battle royal for the right to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. And the similarities go deeper than that.
Both built political careers on pragmatic, reach-across-the-aisle affability but turned up the rhetorical heat with their White House aspirations. Bennet's campaign website highlights when he bashed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas on the Senate floor, and Hickenlooper broke from showering fully clothed in protest of negative campaigns to attacking Trump by name in the first two minutes of his kickoff speech.
Each won his first statewide race in 2010, despite a national red wave fueled by the Tea Party. Both make jokes about their last names: Bennet's Twitter bio notes his name has two Ns and one T, while Hickenlooper has a laugh-line in his stump speech about not having the best-known name in the primary, but "at four syllables and 12 letters," having the biggest name in the race.
Both would consider 3 percent a fantastic showing in preference polls.
So does either stand a chance of emerging from a field that already features: 2016's primary runner-up Sen. Bernie Sanders and his fervent fan base; fellow left-wing stalwart Sen. Elizabeth Warren; establishment favorite Sen. Kamala Harris; the nontraditional but quickly popular paths of South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former U.S. Rep. and Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke; or the literally dozen-plus other contenders?
Oh, and former Vice President Joe Biden — another moderate Democrat positioning himself as a blue-collar slugger — also jumped into the pool with enough aplomb that it threatened to sweep other candidates over the edge.
"If you're looking at campaign contributions, if you're looking at name recognition in the polls, if you're looking at all the standard metrics we use to assess the possibilities of candidates, it's just tough for anyone to get oxygen," Colorado State University political science professor Kyle Saunders said. "Especially when there are two or three presumptive front runners, depending on how you gauge them."
But, he added, "there's always a chance someone can catch a flash in the pan. You never know."
Neither Bennet's nor Hickenlooper's campaigns responded to requests for comment.
The Federal Elections Commission shows Hickenlooper with $2 million raised, which keeps him out of the top 10 of Democratic fundraising. Bennet's formal announcement Thursday means he's not even showing up on the FEC website yet. A recent CNN poll shows the two have a combined 0% support for the nomination among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents, while Biden rocketed to the top with 39% support. Sanders polled at No. 2 with 15%.
"The problem is, Biden sucks away a lot of that moderate-opposing-Trump space that Bennet and Hickenlooper would inhabit," Saunders said, noting that the VP tag on Biden helps him quite a bit with name recognition and the idea of succession. "Parties also turn to whoever's next. In 2016, they didn't. They decided to move toward Hilary Clinton, and now Biden can claim that mantle of, 'Well, you should have chosen me.'"
Saunders also questioned the overall viability of a moderate white straight man — any moderate white straight man — being able to secure the nomination in a party increasingly defined by its diverse coalition and eagerness to embrace women and minority candidates along with the populist politics of candidates like Sanders and Warren.
That said, nationwide Democrats haven't had as much time to get to know Bennet and Hickenlooper as they have others in the race, and a lot could happen between now and the June 26 and June 27 debates for up to 20 of the candidates. A lot can happen after the debates and the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, too, not to mention that the party doesn't formally pick its nominee for President until the July 2020 Democratic National Convention.
The upcoming debates will likely start to winnow the Democratic field, Saunders said. Hickenlooper already secured a spot, along with 16 others, thanks to clocking at least 1% on several polls, according to the New York Times. And if a candidate is able to score a few third-place victories in early caucus and primary states while the top spots sway among the others, that could signal viability despite lack of first-place finishes.
"Once you don't make the debate stage, and it's obvious you don't have a chance, those really, really lesser known candidates will start to fade," Saunders said. "But when will we start to see that winnowing down from 10 (candidates) to one? I'm not sure."
As for Hickenlooper and Bennet, Saunders is bearish on their chances in a field where attention is harder to come by than dollars. But then again, traditional indicators may not be as reliable as they once were, and there always remains the chance of one candidate grabbing the party's, and nation's, attention.
"If you ask someone in 2013 if Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2016, what would they say?" Saunders said. "They'd say Jeb Bush and his $100 million, and his exclamation point, was going to win."

Texto completo: The economy is expanding at a decent clip, inflation has been MIA for years, and the jobless rate is at its lowest level since ­Peter, Paul and Mary were at the top of the charts with “Leaving on a Jet Plane."
But the good news doesn't end there.
A quick perusal of the Internet yields so, so many examples­ of why, as the president tweeted last week, “AMERICA is now #1. We are the ENVY of the WORLD — and the best is yet to come!"
Here are just a few I found — ripped, as the say, straight from the headlines:
Income inequality increases to pre-Great Depression levels (Fortune)
The rich getting richer is proof positive that capitalism is working. Should the rich be getting poorer? Of course not. That wouldn't be progress, would it?
Plus, being stuck in the middle is really hard. You envy­ all the good things rich people enjoy — a health care plan with affordable deductibles, kids who aren't buried under $100k in student loans, a Prius — but know you'll never get them.
Meanwhile, the poor hate you for what you do have — like drinkable tap water, decent public schools, and trust in the police.
How global warming has made the rich richer (BBC)
Talk about a two-fer, a win-win, a daily double. First, see above. Second, to be honest, as I get older, New England winters are starting to lose their charm. Cranking up the snowblower at 5 in the morning isn't the thrill it used to be. Would I mind if our climate became more like, say, South Carolina's? Would I prefer to retire in a community that had South Carolina's climate but not the Confederate flags and white supremacy marches? Put me down as a definite maybe (while I figure out just how many feet above sea level my house is).
Stocks plunge as trade-war worries rattle investors (Business Insider)
One question: Would you prefer a real war or a war over tariffs with China? If you answered “real war" — or sold stock Tuesday — you should be ashamed of yourself.
One million species face extinction, UN report says (Washington Post)
C'mon, how many species of plants and animals do we need? How many can you even name? After homo sapiens and cannabis sativa, I am lost. Think how easy biology class would be for future generations with 40 percent fewer species to study. Should a master's in zoology really take six years? And do we really need all those snakes, scorpions, and killer bees? Make America safe again.
Nearly half of college students surveyed for a new report are going hungry (New York Times)
This absolutely breaks my heart. Colleges are admitting students who can't find the dining hall? Standards have really dropped. Sad. In my day, I lived off Domino's. (They took a check and would deliver to the dorm at 1 a.m., after we were done studying the effects of cannabis sativa.) These days there are so many options: GrubHub, DoorDash, the church soup kitchen. In the land of Super Stop & Shops with 42 varieties of cereal, how is campus hunger a real problem?
US won't escape the pain of Brexit (NBC News)
So true. The headlines just won't stop. How much do we want to read about the Irish backstop and that second-rate Margaret Thatcher called Theresa May? Let's face it, most Americans didn't even know Britain was part of Europe. The good news? We don't really care if Britain becomes a third-rate country. Wake me up when California votes to leave the United States.
Feds say we are all getting fatter (USA ­Today)
This is such good news, which is why I saved it for last. I am already living on the border between paunchy and obese. The more the rest of the country catches up with me, the better I will look at my high school reunion in November. I am tired of beating myself up for not going to the gym, for ordering Diet Coke with a double bacon cheeseburger when I really want a Guinness, and for sizing out of Abercrombie & Fitch.
I want more company when I shop at DXL.

Texto completo: Correction: **********CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION PUBLISHED MAY 8, 2019**********
Correction: A story on page A1 of Tuesday's edition cited a different DETER Act than the one U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio introduced in 2019. The Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines Act was introduced in April and would impose mandatory sanctions for foreign elections interference.
Correction: **************************************************************************
When U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson was castigated by his Republican challenger, Gov. Rick Scott, last year for saying Russian hackers had broken into Florida voting systems, Nelson's colleague Marco Rubio was aware of the breach.
But Rubio couldn't defend Nelson because he wasn't allowed to divulge classified information, a spokesman for the senator said.
Rubio, R-Miami, declined to be interviewed for this story.
Nelson, D-Orlando, warned last year about successful hacking attempts in 2016 but said he could not identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified.
No other senator backed him up, and Scott and fellow Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his "alarming claims" and "extremely reckless behavior."
Scott went on to defeat Nelson in the November election by just 10,033 votes in one of the closest and most expensive statewide races in Florida history.
The Mueller report released last month stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials "sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election."The FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was successfully infiltrated, the report said.
The emails contained an attached document with malicious "Trojan" software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer, the report stated.
Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee initially denied that any county was infiltrated, adding that the FBI had not told the state what county or counties it believed were hacked.
But Rubio on April 26 confirmed to The New York Times that such an intrusion occurred. Last week, Rubio said the hacking reached beyond the Sunshine State, telling news station NY1 that "the federal government has information not specific to Florida ... and is unable or unwilling to personally tell the individual counties that are affected what's happened to them for fear of losing access to that information, intelligence information in the future."
He added that while hackers couldn't directly change "the outcome of the election," they were in a position "to change voter databases."
Rubio's office said he was made aware of the 2016 attempts as early as May 2018.
While he couldn't reveal any classified information, he has been active in pushing measures to combat hacking. He backed the Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes, or DETER Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, which would have barred foreign citizens from the country who have sought to interfere in a U.S. election.
Rubio also introduced an amendment to provide security clearances to state and local elections officials, which did not become law but did spur Homeland Security to begin providing such clearances.
Nelson also said he was constrained as to what he could say about classified information. But he said in a statement to the Orlando Sentinel that Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Virginia, asked him and Rubio in June 2018 "to send a letter to the 67 county Supervisors of Election to warn them of Russian intrusion in Florida."
Nelson's statement added, "The Mueller report makes clear why we had to take that important step as well as my verbal warnings thereafter."
"It's clear that the election security concerns raised by Senator Nelson were legitimate," Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss said, blaming Republicans for "car[ing] more about playing partisan political games and mudslinging for their own gain than protecting the integrity of Florida's elections against foreign interference."
Scott's office has said he and Gov. Ron DeSantis have set up a meeting with the FBI in the next few weeks to discuss the hacking, and U.S. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Michael Waltz have also requested a briefing for the state's 27 members of Congress. Scott would not be interviewed for this story.
The identity of the county or counties infected has not been revealed. More than 50 counties used software from VR Systems, the company impersonated by the hackers.

In our opinion: Trump's tariff threats may be what China needs

Texto completo: Tariffs are not good for the U.S. economy. They lead to higher prices for imported goods and can negate any positive effect last year’s tax cuts might have had on the economy.
However, tariffs, or perhaps just the threat of imposing them, may be a worthwhile temporary cost of negotiating a good trade deal with China. A fair deal that could be verified and enforced ultimately would be best for the U.S. economy.
It’s significant to note that President Trump’s surprise attack on what looked to be an emerging deal this week has not been met by the usual partisan backlash in Washington. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for instance, tweeted for the president to “Hang tough on China,” adding, “Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”
Indeed, that appears to be true.
Of all the president’s provocative trade moves, and despite his apparent lack of understanding concerning the real impacts of a trade imbalance, his tough stance toward China may be exactly what is needed.
China forces American companies to hand over trade secrets if they want to do business there. The United States accuses Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company, of state-sponsored espionage in the development of 5G technology. These are high-stakes problems in the fight for global economic dominance.
That said, the administration’s latest move is risky.
President Trump embarked on a high-wire negotiation tactic Sunday when he tweeted his intention to raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods on Friday if the Chinese don’t get more serious about making concessions in ongoing talks over a new deal. He also threatened eventual tariffs on many more imports.
China might respond by discreetly giving in on some key points. Then again, it might stubbornly refuse to budge, for fear of appearing weak, call the president’s bluff and, should he follow through with these and other threatened tariffs, respond in kind.
But the United States, with the world’s largest economy and emerging dominance in the energy sector, holds the upper hand. The much-criticized trade imbalance also works in Washington’s favor. The U.S. imported $419.2 billion more from China than it exported in 2018. That makes U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods more impactful than what China might impose on U.S. goods.
China also has balked over terms regarding how existing tariffs might disappear, insisting the U.S. drop them as a condition for entering a deal. The administration, meanwhile, wants to drop them only after China demonstrates it will honor the terms of a deal — a much more practical solution that would hold China accountable.
As usual, it’s difficult to understand the true intent of President Trump’s negotiating tactics. He has used the threat of tariffs as a weapon in trade talks with many nations. Yet it’s not certain he has calculated what next steps to take should the tactic backfire.
As The New York Times reported Monday, American businesses already are complaining that they bear the brunt of the cost of tariffs, even though they generally support the administration’s need to negotiate a fair deal with China.
And yet China, with its emerging economy and its large population, is a market too big to ignore. A successful trade deal would be good for the U.S. economy. Utah businesses alone exported $704 million to China in 2017.
Getting tough may be the only way to convince China that this relationship can continue only if it is willing to compete fairly and honestly.

Texto completo: Ask a stranger or a friend, "Who was the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean by plane?" and, chances are, they'll confidently respond, "Charles Lindbergh."
But they would be wrong.
Though the aviator famously piloted his Spirit of St. Louis from Roosevelt Field, Long Island, to Paris, France, in 1927, Lindbergh's effort did not mark the first time someone had flown across the great blue divide - it was the first time someone achieved the feat alone. In fact, during the eight years prior to the Lindbergh pilgrimage, it's estimated that around 80 people had traversed the Atlantic by air.
Thus, the correct answer to the posed question is: "A crew of six U.S. Navy airmen, captained by Albert C. Read." And a hundred years ago next week, they took off from Queens.
"It was a big thing at the time," says Robert Schwach, who steered efforts behind an upcoming celebration of the flight. "It always bothered me being a history buff ... that very few people knew about it."
A ceremony honoring the Navy crew at Riis Landing, close to where their historic flight launched, is planned for May 8.
"We managed to contact a number of the crew's family members - grandchildren and great-grandchildren - and some of them are actually flying into New York for the centenary," said Schwach, deputy chief of staff for City Council member Eric Ulrich, who procured funding for the celebration.
The gathering doubles as a kickoff event for a monthlong exhibit devoted to the aviation achievement at Fort Tildon's T7 Gallery.
Ceremony attendees and exhibition  visitors might arrive at a new conclusion about travel history: Lindbergh, who benefitted from a marketing machine powered by improved film technology that better chronicled his transatlantic trip, often gets exaggerated credit.
During World War I, according to Schwach, the U.S. Navy established a series of stations along the Atlantic coast to monitor German submarine activity by air. Plane technology of the time only allowed pilots to fly about 100 to 150 miles offshore. When crewmembers spotted enemy subs, they'd sometimes toss bombs off the side of their plane into the water, hoping to disable the vessel or force it to flee. These missions helped American ships, carrying troops and supplies to the European front, navigate the ocean with less German interference.
"The Navy said, well, wait a minute. If we can build a plane ... that could make it across [the ocean] with a couple of stops, we could ferry equipment over by air and avoid the submarine threat," Schwach says.
So the Navy built four seaplanes - called NCs - with that goal in mind. But by the time they were ready for flight, the war had ended.
"There was a prize offered by the Daily Mail in London for the first non-governmental pilot to make it across the Atlantic," Schwach says. "So there were private groups trying to be the first to cross."
Though none of their pilots would qualify for the award, the Navy - backed by lobbying from Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt - felt they should put their new seaplanes to the test anyway.
On May 8, 1919, three of the four took off from Jamaica Bay for Europe. The NC-2 seaplane, damaged in test flights, was used for spare parts, and the NC-1 and NC-3 were plagued by radio and navigation problems from the start. Neither finished their flight, and both were damaged during ocean landings - though their crews survived. (The Navy had stationed ships across the ocean in case of emergencies and to help the pilots with navigation, but the NC-1 squad was actually picked up by a Greek freighter that happened to be in their crash area. And the NC-3 flew so far off course that its crew members had to endure 60 hours adrift at sea before finding their way into Horta Harbor, in the Azores.)
Even though the NC-4 itself went down 80 miles off the coast of Massachusetts, in need of repairs, it survived the ordeal and carried on. The NC-4 made several more stops along the way, but on May 27, the seaplane and its crew taxied into Lisbon Harbor, in Portugal.
"The arrival of the NC-4 at Lisbon marks the completion of the first transatlantic air flight in history, with the coveted honor going to a machine designed, built, and manned by Americans," wrote The New York Times, which, like other papers around the world, treated the story with front-page coverage.
"It's an amazing segment in New York City history in general," says Branka Duknic, executive director of the Queens Historical Society, which is helping to coordinate the anniversary celebration. "This side of our history is truly important for the younger generation to know."
Council member Eric Ulrich says part of his motivation in supporting the celebration comes from the fact that New Yorkers "need to tell our story, and we need to do a better job of telling our story to the rest of the country and to the world."
"I know how important Queens is and was," Ulrich continues. "Every other borough seems to have a leg up on telling their story, and the role that they played in American history and the history of the city. Queens [doesn't] always do a great job of telling our own story, and this is just one of many stories that I'm so appreciative of."
On top of Lindbergh's solo achievement eight years later, the reason Albert C. Read and his NC-4 crew are not more broadly remembered is because by June 15, 1919, two other men flew from Newfoundland to Ireland, across the shortest part of the Atlantic, nonstop. The pair were awarded the Daily Mail prize money in London by the British Secretary of State for War and Air, Winston Churchill, and were later knighted by King George V.
On Wednesday, May 8, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., exactly 100 years after the U.S. Navy's NC-4 took off, Ulrich will host a commemorative ceremony at the old Rockaway Coast Guard Station at Riis Landing. He will unveil a new street sign at Beach 169th Street at Rockaway Point Boulevard, which will be co-named "US Navy Seaplane Division One Way" to honor the all-but-forgotten NC-4 and it

Texto completo: Caroline Ann Paton (née Swenson), aged 86, of Sharon, CT died on March 18th, 2019. She was a singer of traditional and contemporary folk songs with a bright, beautiful voice, an amazing recall of lyrics, and a talent for harmony. She would often sing a cappella or accompany herself on the Appalachian dulcimer or the autoharp. In 1961, Caroline, her husband Sandy Paton, and business partner Lee Haggerty, founded Folk-Legacy Records in Huntington, VT. Folk-Legacy became her life's work and passion for the next 57 years. The Patons and Haggerty moved the business and their home to a large, remodeled barn with a concert hall, recording studio, and eight bedrooms on a rural hillside in Sharon, CT in 1967. In November of 2018, Folk-Legacy was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution which will preserve the label and its contributions to traditional folk music, culture, and history. Folk-Legacy's recordings are available in many formats, including vinyl LPs, cassettes, CDs, and online streaming. A full list of Folk-Legacy recordings is available on Folk-Legacy.com.
Folk-Legacy produced over 120 albums, capturing the music of a wealth of traditional singers from the Southern Appalachians to the Ozarks, and from Scotland and England to Canada. Folk-Legacy also contributed to the development of emerging American folk music by recording tradition-inspired contemporary folk singers, songwriters, and musicians over time since the 1960's including Rosalie Sorrels, Gordon Bok, Lorre Wyatt, and Bill Staines. The recordings are a major contribution to the preservation and development of the repertoire and culture of American folk music after the American Folk-Revival.
Caroline grew up in Whiting, Indiana near Chicago. She first became intrigued by folk music at summer camps where she was a counselor. By the time she started college her interest in folk music was well-established. She studied for two years at Oberlin College before transferring to the University of Chicago where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in anthropology.
Wanting to experience the Western United States, Caroline took a job at the University of California library in Berkeley, CA, at the same time exploring ways to pursue her interests in literature, music, and culture. She met her husband, Sandy Paton, at a concert in 1957 after she asked him for lyrics to the song he had performed that night. The song was "Perry Merry Dixi Domini," which is a variant of "The Riddle Song/I Gave My Love a Cherry" from Linscott's book Folk Songs of Old New England. They connected immediately over their love of folk music and soon after travelled to Britain, performing in clubs and studying British traditional folk songs.
Over the next fifty years, Caroline and Sandy brought music and joy to thousands through performances, special gatherings and sales of the traditional and contemporary folk recordings they produced. As performing artists, and in keeping with the folk tradition, the Patons encouraged the audience at their own concerts to sing along on choruses and be active participants in the folk music experience. The preference was, as they put it, "to sing with people, rather than at them." She and her husband Sandy Paton sang together for many years before being joined by their musical sons and singing grandchildren. Folk-Legacy's home-based operation and music was featured in the New York Times in 1981. The Patons were given the honorary designation of Connecticut's State Troubadours in 1993.
Caroline Paton is survived by her two sons David Paton and James Paton; daughter-in-law Marian Paton; siblings Victor, Edward, and Linda Swenson; grandchildren Linnea, Shannon, Juliana, Erik, and Hannah Paton; former daughter-in-law Catherine Paton, and great-granddaughter Adaline Paton-Marceau. She is predeceased by her husband Sandy Paton and grandson Kaelan Paton.
A potluck memorial will be held on May 12th at 2PM at Silver Lake Conference Center 223 Low Road in Sharon, CT. All are welcome to attend. RSVPs at folklegacyweekend.com are appreciated. Condolences for family and memorial contributions may be sent to Kenny Funeral Home at 41 Main Street Sharon, CT 06069.

Texto completo: Former FBI director James Comey published an op-ed last week asserting that President Trump has "eaten" Attorney General William Barr's "soul." Mr. Comey's piece is a remarkable exercise in question-begging -- a series of bald assertions that assume their own truth.
It begins with this rhetorical question: "How could Mr. Barr . . . start channeling the president in using words like 'no collusion' and FBI 'spying'?" If you don't already agree that Mr. Barr's words are outrageous and borderline-criminal, Mr. Comey makes no effort to bring you along. So it goes for another 800 words. The argument of the piece is identical to its premise: that Mr. Trump is a loathsome person and those who work for him -- with a few exceptions, including of course Mr. Comey -- are made corrupt. Media-savvy savant that he is, Mr. Comey knows that the typical reader of the New York Times, where the piece appeared, requires no persuasion on this point.
In that sense, Mr. Comey's op-ed nicely captures what ails present-day American liberalism. Its defining characteristic is a labored ignorance of the other side. Liberals frequently neither know nor care to learn what nonliberals think. Their own views predominate in the universities and media; why bother considering lesser ones? Liberals take the other side seriously mainly when it has the bad manners to win an election and hold power.
Conservatives have no such luxury. However angular and ignorant a right-of-center commentator may be, he can't ignore liberal opinion.
Turn your radio dial back and forth between NPR and talk radio. On NPR, references to conservatives and conservatism are few and awkward. The word "conservative" often attaches to people very few conservatives recognize as ideological associates, from centrist liberals like David Brooks to eccentric figures like Steve Bannon. Mostly conservatives and conservatism are absent, except perhaps in the form of a guest who "served in the George W. Bush administration" or in references to Republican officeholders.
On talk radio, by contrast, "the left" is vividly ubiquitous. The typical host won't go five minutes without referring to liberals by name and to liberalism as the hegemonic force they're struggling against. The prevailing view of liberalism is wildly oversimplified and exaggerates its power, but liberals can't complain that these right-wingers ignore them. Talk radio is obsessed with what liberals think.
Neither is a healthy attitude, but conservatives at least do liberals the courtesy of acknowledging their existence. Liberals often won't even acknowledge that they are liberals, since to do so would be to countenance the legitimacy of conservatives, who are best left to the nebulous realm of speculation.
It is the peculiar failing of highly educated elites to believe that their own views need no defense and have no opponents worth thinking about. Once you take that attitude, you're a soft touch for duplicitous self-promoters such as a certain former FBI director.

Texto completo: Cinco de Mayo isn't just about the margaritas. Celebrate Mexico's culture and heritage with something filling, like a plate of easy, cheesy enchiladas.
This recipe is made with pantry ingredients and can be on the table in less than a half-hour. I used ancho chile powder, a mild but wonderfully smoky powder made from dried ground poblano peppers, but any variety would work. The original recipe calls for frying tortillas in hot oil before filling, but I prefer to simply heat them on a hot skillet.
For sauce
¼ cup neutral oil, like canola, or lard, chicken or beef fat
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1½ teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
½ teaspoon dried oregano, ideally Mexican
2 tablespoons chile powder
2 cups chicken broth, ideally homemade or low-sodium
For enchiladas
½ cup neutral oil, like canola
12 yellow corn tortillas
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or mixture of 1½ cups Cheddar and 1½ cups American cheese, like Velveeta
1 white onion, diced
Prepare chili gravy: In a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat, heat oil or fat until it begins to shimmer. Whisk in flour and stir continuously until it's a light brown roux, about 10 minutes.
Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, oregano and chile powder and whisk to combine. Continue whisking for another minute or so until roux becomes fragrant.
Add chicken broth, slowly, ½ cup at a time, whisking until sauce begins to thicken. Turn heat to low and let sauce simmer 15 minutes more. Add broth as needed to adjust gravy's thickness. Keep warm.
Heat oven to 450 degrees. Ladle about ½ cup chili gravy into an 8-by-13-inch baking pan and spread it out a little.
Prepare tortillas: Heat oil until it shimmers in medium sauté pan over medium-high heat. Heat a tortilla for 10-15 seconds a side until soft and lightly browned.
Roll a few tablespoons of cheese into each tortilla, then place it seam-side down in pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas, working quickly. Nestle each one against the last.
Ladle chili gravy over the top of rolled tortillas and sprinkle remaining cheese over the top.
Transfer to oven and bake until sauce bubbles and cheese is melted, 10-15 minutes. Sprinkle chopped onions over top and serve immediately.
Serves 4-6.

The performance is part of Lawrence University's 2018-19 Jazz Series.
Cohen has drawn huge praise for her expressive virtuosity and delightful stage presence. JazzTimes says, "With the clarinet she becomes a singer, a dancer, a poet, a mad scientist, laughing — musically — with the sheer delight of reaching that new place, that new feeling, with each chorus."
An established bandleader and prolific composer, the Anat Cohen Quartet program is a blend of modern and traditional jazz, classical music, Brazilian choro, Argentine tango, and an expansive timeline of Afro-Cuban styles.
She's been named Clarinetist of the Year by DownBeat, JazzTimes, and the Jazz Journalists Association. Fresh Air's Terry Gross credits Cohen with "bringing the clarinet to the world" and The New York Times calls her a "master."

Taxing the Rich Is Harder Than It Sounds

Texto completo: The hot policy in Democratic circles these days is raising taxes on the rich. Senator Elizabeth Warren has a plan to tax "ultramillionaires," as she calls them. Senator Bernie Sanders wants to expand the estate tax. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated raising the top income tax rate to 70 percent for those making over $ 10 million a year.
But before this country raises taxes, it should grapple with something much more prosaic but equally important for tackling inequality: saving the Internal Revenue Service.
Already, wealthy people and corporations easily get around today's rules. However tough any new laws might seem, they'd soon be undercut.
Slowly and quietly over the past eight years, the I.R.S. has been eviscerated. It's lost tens of thousands of employees. It has fewer auditors now than at any time since 1953. In real dollars, the agency's budget has dropped by almost $ 3 billion since 2010.
Businesses and the wealthy benefit the most from this state of affairs. The largest corporations in America used to be audited every year. That started to change when the cuts began, and today, the audit rate has fallen by half. It's a similar story for individuals making $ 10 million or more a year: With twice the chance of escaping I.R.S. scrutiny, the ultrarich are much less likely to lose at the game of audit roulette.
Fixing the problem will require more than increasing the I.R.S.'s budget (though that would certainly help). It's about having the right personnel with the right skills. Today, the wealthy and corporations have the I.R.S. outgunned. The ultra-affluent -- with the help of legions of tax professionals -- make domestic income disappear overseas or hide it in a pyramid of partnerships. It's like trying to take on a modern army while armed with spears and clubs.
The I.R.S. has difficulty tracing the income of the superwealthy or countering their sophisticated arguments about why what appears to be one type of income is actually something else. The agency also has trouble valuing their assets (a problem that, as The Times revealed, dates back at least to when Fred Trump was misleading the I.R.S. about how much his buildings were worth). By the public admission of numerous I.R.S. officials, it has long done a poor job of scrutinizing complicated partnerships to understand who owns what portion of what stock.
The top 0.5 percent of highest-earning Americans account for about a fifth of the income that's hidden from the I.R.S., according to a University of Michigan study, or more than $ 50 billion a year in today's dollars.
It's much easier to enforce the tax laws for the bottom 90 percent of earners. Wages are reported straight to the I.R.S., and computers can easily check that tax returns accurately report that income. This means that inadequate enforcement of the tax laws necessarily has a regressive effect, liberating those at the top from scrutiny while the masses continue to be tracked by machines.
With its budget slashed, the I.R.S. has pulled back across the board -- except for one area where it's been easier to keep the numbers from falling so much: audits of the poor. More than one-third of all audit targets claim the earned-income tax credit, one of the nation's largest anti-poverty programs. By the hundreds of thousands, I.R.S. computers spit out letters that require low-income taxpayers to prove their eligibility. The counties with the highest audit rates aren't found in the hedge fund precincts of Connecticut or the lobbyist enclaves of Northern Virginia. No, they're rural, mostly African-American counties in the Deep South.
There's nothing easy about auditing the rich. Even when the I.R.S. has evidence of flat-out cheating, such as when it discovers a hidden Swiss bank account, it can take years of work to prove its case. Taking that kind of time clashes with one of the core ways the I.R.S. evaluates its managers and agents: how efficiently they open and close audits. As one senior manager put it to us, "If you're not churning out the exams, you have to explain why you're not."
But more often, the affairs of the superwealthy are infernally complicated and the I.R.S. doesn't have black-and-white proof of evasion. Instead, the agency runs up against what's called "aggressive" planning in the tax world. To the rich, tax returns are just opening offers to the government. If they don't get audited, that's great. If they do, well, they're ready for a fight.
In 2009, the I.R.S. decided to take a bold, new approach to auditing the superwealthy. The agency's idea was to bring specialists together and form a kind of green-eyeshade-wearing Delta Force. It would finally do something it -- surprisingly -- hadn't been doing before: look at the entirety of a taxpayer's empire. That meant examining how his partnerships, limited liability companies, foundations, gifts and overseas operations interact with one another. The ultrarich weave all of these together so that they end up with an ultralow effective tax rate. "We hadn't really been looking at it all together, and shame on us," Steven Miller, a former acting commissioner of the I.R.S., told us.
Because of budget cuts and lobbying, this elite force never came together. The agency hoped to have a staff of about 240 expert auditors by 2012. But by 2014 it had only 96, and by last year the number had fallen to 58. Initially spooked by the group's ambition, tax professionals who counsel the wealthy now speak of the effort with a kind of pity.
Criminal tax enforcement has also faltered. More than 150 million income tax returns were filed in 2017, but the I.R.S. brought fewer than 800 cases in which someone was charged with making legal income but criminally evading taxes. That's one reason tax cheats can get away with brazen behavior for so long -- until they attract the attention of federal investigators for other reasons. That's what happened to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, and the celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, who was charged with failing to file taxes at all for several years. (Mr. Avenatti denies the charges.)
So, what to do? One 2020 candidate already has a bold proposal to resuscitate the I.R.S. It's a plan to pump tens of billions into the agency, enough to fund a second army of agents. That candidate's name is Donald Trump.
Of course, it was Mr. Trump's party that gutted the agency, costing the country, we estimate, more than $ 100 billion in lost revenue. The president's 2020 budget, however, did propose adding $ 15 billion over 10 years to the I.R.S. enforcement budget, a move that would more than double the agency's overall budget. The administration estimated this would produce revenue of at least $ 47 billion. The question arises: Has the administration genuinely had a change of heart? Or is this merely a neat trick to make deficit projections appear smaller?
So far, this is all just talk. It is, though, one of the few areas where Mr. Trump and Democrats are in substantive agreement. Democrats in the House recently proposed a $ 400 million I.R.S. budget increase next year.
Among the Democratic presidential candidates, Ms. Warren does mention the I.R.S. in her wealth tax proposal. She calls for an unspecified but "significant increase in the I.R.S. enforcement budget" and a minimum audit rate for taxpayers subject to her "ultramillionaire" tax.
Raising taxes on the rich is a more compelling cause than increasing the operating budget of a bureaucracy most American voters probably hate thinking about. But the boldest tax plan of all starts with salvaging the I.R.S.

Texto completo: If you are a follower of New Jersey Maritime Museum articles, you have no doubt read about the role Casimir Pulaski played in helping Gen. George Washington defeat the British.
Locally, at the Battle of Chestnut Neck, fought on Oct. 6, 1778, the British raided the location of American privateers along the Mullica River destroying homes, buildings, ships and supplies.
Chestnut Neck was an important trading center during the early part of the Revolution. The Mullica River, once known as the Little Egg Harbor River, soon turned into to the home of American privateers. They would sail out and seize British vessels, taking the cargo back to Chestnut Neck. The boats would either be burned or used by the privateers. Confiscated supplies were often barged up to The Forks, and then shipped by land to Washington's troops at Valley Forge.
British Gen. Henry Clinton had become exasperated by the 18 ships captured by the Americans; so he decided to "clean out that nest of rebel pirates." Fifteen British vessels headed from New York to the Chestnut Neck area. Having been warned ahead of time, most settlers left, moving inland with their confiscated cargos and personal goods. The attack was a short one as word spread that Count Casimir Pulaski was on his way with 250 men.
On Oct.15th, 1778, the Massacre at Little Egg Harbor (or Affair at Little Egg Harbor as it is often called) occurred when British forces brutally attacked at night, killing everyone at an outpost as they slept. But the British withdrew before Pulaski's main force arrived. Privateers resumed their activities and rebuilt the warehouses at Chestnut Neck. In short, the British outcome was not what they expected, as no vessels were captured and few supplies recovered from the Privateers.
Born in Poland, Pulaski was one of the Revolutionary War figures fighting under Washington who is thought of as a true hero. Many events, roads and bridges have been named in his honor. He is remembered as "The father of the American Cavalry."
There is a monument in his memory in Little Egg Harbor. He is a true patriot in our area, and admired in Catholic and Polish American communities.
Pulaski will now be remembered for another thing according to the Smithsonian Channel, which has produced a documentary for America's Hidden Stories titled "The General was Female?" NBC, USA Today, the New York Times and other publications also have picked up on the story. Is the following true or false news?
New evidence in the last few years suggests that Pulaski may not have been a man, but a woman or maybe intersex. According to the New York Times, "The famed general was most likely intersex. New evidence suggests that although Pulaski identified and lived as a man, he did not fit into the binary definitions of male and female, a twist that helps explain why scientists could not previously identify his remains.
"The discovery offers historical representation to people who are intersex, a group that has often been stigmatized and overlooked throughout history. About one in 2,000 people is born with ambiguous genitalia, which can lead doctors to perform what advocates say are unnecessary and harmful surgeries according to the Intersex Society of North America.
"But intersex also includes a variety of conditions, and many more people have subtler variations in sex anatomy which may manifest itself later in life, or not at all. Some estimates suggest that about 1.7 percent of the population has intersex traits, making such characteristics about as common as having red hair."
Or was Count Pulaski a woman? When his remains were studied, his skeleton looked very small, like a woman's. The pelvic bones were those a woman would have; there was also a rounded jaw and delicate face. But "the skeletal record is consistent with an individual who rode horses and sustained battle injuries" according to USA Today.
As Brer Rabbit might have said "Oh my, oh my."
The Smithsonian Channel documentary shows how an intersex person might have lived over 200 years ago.
Pulaski was born as a son, baptized as one, in addition to having facial hair and a receding hairline before dying during the Battle of Savanah in 1779. DNA evidence from Pulaski's great niece was a match for the bones of Pulaski when his remains were dug up from his Savannah monument. He was thought to have been only 5-feet-1 to 5-feet-4. He never married, though once had a lady friend.
The philosophy of the New Jersey Maritime Museum is that history should always be shared. So we are sharing the above with our readers. But is this all really necessary?
The best thing to remember about Count Casimir Pulaski is that he played a big part in defeating the British, was a charismatic leader, and died at the young age of 34.
Would America be free today without him? A researcher quoted in the New York Times sums Pulaski's identity by saying, "Arguably, if urologists had tried to 'fix; Pulaski's body, the U.S. could still be a British colony."
Chestnut Neck and Little Egg Harbor would be under British control.

Martin Kilson, pioneering African-American professor at Harvard, dies at 88

Texto completo: Martin Kilson, a leftist scholar, fierce debater, and follower of W.E.B. Du Bois who became the first tenured African-American professor at Harvard, died April 24 in hospice care in Lincoln. He was 88.
His wife, Marion Dusser de Barenne Kilson, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
A son of a Methodist minister, Dr. Kilson was a prolific writer, an expert on ethnic politics in Africa and the United States, and a mentor to generations of students, among them the writer, teacher, and philosopher Cornel West.
He also found vigorous public debate irresistible during his nearly 40 years as a professor of government at Harvard.
“Lord, oh, Lord, Brother Kilson loved combat," West told The New York Times.
Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor, writer, and filmmaker, told the Times that Dr. Kilson “prided himself on the role of the gadfly, challenging hierarchies, speaking truth to power and arguing against the grain, all in the name of the pursuit of veritas."
Dr. Kilson, an avowed integrationist, was already teaching courses in African politics in the 1960s when black students were starting to assert themselves on predominantly white campuses like Harvard.
“Naturally, the Negro wants to lay down the conditions and call the shots, something done for him by the white liberal in an earlier day," Dr. Kilson told The Harvard Crimson in 1964. “His friendship is not spurned but merely held in abeyance, giving us both time to think over what is going on inside and outside of us."
Dr. Kilson was a faculty sponsor of the Harvard-Radcliffe Association of African and Afro-American Students. But after the university's Afro-American studies department was established in 1969, he became disenchanted with its governance, criticizing it as lacking academic rigor and maintaining that it had become an enclave for radical black students.
“Black solidarity forces are distinctly anti-intellectual and anti-achievement in orientation," he wrote in a provocative 1973 essay about Harvard for The New York Times Magazine. “They indulge in the 'black magic' of nationalism, believing that miracles are possible if Negroes display fidelity to black nationalism or separatism and its anti-white attitudes, rituals and symbols."
Dr. Kilson argued that the radical politics of separatists was an academic dead end.
“It took extraordinary courage in 1969 to challenge Black Panther and black power rhetoric," the Rev. Eugene Rivers III, a former student of Dr. Kilson's, told the Times. “And he was right."
But critics of the professor — including Ewart Guinier, the founding chairman of the Afro-American studies department — disagreed with both his methodologies and his conclusions.
During a debate broadcast by a New York City television station in late 1973, Guinier was scornful of Dr. Kilson, saying he “shouts loudly about rigorous thought, standards and superior white universities, all the while encouraging people to think of him as a major scholar."
Dr. Kilson responded, “I am certainly not as much of an ideologue as Ewart Guinier."
Decades later, in “A Companion to African American Studies" (2016), edited by Lewis Gordon and Jane Ann Gordon, Dr. Kilson wrote that Harvard's Afro-American studies department did not flower until the 1990s, when Gates became its chairman.
He described Gates as a “top-rank academic-entrepreneurial black scholar."
In 2002, Dr. Kilson challenged Randall L. Kennedy, a distinguished African-American professor at Harvard Law School, over the title of Kennedy's book “Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."
Writing in Black Commentator, an online journal, Dr. Kilson called the use of the epithet an insult to black people and to former Harvard teachers like Du Bois, Ralph J. Bunche, and John Hope Franklin. He suggested that Kennedy's goal was to “assist white Americans in feeling comfortable" in their use of the epithet.
Kennedy told The Crimson that Dr. Kilson “seems to think that all of America has the same view of this term. This view is palpably incorrect. How does he know what my motive is?"
The two did not speak for a long time, but “a couple of years ago, I saw him at a gathering and we embraced," Kennedy told the Times. “I was glad to see him, and I'd like to think he was glad to see me."
He added that “being castigated by Dr. Kilson was a rite of passage."
In 1979, Dr. Kilson became one of the first professors to be accused in a formal complaint of sexual harassment in the years after Harvard instituted procedures for filing such complaints, the Globe reported at the time.
Harvard reprimanded Dr. Kilson for sexually harassing a freshman woman during his office hours. “I committed an act of impropriety," he told the Globe that December.
He said he did not intend to offend the student. “My general affectionate air could be misinterpreted," Dr. Kilson said.
The student told the Globe that he patted her hair, kissed the top of her head, and tried to kiss her on the lips during a visit to his office in November.
Henry Rosovsky, a Harvard dean, required Dr. Kilson to write a letter of apology to the student.
Martin Luther Kilson Jr. was born on Feb. 14, 1931, in East Rutherford, N.J., and grew up in Ambler, Pa., a factory town.
His mother, Louisa (Laws) Kilson, was a homemaker. Martin Sr. was not the only minister in the family; there were preachers on both sides, including young Martin's great-great-grandfather, Isaac Lee, a freed black who founded an African Methodist Episcopal church in Maryland in 1848.
Dr. Kilson encountered Du Bois, the pioneering urban sociologist who was a founder of the NAACP, as a freshman at Lincoln University, a historically black college in Oxford, Pa. Du Bois had come to the campus to encourage its students to become part of the educated, community-based black leadership he called “The Talented Tenth," calling on them to help improve the lives of needy black people.
Du Bois remained an influence throughout Dr. Kilson's career. In his book “Transformation of the African-American Intelligentsia, 1880-2012" (2014), he wrote that “it is a moral imperative for today's variant of Du Bois's 'Talented Tenth' to mobilize its new socioeconomic and political resources to help ameliorate some of the social crises that now plague about 40 percent of African-American families."
After receiving his master's and doctorate in political science from Harvard, he did field work in Sierra Leone under a Ford Foundation fellowship, studying the political system in that country as it shifted from British control to independence in 1961.
When he returned to the United States that year, he became a research associate at Harvard's Center for International Affairs. Harvard hired him as a lecturer in 1962. He was named an assistant professor two years later and granted tenure in 1968.
“He took a lot of pride in that accomplishment," his daughter Hannah Kilson told the Times. “But it isn't what made him a decent person. He was a decent man with a strong moral compass that guided and informed us, and a sharp tongue and a sharp pen."
Dr. Kilson served as the Frank G. Thomson professor of government at Harvard from 1988 to 1999, when he retired from teaching.
In addition to his wife, a social anthropologist and college administrator, and his daughter Hannah, Dr. Kilson leaves another daughter, Jennifer Kilson-Page; a son, Peter; six grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and a sister, Gwendolyn Coleman.
West and Rivers recalled Dr. Kilson as a curmudgeonly mentor who nurtured scholars like them over long conversations, often at dinner at his house near Harvard or at his summer home in New Hampshire.
“So many of us wouldn't exist without him," West said.
Acolytes, he said, were drawn to his “joy in the life of the mind, his discipline, his rigor, his unbelievable devotion and his sharing of that with young people."

Raise vaping age to 21? First, read the fine print

Texto completo: With vaping epidemic among teens, there is a push on in the Arizona Legislature to raise the age to buy both tobacco and e-cigarettes to 21.
Before you parents break out in cheers, however, beware the smoke ... or, in this case, the vapor, being blown smack into your face. The biggest cheerleaders for the bill are:
Juul Labs, the San Francisco-based electronic cigarette manufacturer that burst onto the scene with its high-nicotine product in 2015, becoming the drug of choice for America's youth.
Altria, the tobacco company that owns Phillip Morris and late last year paid Juul $12.8 billion for a 35% stake in the e-cigarette company.
And the Vapor Technology Association, the e-cigarette industry's trade association.
In fact, they are pushing what are known as "Tobacco 21" bills across the nation. With a hook, of course. (More on that in a minute.)
"This is nothing more than Big Tobacco trying to find the next generation of customers," Sen. Heather Carter told me. "It's about the next generation for the tobacco industry. It's a bad sequel that should never be written."
Rep. John Allen, the front man for Senate Bill 1147, apparently isn't all that curious about why the tobacco/vaping industry would want to limit sales of its own products. He says passing a T21 law should be the Legislature's biggest priority.
"I think it's passable and signable," he told Arizona Mirror's Jeremy Duda. "And I don't think the other one is. So, I think that this is probably the best path to getting vaping off of our school campuses," he said.
"The other one" being the bill sponsored by Carter, his seatmate, and endorsed by the public health industry and various school associations.
Carter's House Bill 2357 would reclassify e-cigarettes and similar products as tobacco products, bringing Arizona in line with federal law and closing a loophole that allows vaping products to be sold online to minors.
Her bill also would ban vaping in public buildings, provided three-fourths of the Legislature agrees.
Naturally, her bill is opposed by the vaping industry, which contends that vaping products aren't tobacco, are far less dangerous than tobacco and thus should not be regulated like tobacco.
Carter's bill, originally Senate Bill 1009, passed the Senate unanimously, only to hit a brick wall in the House Health and Human Services Committee. Instead, the industry is pushing Allen's bill.
"Our goal as an industry is to reduce the harms that combustible tobacco causes to all Arizonans, and a large part of that is protecting our youth," said Steve Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Smoke Free Business Alliance, a vaping industry trade association. "The provisions of SB 1147 will do that in a far more comprehensive way than anything else the Legislature has looked at in this session or anything previous."
If the goal is truly to protect our youth, there's a way to do that. Just offer a bill that raises the age requirement and imposes strict penalties for those who act as kids' suppliers. But this bill doesn't do that.
A spokesman for Juul Labs says the company would support a straight-up bill that raises the minimum age from 18 to 21.
"We prefer to support Tobacco 21 as standalone legislation and support enacting these laws as quickly as possible to combat youth usage," Juul spokesman Ted Kwong said, via email. "In Arizona, we support any effort to increase the minimum purchasing age from 18 to 21. SB 1147 as amended is the only bill that has had a hearing and provided us an opportunity to publicly support. We hope Tobacco 21 becomes the statewide standard in Arizona this legislative session."
I hope so, too — as long as the bill doesn't have strings attached as SB 1147 does.
The vaping industry is pushing T21 bills across the country in exchange for heading off harsher restrictions.
The New York Times reports that Juul's "80-plus lobbyists in 50 states" are using these "Tobacco 21" bills as a front — adding in restrictions that would block local governments from adopting strict tobacco and vaping controls and to ensure that any bills that discourage youth vaping aren't strictly enforced.
Allen's bill would make it a class 3 misdemeanor for a retailer to sell to those under 21. That's on a par with loitering and two steps below littering. His bill also would preempt local governments from imposing restrictions on the sale or marketing of tobacco or vaping products.
Things like charging a licensing fee on tobacco/vape retailers or a local tax on their products.
Things like dictating that tobacco/vape shops can't be located near schools, though the vaping industry plans to offer an amendment that would allow cities to impose "reasonable" zoning requirements.
Things like whatever else cities or counties may dream up to discourage youth vaping in light of the current epidemic of use in middle schools and high schools across America.
Tucson's license fee on tobacco retailers — the one it has had for 20 years? Gone in a puff of smoke if SB 1147 passes.
"They don't really want T21," Carter told me. "They want preemption and they're using T21 as a smoke-and-mirrors tactic to get statewide preemption."
Here is how you know a bill from the nicotine industry to try to limit the sale of nicotine products is a smokescreen.
Among those who oppose it: the Arizona Public Health Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, the Arizona Academy of Family Physicians, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, the Arizona Nurses Association, the Arizona School Boards Association, Children's Action Alliance and the League of Arizona Cities and Towns, whose members would like to protect your kids from becoming future customers of Phillip Morris.
"Basically, you're either on side of public health advocates or you're on the side of Big Tobacco," Carter said. "It's that black and white."

Texto completo: Woody Allen shopped around a manuscript for his new memoir, but publishers didn't want anything to do with it.
A New York Times report detailed how executives at multiple publishing houses rejected Allen's memoir that he tried to sell late last year largely due to his increasing persona non grata status.
A-list actors, producers and publishers once flocked to Woody Allen projects, but the directing icon's reputation has suffered in the wake of the #MeToo movement. As greater attention has been paid to allegations of Allen molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7, Hollywood has distanced itself from the auteur. Amazon has shelved his most recent film "A Rainy Day in New York" and several actors have either expressed regret over working with the director or vowed never to work with him again, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Timothee Chalamet.
According to the New York Times, some publishing executives described working with Allen as "toxic" in the #MeToo era.
In Europe, Allen's reputation is somewhat less tarnished, and he is in pre-production on a film with a Spanish producer.
Writer and longtime friend of Allen, Daphne Merkin, told the Times that Allen had been working on the memoir for a long time. "He's not one to set the record straight, but presumably, the memoir is his side of things," she said. "He's the kind of person who soldiers on, and someone whose work is his nutrient."

Texto completo: The Trump family's personal bankers, faced with a choice between alienating a client who holds the world's most powerful office or snubbing lawmakers armed with subpoenas, caught a last-minute break from the unlikeliest of places: a federal lawsuit by the president himself.
The claim, filed by President Trump, three of his children, and his companies in federal court in New York City on April 29, effectively shifts responsibility to the judiciary for deciding whether the legislative branch's constitutional duty of overseeing the chief executive includes the right to see his financial records.
That's good news for Deutsche Bank and Capital One, the lenders named in the suit, according to Ira Matetsky, a partner at Ganfer, Shore, Leeds, and Zauderer with decades of experience in corporate law. The banks can now say, "We will abide by whatever the court instructs us to do," he told the Washington Examiner. "That makes it a lot easier."
The House Intelligence and Financial Services committees have sought the banks' records amid inquiries into whether Trump's business dealings as a real estate developer and entertainer pose conflicts of interest in his current position.
[Related: Trump sues Deutsche Bank, Capital One to counter House subpoenas]
The president, who has promised to fight all subpoenas from the Democrat-controlled House, says their only goal is to undo an election that he won.
"We just went through the Mueller witch hunt," Trump told reporters in late April. "I thought after two years we’d be finished with it. No. Now the House goes and starts subpoenas. They want to do every deal I’ve ever done."
In the lawsuit against Deutsche, whose U.S. operations are based in New York, and Capital One, headquartered in McLean, Va., Trump argues that the subpoenas are unenforceable because Congress overstepped its authority by starting an investigation unrelated to potential legislation.
Further, he and his children — Ivanka Trump, now a White House adviser, and Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who run the Trump Organization in their father's absence — claim the subpoenas violate the federal Right to Financial Privacy Act, which would require that they be given copies of the subpoenas and offered 10 days to object to them.
[Also read: No one testifies: Trump says the White House is fighting 'all the subpoenas']
That law, however, cites judicial and administrative subpoenas, not those issued by Congress, which the Supreme Court held in 1975 are constitutionally protected from interference by other branches of government when they involve legislative duties.
In Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen's Fund, the court noted that a subpoena from the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security for the fund's bank account records couldn't be challenged on the basis of an improper motive since the Constitution doesn't allow outside agencies to make such a determination.
The matter nonetheless took five years to move through the federal court system. If Trump's lawsuit were to stretch out over the same period, the House wouldn't be able to evaluate his finances before the 2020 election, which critics say is the president's goal.
"This lawsuit is not designed to succeed; it is only designed to put off meaningful accountability as long as possible," U.S. Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairmen of the House Financial Services and Intelligence committees respectively, said in a joint statement afterward.
"As a private businessman, Trump routinely used his well-known litigiousness and the threat of lawsuits to intimidate others, but he will find that Congress will not be deterred from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities," they added.
Capital One didn't return a message seeking comment on the subpoenas. Deutsche is committed to "providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations," said spokeswoman Kerrie McHugh.
Financial disclosure forms Trump filed in 2017 showed at least $130 million in outstanding loans from Deutsche Bank, which the New York Times says has lent him well over $2 billion.
One of the only large Wall Street firms willing to do business with the president, whose companies have a history of bankruptcies, Deutsche was fined $425 million by New York's banking regulator in January 2017, the same month Trump took office.
The state Department of Financial Services said a "mirror trading" scheme between offices in Moscow, London, and New York had laundered $10 billion from Russia, which the bank missed numerous opportunities to halt.
Four months later, Waters, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, which was then controlled by Republicans, asked then-Deutsche CEO John Cryan for details on the bank's internal review of the scheme as well as whether any loans made to Trump or his family had been guaranteed by the Russian government.
Since regaining power in the House, Democrats, including Waters, have been motivated by a desire to "drown Trump with investigation" and "make Trump's life a living hell," the president argued in his lawsuit, citing news reports.
The subpoenas to Deutsche and Capital One, which together hold numerous Trump family and business accounts, were designed to harass Trump, "rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the president and his family," the Trumps claimed. Democrats, the president said, wanted "to ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage."
The notices were sent shortly after the party took over from Republicans, and Deutsche told the Trumps it planned to begin surrendering documents on May 6, unless ordered by a court not to do so. Capital One indicated similar plans.
While the banks have the luxury of deferring to the courts, the dispute between Congress and the White House is quickly escalating into a constitutional crisis, said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group, which has tracked federal policy for the past four decades.
"The president's strategy is to drag these fights out through the election, and then he will refuse to comply if he wins by saying that voters made the choice," Seiberg said. "That is the same strategy he used on his taxes," and it undermines confidence in the federal government, he added.
Trump's approach is a departure from those of predecessors including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, said Victoria Nourse, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in the constitutional separation of powers. She previously served as chief counsel to Vice President Joe Biden, a Justice Department appellate lawyer, and special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
For example, she said, then-White House counsel John Dean and chief of staff H.R. Haldeman testified before Congress when lawmakers investigated the Nixon administration's role in a break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate complex before the 1972 election.
In the Reagan era, Oliver North, John Poindexter, and Fawn Hall testified to Congress about the sale of arms to Iran, which was under an embargo, to finance a rebellion against the socialist Nicaraguan government.
"In the past, it has been the conventional wisdom inside the Beltway that presidents incur more political damage by stonewalling than allowing Congress to do its job," Nourse wrote in a blog post for the American Constitution Society.
While those rules appear to have changed, Congress is unlikely to lose a court fight, she said, given Supreme Court decisions in cases such as Watkins v. U.S. In that ruling, handed down in 1957, justices said the power to conduct investigations is inherent in Congress' legislative role, covering not only matters that might be the subject of new laws but possible corruption or inefficiency within the federal government.
While Congress' oversight duties can generally be interpreted broadly enough to include a wide-ranging inquiry, Trump's lawsuit may "test the limits," Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, told the Washington Examiner.
"In the end, this is a battle between Congress’ claim to assert legitimate oversight over a co-equal branch of government and the Trump family’s claim that Congress should not be permitted to issue subpoenas to engage in a purely political fishing expedition," he added. "The legal fight will almost certainly slow down the ability of Congress to proceed with their investigation, which is in and of itself a victory of sorts for the president."

Texto completo: The first thing to know about the Minnesota Orchestra maestro’s new position is it won’t change a thing here at home. He will still be based in Minneapolis. He will still lead the same number of concert, tour and recording weeks with the orchestra.
Second, it’s not at all uncommon for music directors to hold multiple leadership posts. Currently Vänskä also serves as principal guest conductor of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and conductor laureate of the Lahti Symphony Orchestra in Finland. Gustavo Dudamel leads both the L.A. Philharmonic and Venezuela’s Orquestra Sinfónica Simón Bolivar. Marin Alsop heads the Baltimore Symphony and the São Paolo State Symphony Orchestra.
And third, MSP airport recently added a direct flight to Seoul. So Vänskä will spend less time in the air and waiting around airports to make connections.
He’ll begin his new position in January 2020, with a contract that extends for three years. His Minnesota Orchestra contract will end in 2022. He announced in December that he would step down as Minnesota Orchestra music director at that time.
In a video on the Seoul Philharmonic’s website (and YouTube), Vänskä says, “I have guest conducted the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra maybe three or four times, and I have always had a great time. The orchestra is full of enthusiasm, full of high skills and this kind of will to make music. So I’m super-excited to be able to start working with that group of musicians.”
According to Gwen Pappas, the orchestra’s communications director, “From Osmo’s perspective, he has commented on how pleased he is to consolidate his conducting weeks ‘away’ to one primary location and how he hopes to build connections between the Minnesota Orchestra and the musicians in Seoul.”
Northfield student wins Poetry Out Loud
A Minnesota student is the 2019 Poetry Out Loud national champion, the National Endowment for the Arts announced Thursday.
Isabella Callery, a senior at Arcadia Charter School in Northfield, won the title and the $20,000 prize at the finals held May 1 at George Washington University for her recitation of Charles Lamb’s “Thoughtless Cruelty.” Watch it here.
During the competition, Callery also performed poems by Joy Harjo and Natalie Diaz. “Being able to find a huge variety of Native American poets and having someone who represents you makes a difference,” she said. “This has made me realize there’s a poem for everyone.”
More than 275,000 students competed this year. The national finals included students from every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Second and third places went to Scottlynn Ernestine Ballard (Illinois) and Alejandro J. Campo (Georgia).
Poetry Out Loud is a partnership between the NEA, the Poetry Foundation and state arts agencies. More than 3.8 million students have taken part since the competition began in 2005.
23rd Pen Pals season to include Susan Orlean, Tommy Orange
The Twin Cities’ longest-running literary series will return in October with Susan Orlean , a New Yorker staff writer whose best sellers include “The Orchid Thief.” She’ll talk about her latest, “The Library Book,” on Oct. 10 and 11. It tells the story of the Los Angeles Central Library in 1968, when it burned, and today. Said the New York Times, “Susan Orlean has once again found rich material where no one else has bothered to look for it.”
Pen Pals is not a readings series. It’s a lecture series, without the heaviness that word implies. A Pen Pals event is entertaining and illuminating. The new season is a diverse line-up of five distinct personalities.
On Oct. 24 and 25, Ann Patchett will be here; her latest novel, “The Dutch House,” comes out in September. Perhaps best known for “Bel Canto” (a novel we read more and more slowly as we neared the end, wanting it to last forever), the PEN/Faulkner Award winner also co-owns a bookstore in Nashville, Tennessee. Maybe some of the anecdotes she shares will come from there.
Dec. 9 and 10 will bring Esi Edugyan, a Canadian writer whose parents emigrated from Ghana. She reimagines classic literary genres through the eyes of black characters. Her latest, “Washington Black,” in which a slave escapes a Barbados sugar plantation by hot-air balloon, was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize and won Edugyan’s second Giller Prize.
On Feb. 13 and 14, 2020, we’ll see religious scholar Reza Aslan, author of “God: A Human History,” “No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam,” and the No. 1 New York Times best seller “Zealot: the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,” which will long be remembered for Aslan’s notorious Fox News interview with Lauren Green.
The final author for 2019-20 will be Tommy Orange , whose best-selling “There There” chronicles the lives of urban Native Americans. The book won a National Book Critics Circle Award and a PEN/Hemingway Award. Orange is an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. He’ll be here April 30 and May 1. (And before then, at the Loft’s Wordplay festival on Saturday, May 11.)
All Pen Pals programs take place at the Hopkins Center for the Arts. Season subscriptions (starting at $200) will go on sale Monday, May 6. Download an order form or call 612-543-8112. Individual tickets ($45-55) will be available starting Wednesday, Aug. 7.
The picks
Tonight (Friday, May 3) and Saturday at the Walker: Bi Gan: “Long Day’s Journey into Night.” Screening in 3-D, China’s biggest arthouse hit includes a climactic 55-minute tracking shot. Set in the director’s native province of Guizhou in southwest China, the story of a solitary man (Jue Huang) is experienced as real life and dreamscape. Here’s the trailer. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($10/8). Also next Friday (May 10) at 7 and Saturday (May 11) at 2 p.m.
Opens tonight at the Children’s Theatre: “Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical.” This new Children’s Theatre Company production of the mega-hit Broadway musical features a cast of 17 young actors including Lillian Hochman, Audrey Mojica and Sofia Salmela as a triple-cast Matilda Wormwood and Alejandro Vega as Bruce. CTC company members Dean Holt and Autumn Ness are Matilda’s dreadful parents. Peter Brosius directs; the projections by Jorge Cousineau had help from Circus Juventas. Runs 2 ½ hours including a 15-minute intermission. For ages 6 and up. FMI and tickets ($15-74; dynamic pricing). Closes June 23.
Saturday on St. Paul’s West Side: 20th Annual Cinco de Mayo . Same event, new footprint: on Cesar Chavez between Wabasha and Robert, and on Wabasha from Cesar Chavez to Congress. It’s a full day of family fun, with cultural activities, events, a parade (starts at 9:30 a.m.), Lucha Libre Live wrestling, a car show, a jalapeño eating competition, and live music and entertainment on two stages. 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. FMI.
Opens Saturday at the History Center: “First Avenue: Stories of Minnesota’s Mainroom.” Video, photographs, artifacts and events tell the story of the legendary Minneapolis club from its first performance by Joe Cocker in 1970 to the memorial items left there after Prince’s death. See big-name bands from their earliest days at 7th St. Entry; step inside the re-created 1980s-era office of long-time manager Steve McClellan; check out Doomtree’s van. The exhibit draws from Star Tribune music writer Chris Riemenschneider’s book, “First Avenue: Minnesota’s Mainroom,” published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press. Here’s the trailer. FMI. Included with museum admission ($12/10/6, members free). Saturday’s opening party will feature DJ sets and book signings by Riemenschneider, Daniel Corrigan and Danny Sigelman (“Heyday: 35 Years of Music in Minneapolis”), Martin Keller and Greg Helgeson (“Hijinx and Hearsay: Scenester Stories from Minnesota’s Pop Life”) and Cyn Collins (“Complicated Fun: The Birth of Minneapolis Punk and Indie Rock, 1974-84”). 10 a.m.-4 p.m. FMI and schedule.
Sunday at Crooners: Chris Lomheim, Michael O’Brien and Jay Epstein “Triage” CD release. A valued part of the Twin Cities jazz scene since the 1990s, Lomheim is a pianist of elegance and restraint. He’s also a composer of eloquence and feeling. A new album by him is a rare treat worth waiting for, though he usually makes us wait a really long time. “Triage” took a while to come together. Lomheim, O’Brien and Jay Epstein have been talking about it since 2006, when O’Brien moved from Minneapolis to New York. It’s finally here, out today on the Minneapolis label Shifting Paradigm, and it’s a beauty. With 11 original compositions (eight by Lomheim, three by O’Brien), “Triage” is everything we love about a great piano trio: melody, musicality, and moments where each musician stretches out among equals. In the intimate Dunsmore Room. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($15).

Will Consumers Love Fake Meat as Much as Investors? An historic first day of trading for a manufacturer of plant-based products.

Texto completo: For roughly half a century a segment of the food industry has been trying to persuade consumers to give up beef. Will the movement finally succeed? History says no, but some investors seem to believe that this time is different.
The Journal's Heather Mack and Brian Gormley report on an historic day for a maker of products designed and manufactured to approximate traditional food:
Beyond Meat Inc.'s share price more than doubled in the company's Wall Street debut, as the first alternative meat startup to go public had the best open for a U.S.-listed IPO of 2019.
Shares of the plant-based meat substitute company, which went public at $25, opened on the Nasdaq on Thursday at $46 and surged as high as $73, putting its market capitalization at $3.7 billion. The stock closed the day at $65.75, a rise of 163%.
That marked the best first-day percentage gain for a U.S.-listed initial public offering this year, according to Dealogic. For IPOs raising more than $200 million, it was the best open since 2000 and the 16th-best first-day gain on record, according to Dealogic.
It is no doubt a triumph for the founders and early investors in the business. For the niche industry dedicated to replacing traditional cattle ranches and hog farms, it is one more milestone on a long journey.
In September of 1973, the New York Times noted the arrival of hamburgers made partly from soybeans in the New York market.
Sixteen years later, such products were still struggling to gain broad consumer acceptance, and not just in the home market of U.S. producers. In October of 1989 the Wall Street Journal reported:
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev opened a major U.S. trade exhibition in Moscow and spent two hours touring some of the 150 stalls representing such blue-chip companies as General Motors Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Johnson & Johnson. At the Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. stand, Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, a board member, offered him a soy burger. He didn't bite.
Biters in general shared his reluctance to try meat substitutes. In October of 1991, the Journal reported that the "featured burger for kids at Disney's experimental Mickey's Kitchen restaurants is made of vegetables." The Journal added:
Pure vegetarianism -- shunning all forms of animal consumption, even a pat of butter -- remains a rarity. Yet many people who chow down on chicken and other flesh may see themselves leaning in varying degrees toward a vegetarian diet.
A recent survey commissioned by the National Restaurant Association found that while only 5% of those queried regarded themselves as vegetarians, 20% said they would prefer a restaurant offering meatless items when dining out.
More than a quarter century later, the Washington Post reported in August of last year:
Five percent of Americans identify as vegetarian, a rate that has remained unchanged since the previous survey in 2012. In 1999, when the survey was first taken, as well as in 2001, 6 percent of Americans identified as vegetarian. Rates of veganism have followed a similar trajectory. This year, 3 percent of respondents identified as vegan — a slight increase from 2 percent in 2012.
For the uninitiated, vegetarians do not eat meat while vegans go further and also avoid consuming things derived from animals, such as honey. According to the Vegan Society, such consumers also avoid "animal-derived materials, products tested on animals and places that use animals for entertainment."
Of course one does not have to be a vegetarian or vegan to want something that seems like meat but is not. Still, given that those who object to meat on principle are a small segment of the dining public—a segment which does not appear to have grown in the last two decades— the question for investors is where they will find the consumers to generate growth.
The general thesis, as in the 1980s and 1990s, is that more health-conscious consumers will want alternatives. But the case against fatty meat has gotten marginally weaker in recent years, as Nina Teicholz has diligently chronicled . As ever, opponents of real meat also make an environmental case against it. But whatever one thinks about the climate, replacing livestock with alternative food production and processing (turning plants into something that looks and feels like a hamburger) is unlikely to drive a significant reduction in emissions.
The Associated Press notes that sales of plant-based fake meats have been surging in recent years, but still represent just a little more than 1% of the market. Investors considering Beyond Meat, which lost nearly $30 million in 2018 on net revenue of $87.9 million, may want to review the relevant history as they consider the potential U.S. appetite.

"The collusion ran deep. When these patients passed from one doctor to another, doctors wrote notes to make sure they were not accidentally told of their conditions in the handover. And when they were told, often too late for treatment, some were warned not to speak to families or friends on pain of becoming a 'social pariah.'
"Then there was the disappearing evidence. 'A recurring theme,' said one lawyer representing victims, 'is the great difficulty victims have had in obtaining their medical records and that when records have been obtained, they have crucial periods missing.' Some were forced to pay to see their own medical notes. Nearly 3,000 people have died as a result of this, and by the time the inquiry ends, victims groups predict the deaths of 300 more."

Jamal Khashoggi's death highlights need for unity on World Press Freedom Day

Resumen: On World Press Freedom Day, more than 250 journalists around the world languish in jails while others risk their lives. We must stand with them.

Texto completo: It’s been seven months since Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident, was brutally murdered inside the country’s consulate in Istanbul. His dismembered body has still not been found. The Saudi Royal Family remains the chief suspect.
Yet for globetrotting capitalists in search of opportunity in Riyadh, it’s back to business as usual.
BlackRock founder, Larry Fink, recently told The New York Times he wants to engage the Saudis rather than shun them for whatever internal troubles led to the killing of a respected member of the press and columnist for The Washington Post. Other companies, including Google, Softbank, and HSBC, are also planning business ventures with the Saudis, The Times reported.
On World Press Freedom Day, as more than 250 journalists around the world languish in jails in places such as Turkey, China, and Egypt and hundreds of others risk their lives daily to bring truth to their readers, it’s important to stand up and call this what it is: naked and unabashed greed at the expense of justice.

Signing up for conferences, joint ventures and other deals is not engaging a foreign government to make a difference. These companies, so practiced at wringing the last dollar at the bargaining table, aren’t there to negotiate for the truth tellers. It’s all about the money, and the Saudis know it.
The world is a tough place, they say. But the message that sends to the Saudis is that they can buy their way out of anything, even killing journalists. Other countries, such as the UAE, Russia or the Philippines, pay heed.
Jailed or killed for reporting the news
In Myanmar, two Reuters journalists have sat in filthy jail cells for more than 16 months, and face seven-year sentences for their reporting on the massacre of Rohingya Muslims by the country’s government. In the Philippines, crusading journalist Maria Ressa faces jail and bankruptcy for her Rappler news group’s reporting on atrocities by the Duterte government. In Pakistan, Cyril Almeida faces treason charges for his reporting on civil-military tensions. In Mexico, four journalists have been killed already this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
And in Northern Ireland, 29-year-old Lyra McKee became the first journalist in 18 years to be killed in Northern Ireland when she was shot in the head during a protest.
The murder recalls an earlier era, a quarter century ago, when terrorists in Ireland, Spain, or even the Middle East kidnapped and shot victims gangland style. Occasional bombings were horrific but rare. These days, terrorists think nothing of video streaming beheadings and coordinating suicide bombings in packed churches on Easter Sunday. Or bringing down jetliners.
Against this ever-increasing spiral of violence, any appeasement or apathy by those who can and should help is a green light to terror and tyranny. Strongmen leaders emboldened by President Trump’s lack of action grow more brazen by the day.
On the front lines of this battle are the brave journalists who strive to report the truth about the violence and corruption in this world. Some pay with their lives. Others sit unjustly in jail. They need our help, not be told the world is tough.
The world’s media is right to highlight these statistics. The world has become less and less of a place for press freedom in the last decade as terror and authoritarianism have grown. Some groups, like CPJ or Reporters Without Borders, or the organization I belong to, the World’s Editors Forum, try to make a difference. But it is an uphill slog.
We need your help moving forward
Still, we’ve had some victories. A campaign in Montenegro to protest government attacks on journalists drew the attention of the U. S. ambassador and for a while helped stifle the violence earlier this year. Safety training in places like Indonesia and Uganda helps journalists learn how to cover natural disasters and large public protests with the latest techniques to avoid violence or accidents.
The rise of interest in the media from a new crop of tech billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Marc Benioff has funneled money into media at a time when declining business models are hurting great journalism even more than coordinated violence.
But the ability of corporate CEOs and government leaders to fragment the media community by attacking it publicly remains our biggest challenge. Without the confidence and support of the public, we are too small an army. And the losers are ultimately the readers seeking truth and freedom.
Working together, across news organizations and borders, is the only way forward. Raising funds for support and training. Highlighting injustices when possible. And educating the public about how and why journalists do what they do. These are our goals this World Press Freedom Day.
The next twelve months will no doubt see more horror shows and tales of abuse and harassment of brave journalists. The world is indeed a tough place. If we can work together to stand up for one another, and garner the support of the leaders who have the power to wield influence, even small gains will be worth the risk.

New York Times cartoonist blames 'Jewish propaganda machine' for anti-Semitic outrage

Texto completo: The cartoonist whose anti-Semitic cartoon was published in the New York Times international edition has blamed the "Jewish propaganda machine" for the subsequent backlash.
António Moreira Antunes, who is Portuguese and uses the mononym António, depicted a blind President Trump wearing a yarmulke being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as Trump's service dog.

He told CNN the cartoon was not intended to be anti-Semitic but was a political statement. Stating that Jews are not above criticism, Antunes said outrage was "made through the Jewish propaganda machine, which is, anytime there's criticism it's because there's someone anti-Semitic on the other side, and that's not the case."
Right-wingers were to blame for the backlash, he said. "The Jewish right doesn't want to be criticized, and therefore, when criticized they say 'We are a persecuted people, we suffered a lot ... this is anti-Semitism.'"
The Times said the cartoon was published as a result of an "error of judgment" and admitted it was offensive.
“A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap. The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it," the newspaper said in a statement.
António, whose work is usually published in the Lisbon weekly Expresso, said he was hurt the paper did not support him. "They should see that here it's a political issue and not religious," he said.

Democratic lawmaker says 'some kids are unwanted, so you kill them'; media focus on GOP reactions

Texto completo: An Alabama Democrat fought the passage of a bill this week classifying abortion as a felony by arguing that unwanted children are going to end up getting killed anyway.
"I'm not about to be a male telling a woman what to do with her body," said Alabama State Rep. John Rogers. "Some kids are unwanted, so you kill them now or you kill them later. You bring them in the world unwanted, unloved, you send them to the electric chair. So, you kill them now or you kill them later.”JR
All too predictably, certain newsrooms ignored the story long enough to make it about the reaction from Republicans and conservatives.
“Conservatives seize on Alabama state Dem's abortion comments,” read a headline published by The Hill Wednesday evening. The group’s social media team also tweeted the following headline: “Conservatives rail against Dem state lawmaker who said ‘some kids are unwanted, so you kill them.’”
The Washington Post’s story Thursday holds out for exactly one paragraph before claiming the Democratic lawmaker’s “perplexing words” have “drawn intense pushback from conservatives, who are orchestrating a nationwide push in state houses this legislative session to restrict abortion access and, they hope, force the Supreme Court to reevaluate Roe v. Wade.”
These reports represent The Hill’s and the Post’s first coverage of Rogers’ comments this week recognizing abortion as the killing of "kids." Remember: For most of the national media, the story is never the thing that may reflect poorly on Democratic lawmakers and their allies. The real story is that Republicans and conservatives are reacting to it in any way.
On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Alabama state House passed the Human Life Protection Act, HB 314, by a vote of 74-3. The bill will make it a felony to perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy except in cases where it is "necessary in order to prevent a serious health risk to the unborn child’s mother.” The motion, which now goes to the state Senate, passed after Democratic lawmakers stormed out of the chamber in protest. Rogers did not leave, though. He stuck around as part of a filibuster against the bill.
Rogers claimed that the decision to abort is ultimately a "woman's choice." He added that it is a fact that some children are unwanted. Rogers also argued it is sometimes preferable to abort children who may have mental and physical abnormalities.
"Some parents can't handle a child with problems. It could be retarded. It might have no arms and no legs," the lawmaker said, according to the Alabama Political Reporter. Rogers added, “I may bring a bill to force all men to have vasectomies. That would end this whole debate. There would be no more abortions and eventually no more voters.”
There is obviously a lot going on here, the worst of it being Rogers' cold, calculating praise for streamlining the process of offing allegedly unwanted persons. Yet, The Hill’s and the Post's first reaction to his Mengeleian paean to the culture of death is to note that Donald Trump Jr. has some thoughts on the matter. That is how seriously they are taking it. Also, neither newsroom makes any mention of Rogers' reference to aborting “retarded” or deformed children.
But to The Hill’s and the Post’s credit, they at least covered the story. That is more than can be said of competing newsrooms, including the New York Times, CNN, and USA Today. If you want, though, USA Today has an interesting piece on its front page right now about Joe Jonas marrying Sophie Turner in Las Vegas. So, there is at least that.

New York Times penalizes editor involved in publishing anti-Semitic cartoon

Texto completo: The production editor involved in publishing an anti-Semitic cartoon in the New York Times international edition is being penalized.
“We are taking disciplinary steps with the production editor who selected the cartoon for publication,” publisher A.G. Sulzberger said in an internal memo, according to media reports.
Sulzberger, who became publisher of the Times in 1992, also said that the Times’ “unconscious bias training” will be modified with a “direct focus on antisemitism.” He also characterized the graphic as “offensive and inconsistent with our values.”
“Though I’ve been assured there was no malice involved in this mistake, we fell far short of our standards and values in this case,” Sulzberger said.
Screen Shot 2019-05-02 at 8.50.38 AM.png
The controversial cartoon was included in the New York Times’ international print edition last week and illustrated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dachshund dog with a Star of David collar leading President Trump, who was wearing a yarmulke.
[Related: New York Times cartoonist blames 'Jewish propaganda machine' for anti-Semitic outrage]
On Sunday, the Times issued a full apology after sharing an editor’s note on Saturday admitting the image was “offensive.” In the apology, the Times explained that “we have investigated how this happened and learned that, because of a faulty process, a single editor working without adequate oversight downloaded the syndicated cartoon and made the decision to included it on the Opinion page.”
“The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training,” the apology said. “We anticipate significant changes.”
According to the Times, an anonymous editor in Hong Kong signed off on including the cartoon, which was drawn by Portuguese artist, António Moreira Antunes.

Giuliani calls for Biden to be investigated for Ukraine conflict of interest

Texto completo: President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani called for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden to be investigated "quickly and expeditiously" over alleged conflicts of interest when he was vice president.
Giuliani tweeted a New York Times article Thursday about Biden’s work in Ukraine in 2016 when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss Viktor Shokin, the country’s prosecutor general. Shokin, who was accused of corruption, was voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament soon after.
Biden’s son, Hunter, stood to benefit from the decision because he was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian businessman that was being targeted by the prosecutor.
Giuliani tweeted Thursday: “Biden conflicts are too apparent to be ignored and should be investigated quickly and expeditiously. But the more important question is how deep and how high did the alleged Ukraine conspiracy go?”

At the time of Shokin’s departure, Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 per month for his work with Burisma Holdings, the energy company. Hunter Biden left Burisma’s board last month.
Biden’s campaign said that his son’s position had no role in his 2016 work in Ukraine and that he never discussed the effort to remove Shokin with Hunter Biden.
Since joining the race, Biden has jumped in the polls and has a clear lead in the crowded Democratic field. A RealClearPolitics national average of polls shows him with 32.8% support.

NEWARK, N.J. — A New Jersey gubernatorial task force examining possible irregularities in the awarding of state tax breaks zeroed in Thursday on a series of projects related to political boss George E. Norcross III that were intended to revitalize the Camden waterfront.
At a public hearing, members of the task force, named in January by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, said they will further scrutinize projects approved by the state Economic Development Authority under former Republican Gov. Chris Christie, including new buildings for Norcross’ insurance brokerage and a nonprofit hospital system where he is board chairman. Tax breaks for the projects totaled $285 million.
Companies related to Norcross, his charitable affiliations and the law and lobbying firms of his brother Philip received tax breaks worth at least $1.1 billion under the program, according to an investigation by WNYC and ProPublica.
A main issue, members said, involves claims made by the companies that they would leave New Jersey if they did not get tax grants. Norcross’ company, Conner Strong & Buckelew, said in its application that it was considering a move to Philadelphia without tax relief.
But Norcross said in an interview that the company did not have to show that it planned to move out of state, only that it wanted to locate jobs in distressed Camden. The task force intends to examine how the EDA administered the rules.
Task force members raised questions, for example, about the viability of competing offers made by landlords of office towers in Philadelphia. In some applications, letters of intent detailing offers had expired before applications were submitted to the state.
A spokesperson for Norcross’ company and its two partners in a new Camden office tower said the lease offers had expired because of the slow pace of government review and approval. “No private landlords would ever agree to hold open an offer for as long as government decides to take to review an application,” the spokesperson said.
Investigators also presented email evidence that Cooper University Health Care System officials were enthusiastic about moving to Camden after first telling the state they would move jobs to Philadelphia.
Cooper Health, which was approved for a $39.9 million tax break in 2014, has thus far collected more than $13 million in tax credits, investigators said.
A spokesperson for Cooper Health said in a statement the hearing confirmed that the nonprofit did not intend to move jobs out of state. It checked “no” on an application when asked if any jobs were “at risk” of leaving New Jersey, the spokesperson said.
Task force member Pablo Quinones said firms that misled the state on applications would have to pay back any credits already received.
The task force, however, was careful to emphasize that its investigation is still in its early stages.
“This is a hearing, not a trial,” the task force’s chairman, Ron Chen, said.

How Companies and Allies of One Powerful Democrat Got $1.1 Billion in Tax Breaks
Meet George Norcross. Nearly two thirds of $1.6 billion in tax incentives in his hometown of Camden, New Jersey, went to his own company, business partners, political allies and clients of his brother.
Chen, however, said that the task force had identified nine companies as “entities of concern,” and that some would be subpoenaed for more information.
About 40 companies from around New Jersey have agreed to submit new certifications about job creation and other promises made in their applications.
The tax break program has been under scrutiny since January, when the New Jersey comptroller’s office issued a report concluding that billions in tax breaks were approved without adequate state diligence. The investigators found that the state was unable to verify that firms that received tax breaks actually created jobs.
Murphy has called the program an “$11 billion black hole,” and his administration is considering reforms that would pare back awards and create more more benefits for host communities.
On Wednesday, Murphy cited the WNYC-ProPublica report and another in The New York Times detailing how political insiders may have influenced the program.
“Given the breadth of these findings and those so far reported by the task force, I believe anything short of a total revamp of the tax incentive program is a disservice to the hard working taxpayers of New Jersey,” Murphy said in a statement.
Christie, who expanded the tax break program and championed Camden projects, sharply criticized his successor, a former diplomat.
“While Governor Murphy was collecting his pay-to-play gift from President Obama entertaining the wealthy of Germany at embassy parties, we were back here doing the hard work to rebuild Camden from the most dangerous city in America to the most hopeful city in America,” Christie said in a statement.
The task force, without providing details, said in a press release it has already made a “criminal referral” to an unspecified agency regarding “unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.”
On Thursday, the task force raised questions about changes to the 2013 Economic Opportunity Act, which gave benefits to companies moving to Camden.
James Walden, the task force’s lead attorney, projected sections of the law that changed and revealed that metadata in the documents show the author was Kevin Sheehan, an attorney with Parker McCay, Philip Norcross’ law firm.
Walden walked through provisions in the bill that increased the tax breaks for several companies that were represented by Parker McCay, including Holtec International, which makes containers for spent nuclear fuel, and Conner Strong & Buckelew.
In a statement, the law firm told the Times that Sheehan’s work on the bill did not represent lobbying. The firm said in a statement, “It would be a reckless mischaracterization of Parker McCay’s activities to state that Parker McCay was engaged in unregistered lobbying in 2013.”
The former president and CEO of the Economic Development Authority testified about the changes, explaining in each case how the rewrite of the legislation resulted in a larger tax break for specific companies.

Texto completo: Tareck El Aissami , uno de los líderes más poderosos del gobierno venezolano, cercano al presidente Nicolás Maduro , exvicepresidente y ahora ministro de Industrias y Producción Nacional en Venezuela , está siendo señalado de nueva cuenta por narcotráfico y de tener nexos con el grupo terrorista Hezbolá .
Así lo revela el diario The New York Times, que tiene en su poder un expediente que indica que El Aissami , de 44 años, y su padre, Carlos Zaidan El Aissami , buscaron cómo introducir a Hezbolá en Venezuela .
De igual manera los documentos afirman que su hermano, Feraz El Aissami , tenía negocios con el narcotraficante más famoso de Venezuela , Walid Makled alias “ El Turco “, y que tenía casi $45 millones de dólares guardados en cuentas bancarias de Suiza. Pero no solo eso, si no que además a Tareck se le vincula directamente con “ El Turco “, pues hay documentación que afirma que emitió contratos millonarios para empresas propiedad de Walid .
Y mientras la mayoría de los venezolanos viven entre el hambre y la miseria, Tareck El Aissami ha amasado una enorme fortuna que le permitió comprar un banco en Estados Unidos , parte de una constructora, acciones en un centro comercial panameño, tierras donde se construirá un complejo turístico de lujo y varios proyectos inmobiliarios en Venezuela, entre ellos una costosa mansión hecha para sus padres.
El 8 de marzo pasado Estados Unidos acusó formalmente a El Aissami por narcotráfico lo que lo convirtió en el segundo miembro del gabinete de Maduro señalado de dicho delito luego que se hiciera lo propio con Néstor Reverol , actual ministro del Interior venezolano.
De igual manera detallan cómo almacenes supuestamente abandonados en realidad estaban siendo usados para guardar toneladas de químicos que se utilizan para producir cocaína. Aquí de nueva cuenta suena el apellido de El Aissami : Haisam , primo de Tareck , quien se identificó como representante legal de Makled Investments , la compañía del “ El Turco “.
La última parte del archivo recoge informaciones de testigos que vinculan a la familia El Aissami con Hezbolá , quienes detallan los intentos para reclutar a militantes que buscaban establecer una red de tráfico de información y de drogas a lo largo de América Latina , algo que no se aclara si se logró o no.
* La “bruja” que no pudo predecir que sería víctima de “El Mencho” o “El Marro”
* Le llegan más malas noticias a “El Mayo” Zambada desde Colombia
* Profanación de cuerpos y más atrocidades; la cruel venganza del Cártel del Noreste

Can the Dems still talk down the economy?

Texto completo: "The recession talk in late 2018 got way, way out of hand," New York Times economic reporter Neil Irwin tweeted a few days ago. Indeed it did. Irwin’s tweet came shortly after the government released figures showing the economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of this year. The number was good by anyone’s measure, significantly outpacing predictions. And it raised a question: What about all that recession talk of the last few months? What was going on?
Certainly, there were some economists who looked at various indicators — housing, energy, the international economy — and feared an economic slowdown was on the way. But in the popular conversation — the world of columnists and cable TV talkers — much of the economic chatter was really about President Donald Trump. A worsening economy, some said, would show how wrong the president’s policies have been and would be the worst possible news for his 2020 re-election bid. Now, though, the case is a bit harder to make, with 3.2% growth, plus low unemployment, plus — perhaps most important — wage increases that have not been seen in years.
Still, the presidential campaign is under way, and Democrats will try to portray — actually, they’ll have to portray — the president’s policies as an economic mess. The question is whether it will work. Republican strategists are of two minds. On one hand, some still bear the scars of the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton managed to convince voters that the economy, which was in the early stages of a recovery, was in desperate shape. The lesson: Creating a perception of the economy was more important than the economy itself.
On the other hand, some Republicans believe it will be difficult for any Democrat — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, anyone — to talk down a healthy economy.
"We, of course, have no idea what the economy will be like in a year and a half," said strategist Curt Anderson in another email exchange. "But if it stays similar to how it is now, the Democrats will not be successful in talking it down."
While an economic downturn would obviously hurt Trump, Anderson sees the possibility of another dynamic entirely.
"When the economy is good, voters don’t say that the economy is their No. 1 issue," he explained. "We have several polls this year where the voters list the economy as their third- or fourth-most important issue ... Often voters will migrate to other issues when the economy is good."
In that rather ironic scenario, a good Trump economy could give voters the freedom to focus on things they don’t like about the president.
In any event, Trump’s job will be to convince voters not only that his economic policies are working, but that Democratic proposals — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, tuition-free college and more — would destroy the economy that has gone well during the early Trump years.
So far, despite all the pessimistic talk, that’s not a hard argument to make. And if the indicators hold up, the president will hold a strong hand, whatever his real or perceived liabilities, in November 2020.

Anti-Semitism -- and a salve -- on Holocaust Remembrance Day

Texto completo: Twice during the recent Passover holiday I was doubled over by news that hit me like the low blow I once suffered in a boxing ring. Though I'm still reeling from one bulletin, I knew a psychological salve for the second one, the report of a murderous assault on a Southern California synagogue. I needed tactile contact with my children and grandchildren.
So I caught up with one set at a Lake Forest middle school, where Noa, a 9-year-old granddaughter, participated in a ceremony marking her Girl Scout troop's promotion from Brownies to Juniors. As similar milestones were being marked by other troops, white, African-American, Asian-American and Latina Girl Scouts raised a rainbow of right hands and promised "to help other people at all times."
"Am Yisrael Chai," I whispered. It's a defiant cry Jews have long evoked, a proclamation that, despite all the pogroms, massacres and exiles, "The people of Israel live!"
Last Sunday, I added a phrase: "Now we are blessed to live in a country where decency and brotherhood outweigh hatred and prejudice."
My spirits were lifted for half the ride home. Then I reverted to obsessing over the other piece of disturbing news: The New York Times published an anti-Semitic cartoon in its international edition.
It showed a blind President Donald Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depicted as a guide dog. Trump's head is covered by a keppah, the skullcap worn by observant Jews. Netanyahu had a large nose, and a Star of David dangled from his dog collar.
In my mind and in the pit of my stomach that ugly image is indelibly linked with Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. It began at sundown Wednesday and will end at sundown Thursday.
Of all the lessons that can be drawn from the murder of 6 million Jews, the most difficult for me to come to grips with is that the genocide wasn't sponsored by some despot in Eastern Europe, where poverty and anti-Semitism were endemic.
It was conceived in Germany, a prosperous and highly cultured nation, the homeland of musical geniuses like Beethoven and Bach and eminent philosophers like Hegel and Kant. Before Hitler, Jews weren't despised outsiders but integrated into the German mainstream. It was not just street ruffians who supported the Nazis, but professors, doctors and clergy.
Given that, could any nation be truly free of deathly religious prejudice?
Almost in answer to that question, a vile cartoon like those that once appeared in Nazi Party newspapers was published in America, and not by some neo-Nazi fringe group. The New York Times has long been regarded as the voice of reason, a venue for enlightened discourse.
Belatedly responding to a wave of criticism, the Times apologized for the cartoon. It blamed one editor's poor judgment. Yet this wasn't the first time the paper published anti-Semitic material thinly disguised as legitimate criticism of Israel.
In 2015, it printed an op-ed piece that echoed the Palestinians' argument that the Israelis have no right to Jerusalem because their claim that it was the site of an ancient Jewish Temple is false.
"The question, which many books and scholarly treatises have never definitively answered, is whether the 37-acre site, home to Islam's sacred Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aqsa Mosque, was also the precise location of two ancient Jewish temples," wrote the author of "Historical Certainty Proves Elusive at Jerusalem's Holiest Place."
How did that get past the Times' editors? Had none gone to Sunday school? The New Testament reports several visits of Jesus to the Jerusalem Temple.
While apologizing for its Passover-season cartoon, the Times promised editorial reforms to inoculate its pages against anti-Semitism. Let me suggest one:
Avoiding phrases like "the Israelis captured" or "seized" the West Bank. Gaza, or the Golan Heights. Without a bit of context, they imply that, right out of the blue, Israeli troops marched into Palestinian territories.
In a recent variation on that theme the Times wrote: "The Six-Day War of June 1967 ended in decisive victories for Israel, which seized the Golan Heights from Syria."
The article made no mention of how the war started: In 1967, the Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser announced that his army would wipe Israel off the map. Syria and Jordan, which ruled the West Bank, signed on for that ill-fated project. Israel survived, and the three conspirators were ousted from their Palestinian territories.
But how will I react if the Times doesn't heed my advice? Or if anti-Semitism surfaces elsewhere in newsprint or another episode of violence?
At least I'll have a new layer of protection against the despair that leads to sleepless nights. Putting my head upon a pillow, I'll recall that Sunday in a middle-school gymnasium when Girl Scouts of different races and creeds joined my granddaughter in vowing not to hurt but to help other people at all times.

Texto completo: l The Margaret Sullivan column in the April 29 Style section, about journalists reporting on information from data hacks, included a quote from New York Times reporter Amy Chozick's book "Chasing Hillary": "I can't explain it exactly except to compare it to a fever that spread through every newsroom and made us all salivate over the tiniest morsels." The quote was about the Hillary Clinton email server scandal, and not Russian-hacked emails in the 2016 presidential election, as the column suggested.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr accused the New York Times of botching a report that claimed President Trump instructed former White House counsel Don McGahn to fire special counsel Robert Mueller who was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.
According to Barr, there was “no question” that Trump’s instruction to McGahn was to contact Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and relay concerns that Mueller had a conflict of interest that prohibited him from leading the investigation.
Barr told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that Trump later clarified that “what he meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein."
“On the other end of the spectrum, it appears that McGahn felt it was more directive and that the President was essentially saying push Rosenstein to invoke a conflict of interest to push Mueller out,” Barr said.
“Wherever it fell on that spectrum of interest, the New York Times story was very different. The New York Times story said flat out that the president directed the firing of Mueller,” Barr said. “He told McGahn, ‘fire Mueller.’ Now there's something very different between firing a special counsel outright, which suggests ending the investigation and having a special counsel removed for conflict, which suggests you're going to have another special counsel.”
Tweet
Federal regulations outlined that Mueller could only be fired by the attorney general. But then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, meaning Rosenstein oversaw the investigation and was the only one who could have fired Mueller.
According to the New York Times report from January 2018, Trump sought to oust Mueller in June 2017. Although he instructed McGahn to fire Mueller, McGahn did not abide by the order and warned he would step down from his post.
The New York Times claimed Trump cited that there were conflicts of interests that prevented Mueller from carrying out his investigation. For example, he asserted there was a dispute concerning fees at Trump’s National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., which prompted Mueller to end his membership there.
He also noted that Mueller was previously employed by a firm that represented his son-in-law and White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
A redacted version of Mueller’s report says Trump called McGahn twice and ordered him to “call Rod” in June 2017. McGahn told the special counsel that Trump first said, “‘You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.”
In the second call, McGahn claimed that Trump was more “direct, saying something like, ‘Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the Special Counsel.’ McGahn recalled the President telling him ‘Mueller has to go’ and ‘Call me back when you do it.’”

Texto completo: Demand better of media Well, the Mueller report is completed and The Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press, Daily Herald and all Democrats are upset because the findings do not match the incorrect stories they have been publishing for the past almost three years. Now they are scrambling to cherry-pick bits, pieces and phrases from the report in an attempt to justify their false reporting.
The fact is that the report found 25 Russians and three companies were charged with trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election without the assistance of any Americans. They also found that the Obama administration was aware of this back then but failed to do anything about it.
Perhaps this should have been reported as big news back then as well as now. Perhaps the headline on the Daily Herald Opinion page should be "We must do better" rather than "We must demand better." Our citizens need to demand better of the media.
Daryl G. Pratt Arlington Heights Disney’s executive compensation outrage Kudos to Abigail Disney for making herself heard regarding the compensation paid to Disney CEO Bob Iger.
When the new tax plan was passed giving big business huge tax breaks, it was supposed to enable corporations to raise the salaries of everyone working for them. Instead, some companies gave one-time bonuses, others gave small salary increases to those who kept the business running every day and used the money to provide more dividends for stockholders. When a CEO is paid over 1,000 times as much as the average employee, there is something wrong with our system.
How many millions does one person need to make to feed his ego, while employees struggle to hold their families together? Minimum wage is a farce. It’s time we took a good look at employee compensation, including company medical coverage.
Thank you, Ms. Disney, for having the courage to step forward on this issue. I think your grandfather would be proud.

Texto completo: Magic Leap is seeking more cash from investors.
The Plantation-based startup, which already has raised $2.3 billion from some of the world's largest companies, has received $280 million in funding from Japan-based cell phone company NT DoCoMo, Magic Leap said in a news release.
NT DoCoMo will be Magic Leap's exclusive partner in Japan, the company said. The partnership will combine the telecommunication company's planned 5G infrastructure with Magic Leap's technology.
Magic Leap's spokeswoman replied to an email that she was traveling Monday and unavailable for comment.
But in an interview with The New York Times, founder and CEO Rony Abovitz said research and development is expensive in spatial computing, or a computer-generated interactive experience. "The R&D investments are substantial, but so is the upside," he said.
While Magic Leap has many other products in its pipeline, evidenced by hundreds of patents filed by the company, it also is facing competition. Microsoft has already introduced its second version of HoloLens, which it is geared toward helping business people communicate and collaborate.
The company, which was founded and is led by entrepreneur Rony Abovitz, also said it is reopening its latest fundraising round to accept new investments from new and existing investors.
Magic Leap, which employs thousands of people in South Florida, introduced its first product, goggles for developers called Magic Leap One, in December 2017. It is a wearable computer that combines Magic Leap says its product lets users interact with digital content in the real world. The product sells for $2,295 and is available in South Florida.
The company also has a partnership with AT&T and has begun selling its product in some stores in California, Illinois, Massachusetts and Texas. Magic Leap One is not yet available in AT&T's South Florida's stores but can be ordered directly from Magic Leap.
Magic Leap has previously raised funds from companies including Google, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, and the Public Investment Fund, an investment arm of Saudi Arabia.

Texto completo: Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, which the couple launched last year, has partnered with Netflix for a slate of projects that include scripted and unscripted shows as well as full-length features and documentaries.
"We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling," the former president said. "Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won't just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all."
Some of the projects are:
"American Factory," about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio; "Bloom," an upstairs/downstairs drama series set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York that depicts barriers faced by women and by people of color; a feature film adaptation of author David W. Blight's "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," for which he won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History; "Overlooked," an adaptation of The New York Times "Overlooked" obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper; "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series; "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," a nonfiction series that will portray the importance of unheralded work done by everyday heroes guiding our government; "Crip Camp," a documentary about a 1970s summer camp for teenagers with disabilities.
Higher Ground has made a point of focusing on stories that reflect a range of "interests and experiences" but are "relevant to our daily lives," Michelle Obama said. "We think there's something here for everyone - moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day."
- Variety
Women unite: Typically, female country artists only get one or two slots on a tour or festival. But on Carrie Underwood's Cry Pretty Tour 360, six women will be behind the mic throughout the show. Underwood picked duo Maddie & Tae and trio Runaway June to open for her arena tour that starts Wednesday in Greensboro, N.C. The seven-time Grammy winner says it's a great time for women to come together and support each other.
Cave boys: Netflix announced it will join with the "Crazy Rich Asians" production company (SK Global Entertainment) to make a film about last July's dramatic rescue of 12 village boys in northern Thailand who were trapped with their soccer coach in a flooded cave for more than two weeks.
Wango Taylor: Taylor Swift has been added to the lineup of the iHeartRadio Wango Tango concert June 1 in Carson, Calif. She will also open Wednesday's Billboard Music Awards with a performance of her new single, "ME!" Ryan Seacrest hosts Wango Tango, which will also feature the Jonas Brothers, Halsey, 5 Seconds of Summer, Zedd, Ally Brooke, Tyga, Ava Max, Fletcher and TOMORROW X TOGETHER. Tickets go on sale Friday.

Politics &amp; Ideas: Impeachment Now Would Be Irresponsible

Texto completo: An insightful friend of mine remarked recently that before reading the Mueller report, he was sympathetic with Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to pursue impeachment of President Trump, but by the time he finished the report he was convinced Congress has a duty to act.
Our times demand moral clarity. But equally, they require political clarity. When it comes to impeachment, these two imperatives might point Democrats in opposite directions.
The argument that Congress has a duty to act is straightforward: Whether or not Mr. Trump has committed indictable crimes, he has acted in ways that offend the Constitution and degrade his office. Failing to pursue impeachment will make Congress complicit in the normalization of unacceptable behavior.
Here's the counterargument: The president's re-election would be the ultimate normalization of his conduct. In the best scenario for Democrats, even a failed effort to remove the president from office would weaken his electoral prospects. But it's also possible that such an effort would hurt Democrats by making them look aggressive and opportunistic. If the pursuit of impeachment makes Mr. Trump's re-election more likely, it is well-intentioned folly.
No one can know for sure which of these two outcomes is likelier. As Aristotle remarked, we do not deliberate about certainties. Political judgment is an inherently risky and contested business, but we can use evidence to narrow the indeterminacy and estimate probabilities.
Not one major survey has shown a majority or even a plurality of the American people in favor of pursuing impeachment. To be sure, most people have a negative view of Mr. Trump's conduct. In last week's Washington Post/ABC News poll, 53% of respondents said that the Mueller report, which most regard as fair, did not clear the president of all wrongdoing. A plurality, 47%, believe that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice in the course of Mr. Mueller's inquiry. Only 31% think that the president told the truth about the matters under investigation; 58% think he lied. Only 14% say that the Mueller inquiry has made them more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2020, compared with 36% who say less likely.
One might think that these sentiments would lead most Americans to favor impeachment. But the survey finds only 37% favor impeachment while 56% oppose it. Among registered voters, opposition to impeachment is even higher at 60%. Not surprisingly, 62% of Democrats favor it while 87% of Republicans oppose it. But independents, who now constitute a plurality of the electorate, are against impeachment, 59% to 36%.
Almost three quarters of white Americans without college degrees -- Mr. Trump's base -- oppose impeachment. But anti-impeachment sentiment also runs high among college-educated whites, a group that has moved toward Democrats in recent elections. There is no evidence of a gender gap within this group: 66% of college-educated white men oppose impeachment, as do 65% of college-educated white women. Only nonwhite groups, including 69% of African-Americans, believe that impeachment is the right course.
Though a majority of Democrats say they favor impeachment, reports from the grass roots suggest a lack of intensity on the issue. Congressional Democrats conducting town-hall meetings have found far more interest in health care, climate change and living wages than in removing Mr. Trump from office before the 2020 election. Freshman Rep. Katie Porter of Orange County, Calif., told the New York Times that, as a priority for her constituents, impeaching the president is not in the "top half dozen; it may be down at the No. 12 spot."
Public opinion could shift under the weight of an impeachment inquiry. But it seems more likely that most people have made up their minds about Mr. Trump and are trying to determine whether Democrats and their presidential nominee would be a better alternative. Pursuing impeachment would be unlikely to move undecided voters toward the Democrats.
In his famous essay "Politics as a Vocation," Max Weber distinguishes between the ethic of intention -- doing the right thing without regard to consequences -- and the ethic of responsibility, in which politicians take account of the probable consequences of their actions. There is no clash between moral clarity and political clarity -- as long as Democrats eschew self-defeating high-mindedness and adopt Weber's ethic of responsibility as their pole star. If they are politically serious, they will evaluate every choice -- including not only impeachment but also the selection of their presidential nominee -- in light of its impact on the 2020 election.

Texto completo: For its 11th season, the esteemed chamber ensemble Accordo will return to Westminster Hall and Icehouse. For its 7th season, the Schubert Club Mix will be its usual itinerant self, hopping from the James J. Hill House to the American Swedish Institute, Aria to the Summit Center for Arts and Innovation.
A group that includes the concertmasters of the Minnesota Orchestra and the SPCO, the associate concertmaster of the SPCO and principal strings from both orchestras, Accordo must be a headache and a half to schedule, but Mondays and Tuesdays seem to work out.
All four full-length Monday concerts at Westminster will be followed by abbreviated and more casual Tuesday concerts at Icehouse. (Which, if you’ve never seen Accordo – and if you have – is a great place to experience their music and overall excellence.) This season’s musical offerings will include several neglected works by female composers Ruth Crawford Seeger, Grazyna Bacewicz, Sofia Gubaidulina, Shulamit Ran and Clara Schumann alongside classics by Schubert, Bach, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Haydn, Debussy, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich. The April 6 concert will feature the world premiere of a new work by George Tsontakis, co-commissioned with the Schubert Club.
The members of Accordo – Rebecca Albers, Ruggero Allifranchini, Steven Copes, Erin Keefe, Maiya Papach, Anthony Ross and Ronald Thomas – will also perform what’s become an annual favorite: a night of music and silent film at the Ordway, with guest pianist and composer Stephen Prutsman.
The Schubert Club Mix season is shorter this year than last. The 2018-19 lineup included six events and 2019-20 has four. But numbers aren’t the main thing in this always surprising series, which aims to take the formality out of classical music. Mix has consistently brought artists to the Twin Cities we wouldn’t see otherwise and ought to know.
We jumped up and down when we read that David Greilsammer will return with his latest program, “The Labyrinth.” His 2015 appearance – also with Mix at the Hill House – was one of the 25 best arts events we experienced that year. Greilsammer alternated between Scarlatti and John Cage sonatas, playing on two facing Steinways (one prepared Cage-style), moving between them on a revolving stool and tossing music to the ground. “The Labyrinth” features Leoš Janáček’s suite “On an Overgrown Path” interspersed with other pieces and ending in chaos. Sounds like another great night.
New to Mix, and probably to most of us: the Danish String Quartet , with selections from “Last Leaf,” their second recording of Scandinavian folk music. The four-member Russian Renaissance , Grand Prize winner of the 2017 M-Prize Competition, the world’s largest prize for chamber music, who are redefining the balalaika, domra and button accordion. And the London-based, 12-member, conductorless vocal ensemble Stile Antico , performing Renaissance polyphony. How cool are they? Cool enough for a Tiny Desk Concert.
Accordo’s season begins Oct. 14, Mix on Oct. 3. Series tickets are on sale now. Singles will be available starting Aug. 1.
Accordo’s 2018-19 season has ended. Schubert Club Mix is still under way. On May 9 at the Machine Shop, Chalaca – clarinet, harp and percussion – will perform music by composers who have immigrated to the United States from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. On May 23 at TPT Studio A in Lowertown, Mix will present “Tienda,” a partially staged opera by Schubert Club composer-in-residence Reinaldo Moya about a Mexican musician who immigrated to Minneapolis in 1886 and opened a small grocery store in St. Paul. Among the performers: Clara Osowski . FMI and tickets for both. There will also be a free community performance of “Tienda” on Saturday, May 25, at 2 p.m. at Neighborhood House.
The picks
Today (Tuesday, April 30) on your streaming device: International Jazz Day Global Concert 2019. This year’s concert – always an all-star affair, co-chaired by jazz legend and UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Herbie Hancock – will take place in Melbourne’s Hamer Hall and feature Hancock, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Till Brönner, Brian Blade, Kurt Elling, Ledisi, Antonio Sánchez, Somi, Lizz Wright, and many more, including jazz musicians from China, Iran, Japan, the Netherlands, and Lebanon. Truly a global affair, Jazz Day will be celebrated in more than 190 countries and the concert will be seen by millions of viewers worldwide. Tune into YouTube, Facebook, jazzday.com and UNESCO starting at 10 a.m. CST.
Tonight (Tuesday, April 30) at Magers & Quinn: Louis Bayard presents “Courting Mr. Lincoln.” The latest from the New York Times Notable Book author is the story of a young Mr. Lincoln and two people who loved him: debutante Mary Todd and Lincoln’s best friend and roommate, Joshua Speed. Here’s Chris Hewitt’s review for the Star Tribune. 7 p.m. Free.
Now at the Southern Theater: Mathew Janczewski’s Arena Dances 3rd Annual Candy Box Dance Festival. A week of performances, new works, masterclasses and discussions curated by Janczewski to strengthen and lift up the Minneapolis modern dance scene. This year’s headliners are Darrius Strong’s STRONGmovement, with two remounts and a new work; April Sellers Dance Collective, with a reimagined piece from the past; and Chris Schlichting, with the debut of a new duet. All three will perform at 7:30 Thursday through Saturday and 2 p.m. Saturday. FMI and tickets ($20/$12/pay-as-able, depending on performance). Happy Hour works-in-progress showings will take place Tuesday through Friday at 5:30. Artist workshops are scheduled for 9:30-11:30 daily. FMI.
Now at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre: “Amazing Grace.” The heavenly Aretha Franklin concert film we almost never saw – technical problems were followed by other snags, including Franklin’s refusal to release it – has moved from the Uptown to the St. Anthony Main, so you can still see it in a theater on a big screen. This is the film that captures Franklin’s recording of the best-selling gospel album in history, nearly 50 years ago. FMI including trailer, times and tickets ($9.50; $5 on Tuesdays).
Sunday at the Ordway: Omara Portuondo: One Last Kiss Tour. Cuba’s greatest diva became known to U.S. audiences in the late 1990s as the female voice of the Buena Vista Social Club. But she had already been singing for decades and had fans all over the world. Now 88, she’s on her final international tour, which will bring her to the Ordway. With Roberto Fonseca on piano, Andres Coayo on percussion, Ruly Herrera on drums and Yandy Martinez on bass. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($48-79).

Texto completo: Netflix is about to get an Obama makeover.
Higher Ground Productions, President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama's production company in partnership with Netflix, announced Tuesday a list of projects being developed for the streaming service, and they feature an eclectic mix of films, TV series, documentaries and children's programming. (It's unclear which will actually move forward, or when; the announcement said only that the projects will roll out over the next several years. )
The series include "Bloom," a period piece set in the post-World War II fashion industry in New York City; "Overlooked," an anthology series adapted from the New York Times column of obituaries for past deaths the paper overlooked; "Fifth Risk," a nonfiction series adapted from "The Big Short" author Michael Lewis's book on government bureaucracy; and "Listen to Your Vegetables and Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series focused on travel and food from Jeremy Konner (“Drunk History”) and Erika Thormahlen.

Higher Ground is also planning movie projects: The company acquired documentary "American Factory" at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, which centers on a Chinese billionaire who opened a factory in Ohio and hired American workers. The company is also working on a film adaption of author David W. Blight's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom. " A third film is another documentary, "Crip Camp," about a camp for disabled teenagers in the 1970s that helped start the disability rights movement.
“We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling. That’s why we couldn’t be more excited about these projects,” Barack Obama said in the announcement. “Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won’t just entertain, but will educate, connect, and inspire us all. ” “We love this slate because it spans so many different interests and experiences, yet it’s all woven together with stories that are relevant to our daily lives,” Michelle Obama also said in a statement. “We think there’s something here for everyone – moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day. We can’t wait to see these projects come to life – and the conversations they’ll generate. ”

2 drop their lawsuits in the 'gardening while black' spat

Texto completo: Two people embroiled in what was nicknamed the "gardening while black" case have dropped their lawsuits against each other.
Detroiter Marc Peeples, who is black, said three white women falsely accused him of crimes in 2017 and 2018 as he built a community garden in Hunt Park. Peeples said the women had their own plans for the park and wanted to see him "incarcerated or seriously injured by law enforcement." He sued them in February for $300,000.
One of the women, Deborah Nash, filed a counterclaim against Peeples earlier this month, alleging libel, invasion of privacy, ethnic intimidation and other claims.
Both parties agreed Monday to drop their cases against each other. No money was exchanged.
Peeples said the attention the case received was difficult for him and his family, something that factored into his decision.
"It was never about money for me," Peeples, 33, told the Free Press. "By me being able to be in the garden and do what I was doing, that was victory for me. That was enough for me."
Nash's attorney, Kyle Bristow, issued a statement that said Peeples' lawsuit was "stupid, devoid of common sense, and disregarded the elementary rule that witnesses cannot be sued for talking to the police or testifying in court." Bristow said Nash never engaged in misconduct.
Peeples is still in litigation with the two other women, Martha Callahan and Jennifer Morris, said his attorney, Robert Burton-Harris They have not responded to the lawsuit and therefore are in default, Burton-Harris said.
Neither Callahan nor Morris could be reached for comment.
NBC News previously reported that Peeples and Burton-Harris have described what happened as a case of "gardening while black."
According to Peeples' lawsuit, the women told Detroit Police administrators in March 2018 that Peeples had stolen from houses near the park and threatened to burn down their homes and kill them. Two months later, as Peeples was in Hunt Park teaching a group of home-schooled students about gardening, one of the women called 911 and falsely reported that Peeples was a convicted pedophile and wasn't legally allowed near kids, the lawsuit said. Police arrested Peeples.
Peeples was charged with three counts of stalking and temporarily barred from the park. A Wayne County Circuit judge eventually tossed the case, saying the three women harassed Peeples.
In her counterclaim, Nash said Peeples made false and defamatory statements about her online and in a New York Times article. She also said he tried to intimidate her because she is white, referring to her as a "Euro" and "colonizer."

N.Y. Times is 'deeply sorry' for cartoon

Texto completo: The New York Times has offered an apology three days after its international edition published a cartoon that has been widely condemned as anti-Semitic.
The cartoon depicts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog, a Star of David dangling from his collar, as he leads an apparently blind President Trump, wearing a yarmulke, around by a leash.
The cartoon, which initially drew little response when it was published on Thursday, appeared in the Times's global edition, which is published from Hong Kong and sells about 175,000 daily copies outside the United States. It did not appear in the Times's domestic edition.
Criticism of the cartoon began to gain momentum on social media starting on Saturday. Critics said it evoked hateful images distributed by Germany's Nazi regime in the 1930s to dehumanize Jews and depict them as evil manipulators of world opinion.
One of the Times's opinion columnists, Bret Stephens, wrote on Sunday that the cartoon could have been published by the vicious Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer. It "checked so many anti- Semitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign," he wrote.
In an interview on CNN on Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, called the cartoon "propaganda." He said, "It would not have surprised me if this had come from Tehran or Damascus, but it does not belong in the New York Times or any other credible news organization. It's unacceptable anywhere."
The reaction to the cartoon began to build, including in the Israeli media, as news reports circulated about the shooting of a rabbi and three Jewish worshipers at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., killing one; the suspected gunman is allegedly a self-identified white supremacist and anti-Semite.
The Times initially issued an editor's note on Saturday that was to appear on Monday in its international edition, which isn't published on Sunday.
It read, "A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap. The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it."
On Sunday, as more condemnation rolled in, it issued a fuller apology and partial explanation: "We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday that circulates outside the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again. Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it's all the more unacceptable. We have investigated how this happened and learned that, because of a faulty process, a single editor working without adequate oversight downloaded the syndicated cartoon and made the decision to include it on the Opinion page. The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes."
A Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said, "We made the decision on Sunday that more forceful language was necessary."
Murphy declined to identify the artist who created the cartoon or the editor who decided to publish it, pending an internal review.
But the Times itself reported Sunday that it was drawn by a Portuguese cartoonist, António Moreira Antunes, and first published by Expresso, a Lisbon newspaper. It was syndicated by CartoonArts International, the Times said.
On Monday, the Daily Beast reported that the Times cut ties with CartoonArts and that it will stop using syndicated cartoons.
President Trump weighed in on the cartoon on Monday on Twitter, tying it in with his own complaints about the newspaper's coverage of him.
He tweeted, "The New York Times has apologized for the terrible Anti-Semitic Cartoon, but they haven't apologized to me for this or all of the Fake and Corrupt news they print on a daily basis. They have reached the lowest level of 'journalism,' and certainly a low point in @nytimes history!"

WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation Monday, ending a two-year run defined by his appointment of a special counsel to investigate connections between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. His last day will be May 11.
Rosenstein’s departure had been expected following the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general. The White House nominated a replacement for the department’s No. 2 slot weeks ago.
In his resignation letter to Trump, Rosenstein paid tribute to Trump, even praising the president’s sense of humor, despite being the subject of some of Trump’s most biting jabs. Trump once retweeted an image that showed Rosenstein and other officials jailed for treason.
Rosenstein intended to leave around mid-March but stayed on for the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Mueller last month submitted his report to the Justice Department, and Rosenstein was part of a small group of department officials who reviewed the document and helped shape its public release. After Mueller didn’t reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed the investigation, Barr and Rosenstein stepped in and determined the evidence wasn’t enough to support such an allegation.
Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 following the recusal of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and oversaw much of his work. His exit leaves the department without the official most closely aligned with the probe as officials grapple with public and congressional scrutiny of the special counsel’s findings and the department’s handling of the report.
He not only supervised Mueller’s work for much of the last two years but also defended the investigation against attacks from congressional Republicans and Trump, who has blasted the probe as a “witch hunt.” In so doing, Rosenstein sometimes found himself at odds with Trump. He was nonetheless spared the brunt of anger directed at Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia investigation infuriated the president, leading to his forced resignation last November.
As deputy, Rosenstein was a central character in some of the most consequential, even chaotic, moments of the Trump administration. He wrote a memo criticizing James Comey that the White House used as justification for the firing of the FBI director, then a week later appointed Mueller to investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. That investigation swiftly grew to include whether the firing of Comey constituted obstruction of justice.
Integral to the start of the investigation, Rosenstein also was present for the very end, standing silently on stage behind Barr two weeks ago when the attorney general cleared the president of obstruction, praised the president’s cooperation with the investigation and maintained several times that there had been no collusion between the campaign and Russia.
In his resignation letter, Rosenstein said most deputies stay in their post for about 16 months; Rosenstein will have served about two years.
“I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens,’” Rosenstein wrote.
The deputy attorney general position is a hugely significant job, responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the Justice Department and the work of United States attorneys across the country. Trump has nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen as Rosenstein’s replacement.
Though Rosenstein’s exit was orderly, his relationship with the president had waffled over time. His job status appeared perilous last September following news reports that he had discussed secretly recording Trump and invoking a constitutional amendment to remove him from office. He hung on for several more months and appeared to turn the page, at least publicly, after a private meeting with Trump aboard Air Force One.
Rosenstein appointed Mueller after Sessions, who ordinarily would have overseen the investigation, recused himself in March 2017 because of his close involvement in the Trump campaign. The appointment came one week after Trump fired Comey, an action Rosenstein laid the groundwork for by writing a memo that sharply criticized Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
The White House initially cited the memo as justification for the firing, but Trump has said he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he fired Comey.
Over the next two years, with Sessions recused from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein set the boundaries of Mueller’s investigation, approved investigative steps and, in place of the rarely seen special counsel, twice announced criminal indictments from the Justice Department podium against Russians accused of election interference.
The investigation overshadowed the rest of Rosenstein’s work even as he joined Sessions in talking up the president’s agenda, including announcements on combating violent crime and opioid addiction.
Rosenstein endured in the job beyond Sessions, but there were moments when his position appeared in the balance.
Trump lamented to The New York Times in July 2017 that “there are very few Republicans in Baltimore,” a reference to Rosenstein’s prior job as the U.S. attorney in Maryland. Rosenstein was appointed to that position by Republican President George W. Bush and remained for the entire Obama administration.
That same summer, Trump tweeted: “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt”
Trump lashed out the following April after the FBI raided the office of his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and months later retweeted the image that showed Rosenstein, Comey and other investigators behind bars.
In September, The New York Times reported that after Comey’s firing, Rosenstein and other top law enforcement officials had discussed secretly recording the president to expose chaos inside the White House and invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows the Cabinet to seek the removal of a president deemed unfit for office.
The Justice Department issued statements challenging the reporting, but former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — who was in the room — has said he got the sense that Rosenstein was “counting votes” about which Cabinet members he could enlist in the effort.
Rosenstein arrived at the White House days after the reporting expecting to be fired, but he was instead allowed to stay on after private conversations with Trump’s then-chief of staff, John Kelly, and the president himself.

Texto completo: By the time day two headliner Sam Hunt hit the stage at the 13th annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the fans were ready to dance at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.
During an interview ahead of the festival, Hunt said he hadn’t played a show in about six months but was ready to get back out to party with his fans at the festival. For a first-time headliner, Hunt’s performance was solid. He came out hard with “Leave the Night On” and transitioned into “House Party,” during which his crew unleashed dozens of giant balloons into the audience, which promptly blew away in the gusty desert winds.
Not all of Hunt’s songs are bangers, though, and he did pick up his acoustic guitar and slow things down a bit with songs like “Take Your Time,” “Cop Car,” a song he wrote for Keith Urban, and he jumped on the piano for “Make You Miss Me” during his encore. The fans danced and sang all the “woah-oh-oh’s” they could in “We Are Tonight,” a song Hunt wrote that was recorded by Billy Currington.
Though he’s not a traditional country artist since he mixes in elements of pop, rock, electronic dance music and R&B into his music, Hunt is a traditionalist at heart. He told the crowd he’d always tip his hat to those who paved the way within the country music genre and invited out fellow Mane Stage player Luke Combs to pay tribute to Brooks & Dunn with a cover of “Brand New Man.” Hunt also paid homage to the late Waylon Jennings with “Belle of the Ball.”
For his first Stagecoach appearance in 2016, Hunt surprised the audience by bringing out G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha and Snoop Dogg during his set, but this year he let his own material shine. After closing out with “Body Like a Back Road,” he did tell the audience he’d see them tomorrow, which might mean he’ll pop up at the festival’s first-ever official after party with EDM artist Diplo at the Palomino Stage after Aldean’s turn on Sunday.
While Luke Combs is an incredible songwriter and his ascent has been a quick one, unlike Hunt he is country through and through. He reminded the Stagecoach crowd when he took the Mane Stage just before Hunt he played this same fest at about 2:30 in the afternoon two years in front of about 1,000 people.
Since then, he’s scored five No. 1 hits and racked up the awards and accolades for songs such as “Hurricane,” “One Number Away” and “She Got the Best of Me,” all of which he put in his Stagecoach set. He also earned his spot, second to headliner, on the Mane Stage in front of 80,000 fans. That fact wasn’t lost on him as he told the crowd “five or six guys on stage get to live their dreams every night” because they spend their hard-earned money to come see them perform at things like Stagecoach.
He’s been touring on this album for some time and hit the audience with a few new songs including “Reasons” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” and during the latter he stopped and shotgunned a beer.
Singer-songwriter Cam has clawed her way up with time slots on the Mane Stage and finally landed herself the coveted sunset hour. The 34-year-old California native showed up in a colorful getup with lots of fringe and bedazzle not unlike a pack of Starburst. She opened with her single “Diane,” her fiery nod to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” which she included near the end of her set as well. She’s always been bubbly, but on Saturday night she let her personality really shine, engaging with the crowd with more banter and confident interactions. She debuted Diplo’s new song, “So Long,” on which she guests, which dropped earlier this week and hinted that she might be over at his set on Sunday as well.
Before performing her first single, “My Mistake,” she told the crowd that the New York Times once called the song “sex positive,” which she took as a compliment. However, “…when women sing about sex it’s like a statement, but when a man sings about sex it’s just another Friday night,” she told the crowd.
“If you think sex isn’t as important to women as it is to men, than I gotta story about yo’ mama,” she added as the crowd cheered. She came out at the end of her set wearing a bedazzled cape to sing her big hit, “Burning House.”
Meanwhile, Lynyrd Skynyrd became the new record holder for crowd at the Palomino Stage, with fans spilling out of the tent for tens of yards in every direction. The band even outdrew its 2014 audience at the same location. Part of the attraction could be that it’s a last chance to see Southern rock’s defining band, as a long farewell tour wraps this year. And unlike many Palomino players, Lynyrd Skynyrd held the crowd’s attention for the full set.
The 75-minute performance packed in the hits, including “Gimme Three Steps,” “That Smell,” “Simple Man,” “Tuesday’s Gone,” “Don’t Ask Me No Questions,” and “Call Me the Breeze” before ending with “Sweet Home Alabama,” during which the crowd danced and drowned out the band with their own singing. But what would Skynyrd’s final Stagecoach bow be without “Free Bird” as an encore?
Other earlier highlights included Lanco’s fun set with its hits “Greatest Love Story,” “Trouble Maker” and “Born to Love You.” Michael Ray had fans singing along to “One That Got Away” and Jessie James Decker got the Mane Stage going early with covers of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and Led Zeppelin’s “What Is and What Should Never Be.”

FLOWER DRUM SONG' BRINGS TRUE IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE

Texto completo: There are at least three versions of the musical "Flower Drum Song" in the world, and the main thing they have in common are the songs of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.
The musical was first based on a 1957 novel by C.Y. Lee, became a not very successful Broadway musical in 1958, then became the first American movie with a mostly ethnically Asian cast in 1961, then was adapted in 2001 by David Henry Hwang ("M. Butterfly," "Yellow Face," "Chinglish," among others).
Hwang's update "took back the story to better represent the Chinese immigrant experience in the United States," said Lily Tung Crystal, who is directing the show for Palo Alto Players. "The original musical was written by white men. The depiction of Chinese immigrant men and women was quite shallow and stereotypical."
But, she added, the movie marked "the first time I saw people like me on film. When I started watching the movie, I thought, Wow, this Chinese American story is amazing.'
"David's rewrites helped depict the Chinese-American experience, and the Asian-American experience, in entertainment. It's about finding identity as an Asian American, and the gap between Chinese immigrants and their American-born children.
"David was able to own that story."
Like Hwang, Crystal is the child of immigrants from China. Her mother is the daughter of a three-star general who served under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Crystal's parents spoke Chinese in the home, in an effort to teach the language to their children.
Crystal said she is "conversationally fluent in Chinese."
Raised in Palo Verdes, in Southern California, Crystal went to Cornell University, where she earned a degree in English, then moved to Shanghai.
"I was there from 1991 to 1999, off and on," she said during a recent phone interview from her San Francisco home. "Shanghai was kind of like the Wild West, changing very rapidly. The only thing that was consistent in China was change. It was a chaotic existence. But with all the building, it was getting very cosmopolitan."
Her work, she said, was "super interesting." She was the launching editor of Shanghai Talk magazine, the city's first English-language magazine. She also freelanced for U.S. and British organizations, such as NBC News, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
She did some acting and singing while in Shanghai. She was in a rock and blues band, and played Amanda in Noel Coward's "Private Lives."
She returned to the United States in 2000, and in 2002, took classes at A.C.T. in San Francisco, and started auditioning. She mostly worked in musicals, but since she joined Actors Equity in 2009, mostly does straight plays.
It was Patrick Klein, artistic director at Palo Alto Players, who coerced her into directing.
"I was acting in a regional tour of Chinglish.' Patrick Klein emailed me and said he'd gotten my name from Jeffrey Lo (playwright, director). He asked me if I would be interested in directing Chinglish.' I wrote back, saying, I'm an actor, not a director, but I can recommend these other Asian American artists. We talked by phone, then met in person, and I said, I'm still not a director, and he said, We like your thoughts about the play, and we want you to direct it.'
"I had never even thought about directing, but he was just very stubborn about pursuing me. He said some of the best directors were actors, and that he could guide me through the process. I thought about it for a couple of weeks, then accepted. One reason I felt safe taking this on as my first directing job was that I knew Chinglish' so well."
The show was a big success, selling a lot of tickets and picking up a number of award nominations.
Then Klein asked her to direct again: "Flower Drum Song."
"I'm feeling really good about it," she said. "We have a talented cast. We are getting to the heart of the story, the immigrants and Chinese-American part of the story. There are some deep themes, about identity and discrimination. We're bringing all that out."
"Flower Drum Song" is about a time in the 1930s to early 1950s, when new immigrants from China, who brought with them Chinese operas and "flower drum songs," were in conflict with a younger generation who wanted the livelier music of the "chop suey circuit" entertainers. The latter form of entertainment made money. The operas did not.
"The chop suey circuit clubs in Chinatown in the 40s and 50s included performers of many Asian, Pacific Islander ethnicities," said Crystal, "including Filipinos, Japanese and Koreans. Many of them changed their names to be more Chinese-sounding so they could market themselves better, and also, in some cases, to escape internment" (as happened with Japanese-Americans).
"So, it's actually historically accurate to have not only Chinese performers (in the Flower Drum Song' cast), but performers from around the Asian diaspora in the chop suey clubs."
The Players production directed by Crystal has a cast of 20 performers, all from the Bay Area, and all part of the Asian diaspora.
The show "is representative of Asian Americans. We brought in a dialect coach and other cultural consultants. We'd like to give a really good representation of issues surrounding identity," said Crystal.
"The original was in the 1950s, and David rewrote in it in 2002. Now, when immigration is such a contentious topic, David's script really speaks to that."

The latter form of entertainment made money. The operas did not.
"The chop suey circuit clubs in Chinatown in the 40s and 50s included performers of many Asian, Pacific Islander ethnicities," said Crystal, "including Filipinos, Japanese and Koreans. Many of them changed their names to be more Chinese-sounding so they could market themselves better, and also, in some cases, to escape internment" (as happened with Japanese-Americans).
"So, it's actually historically accurate to have not only Chinese performers (in the Flower Drum Song' cast), but performers from around the Asian diaspora in the chop suey clubs."
The Players production directed by Crystal has a cast of 20 performers, all from the Bay Area, and all part of the Asian diaspora.
The show "is representative of Asian Americans. We brought in a dialect coach and other cultural consultants. We'd like to give a really good representation of issues surrounding identity," said Crystal.
"The original was in the 1950s, and David rewrote in it in 2002. Now, when immigration is such a contentious topic, David's script really speaks to that."

Texto completo: RAMAPO – Nathan Oberman, a longtime Democratic Party leader and former Ramapo finance official and receiver of taxes, was mourned during a service on Thursday.
Oberman died Tuesday in New City at age 90.
Oberman, a Korean War veteran and widower, worked for the Ramapo government from 1997 to March 2018.
He worked as receiver of taxes and, during his two-decade tenure, deputy finance director. His career with the town came to an end when he was implicated in the federal corruption probe that snared his boss, Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence.
Oberman also had chaired the Suffern Zoning Board of Appeals.
A congenial man, Oberman worked as an assistant comptroller for The New York Times prior to his government career and regaled anyone who would listen with stories of working for the newspaper and politics.
His friends and government colleagues remembered him fondly.
"Nat was like a big brother to me," Ramapo Town Clerk Christian Sampson said Thursday. "Not the domineering type but rather a gentle, guiding and supportive mentor."
Sampson said he and Oberman lunched regularly during the 22 years they worked together in Town Hall.
"We'd share experiences we had over the many years we both worked in the private sector before our becoming co-workers and friends in public service," Sampson said.
When Oberman retired in January 2018, Oberman told the Town Board to a standing ovation, "It's been a wonderful time. A few bumps in the road but a wonderful time."
Oberman's government career ended with a $10,000 civil penalty from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for his role in St. Lawrence's scheme to inflate the town's general fund budget to hide a deteriorating financial situation in order to get better interest rates on borrowing money.
Oberman, who was described as loyal to St. Lawrence, paid the penalty for directing improper transfers of $12.4 million from the ambulance fund to the general fund as part of the former supervisor's scheme.
The SEC also fined the former town attorney, Michael Klein, $25,000. Both men didn't admit or deny of the SEC allegations but in a settlement they resigned and were barred from participating in the municipal bond market.
A federal jury convicted St. Lawrence of more than 20 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy. He is serving a 30-month sentence in federal prison.
Oberman was born March 6, 1929, in the Bronx.
Supervisor Michael Specht, a former assistant town attorney who worked with Oberman for two decades, called him "a gentleman."
"Nathan retired last year after many years of service with the Town and will be greatly missed," Specht said.
His obituary states his funeral services were scheduled for Thursday at the Sanctuary of Abraham and Sarah in Paramus, New Jersey, with interment Cedar Park Cemetery.
Oberman's wife Shirley died earlier. He is survived by his two daughters; Gwen and Roberta.
Funeral arrangements were handled by Hellman Memorial Chapels in Spring Valley.

Lessons in dying from 'Modern Love' husband

Texto completo: My mother's recent death is teaching me lessons that I imagine will take time to realize. One that is clear already is how much easier it is to sit with dying if you know you are honoring the wishes of the one you love.
Because we had talked about these matters years ago, I did not feel any compulsion to send her to the hospital on the Monday she suffered a stroke or at any point along her eight day journey to death. I knew that keeping her comfortable, surrounding her with the love of family and friends, and reminding her of her faith were the things that she wanted in the sacred time of her dying.
I am so grateful to my family, to the staff at Westminster Oaks and Big Bend Hospice, to her beloved caregiver, Michelle, to the Tallahassee Area Threshold Choir, to her "Sparkler" Peggy, and to all who made her last days so rich with the meaning she desired.
April is the month when we are encouraged to consider what we would want or not want regarding medical treatment if we could not speak for ourselves due to a serious illness or at our dying.
National Healthcare Decisions Day was founded in 2006 by Nathan Kottkamp, an attorney in his mid-twenties in Richmond, Virginia. As a 20-year-old he had completed his own advance directives and wondered why his 80-year-old clients did not have theirs.
As a member on the ethics committee of a few local hospitals, he was privy to the sorts of family tension that can occur when the family has no guidance about a family member's wishes and he wanted to make a difference. Nathan picked April 16, the day after tax day, as National Healthcare Decisions Day. It is a clever reminder that not only are taxes certain, so is our mortality.
To celebrate National Healthcare Decisions Day in our community, Big Bend Hospice and the Community Advance Care Planning Encouragement Task Force invite you to a free life-affirming, uplifting evening at Goodwood Carriage House this Tuesday, April 30, at 6 p.m.
We will hear firsthand from husband, Jason Rosenthal, what his wife's loving intentions regarding her own death from ovarian cancer meant to him and to his family at the time of her death and beyond. While potentially depressing, his wife's bright spirit transformed this sad time for the whole family.
On her last Valentine's Day in 2017, his wife, popular children's book author, Amy Krouse Rosenthal, wrote an article, "You May Want to Marry My Husband," which was published in the Modern Love section of the New York Times.
Perhaps you remember reading it, as it went viral. In it she told the world she soon would die of cancer and that her beloved husband deserved another shot at happiness. It is worth finding on the internet and reading this beautifully crafted tribute to their love that begins, "I have been trying to write this for a while, but the morphine and lack of juicy cheeseburgers have drained my energy and interfered with whatever prose prowess remains."
On Father's Day, 2018, her husband and the father of their three grown children, Jason Rosenthal, posted a response in the same section of the Times titled, "My Wife said You May Want to Marry Me." In it he shared what his wife taught him about dying well and living well after loss.
In his poignant column he says, "I have come to understand what a gift Amy gave me by emphasizing that I had a long life to fill with joy, happiness and love." In both of these beautiful columns, precious New York Times white space is left at the end of the article. Amy left space for Jason's new love story to unfold, and Jason left space for the reader in whatever new beginning he or she is embracing.
Jason, who is featured in a TED Talk and several national talk show interviews, will speak with us on April 30 about ways Amy prepared herself and her family for her death and for their grief.
She wrote a last book with their daughter, Paris, giving her wings. She inspired a book that her husband Jason wrote and that will be for sale at the event, along with some of Amy's beloved titles, 29 of which we have in our Leon County Public Library. It is a remarkable and heartwarming story of devotion and love that we know will inspire your heart.
Free "Five Wishes" documents will be available for those who may want to prepare for their own future healthcare choices. 1.5 CEUs are available for nurses and social workers.
If you wish to make a donation to the Amy Krouse Rosenthal Foundation that Jason established in his wife's memory to support literacy and ovarian cancer research, that opportunity will also be available. Light refreshments will be served. Please contact Candace McKibben at 850-671-6029 for more information and we look forward to seeing you there.

If this Dupont Circle rowhouse could gossip

Texto completo: When writing about this Dupont Circle house, it is perhaps off-topic to cite a newspaper article that only briefly mentions it.
But when the story contains the following lede, it is nearly impossible to exclude it.
"Travel weary and vexed by the notoriety caused by her domestic troubles in Chicago and elsewhere, Mrs. Anne Ansley Davis, who sued her husband, David Shelby Davis, because he demanded that she love him, when she really 'loathed him,' arrived in Washington last night," The Washington Post reported in 1909.
It seems David drank too much, and after one year of marriage, Anne had enough. So she came home to daddy, H.S. Ansley, who was treasurer of the Southern Railway and lived in this house.
What does poor Anne have to do with the present-day house? Nothing at all. But a house is more than walls and a roof. It is the accumulation of history and the people who left their mark on it.
The neo-Richardsonian Romanesque rowhouse was built in 1892 for Elbert Robertson, a prominent businessman. Robertson remained in the home until his death in 1901.
Charles Henry Butler, a lawyer, purchased the home in 1912 for $25,000. Butler was the 10th reporter of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. His book, "The Treaty Making Power of the United States," received a glowing review in the New York Times when it was published in 1902.
Although the house was home to several notable residents early on, it eventually suffered the fate of many large houses and was divided into apartments. The Mozart-Liszt Studios, which offered piano lessons, was at one point found here.
When the current owners purchased the home in 1994, very little remained of the original interiors. They hired architect Dudley Cannada to restore them to their original splendor. An oversize carved wood pocket door separates the living room from the entry hall. Hardwood floors add warmth, and Bradbury & Bradbury wallpaper provides elegance. The house has five fireplaces. Cannada designed built-in shelves and hidden nooks to create abundant storage throughout the house.
The space inside the turret is used in clever ways on each floor. On the first level, it is a cozy sitting area that opens to a balcony. On the second level, it is a breakfast area off the kitchen. On the third level, it is a sunroom off the master bedroom.
The master suite, with its spacious bathroom, walk-in closet and separate dressing area, takes up the entire third floor.
The four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 4,270-square-foot house, which has been featured on the Dupont Circle House Tour, is listed at just under $2.2 million.

Slime convention includes 16-year-old who bought a $45,000 Tesla with slime profits

Texto completo: Some kids play soccer. Other kids make slime. Guess who has more money for college?
Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Declaring the "soul of this nation" at stake, former Vice President Joe Biden pushed into the crowded 2020 presidential contest on Thursday and sparked a fierce debate over the direction of the modern-day Democratic Party.
Biden aimed directly at Donald Trump in an announcement video seizing on the Republican president's response to the deadly clash between white supremacists and counter protesters in Charlottesville, Va., two years ago. That was the spur for him to launch a third presidential bid, Biden said, noting Trump's comments that there were some "very fine people" on both sides of the violent encounter, which left one woman dead.
"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation," Biden declared. "If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation - who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen."
Yet Biden will get a chance to take on Trump only if he survives a Democratic field that now spans at least 20 contenders. And his party's more liberal wing was far from welcoming in the hours immediately after he declared his candidacy. Justice Democrats, a group created from the remnants of Bernie Sanders' failed 2016 campaign, came out against Biden on Thursday and spent much of the day assailing him on social media.
As an older white man with often-centrist views, Biden must now prove he's not out of step with Democrats trying to push the party to the left.
He's been taking steps in recent weeks to clean up perceived missteps from his long record in elected office, including his role as a senator in allowing sexual harassment accuser Anita Hill to be grilled by an all-male committee during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings.
A campaign aide said Biden has privately contacted Hill to share "his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country." But The New York Times reported Thursday that Hill said in an interview she was "deeply unsatisfied" and unconvinced by his apology.
Biden also has highlighted his role in authoring the Violence Against Women Act nearly three decades ago, legislation that is credited with reducing domestic violence nationwide.
Still, the 76-year-old Scranton, Penn., native's political liabilities are many.
He would be the oldest person ever elected president, even as his party embraces a new generation of diversity. He's also yet to outline his positions on issues defining the 2020 Democratic primary, most notably "Medicare for All," the universal health care plan authored by Sanders.
Biden is betting that his working class appeal and ties to Barack Obama's presidency will help him win over skeptics. He quickly racked up endorsements on Thursday morning, becoming the first Democrat running for president with the backing of more than one U.S. senator.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump started a recent morning with a pair of angry tweets at The New York Times, demanding that his hometown paper "get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness" over its coverage of the Russia probe. "They are truly the Enemy of the People!" he wrote in his latest withering attack on the free press.
But by midday, the president was hobnobbing in the Oval Office with a group of White House news photographers, signing their photos of him and joking that they should hold a fundraiser at his golf course. Trump kept some of the prints and returned others with such praise as "Fantastic Job!" and "Amazing Talent!" in his distinctive handwriting. He chatted with Doug Mills, The Times' lead White House photographer.
The president's participation, for the third year in a row, in a private reception to celebrate the winners of the White House News Photographers Association's annual awards reflected a sharp dichotomy in how the former reality television star views the pack of correspondents that covers his every public move.
Although Trump has waged rhetorical war on newspaper writers and cable television correspondents, he has been more appreciative of the photographers who produce two-dimensional images the visually minded president has often admired.
Trump has been so taken with photos of himself published in newspapers that aides have requested high-quality prints on his behalf, and the president has retweeted images from photojournalists on social media.
"It seems like he does appreciate the photographers when we go in there," said WHNPA President Whitney Shefte, a Washington Post multimedia journalist who, along with Post photographer Jabin Botsford, were among those honored at the reception. "Last year, he said something like, 'You do great work.' It's a very different message than what he says publicly."
The WHNPA has been meeting with presidents since, at least, the administration of Harry Truman, who was named honorary president of the "One More Club," a moniker that referred to their insistence on constantly yelling out for another photo. The organization is independent from the White House Correspondents' Association, which hosts the annual fundraising dinner that Trump has boycotted since taking office.
WHCA President Olivier Knox, the chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, said past presidents, like Trump, have generally displayed a greater affinity for news photographers than writers or television pundits because they are viewed as less threatening.
While all presidents have been mindful of their image, Trump -- whose private charity spent $30,000 on two portraits of him and whose golf resorts displayed a fake Time magazine cover bearing his visage -- is perhaps the most hyper-attuned to the cameras.
During a luncheon at his first high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last summer, Trump jokingly instructed photojournalists to make the two leaders "look nice and handsome and thin."
Trump's tone is perhaps most striking in the way he has dealt with his hometown paper, The New York Times, which he has denounced as "failing" -- even though the publication has thrived with more than 4 million total subscribers.
In early February, Trump jousted with the Times' publisher over the dangers posed by his hostility toward the press corps and complained that he felt entitled to "a great story" from the newspaper.
But by the end of that month, during a dinner with Kim at their second summit in Hanoi, Trump pointed at Mills, The Times photographer, and called him "one of the greatest photographers in the world."
That praise came after White House aides had attempted to bar newspaper and wire service writers from the photo op because they had shouted out questions at a prior event. The aides relented and allowed in one writer only after the photographers threatened to boycott coverage.
Some photographers have expressed a measure of satisfaction in the access they have to Trump. During Obama's tenure, the WHCA logged formal complaints over photojournalists being excluded from events that were open to official White House photographer Pete Souza, who has since published two books of his work.
Mills, a member of the WHCA board, said that Trump has offered more daily access, for longer sessions, than any president since he began covering the White House during the Reagan administration.
"For a photographer, you couldn't ask for anything better," Mills told the Lafayette (Indiana) Journal & Courier this month. Trump's official White House photographer, Shealah Craighead, has had a lower public profile than Souza.
WHNPA Vice President Jim Bourg, a photo editor at Reuters news service, also said that photographers see Trump more often than they did other presidents. But he added that access at campaign rallies has been more restrictive, and he noted that the president has declined to attend the annual WHNPA gala dinner the past two years.
The group, which also represents video journalists, has issued a critical statement over reports that the White House disseminated altered video of CNN's Jim Acosta after a contentious Trump news conference last fall, and it called on the president to temper his hostility toward the media after a BBC cameraman was assaulted by a Trump supporter at a rally in El Paso, Texas, in February.
But such criticism hasn't dissuaded Trump from asking for favors from the photographers. During a flight on Air Force One last August, a White House aide asked another New York Times photojournalist for a high-resolution print of a photo he had published of Trump boarding the presidential jet a day earlier amid a cloud of smoke from a ceremonial cannon in Fort Drum, N.Y.
The aide handed him a clipping of the newspaper on which Trump had underlined the photographer's name in black marker.

Texto completo: Whether it's Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz traveling across the country in "The Long, Long Trailer" or Iggy Pop spending time at home with Mom and Dad, Americans love their campers. Now the iconic symbol of middle-class success is gaining ground with a new audience: millennials, who not only are traveling the country in them but renting the wheeled living quarters through Airbnb. According to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, RV shipments saw their second-best year in 2018, with 483,672 units. Shipments were down only 4.1% from 2017's record-setting year of 504,600 units.
The surging demand also is fueling the market for classic campers.
Organizations such as the Tin Can Tourists (TCT), a nationwide group celebrating its 100th year in 2019, draw collectors looking for vintage style.
"I like the design, the shape of the unit, to the fabrics used inside, to the woodwork," said TCT member and Hall of Famer John Truitt regarding vintage travel trailers. "I like how it reflects past eras of design and workmanship."
Millennials move in
More than a million American households have started camping each year since 2014, with millennials making up 38% of the 75 million active camper households, according to The New York Times.
Truitt said the group is seeing more interest from younger members, with many in their late 20s and early 30s.
Lauren Albrecht of Holly, Michigan, became fascinated with vintage trailers after her family traded in their pop-up camper for her grandfather's Avion camper.
The 26-year-old is in TCT with her parents and is "obsessed with all things vintage."
"It's cool to see the trailers restored," she said. "That's the most fun aspect of our group besides the people we camp with. Everyone is so creative, and they really care about preserving the history of these trailers."
Edward Byrnes 38, of Commerce Township, Michigan, first became aware of TCT after a member happened to be walking by while he was working on a 1959 Fan trailer in his driveway. Byrnes and his girlfriend, Jessica Neff, ended up going to their first TCT rally in 2017.
"One of the reasons Jessica and I got together was our affinity for vintage campers," he said. "After the rally, we were hooked, and attended as many rallies as we could. That is until we purchased an aging home that now requires much of our time for renovations."
When the couple is able to go camping, Byrnes said he enjoys the "smell of campfire smoke in the air, making memories and enjoying the company of other TCT members."
RV brands are taking notice in the demographic shift and are designing trailers geared toward 20- and 30-somethings.
The Airstream, which resembles a gleaming silver bullet, is perhaps the icon of all the RVs on the road.
Airstream – which saw its fifth consecutive year of growth, with sales increasing to 218% – offers a compact RV called the Nest. Weighing 3,400 pounds, the mid-size trailer offers a two-stove burner, microwave and bathroom. Users can change the colors of the interior lighting with a smartphone app. Prices start at $45,900.
Another popular choice is the TAG Teardrop Boondock by NuCamp RVs. The compact towable, which weighs 2,900 pounds, starts at $15,000.
Even car companies such as Volkswagen are jumping back into the camper game with the launch of its California Camper Van last year. In addition, VW is making sure its conventional vehicles have enough power to carry trailers. The Atlas SUV has a 5,000 pound towing capability.
Can't afford an RV? Airbnb offers RVs to rent. Spend the weekend "glamping" or glamorous camping in Los Angeles in a 1969 Airstream Globetrotter. Campers in the San Gabriel mountains can take in the sights of L.A. such as the Hollywood sign, and the city skyline. The cost: $236 per night.
For something more rustic, Airbnb offers a vintage Airstream in Wimberley, Texas, near San Antonio and Austin. For $130 per night, the RV includes a hot tub, outdoor shower, patio grill, fire pit and a selection of Western movies.

Impeaching Trump will only help him

Texto completo: President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly 200 times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert S. Mueller III definitively declared that "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia - evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do, and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to the New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to pursue impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: Taos Center for the Arts is hosting an event as part of the national conversation "What It Means to Be American" in the Taos Community Auditorium on Monday (May 13) at 7 p.m.
"What It Means to Be American" is a project of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History and Arizona State University, produced by Zócalo Public Square. Since its launch in 2014, "What It Means to Be American" has held 13 events in seven cities and published more than 400 essays on American history and identity, according to a press release.
The May 13 event in Taos - "How Did the American Conquest of the Southwest Shape New Mexico's Future?" - will be moderated by Simon Romero, a New Mexico native and national correspondent with the The New York Times . Panelists include New Mexico Historical Review editor Durwood Ball, University of Colorado historian and Center of the American West faculty director Patricia Limerick, and Pablo Mitchell, Oberlin College historian and author of "Coyote Nation."
The event will address the way that some places became American states after colonists repelled an imperial power. But the conversation will address how the area now known as New Mexico joined the Union when it was conquered by the U.S. Army. The U.S. incorporated the land after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, but its inhabitants weren't automatically U.S. citizens; their status became the subject of negotiations and controversies over who could remain and who would be considered American.
Local co-sponsors for this event include SOMOS, which provides support for a public reception, and these organizations: Taos County Historical Society, the Millicent Rogers Museum, the Couse-Sharp Historic Site and Oo-oo-Nah Art & Cultural Center. The event is free and open to the public. Seating is limited and registration is required. Contact Colette LaBouff at colette@tcataos.org.
For further information about Taos Center for the Arts, contact Susan Nuss susan@tcataos.org or (575) 758-2052.

Texto completo: Over the past several years, an increasing number of New Jersey wines have gained recognition from national and international wine competitions. Wines from the Garden State have continued to impress critics in blind tasting competitions and earned special mention in reputable publications such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
The Winemakers Co-Op will be kicking off its 2019 season with their Spring Portfolio Tasting, a sampling of over 40 premium New Jersey wines on Sunday, May 19 from 1-5 pm at Hawk Haven Vineyard & Winery in Rio Grande of Cape May. Guests will be invited to sample select wines from five New Jersey wineries in an intimate, relaxed setting, rubbing elbows and lifting glasses with winemakers and proprietors of the Co-Op wineries.
The Winemakers Co-op was created by four New Jersey wineries to promote the fine wine movement in the Garden State. Comprised of Beneduce Vineyards of Pittstown, Hawk Haven Vineyard & Winery in Rio Grande, Unionville Vineyards in Ringoes, William Heritage Winery in Mullica Hill and Working Dog Winery in East Windsor, the Co-Op encourages and promotes fine wine production in New Jersey. All wines poured at the event will be 100 percent New Jersey grown from the classic grape varietals native to Europe.
The event's special guest will be renowned wine consultant Clark Smith, who will give wine education presentations to patrons of the event. With live music and upscale casual food offerings, this event should not be missed by any avid follower of the New Jersey wine industry, or any wine enthusiast looking to delve into the local scene.
Smith is also the author of the critically acclaimed book, "Postmodern Winemaking." Hailed as one of the preeminent wine consultants in the United States, Smith was recently named one of IntoWines "Top 100 Most Influential People" in the U.S. wine industry. Presentations will cover the rise of small boutique wineries, the future of the New Jersey wine industry, and a lecture on wine's status as a historically revered beverage.
VIP admission will include a one-hour early entry, with exclusive access to another hallmark of Co-Op wine events — a panel discussion with the winemakers. The talk and guided tasting will focus on the collaborative project of the Co-Op's "Open Source Chardonnay." This talk will also give VIP patrons a chance to ask questions and discuss New Jersey winemaking with the vintners as a group. Afterwards, VIP patrons will have special access to a flight of reserve wines not offered elsewhere throughout the tasting along with a complimentary gourmet cheese and charcuterie spread.
Musical entertainment will be provided by Hot Club of Philadelphia, a gypsy jazz quartet influenced by Django Reinhardt and the original Hot Club of France. Gourmet a la carte dishes will be available for purchase. All guests will have access to a new feature to the annual tasting, the Winemaker's Showcase, where winemakers from each winery will each take a turn pouring a select wine of choice to be discussed and shared with a few guests at a time.
Early bird tickets are on sale through May 5 at $29 per person. Afterwards, tickets will be $39 both online and at the door. VIP admission is $70 per person and is limited to 75 patrons. Youth tickets are available for guests 21 and under at $10 per person. The event will be held rain or shine, with ample sheltered and outdoor spaces for patrons to taste, learn, discuss and enjoy. The event is limited to 500 patrons and should sell out fast! For tickets and more information, please visit thewinemakersco-op.com/events.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO EXPERIMENT WITH PAYING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BASED ON RESULTS: The Trump administration unveiled a new program Monday to pay primary healthcare providers based on patient health and outcomes rather than on specific services and procedures.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that his agency would experiment with two new payment models to “test out paying for health and outcomes rather than procedures on a much larger scale than ever before.”

The goal of improving healthcare outcomes and lowering costs through value-based payments goes back across several presidencies, and is considered an area of bipartisan agreement. Azar credited predecessors under the Obama administration when he rolled out the plan on Monday.

One of the plans involves paying primary care providers a flat fee per patient. If the patient stays healthy, the practice would receive a bonus. But if the patient does not, the practice must pay a penalty.

The second model applies to larger practices and allows them to voluntarily assume different risk level payments. Like the first model, the practices are paid based on patient outcomes. But practices will have more control over how the funds are spent, “allowing them to come up with innovative ways to care for patients, and receive significant savings if they keep patients healthier than expected,” Azar said.

Local entities could also be awarded funds to focus on a specific area, promoting positive patient outcomes on a local, community level.

HARRIS NOW SAYS PRIVATE INSURERS COULD PLAY A ROLE UNDER ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris of California said in a CNN townhall Monday that she believed private health insurers should continue to play a supplemental role under a fully government financed healthcare system. The comments appear to veer away from another position she expressed earlier this year in which she said private health insurance should be eliminated. The Medicare for All Act that she has co-sponsored allows little room for private health insurers, relegating plans only to be offered for cosmetic surgery.

MEDICARE TO RUN OUT OF FUNDING IN 2026: The part of Medicare that pays for in-patient hospital and hospice care will run out of full funding in 2026, according to the Social Security and Medicare trustees report out Monday. At that point, the program would pay a diminishing amount of reimbursement for medical costs. Medicare Parts B and D, which primarily assist with outpatient care and prescription drug access, are expected to be well funded for the foreseeable future.

But Medicare cost is expected to rise steadily as share of GDP from 3.7% in 2018 to 6% of GDP in 2043.

“Notwithstanding recent favorable developments, current-law projections indicate that Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation,” the trustees say in their report.

“Lawmakers have many policy options that would reduce or eliminate the long-term financing shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare,” write the trustees, who are all Trump appointees, including the secretaries of Treasury, Labor, and HHS. “Taking action sooner rather than later will permit consideration of a broader range of solutions and provide more time to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare.”

While projections in the near-term are more certain, the trustees caution that their longer-term projections will be affected by a variety of factors, including efforts to cut costs and advancements in medical technology.

Trump administration seizes on report: Officials drew parallels between the findings in the report and some Democrats’ vision to move everyone living in the U.S. onto an expanded Medicare plan. CMS Administrator Seema Verma pointed to efforts by Democrats to shift millions of people onto government plans at a time when the trust fund was becoming depleted. “If we do not take the fiscal crisis in Medicare seriously, we will jeopardize access to health care for millions of seniors,” she said in a statement.

The White House said the report “underscores the recklessness of proposals to dramatically expand Medicare, which amount to a total government takeover of healthcare that would eliminate private sector options and actually jeopardize seniors’ access to healthcare, while further straining the federal budget.”

FEDERAL COURT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON TITLE X FUNDING ALLOCATION: The Center for Reproductive Rights, on behalf of Maine Family Planning, will ask Judge Lance Walker of the U.S. District Court of Maine Wednesday to block the Trump Administration’s rules on clinics that receive federal Title X grants. The rules prohibit doctors from directly referring patients to abortion providers or from housing abortion services in the same building as other family planning services. The rule, which critics call the “gag rule,” would force all but one of Maine Family Planning’s 18 clinics throughout the state to close.

HOW THE MEASLES VIRUS IS INFECTING HUNDREDS, AFTER BEING ELIMINATED IN 2000: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the measles virus eliminated in 2000, but the number of measles cases has skyrocketed to 626 as of April 19 and is almost certain to set a record in 2019 for the most infections since then. The outbreak of measles this year reflects a major increase in recent years of parents refusing to vaccinate their kids and taking advantage of new state laws that have permitted exemptions to vaccine mandates. For an unknown reason, parents have become increasingly skeptical that the vaccine was safe. Most states now permit philosophical and religious exemptions from vaccinations. All but three states, California, West Virginia, and Mississippi, allow parents to refuse otherwise mandatory vaccinations.

TENNESSEE GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENDS ABORTION BILL TO GOVERNOR: Both the House and Senate chambers of the Tennessee General Assembly voted to enact an abortion ban Monday in the event that the Supreme Court of the United States overturns or alters Roe v. Wade . The bill will be sent to GOP Gov. Bill Lee for his signature. The measure would make it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion, unless he or she can prove that without the procedure, the woman would die. Women seeking abortions would be exempt from prosecution. State legislators were met with protests when the bill was taken up in the Senate.

THE FDA CONFIDENT THAT MMR VACCINE IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE: The Food and Drug Administration reinforced its support Monday for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which they say is safe, effective, and in no way linked to autism. The FDA urges people to get vaccinated not only for themselves, but to protect those who cannot be vaccinated. While the CDC declared measles eliminated in 2000, the U.S. has seen a sharp increase of measles cases, reaching over 600 as of last week.

PURDUE’S SACKLER FAMILY SEEKS GLOBAL OPIOIDS SETTLEMENT: In rare public comments, Mary Jo White the attorney for four members of the Sackler family that controls Purdue Pharma (and the former chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Barack Obama ), spoke with Reuters, saying the family wants to settle the opioid litigation globally. Purdue, the creator of OxyContin, and many manufacturers and wholesalers are facing about 2,000 suits by state, city, and county officials blaming them for the opiate addiction crisis.

Texto completo: Una joven de una aldea en Guinea llegó sola de niña a Southlake (Texas) a principios de 2000. Pero en vez del sueño estadounidense, lo que se encontró fue con un hogar abusivo.
La pareja de Texas que coordinó su traslado fue declarada culpable de obligarla a trabajo forzado por 16 años y de conspirar para dar refugio a un extranjero, informó el Departamento de Justicia en un comunicado emitido el lunes.
Mohamed Toure, de 58 años, y Denise Cros-Toure, también de 58 años, deben pasar cada uno siete años tras las rejas y pagar casi 300,000 dólares en restitución . Ambos son ciudadanos de Guinea y residentes legales permanentes en EEUU . Ahora podrían perder su estatus y ser deportados al país africano, dijo el departamento.
“Espero que la sentencia de hoy aporte un poco de justicia y sanidad a la víctima, que sufrió un trauma incalculable como resultado de los crímenes atroces de los acusados”, dijo en un comunicado el subsecretario de Justicia, Eric Dreiband, de la división de Derechos Civiles del departamento. “Los acusados ​​robaron su infancia y su trabajo durante años, enriqueciéndose y dejándola con dolor y un futuro incierto”.
Según el departamento, los acusados forman parte de “adineradas y poderosas familias en Guinea”. Coordinaron para que la joven viajara sola desde el Oeste de Africa a su casa de Texas, donde s e le obligó a cocinar, limpiar, y cuidar de los hijos biológicos de la pareja.
Touré es hijo del primer presidente de Guinea, Ahmed Sékou Touré, que lideró el país africano por más de 20 años, según el diario New York Times.
Las autoridades dicen que la joven fue física, psicológica y verbalmente abusada cuando no cumplía con las órdenes cuando querían.
La niña, dicen las autoridades, fue golpeada en varias ocasiones, a veces con un cable de electricidad. También reportan que se le insultaba y le decían “esclava”, “perro” o “sin valor”. Se le obligó dormir en un parque cercano a la residencia, le afeitaron la cabeza y la bañaban con una manguera en el jardín como castigo. Agregan que no acudió a la escuela, aunque los hijos de la pareja si asistieron a la preparatoria y la universidad.
“La sentencia de hoy envía un fuerte mensaje a las personas que abusan y explotan: usted será responsable de sus actos viciosos” , dijo Jeffrey McGallicher, agente especial a cargo de la oficina del De Seguridad Diplomática en Houston.
Un vecino alentó a la joven a recolectar evidencia en agosto de 2016, según el Times. Luego decidió huir de la casa con una maleta y un bulto y fue llevada a un centro de servicios sociales.
Scott Palmer, abogado de la pareja rechazó las declaraciones , diciendo que la niña era tratada como un miembro más de la familia, reporta NBC 5.
Según Palmer, la joven era una pariente lejanda que fue enviada por su padre a crecer junto a los otros tres hijos del matrimonio Touré. Palmer dice que esa práctica es común en Africa, cuando una familia de recursos limitos envía a su niño a vivir con una familia adinerada.
“Tenía sus deberes, pero todos los niños tenían deberes”, dijo el abogado. Palmer confirmó que la niña no acudió a la escuela porque presuntamente se había quedado más tiempo en EEUU de lo que permitía su visa y temían que fuera deportada.

Texto completo: La mano dura de ICE bajo el gobierno de Donald Trump se sigue sintiendo con fuerza en la vida de inmigrantes que nunca han cometido un delito.
Según un reporte del New York Times la deportación de inmigrantes del área de la ciudad de Nueva York sin antecedentes penales, incluidos solicitantes de asilo con órdenes de deportación de años o décadas anteriores, aumentaron a 1,144 en el año fiscal de 2018 pasando de 313 deportaciones en 2016, lo que representa un aumento del 266% por ciento, según un informe reciente del contralor de la ciudad.
“Ese es el mayor aumento porcentual de cualquier oficina de campo de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas en el país”. , asegura el reporte.
La administración de Trump dijo que los agentes de ICE están siguiendo la ley al tratar de devolver a los solicitantes de asilo que han perdido sus casos y que por lo tanto no tienen derecho a permanecer en el país. Política que va de la mano con el aumento de la tasa de denegación de asilo que fue de casi el 62% en 2017, frente a un 57% por ciento en 2016, según el Foro Nacional de Inmigración.
Durante el gobierno de Obama, los jueces de inmigración recibieron instrucciones de utilizar su discreción para permitir que indocumentados sin pasado judicial permanecieran en el país, como solicitantes de asilo que habían perdido sus casos, pero a quienes se les daba la capacidad de permanecer y trabajar legalmente en los Estados Unidos mientras se registraran con ICE. Sin embargo bajo la administración de Donald Trump esa política ha cambiado drásticamente.
Uno de estos es el caso de Indra Sihotang , un inmigrante que literalmente se aferró a una silla cuando los funcionarios de ICE trataron de cargarlo en un vuelo de regreso a Indonesia, donde ” la persecución de cristianos como él” se “intensificó”, continuó el New York Times .
Sihotang al igual que muchos otros inmigrantes, fue arrestado durante lo que supuso que era un registro de rutina de ICE. Los defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes han apodado este tipo de arrestos como “redadas silenciosas”.
Tras la escena en el aeropuerto, ni a Sihotang ni a ICE se les permitió abordar el vuelo comercial. ICE una vez más intentó deportarlo, y él estaba sentado en una camioneta de camino al aeropuerto cuando los agentes recibieron una llamada para detener su deportación.
Si bien Sihotang había perdido su caso de asilo hace cinco años, “un juez determinó que el Sr. Sihotang enfrentó miedos creíbles de persecución en Indonesia y reabrió su caso de asilo, que sigue sin resolverse”.

Texto completo: The thousands of images of Fisher-Price’s Rock ‘Play sleeper posted on Instagram include many of babies snuggled serenely in the cloth-covered cradle, free of its harness and surrounded by blankets and stuffed animals.
To sleep-starved parents, the photos and videos seemed to underscore the Rock ‘Play’s ability to lull fussy infants into a peaceful slumber. But the posts also suggest something else: that the risks long associated with the sleeper did not register with many consumers.
Doctors, safety groups and now several lawsuits say Fisher-Price and its parent company, Mattel, should have done more to fix that.
When Fisher-Price agreed this month to recall all 4.7 million Rock ‘Plays on the market, it said it was not at fault for the more than 30 infant deaths the Consumer Product Safety Commission had linked to the sleeper.
Instead, the company said the reported deaths stemmed from the sleeper being “used contrary to safety warnings and instructions” to buckle babies in with the harness and avoid putting other items in the sleeper. (The safety commission advises that it should not be used once children reach 3 months or show signs of being able to roll over.)
But Fisher-Price’s marketing materials for the product had long included phrases like “baby can sleep at a comfy incline all night long” that were at odds with pediatricians’ long-standing recommendation that infants sleep on flat surfaces without restraints.
Consumer safety watchdogs criticized Fisher-Price for waiting years to initiate a recall after first hearing about suffocations linked to the sleeper. Instead, they said, the company let the government issue vague warnings that got little attention.
“This is just not a safe way for babies to sleep,” said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit organization focused on the safety of products for children.
Fisher-Price said in a statement that the Rock ‘Play had “always met all applicable regulations and safety standards” in the United States and that it “included very specific and conspicuous product usage instructions and warnings that we urged parents and caregivers to read and follow carefully.” The company also said it had shared safety information about the sleeper with the government commission “from the moment it was introduced.”
Winding up in court
Fisher-Price’s marketing claims are among the issues cited in lawsuits now being brought against the company.
On Thursday, Samantha Drover-Mundy and Zachary Mundy, parents of a 12-week-old girl who died in September after a few minutes in a Rock ‘Play, sued Fisher-Price, Mattel and Amazon, where the girl’s grandmother bought the sleeper, in federal court in New York.
Fisher-Price declined to comment on the lawsuit. Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment.
Fisher-Price, the suit says, gave Rock ‘Plays to online reviewers after it “determined that the most effective form of advertising for its baby-related products was through word-of-mouth and through ‘mommy bloggers.’ ” The company’s marketing language promoted “dangerous features as selling points,” emphasizing the product’s soft padding and angled positioning, the suit says.
The family also accuses Fisher-Price of lobbying government officials to skirt regulations that could have blocked it from being sold, an issue explored by Consumer Reports in a recent investigation that helped prompt the Rock ‘Play recall.
The safety commission is now investigating all inclined sleepers, which 26 companies sold in the United States as of August. At least one report filed on the commission’s website links another inclined sleeper, the Ingenuity Moonlight by the baby products manufacturer Kids II, to a child’s death.
Inclined sleepers prop babies up at an angle. Many parents say they help soothe infants with gastroesophageal reflux, which can cause spitting up and irritability. But the safety commission said it had received more than 700 reports since 2005 about injuries associated with the sleepers. There were at least eight recalls before mid-2018 linking inclined sleep products to concerns about strangulation, suffocation, falls and entrapment.
In 2012, the commission and the Food and Drug Administration warned customers to avoid sleep positioners for babies. By then, such products had been linked to at least 13 deaths over 15 years, officials said.
About 3,500 infants die in the United States each year from sleep-related causes such as sudden infant death syndrome, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That number declined in the 1990s after a national campaign to raise awareness about safe-sleeping techniques for infants.
The pediatricians’ group objects to infant-sleep products that are set at an incline or require restraints. Babies should rest on their backs on a firm, bare sleep surface without soft bedding, the group says.
Praise first, then problems
The Rock ‘Play, created in 2009, never met those guidelines. But it quickly drew rave reviews. The price - $40 for some models - made it attractive to parents who could not afford to skip work after being kept up all night by colicky infants, one baby sleep consultant told NPR this month.
But problems soon emerged.
Pediatricians and parents said some babies who spent time in the sleeper developed torticollis, a condition that twists the head to one side. Others said it was flattening parts of some infants’ skulls. In 2013, Fisher-Price recalled 800,000 Rock ‘Plays after complaints about mold that could cause respiratory illnesses and infections.
But there were more serious concerns. Consumer Reports linked the Rock ‘Play to 32 deaths, including one in 2011.
A 2012 complaint described a 5-month-old girl falling out of a Rock ‘Play despite being restrained and then dangling upside down from the harness. A complaint last year said a 6-month-old boy who weighed less than the 25-pound maximum set by Fisher-Price had died after rolling over in the sleeper.
Nonetheless, long after authorities in Canada and Australia had blocked it from being marketed as a sleeper, the Rock ‘Play remained popular in the United States.
In August, Ann Marie Buerkle, the safety commission’s acting chairwoman, responded to a congresswoman’s inquiry about inclined sleepers with a letter saying the agency had “ratcheted up the resources and senior staff attention being devoted to” the products. Buerkle cited a 2018 consumer alert that said the agency knew of deaths associated with the sleepers but did not name specific products or companies.
“The warning wasn’t written to gather attention,” said Cowles of Kids in Danger. “No parent ever calls the Rock ‘Play an ‘inclined sleep product.’ ”

Texto completo: The Bears on Tuesday will announce the winners of the Brian Piccolo Award.
To some, Piccolo is a beloved figure, immortalized in a TV movie -- make that two TV movies. But to many more, he might be no more than a familiar name.
So here's what you should know about Piccolo.
1. He led the nation in rushing but wasn't drafted.
Louis Brian Piccolo was born Oct. 31, 1943, in Pittsfield, Mass. His family later moved to Florida, and he graduated from St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, where he lettered in four sports. His parents ran Piccolo's Sandwich Shop.
He went to Wake Forest and as a senior in 1964 led the nation in rushing (1,044 yards) and scoring (111 points). But no NFL or AFL teams picked him in the 1965 drafts, likely because of his size: 6 feet, 205 pounds.
"Four hundred and forty draftees and none of 'em me," Piccolo said, according to an ESPN story. "I was disappointed and embarrassed. Really embarrassed."
2. The Bears signed him the same year they drafted Gale Sayers.
After Piccolo was passed over in the 14-team, 20-round NFL draft, the Bears signed him as a free agent. Piccolo was hurt that first year and played on the taxi squad.
Meanwhile, the Bears drafted another running back, Kansas' Gale Sayers, with the fourth pick in 1965. (With the third pick, they took Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus.)
Behind Sayers, Piccolo played sparingly in 1966 (three rushes for 12 yards). He moved to fullback the next season and gained 317 yards on 87 carries.
In 1968, Sayers suffered ruptured cartilage and tore two ligaments in his right knee in the ninth game, ending his season. Piccolo became the starter in late November. That year he had 123 rushes for 450 yards and two touchdowns.
When Sayers returned the next season, Piccolo again was his backup. On Nov. 16, 1969, in Atlanta, after scoring a touchdown in a 48-31 loss to the Falcons, Piccolo took himself out of the game because of chest pain and a nagging cough.
3. The diagnosis was testicular cancer.
On Nov. 18, a chest X-ray spotted a tumor in Piccolo's lungs. He was diagnosed with embryonal cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of testicular cancer that had spread to his chest. Piccolo began chemotherapy.
At the time, embryonal cell carcinoma was essentially incurable. Now it has a cure rate of nearly 90 percent.
His left lung and left breast were removed on April 9, 1970.
When Bears vice president Ed McCaskey visited Piccolo in a New York hospital, Piccolo was in the final stages of cancer.
"Tears popped out of my eyes," McCaskey said, according to a Tribune story. "He was gasping for breath. He looked up and said: 'Don't worry, Big Ed. I'm not afraid of anything. Only (Ray) Nitschke.' "
In May 1970 in New York, Sayers received the NFL comeback player of the year award. He had led the league in rushing after his devastating knee injury.
"You flatter me by giving me this award," Sayers told the crowd at the ceremony. "But I tell you here and now that I accept it for Brian Piccolo. Brian Piccolo is the man of courage who should receive this award. I love Brian Piccolo and I'd like all of you to love him too. Tonight, when you hit your knees, please ask God to love him."
Piccolo died on June 16, 1970.
"Brian Piccolo, Brian the fighter, Brian of the stout heart, lost the big one," Tribune columnist Robert Markus wrote that day. "He never had a chance. He must have known that, but the knowledge would not have stopped Brian from fighting this thing that was killing him. That was not his way.
"Brian was always a fighter. He came out of Wake Forest the leading college rusher in the nation, and the pros said he was too small. Brian fought it. He fought it and he won because even in the land of giants, it is the size of the heart that matters most."
4. "Brian's Song" aired 17 months after Piccolo died.
On Nov. 30, 1971, ABC first broadcast the 73-minute made-for-TV movie, which focused on the relationship between Sayers and Piccolo.
The movie starred James Caan as Piccolo, Billy Dee Williams as Sayers and Jack Warden as George Halas. Abe Gibron, Jack Concannon and Ed O'Bradovich played themselves.
The screenplay was based on a chapter in Sayers' autobiography, "I Am Third," written with Al Silverman.
"If you're a real football fan, you may think some of the scenes are kind of hokey," Sayers said in 2001. "But it's not about football, it's about the relationship, so I think they can get over that."
A major theme was the fact Piccolo and Sayers were interracial roommates, rare in the NFL at the time.
5. The Brian Piccolo Award started in 1970, the year of Piccolo's death.
The early recipients were Bears rookies who "best exemplify the courage, loyalty, teamwork, dedication and sense of humor of the late Brian Piccolo." The first winner was guard Glen Holloway.
Since 1992, the award has been given to a rookie and a veteran player. Tarik Cohen and Benny Cunningham won last year. Other winners have included Zach Miller, Matt Forte, Charles Tillman, Olin Kreutz, Brian Urlacher, Tom Waddle, Kevin Butler, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton.

Federal investigation into drug distributor a possible 'test case'

Texto completo: The federal investigation into a Rochester-area company's distribution of opioids could soon be ending and is seen as a "test case" for federal prosecutors, The New York Times is reporting.
The Democrat and Chronicle in August was the first to report the Drug Enforcement Administration investigation into Rochester Drug Cooperative, one of the nation's largest distributors of painkillers and other pharmaceuticals. The Rochester Drug Cooperative, or RDC, is a cooperative operation, so its members are the very pharmacies to which it ships medications.
RDC was among the companies sued last month by the New York Attorney General's Office, a lawsuit targeting businesses that Attorney General Letitia James alleged fueled the opioid epidemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives nationally.
Also sued were manufacturers of painkilling opioids, including the Sackler family and its company, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin.
In a story Monday, The New York Times reported: "Now, in what could be a test case, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the DEA are wrapping up an investigation that appears likely to result in the first criminal case involving a major opioid distributor, Rochester Drug Cooperative, one of the 10 largest, people familiar with the matter said."
In August, RDC spokesman Jeff Eller said of the investigation, "We are talking with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York about their concerns and hope to have a resolution soon." On Monday Eller said he could not comment further
While The Times bases its knowledge on anonymous sources, the information about the investigation aligns with earlier reporting from the Democrat and Chronicle.
"The investigation began with an examination of possible crimes including wire and mail fraud and various drug violations, according to three people with knowledge of a federal grand jury subpoena served in Rochester in 2017, but it remains unclear what charges might be brought," The Times reported.
RDC's former chief executive officer, Laurence Doud III, claims in a lawsuit against RDC, its top administrators, and members of its board of directors that he was forced out of the company as a scapegoat for the DEA investigation.
In March 2017, the lawsuit states, the Justice Department's civil branch referred to its criminal branch a continuing investigation into RDC's alleged noncompliance with federal pharmaceutical reporting laws. The DEA subpoenaed company documents "regarding controlled substances, customer due diligence, suspicious order monitoring and reporting" and other aspects of its business, according to the lawsuit.
In November 2017 a federal grand jury subpoenaed additional records, the lawsuit says.
This is not the first federal investigation into RDC. In 2015 RDC admitted that it had failed to report drug sales and the theft of painkilling opioids to the DEA. The company paid $360,000 to resolve the civil action against it.
In recent years, RDC's distribution operations have swelled in size.
"Between 2010 and 2018, Rochester Drug sold more than 143 million oxycodone pills to its customers in New York," according to the attorney general's lawsuit.

Texto completo: Wouldn't it be nice to have a president who could speak another language?
We're thinking about the Democratic candidates now. Pete Buttigieg seems to be the name of the moment, and the Buttigieg folk say that besides English, he's proficient in Spanish, French, Italian, Maltese, Norwegian, Arabic and Dari, a variation of Persian.
Let's go out on a limb and say he's got this résumé category sewn up.
Buttigieg picked up Arabic in college and Dari when he served in the military in Afghanistan. He reportedly learned Norwegian in order to read novels by Erlend Loe, most of which haven't been translated into English.
Obviously, multilingualism isn't the most crucial thing you look at when you're picking a president. Abraham Lincoln spoke nothing but English, while Herbert Hoover spoke Mandarin and translated mining books from Latin.
This is definitely turning into a sterling Democratic campaign when it comes to linguistic diversity. Beto O'Rourke speaks Spanish and Kamala Harris' staff says the senator, who went to high school in Quebec, speaks "conversational French." Kirsten Gillibrand understands French, Spanish and Mandarin.
John Hickenlooper picked up some Spanish in his school and travel. When he was governor of Colorado he gave a speech every year in Spanish, with friends to coach him "so I don't mangle the pronunciation." The working-on-Spanish category is pretty large. Julián Castro was raised in Texas by a Mexican-American mother who made it a point to speak only English to her sons. For years now, he's been saying that he's recapturing the family's other language. Recently, Castro told an NPR podcast that he now speaks Spanish "to some extent."
People almost always appreciate candidates who at least seem to be trying. Bill Clinton wowed the world when he threw in a few lines of German in a 1994 speech in Berlin. Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush both got points for their fumbling Spanish, and while Barack Obama doesn't actually speak any other languages, he has to get an A for effort. Obama has, over the years, delivered remarks in Spanish, Swahili, pretty good Indonesian, pretty bad French, German and Hindi, an endeavor for which the international Hindi Association praised his "good intentions."
It would have been nice, last week, to have had a president who could say a few words in French about the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. He would not necessarily have had to give an entire interview with a French-language television station like Buttigieg did. But a couple of prememorized, read-from-the-teleprompter sentences would have been appreciated.

Texto completo: Forty years ago last Monday, Gilbert M. Gaul ran in his first Boston Marathon, finishing in an impressive 3 hours and 6 minutes.
About six hours later, Gaul and some friends were celebrating in a Holiday Inn near Fenway Park. Amid the beer drinking, their room phone rang. It was the father of one of Gaul’s friends.
The father and son were speaking for a few minutes when the friend turned to Gaul and said, “Oh, hey, you just won the Pulitzer Prize.”
“I’m there, ‘No way! No way!’ ” Gaul recalled last week.
He called home right away.
“My wife, Cathryn, was screaming and yelling and crying,” he said, the excitement still evident for Gaul these four decades later. “I get chills.”
Gaul had been hired at The Pottsville Republican in 1977 to help investigative reporter Elliot G. Jaspin. They would follow a trail of corruption with the Blue Coal Corp. that Jaspin had first uncovered, and the resulting five-part series published in June 1978 won them the 1979 Pulitzer for investigative reporting. Also, the series led to investigations by the FBI and the state House of Representatives, and included a twist that attracted the nation: former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, who had gone missing in 1975, was among the Blue Coal investors.
Jaspin, like Gaul, doubted the news he had won journalism’s most prestigious award when first told by an AP reporter. In fact, he insisted he call the reporter back to be sure he wasn’t the target of a prank.
Not only does that speak to the fact that the award was unexpected, Jaspin said Thursday, “It also speaks to the mindset of a reporter: If your mother says she loves you, check it out.”
Still writing
The original series, The “Great American” Fiasco (Great American was a holding company for Blue Coal), detailed how one of the nation’s largest producers of anthracite was deliberately destroyed by people who outmaneuvered the state government and left the commonwealth holding $20 million in bills. After the original series, which included 11 stories, there were more than 30 follow-ups, including those detailing actions taken by state and federal legislators and agencies in light of the revelations.
Jaspin, now 72, is retired from Cox Newspapers’ Washington, D.C., bureau, but he’s still doing investigative journalism from his home in Annapolis, Maryland. Gaul, who is 67 and lives in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is also retired but says he’s working as hard as ever. His latest book, “The Geography of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas and the Cost of America’s Coasts,” is due out Sept. 3.
Both men left The Republican within a year or two of winning the Pulitzer, and they’ve had no contact with each other in recent years. But there’s little doubt their efforts in Pottsville helped chart a course for their careers.
Jaspin, who was 32 at the time he won, came to Pottsville from Maine in 1972 after a friend who had previously worked with Republican editor Doug Costello suggested he apply for a reporter position.
The Long Island, New York, native was at Pottsville for two years before taking a job with the Lehighton Times News. He returned to Pottsville a few years later when Costello offered him a job as a full-time investigative reporter.
It was at Lehighton where Jaspin met Gaul. Whereas Jaspin had studied journalism in college, Gaul, who described himself as an “OK writer,” had majored in psychology and English in college, but had zero journalism experience. He moved to Pennsylvania from his home state of New Jersey when his wife was hired as an art teacher at Jim Thorpe; he needed a job so he applied at Lehighton.
“I never had one course (in journalism). I didn’t even know what a dateline was,” he said.
About 2 1/2 years later, at age 27, he won a Pulitzer Prize.
Uncovering a scam
While pursuing a generalized story on the coal industry, Jaspin came across records in a court in Wilkes-Barre that “raised a lot of questions in my mind,” he told AP in 1979.
“I got into the Blue Coal thing and it just got bigger and bigger and bigger,” he elaborated last week. “I went to Doug and said, ‘Boy, I could really use some help here,’ and suggested Gil Gaul.”
Gaul, who said he helped educate himself in journalism by reading the New York Times and The Washington Post in the era of Watergate, came to The Republican, and he and Jaspin would unravel the story over the next year.
“We spent an awful lot of time going through courthouses across Northeastern Pennsylvania, tracking down (information and people),” he said.
Neither recalls an “a-ha” moment, but there were some interesting twists. Among them was the Hoffa angle.
Gaul remembers how a court filing showed Hoffa was trying to get his $400,000 investment back from Blue Coal, which was located in Luzerne County. When the filing “disappeared” from court records, The Republican made contact with a Hoffa family attorney in St. Louis. After offering a document that the attorney wanted in exchange for a copy of the court filing Jaspin and Gaul wanted, it was agreed that then-News Editor Jim Kane would fly to St. Louis to meet the attorney, and that’s where the two swapped the documents.
Gaul said they learned that Hoffa’s investment was in cash, “kept in a wall safe behind a painting in a room somewhere,” he said. “You don’t make this stuff up.”
‘Unthinkable’ today
The fact that a 30,000 circulation newspaper had won a Pulitzer - for which Gaul and Jaspin split the $1,000 cash prize - was noteworthy in 1979.
“There’s only one reason it happened and that’s because Al (Uzal) Martz (Jr.) was an extraordinary publisher,” Gaul said. “He understood that doing this kind of reporting was part of what a good newspaper should do.”
He and Jaspin also gave credit to Costello, who is now deceased (as is Kane).
Both Jaspin and Gaul lament the condition of journalism today.
“On cable TV,” Gaul said, naming CNN, Fox and MSNBC, “you can say anything you want no matter what’s behind it. Nobody cares.”
“Opinion has replaced facts,” he said.
Jaspin said he doubts a small newspaper could do the same level of journalism today because of cuts to newsrooms.
“For me it’s heartbreaking,” he said. “I’m watching the destruction of journalism.”
While no one in the 1970s knew what was ahead for the news business, it was impressive that Martz and Costello would hire two reporters solely for investigative work, Jaspin said.
“It was audacious back then,” he said. “Today it would be unthinkable.”
Illustrious careers
The Pulitzer in 1979 was just one highlight in illustrious careers for Jaspin and Gaul.
After Pottsville, Jaspin worked for the Philadelphia Daily News and the Providence (Rhode Island) Journal. He was a pioneer in the field of computer-assisted reporting and, with a research assistant, wrote software while a fellow at Columbia University that moved CAR systems from mainframes to PCs and lowered their cost from millions to under $10,000. Later at the Missouri School of Journalism, Jaspin formed the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. He also taught journalism at Missouri before finishing his career at Cox.
“Old habits die hard,” Jaspin said Thursday. “I’m currently engaged in a lawsuit with the state of Maryland to get computer data.”
Gaul would win a second Pulitzer, in 1990 while working for the Philadelphia Inquirer. This one was in the public service category after his expose on the “economics of the blood industry.” He spent 18 years at the Inquirer, worked briefly for the New York Times and spent nine years at The Washington Post before retiring about nine years ago. He was a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.
He laughs, however, about his naivete in 1979, thinking the Pulitzer proved he was a good writer and that employers would be knocking down the door. He had a lot to learn about writing, he said, and no one came calling. In the end, he described his 1979 Pulitzer as “humbling and good at the same time.”

Actriz en silla de ruedas hace historia al protagonizar un musical en Broadway

Texto completo: Dos triángulos de amor, uno trágico y otro relajado, han hecho de “¡Oklahoma!” uno de los musicales más resistentes al tiempo , desde su estreno en marzo de 1943, hace exactamente 76 años, como la primera colaboración entre el compositor Richard Rodgers y el libretista Oscar Hammerstein.
Ahora está de vuelta en Broadway, igualmente ambientado en 1906, pero con giros muy contemporáneos a la sociopolítica y el mercadeo el siglo XXI: mujeres liberales, una pareja protagónica es biracial -ella negra, él blanco-; y en el elenco hay una actriz en silla de ruedas (Ali Stroker), algo inédito en el teatro musical de Nueva York, y que la coloca en ruta a las nominaciones a los premios.
Stroker es una actriz rumbo a los 32 años, nativa de Ridgewood, Nueva Jersey . A los 2 años un accidente de tránsito la dejó paralizada de la cintura para abajo, debido a una lesión de la médula espinal. Pero ello no detuvo la meta profesional que se fijó desde que, a los 7 años, vio un primer musical de Broadway.
Estudió y en 2009 se convirtió en la primera actriz en silla de ruedas en obtener un título del Departamento de Teatro de Tisch de la Universidad de Nueva York , con un título en Bellas Artes. Que se sepa, es la primera intérprete en silla de ruedas en un musical de Broadway, donde como todos debe cantar, bailar y actuar.
Su rol (Ado Annie) no es nada sumiso, al contrario, es el personaje femenino más liberal, infiel y pícaro en la trama. Las críticas han sido muy favorables a todo el equipo, e incluso con ironía Ben Brantley escribió en The New York Times, “¿Cómo es posible que el nuevo show más genial de Broadway en 2019 sea un musical de 1943?”
Además se está presentando en una sala muy peculiar, Circle in the Square , que coloca al público cerca de los actores, planteando un reto adicional para el director, Daniel Fish, apoyado en una interesante iluminación de Scott Zielinski.
Aquí la audiencia no está al frente, sino alrededor del escenario, que es más largo que ancho. Para lograr más interacción aún, los presentes son invitados a probar, en el intermedio, la comida que los personajes “cocinan” durante el primer acto.
Este musical “country” o rural está basado en la obra “Green Grow the Lilacs” (1931) de Lynn Riggs, autor de sangre indígena cherokee. Se centra en la vida sencilla de unos granjeros y vaqueros , mayormente ingenuos, celosos y conservadores, amantes de la caza, los caballos, el baile y el alcohol, y para quienes el honor siempre está a un balazo de distancia.
No son en esencia violentos, sino simples en su manera de ver el mundo y resolver los problemas en la mentalidad de 1906, vigente hoy en muchas zonas rurales en EEUU. En ese entonces, Oklahoma aún no era un estado, sino un “territorio de reserva indígena”.
Las coreografías originales se mantienen simples, mayormente integradas a la trama, cuando los personajes celebran en algún establo dentro de su rutina de “pueblo pequeño, infierno grande”, donde la amistad se debate entre camaradería, celos, amor, venganza y envidia. Así, una boda puede mutar a un funeral y luego a un juicio penal, pues también son rápidos a la hora de imponer justicia, al estilo “Fuenteovejuna” (1619) de Lope de Vega.
En su largo periplo, “¡Oklahoma!” fue adaptada al cine y ganó dos premios Óscars en rubros técnicos en 1955, entre cuatro nominaciones. También se ha producido para TV y teatro en varias ocasiones y lugares. En Broadway estuvo por última vez en 2002 y el estreno actual es la 6ta producción en Nueva York.
La más exitosa fue la primera, que sumó 2.212 presentaciones en poco más de cinco años, aliviando los horrores de la 2da Guerra Mundial. Esta vez el calendario es limitado, sólo de abril al 1 de septiembre.

THE REAL EXTREMISTS CONSPIRACY THEORISTS AND ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, OH MY

Texto completo: All of Donald Trump's major policies have failed substantively, politically, or both. His one big legislative achievement, the 2017 tax cut, remains unpopular. His attacks on Obamacare have only enhanced public approval of the program. His fearmongering has cemented majority opposition to his proposed border wall.
But while today's GOP can't do policy, it commands a powerful propaganda machine. And this machine is now dedicated to a strategy of portraying Democrats as extremists. It might work - but it shouldn't, because Democrats aren't extremists, but Republicans are.
The attack on Democrats has largely involved demonizing two new members of Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Ms. Omar is Muslim, and the usual suspects have gone all out in using an out-of-context quotation to portray her, completely falsely, as sympathetic to terrorists. AOC, who calls herself a democratic socialist - although she's really just a social democrat - has been the subject of obsessive coverage on the right. Over a six-week period, Fox News and Fox Business mentioned her more than 3,000 times, invariably portraying her as ignorant, radical or both.
It's surely not an accident that these two principal targets are both women of color; there's a sense in which supposed concerns about extremism are just a cover for sexism and white nationalism. But it's still worth pointing out that while both Ms. Omar and AOC are on the left of the Democratic Party, neither is staking out policy positions that are extreme compared with either expert views or public opinion.
Take AOC's famous advocacy of a 70 percent tax rate on very high incomes. Economists who knew anything about public finance immediately recognized that number as coming from a widely cited paper by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, two of the field's leading figures. You don't have to agree with their analysis to recognize that AOC, far from showing her ignorance, was actually drawing on solid research.
Nor does the public find the idea outrageous. An overwhelming majority believe that people with high incomes pay too little in taxes, and polls show wide support for AOC's proposal.
Is echoing leading experts and matching popular opinion extremist? Actually, what AOC's position on the Democratic left tells us is that the party as a whole is, if anything, to the right of the general public on major policy issues.
Republicans, on the other hand, really are extremists. As Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it in 2012 - long before the rise of Trump - the modern GOP is "ideologically extreme" and uninterested in "facts, evidence and science." For example, major figures in the party routinely dismiss global warming as a hoax perpetrated by a vast global conspiracy.
Or consider the views of Stephen Moore, who Mr. Trump is trying to put on the board of the Federal Reserve.
What you need to know about Mr. Moore, aside from his inability to get facts right, is that, unlike Herman Cain, Mr. Trump's other Fed pick, he's very much a part of the right-wing establishment. He's a former editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal, a former chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, a fixture at conferences like FreedomFest. Given this background, it may not be surprising that he's a firm believer in failed economic doctrines, especially the insistence that tax cuts for the wealthy have magical effects.
What's coming out only now, however, is the extent of Mr. Moore's political extremism. Many of his past statements - like his assertion that "capitalism is a lot more important than democracy" - sound like a liberal caricature of conservatism. But it's not a caricature; Mr. Moore shows us what the right actually thinks.
I mentioned that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the rich pay too little in taxes. Mr. Moore, on the other hand, wants to eliminate income taxes and replace them with sales taxes, which would dramatically shift the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class. And he has called the 16th Amendment, which created the federal income tax, "the most evil act that has passed in 100 years."
He also wants to privatize Social Security, a program that is both hugely popular and the bedrock of retirement security for American workers. Moore would convert it into a 401(k)-type system. He is also fiercely hostile to Medicaid, which covers 65 million Americans.
Finally, Mr. Moore has proposed, in advance, a purge of the institution Mr. Trump wants him to join, calling for firing "hundreds" of Federal Reserve economists "who are worthless." These would, presumably, be the economists who considered low interest rates and monetary expansion valuable tools in fighting the Great Recession, at the same time Mr. Moore was predicting that these policies would send inflation soaring. Guess who was right.
So even if you cherry-pick left-leaning Democrats, a look at their actual positions shows them to be not at all extreme. At the same time, pillars of the right-wing establishment hold views that are utterly at odds with both evidence and public opinion. Republicans are the real extremists.
Paul Krugman is a columnist for The New York Times.

Texto completo: When Jason Frankiewic, a Lyndhurst resident, first began to lunch at Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen in Morristown, he couldn't help but notice the same guy sitting at the bar every time. One day, the man asked him what he thought of the wine. Few restaurants, Frankiewic told him, actually serve wine at the right temperature and too few serve wine in the right stemware. Jockey Hollow does both, he said. "I'm really impressed." "By the way," he added. "I'm Jason Frankiewic and I'm an attorney." "By the way," the man said, "I'm Chris Cannon and I f----n' own this place."
"Own" is a huge understatement. Christopher Cannon is the Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen (JKBH), the longtime abandoned 15,000-square-foot Italianate mansion that five years ago the 58-year-old longtime New York City restaurateur turned into a stunning, bustling four restaurant compound — a cynosure on South Street.
Every piece of artwork, every piece of furniture, every light fixture, and glass, wine bottle, craft beer, and tile Cannon chose and bought. "I found most everything for the place on eBay," said the father of three, a Mountain Lakes resident since 2001.
Why house four restaurants — a boisterous cocktail lounge, a contemporary raw bar, a basement beer hall and a fine-dine seafood restaurant — in one space? "I'm not catering to one clientele," Cannon answered.
He's also responsible for the extraordinary 20,000-bottle wine program that has garnered JHBK a Wine Spectator Award for Excellence. "I seek out wines not from your typical areas — great wines that are well priced," said Cannon, an unabashed, passionate oenophile. His menu lists 60 underrated wines for under $60.
"I've never seen a wine list that compares to his," said Vince Caracciolo, a Florham Park resident and regional manager for a cyber-security firm. "It's made up of boutique wines at incredibly reasonable prices."
Cannon also has a hand on what diners eat at JHBK, proposing the direction and sometimes the items on the menu. If something is less than stellar, Cannon, who loves to cook (every workday he rushes home at 3 p.m. to make dinner for his family and then returns to JHBK), doesn't hesitate to tell his chefs. "I let them know," he said."I'm a better cook than some of the chefs I've hired."
"The only thing I don't do is wash pots," Cannon said with a laugh.
He also doesn't give up.
Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen is Cannon's comeback from what could be seen as a real-life Shakespearean tragedy. For years, he was one of Manhattan's most prominent and successful restaurateurs. "The first five dates with my wife, we would never get a check at any restaurant. When we finally got a check, she was miffed. Now, she knows," he quipped, "I'm a dumb schmuck." It was his wife, a financial planner, who brought the family to New Jersey. "After 9/11, she didn't want to be in the city."
At some point, Cannon and his partner, the celebrated chef Michael White, achieved the nearly impossible: Each of their three restaurants (Marea, Alto and Convivio) were awarded three stars from the New York Times within the years 2007 to 2009. They also managed to receive altogether five Michelin stars.
"We were the hottest thing in New York for awhile," Cannon said.
Two years later, he was out.
"They" — his partners — "forced me out," Cannon said. "It was bad."
For the next eight months Cannon did little but hang with his wife and three kids, ride his bike and feel lousy. "It took me that long to get my head out of my rear end," he said. Once he stopped moping, he knew that he didn't want to quit the restaurant world "This is what I love doing," he said. "I wasn't going to let these guys stop me from doing what I love doing most."
Ergo, Jockey Hollow Kitchen & Bar.
Cannon, who grew up on the Upper East Side with three brothers and is a Brown University alum, was first shown the building in 2010. Built in the early 20th century by the architect who built Kykuit, John D. Rockefeller's estate in Westchester, the Italianate palazzo first served as the home of Theodore Vail, the president of AT&T (JHBK's cocktail lounge is called The Vail Bar).
"I only recently found out that the same marble used here was used in the AT&T building in the city," Cannon said.
After Vail's death, the mansion with its grand marble staircase, super high ceilings and long reflecting pool morphed into the Morristown City Hall (the basement, now The Rathskeller beer hall, was a prison of sorts). And when City Hall moved to another part of town, the estate sat vacant.
"I fell in love with the building," Cannon said. "But my partners weren't interested in New Jersey and I didn't know the Jersey market that well."
But he couldn't forget it. After all, running restaurants is all he ever wanted to do. "My parents didn't take us to restaurants the way parents do now," he said. "But twice a year, we went to this seafood restaurant that was a sister to the Coach House and I just thought it was the coolest thing. I loved everything about it. I knew I wanted to be a restaurateur."
He worked in New York City a bit, then went to Europe, and afterwards did stints at several luxe restaurants in Manhattan — Palio, Judson Grill, Remi. "I did everything," he said, "bought the wine, arranged the flowers, cooked. I worked my tail off."
And it showed. "Chris has it all," said Ben Chekroun, dining room director of Le Bernardin, the exalted French restaurant in Manhattan. "He has amazing wine knowledge, he has management skills, and he can operate a restaurant front and back. He is the complete package."
Cannon loved the work. "A restaurant is like theater. You are an actor. You have to be charming. There's energy. It's happening."
The theaters got more grand and more prestigious and Cannon was getting, figuratively, standing ovations from diners and press alike — then it all unceremoniously ended.
When, after the ugly business divorce, he found out that the Vail estate was still available, he pounced. Twenty-eight investors, $5.5 million and three-and-a-half years later, he opened Jockey Hollow.
"So many restaurants today are pasteurized: blonde wood, same menu, same concept," he said. "Where's the culture? Where's the individuality? The goal of Jockey Hollow was to create a place that can't be replicated."
Stephen Sottile of Morristown, a frequent patron of JKBH, is among many who believe Cannon has achieved his goal. "I've eaten at many of the finest places in the world," he said. "Chris brings the best of everything to North Jersey. It's like you're in Paris, Florence or Venice eating in a nice place."
Caracciolo of Florham Park adds, "He's a consummate host. He's like a pinball, moving from place to place making sure everything is going right."
And it seems everything is going right. "I want to be the quintessential restaurateur," Cannon said. Jockey Hollow, he believes, has helped him become just that. "You couldn't create this anywhere else," he said. "It has its own terroir. It has history behind it."
And most importantly it has Chris Cannon.
Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen is located on South St. in Morristown.

Texto completo: We praise G-d, and we pray the prayer and the peace be upon His Messenger, Most Generous Messenger, Muhammed.
We greet him with the salutation, "sallallahu alaihi wa sallam"; the prayers and the "peace be upon him" and what follows of the traditional salute or salutation. As salaam alaikum rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. Dear believers, Muslims, peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of G-d.
Let me have a few words before giving the substance here, just to set the stage for this. This, I believe, will be the last address that I'll be making to the Muslim community, separating the genders, males and females.
Unless sometime in the future, distant future maybe, I mean like two, three years from now maybe, there'll be a need to do it again. But this will be the last in a series of addresses that I have been giving to you separately. It is definitely for the members of the ASM - the American Society of Muslims.
This is for Muslims who identify with our history in America; those who experienced or lived part of their history, or all of their history; part of it with the Hon. Elijah Muhammad, or under his leadership, and the rest of it since I became the leader.
And that was convention time, Nation of Islam convention, February 1975. It's for you.... I'm not saying that others can't benefit. I believe even a non-Muslim, Christian, or anybody, could sit here and benefit greatly from hearing what I am going to say; they could benefit a lot.
But it's not for them. It's not for you if you identify as a Muslim with the rest of the Muslims of the world, but you don't strongly identify with our history in America. It's not for you.
You're welcome to be here if you're a Muslim, and you belong to this association of ours, the American Society of Muslims; you're welcome to be here, but it's not for you. It's for those who strongly identify with our history in America, beginning with Mr. Fard, called our savior back then.
And, by the way, the Hon. Elijah Muhammad, when he put me out of the Nation of Islam for not accepting him as a G-d, Mr. Fard that is, he said:
"Son, how can you reject our savior, when you know your father, the bad life that I was living, a drunk in the streets, shamed, during the depression, couldn't even come home to my family, ashamed to face my wife and my children, and how he came and changed all that, and now you are benefiting from that."
That's what he told me, and he was correct in everything he said. My reply to him was this; I said: "Daddy, I know he's your savior, and I respect that." He said, "He's your savior, too."
I didn't say anything to that, but I just used a bit of child psychology. I said, "Well, Daddy, I know he's your savior. And I can more easily accept you as my savior, because I know you. You know him."
And it worked, because I'm still here. If it didn't work, I wouldn't be here.
Yes, to my father, I said that and he looked at me like he never looked at me before. He looked like he was seeing something he'd never seen before in me. And he couldn't admit it, but I touched the sore spot, the tender spot when I said that to him.
He later admitted to me, "Son, a lot of what our savior taught us, we were misunderstanding it." He said, "Yakub's history is talking about now, not something that happened in the past." That's what he told me.
I wasn't the only one he shared that with; he shared that with some of his ministers, too. I heard him share it with them at another time.
He told them, "Brothers, a lot of this we don't understand it, that's talking about now." So history like that is very valuable. This is a very valuable and precious history.
Wise people, very wise people in scripture, wise in the study of human society, how societies evolve, how they grow into bigger and better communities or societies, they would be fascinated to hear this - what I'm giving you, and just the hints that I'm giving you.
There's a hint of what happened to our lives. They would be so fascinated to listen to it.
I read a report recently - this is all necessary to get you to appreciate more of what I'm going to give you here today. I read in the Wall Street Journal, no, New York times, sorry. That's where I zzread this article. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times are America's most reliable papers.
Well, I don't know about reliable, but most respected papers. I'll put it that way: most respected newspapers. For some of these small towns, I think their papers are more reliable. I've been to some small towns and they're pretty straight. When they report, they're pretty straight and they keep the paper pretty decent. Not to say that these great newspapers like New York Times and Wall Street Journal are not that, I'm not implying that at all. But I have a lot of respect for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
The article was really on the documentary that showed recently on television, "Inheritors of Faith." And if I recall correctly, it came in five parts, and most of it was not on us. But the last part was on us. Isn't that something; they closed it out on us?
And they didn't call me "Wallace D. Mohammed", they called me "Warith Deen Mohammed," (the) inheritor of the faith. So here they presented our leader, our Imam, Warith Deen Mohammed. They presented him in the fifth part, the last part of the series, and presented him with the title name.
That's the title name, "Inheritors of the Faith," and it showed that this person, his name is that, "inheritor of the faith." The wise in scripture, and the wise in the nature of society, the growth and nature of society, they will know right away what that series or documentary was saying.
That documentary was saying, for the benefit of you who don't know and maybe you will never know, that documentary was saying Muslims are brought over to America and enslaved along with others who were not Muslim. And now these people have trusted G-d, and faith has brought them to be reconnected (again) with the religion that they lost because of the separation from their country, and their people, and their culture, et cetera.
And it is this man that has inherited the faith. That's exactly what they're saying. That's exactly what that documentary is saying, that this man has inherited the faith.
Now let me tell you, speaking to my faithful supporters who don't distrust me, who are not suspicious of me at all, who have their ears open to hear me, not to get something to use against me. I'm speaking to you; this is for you.
That documentary is also saying that this man is the one that G-d is with more than any other of the African American leaders, more than any others in the whole history of this people in America.
G-d is with this man. He has inherited the faith of his ancestors. And he's not just a leader for Muslims, but a leader for people. That's what they're saying. Allahu Akbar!
The young lady worked hard. She's an African American young lady; looked like she was just maybe second year of college maybe. She could have been older. (When) you get older, then everybody looks like a baby to you after a while; you get so old.
So she could have been older, but she looked like she was maybe second year of college or maybe just finishing college. She worked hard. She did hours and hours of interviewing me, and not on one occasion, but several occasions.
She came back and back and she said, "Well, I have to come back again. I have to come back. Can you just spare me some more time?" Yes, I can, because I saw her interest, and I know I value our history.
And I know that as often as we get a chance to have it documented, or to have it put in books, or put in print, so that it will outlive us and those to come behind us will have it to read and benefit from it, then I want to take advantage of that time, that chance, that opportunity.
I don't want to miss such an opportunity. So I make myself available, and to me, that's a good way of spending my time.
I'm not wasting my time, I'm spending my time wisely. That's a real good way of spending my time. It's valuable to us now and in the future. And it's a shame to say this because... well, then it is not a shame, you know that the Hon. Elijah Muhammad did not attract the educated people.
He attracted the uneducated but good people, sincere people, innocent people, people who had been confused in this world and this world will confuse you, and just couldn't believe in this world anymore.
And the Hon. Elijah Muhammad presented something from another world, a different world, different with that that they had been told by the white authority, and they grabbed it and they believed it was from G-d.
And that's why they stayed with it. They were sincere, and they stayed with it. But getting back to the point, most of his following were not educated. I remember when we felt real proud to know that there was someone who had some college education join the Nation of Islam.
That was after I had already graduated from high school when I learned that. To be continued....

Texto completo: Our system of American justice demands corruptocrats like James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, John Brennan, James Clapper, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, Loretta Lynch, Glen Simpson of FusionGPS (who collated the phony "Christopher Steele dossier") and Hillary Clinton begin paying the price for their abuse of power and the ongoing political coup in which they were involved (18 U.S. Code Chapter 115).
This loathsome cabal also included more than 20 other bureaucratic fascists in the DOJ, FBI, CIA and NSA.
During this political coup, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, The Washington Post, the New York Times and other leftist "news" outlets have removed all reasonable doubt they are little more than propaganda arms of the Democratic (Socialist) Party and the corrupt Washington establishment.
The establishment's deep-state intelligence operatives feverishly embraced a "salacious and uncorroborated" FusionGPS/Steele dossier (former FBI Director James Comey's own words in January 2017) full of phony allegations that were used to commit a fraud upon the FISA court in order to spy on the Trump campaign.
Under oath, even McCabe admitted the unvetted dossier formed the foundation of the FISA warrant request: "Without the dossier, there would be no warrant."
Significantly, Hillary Clinton, her campaign and the DNC paid millions of dollars to ply the FBI and thus the FISA court with this "dossier" brimming with fraudulent Russian propaganda.
Failure to bring real justice to these seditious criminals further entrenches the two-tiered, double-standard justice system that disproportionately favors the privileged establishment elite -- Hillary Clinton being one of those benefactors.

Texto completo: Earlier this week Decatur's commission approved a "special exemption application" for a long-planned project on the Bank of America property north of the courthouse.
The conditional use permit for a mixed-use development featuring 194 apartments and about 25,000 square feet of retail initially received commission approval in 2017. That permit included a "Lifecycle Density Bonus" allowing for 38 additional units that were planned as affordable housing.
But since 2017, developer Mill Creek Residential has found groundwater on the site, meaning it can't build the extra level of underground parking required to support the 38 units. The commission decision this week, therefore, eliminated the Lifecycle Dwelling Density Bonus.
The 2.8-acre site is bordered by Commerce Drive north, Clairemont Avenue West and Church Street East, with an alley to the south that will get extended from Clairemont to Church.
"We do want affordable housing in all our developments," said Assistant City Manager Lyn Menne. "But in this case, it just doesn't work. What we are getting is a safer, more pedestrian-friendly downtown. It'll be more about having a grid instead of a superblock."
According to Mill Creek officials, they hope to start construction on the new bank in 60 days, relocating it to the site's northeast corner at Church and Commerce. The goal is to finish the new bank by year's end and commence work on the rest of the project next year.

Texto completo: The tabloid, embroiled
in scandal on two fronts,goes for $100 million
American Media Inc. is selling the National Enquirer for $100 million to James Cohen, CEO of Hudson News, ending an association between a longtime friend of President Trump and the tabloid that illegally attempted to bury embarrassing news about Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The supermarket tabloid, along with two sister publications, is set to be purchased by the head of the travel retailer known for its airport newsstands.
The decision to sell came after Anthony Melchiorre, the hedge-fund manager whose firm controls AMI, became disillusioned with the reporting tactics of the Enquirer and the legal and political pressure that resulted from them, according to people familiar with the deliberations.
The Enquirer is overseen by AMI President and CEO David Pecker, Trump's confidant dating back many years, whose efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election have been the subject of news stories for much of Trump's presidency.
Pecker and his supermarket tabloid have also been embroiled in recent months in an unusually public feud with Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.
The sale of AMI's tabloid business, which includes the National Examiner and the Globe, is expected to reduce AMI's debt to $355 million, the company said.
AMI faced financial difficulty as it sought to refinance more than $400 million in debt and the Enquirer's circulation continued to decline. The paper sold an average of 516,000 copies per issue as recently as 2014, but that number fell to 218,000 in December, according to data compiled by the Alliance for Audited Media.
The sale price of $100 million is a stunning figure for a scandal-ridden tabloid. The New York Times Co. sold the Boston Globe for $70 million in 2013. Bezos paid $250 million for The Post that same year.
The sale to Cohen, whose father founded Hudson News, also includes a service contract under which AMI will provide publishing, financial and distribution assistance to the tabloids included in the purchase. Employees of the publication were told Thursday that they were not moving from their current downtown Manhattan office location, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of AMI, will remain at the company, those people said.
In addition to its shaky finances, AMI faced significant legal risk owing to the efforts of Pecker and Howard and their "catch-and-kill" actions during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Pecker and Howard entered into non-prosecution agreements with federal investigators to avoid indictments for their role in buying and then burying the story of a former Playboy model who alleged having an affair with Trump.
In August, just as the two men were finalizing those agreements, the company's board of directors started looking for ways to unload the tabloid business "because they didn't want to deal with hassles like this anymore," said a person familiar with the board's deliberations.
As part of that agreement, the company admitted to making the hush-money payments to "influence the election." Also as part of the arrangement, the company said it would not commit any crime for three years. Doing so could result in "prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which this office has knowledge," according to the agreement.
The Enquirer's reporting on Bezos's extramarital affair led to Bezos accusing the Enquirer of an attempt to extort him. Prosecutors are now investigating those claims, which put the Enquirer and its top officers in a position of potentially violating their agreements.
"The sale of these brands shows their vitality in today's newsstand marketplace where they continue to generate nearly $30 million in profit annually," Pecker said in a statement. "James and his team at Hudson have a proven history in publishing and have the market-based knowledge and long-term vision needed to ensure the growth of these brands."
In announcing the deal, Cohen said he planned to utilize the Enquirer's archive in documentaries and podcasts.

Texto completo: On the morning of March 10 an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner, in clear weather, crashed shortly after leaving Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. The plane was en route to Nairobi, the capital of neighboring Kenya. This same model aircraft was used by Indonesian airline Lion Air when it went down in Indonesia just four months earlier: Lion Air Flight 610 killed all 189 passengers, including the air crew.
Ethiopian Airlines, the flag carrier of the East African nation, immediately ground its remaining Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts "until further notice."
A statement issued by the African carrier read: "Although we don't yet know the cause of the accident, we had to decide to grounded the particular fleet as extra safety precaution."
Other airlines followed suit. On March 13, all airlines using the plane, except U.S. domestic carriers, had grounded the Max 8 with the addition of the European Union issuing a statement preventing the plane from using its air space.
By the later part of the same date U.S. president Donald Trump announced all Max 8 aircraft would be grounded until further notice.
Rumors that the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 would seriously damage Ethiopia's premier airlines relationship with Boeing may be overrated. It does not take into consideration the state-run airline's history. Ethiopia's airline actually had its beginnings with a delegation visiting New York in 1945 armed with a request to American officials to assist it in launching a commercial airline for all its domestic service.
Ethiopian Airlines, the country's national carrier, was founded on Dec. 30, 1945, by Emperor Haile Selassie. The airline commenced operation in 1946, with a weekly service between Addis Ababa and Cairo with five Douglas DC-3 propeller-driven aircrafts.
Beginning with assistance from the now defunct U.S. based Trans World Airlines and "later Boeing's technological support, Ethiopian Airlines has over the decades transformed into Africa's largest and most successful airline," reported Quartz Africa.
In 1962 with African liberation movements and the overthrow of colonial regimes in full effect, Ethiopia became the first African airline to secure and pilot the Boeing 720B. According to Quartz, the manufacturer was also critical in Ethiopia's expansion strategy, "whether in the short to medium-range routes or nonstop long-distance flights to Europe (1963), China (1973), and the United States (1984). In 1977, the state carrier acquired a Boeing 720B simulator, making it autonomous from foreign airlines when it came to pilot training, and kick-starting the journey to establish a leading aviation academy."
Much of the Western press has suggested that Ethiopian Airlines maybe complicii in the Boeing 737 Max 8 crash. Ethiopia strongly refuted what it said were baseless and factually inaccurate allegations. "All the allegations ... are false defamations without any evidence, collected from unknown and unreliable sources to divert attention from the global grounding of the B-737 MAX airplanes."
A recent New York Times headline, "Can Ethiopia's Long Love Affair With Boeing Survive the 737 Max Crash?" said that Ethiopia and Boeing maintained such "close ties" that, until three years ago, it didn't purchase planes from rival Airbus.
With the airline's entire 737 Max 8 fleet grounded and with over 4000 orders on hold Ethiopia is the least of Boeings problems. "But once the investigations are over and the dust has settled," according to the Times, "the company may need to work hard to restore its image in a country [Ethiopia] where its reputation was once beyond challenge."
To add to Boeing's woes a "scandal is emerging." It appears that, nearly 10 years ago, to stay competitive with its rival manufacturing competitor Airbus, Boeing not only cut costs, but also possibly safety by adding to the 737 a nacelle (housing that holds engine and fuel) too large for the aircraft. The 737 is lower to the ground than the Airbus A320, and the new more fuel efficient engine has a larger diameter, which, unlike the Boeing aircraft, the Airbus without modifications is able to accommodate.
Putting ill-fitting engines on airlines to stay competitive instead of building a new plane is the height of corporate greed at the expense of safety.
The problem with tins emerging development, as revealed in some aviation publications and reported on Vox.com, was "to get the engine under the 737 wing, engineers had to mount the engine nacelle higher and more forward on the plane. But moving the engine nacelle (and related change to the nose of the plane) changed the aerodynamics of the plane, such that the plane did not handle properly at a high angle of attack. That, in term, led to the creation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). It fixed the angle-of attack problem in most situations, but it created new problems in other situations when it made it difficult for pilots to directly control the plane without being overridden by the MCAS."
Note: According to pilot and software engineer, Dave Kammeyer, "don't blame software." Iťs being used to get around a whole host of problems.
A possible reason for lessening of U.S. aviation safety standards, reported FORBES, is tli at since 2005 the FAA "sílifted its approach for how it delegated authority outside the agency, creating a new program through which aircraft manufacturers like Boeing could choose their own employees to be the designees and help certify planes."
New information from the Indonesia, Lion Air 737 Max investigation links a "faulty sensor... to the jetliner's deadly crash...," reported the financial publication Bloomberg. On April 4, according to CBS News, the Ethiopian government and Ethiopian Airlines briefed reporters on its initial findings stating "preliminary report show the doomed jet's crew followed guidance provided by Boeing on how to fly the plane, including emergency procedures, but failed to regain control of the jet, putting the blame largely on the manufacturer."
ABC News reported, "The Ethiopian Airlines crew commanding the Boeing 737 Max 8, which crashed last month and killed all 157 people on board, followed all recommended procedures but couldn't regain control of the doomed flight."
The fact that Boeing executives are deliberately offering every explanation for the crash but the fact the 737⅛ engine nacelle changed the aerodynamics of the plane, and thus bringing into question a pilot's ability to control it, is telling.
Before the accident, according to the British publication The Independent, "If you want to fly on the continent's best airline, with the world's most modern aircraft, then it has to be Ethiopian. During traumas from famine to revolution, the airline has managed to deliver those two elusive qualities: customer service and profit."
If Ethiopian Airlines can overcome all manner of adversity, and still be Africa's No. 1 airline, why would a plane accident, which many carriers before it has suffered, cause the Western press to suggest otherwise?
Ethiopian Airlines currently flies to over 50 African cities in what is the largest network by a national carrier. Currently it's in discussions to assist at least a dozen African countries to establish and manage their carriers. On top of that, the airline is in its seventh decade of operation and has become Africa's leading carrier in terms of efficiency and operational success, reported AfricaNews.com/

Texto completo: New York • The National Enquirer is being sold to the former head of the airport newsstand company Hudson News following a rocky year in which the tabloid was accused of burying stories that could have hurt Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.
Tabloid owner American Media said Thursday it plans to sell the supermarket weekly to James Cohen. Financial terms were not immediately disclosed for the deal, which included two other American Media tabloids, the Globe and the National Examiner.
American Media said last week that it wanted to get out of the tabloid business to focus on its other operations, which includes its teen brand and broadcast platforms.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan agreed last year not to prosecute American Media in exchange for the company's cooperation in a campaign finance investigation. That probe eventually led to a three-year prison term for Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen for campaign violations among other charges.
American Media admitted it had paid $150,000 to keep former Playboy model Karen McDougal quiet about an alleged affair with Trump to help his campaign. Trump has denied an affair.
The sale would end a longtime relationship between the National Enquirer and Trump. Under the aegis of American Media CEO David Pecker, the tabloid has for years buried potentially embarrassing stories about Trump and other favored celebrities by buying the rights to them and never publishing in a practice called "catch-and-kill."
The Associated Press reported last year that Pecker kept a safe in the Enquirer's office that held documents on buried stories, including those involving Trump.
Whether James Cohen has any allegiances to Trump is not clear. While he was a registered Republican as late as 2017, according to Nexis records, he has given to both Republicans and Democrats. That included $17,300 in 2016 to an arm of the Democratic National Committee and $2,500 to the Republican National Committee in 2012.
News of the sale comes two months after Amazon chief Jeff Bezos publicly accused the National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him by threatening to publish explicit photos of him.
An American Media attorney denied the charge, but it threatened potentially big legal costs by upending American Media's non-prosecution agreement in the hush money case. The AP reported that federal prosecutors were looking into whether the publisher violated terms of the deal, which included a promise not to break any laws in the future.
The Bezos accusation comes at a difficult time for American Media. It has financed several recent acquisitions with borrowed money and has been struggling under a heavy debt load. American Media said the Cohen deal would help reduce the amount it needs to pay back, leaving it with $355 million in debt.
The Washington Post, which earlier reported the sale, said Cohen will pay $100 million in the deal.
Cohen's family had run a magazine and newspaper distributor for decades before his father branched into newsstand stores in 1980s, starting with a single one at LaGuardia Airport. Before he died in 2012, the father had opened more than 600 stores.
After the death, James Cohen's niece alleged her uncle had cheated her out of her inheritance. She lost the case.
The family sold a majority stake in the chain about a decade ago. The business is now owned by Dufry, an operator of duty-free stores in which James Cohen is a major shareholder.
Cohen still owns a magazine and newspaper distributor called Hudson News Distributors. In addition, he runs a real estate developer and a publishing company, which owns Gallerie, an art and design magazine.
Cohen has reportedly been involved in American Media deals before. The New York Times reports that, in 2011, Cohen invested in the company’s American edition of OK!, a British tabloid.

How tragic church fires can inspire decency in others

Texto completo: Seeing the iconic church on fire was stunning. After firefighters extinguished the inferno, the heartbreaking scenes of the charred church, which had been a beloved home for generations of her family, were almost too much for Monica Harris.
"Seeing the church in the condition it is now," the 57-year-old Christian said for a story in The New York Times, "it’s almost like losing a family member."
That loss, and the beauty destroyed by that blaze, hadn’t even had time to register before a man of the cloth added some perspective.
"They burned down a building. They didn’t burn down our spirit," he said.
The gofundme rebuilding fund for three overwhelmingly black churches burned in Louisiana in the past month had topped out under $100,000 until Monday’s fire at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris reignited the cause. None of those structures was on par with the world-famous, centuries-old, magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame, but black churches matter. As of Wednesday, online donations for the three black churches were nearing the $1.8 million goal. Donations for Notre Dame are expected to top $1 billion.
"As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana," Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday. Journalist Yashar Ali and CNN anchor Jake Tapper posted similar tweets asking people to remember those black churches, too.
As the world watched the flames consuming the iconic spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame, people used words such as heartbreaking and tragic to describe the damage to the centuries-old architectural wonder, which is a monument to Christianity. But one of the first online comments I read came from a suburban Catholic priest, who noted, "This is really, tragically sad. But God is NOT confined to even beautiful and ancient structures." He went on to explain how asylum-seekers and other people suffering hardships deserve that same outpouring of empathy and assistance.
Easter celebrates the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead, the keystone of the Christian faith. But it also offers a more universal message that bad things can get better. Easter signals hope and a new start.
On the same day Notre Dame was burning, every Major League Baseball player, coach and umpire wore a No. 42 jersey to honor Jackie Robinson, the first black player allowed to play in the majors. It is heartbreaking and tragically sad that there was a time when black players were banned from the National Pastime, but in honoring Robinson, we celebrate how the world can change for the better.
At the same time, we can continue to find it heartbreaking and tragically sad that MLB now is investigating racist messages sent to Carl Edwards Jr., a relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who got off to a bad start this season and happens to be black.
Clearly, today’s world gives us plenty of opportunities to right wrongs and make bad things better. Louisiana officials on Monday charged a 21-year-old white man with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires set at the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, as well as the St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre.
Every cowardly and hateful act can inspire a commitment to decency and good in others. Not only can we take some comfort in the fact nobody died in any of these tragic church fires, we can also find something good in the response of ordinary people.

Texto completo: I often think of the library as a place where things happen – you can conduct research, attend a program, meet with neighbors, read books, watch movies, learn a new skill. While all these things are true, the library is first and foremost a depository of knowledge and information. From April 21-27, the American Library Association recognizes Preservation Week. It reminds us that libraries play a key role in preserving our history and our stories and that library collections account for almost two-thirds of the nation's collections held in institutions. These collections include books, manuscripts, photographs, prints and drawings and objects that connect us to our past, present and future.
Those interested in family history are familiar with the Broadmoor Branch's Genealogy Collection, one of the best in the South. But did you know that there are many more special collections housed at Shreve Memorial Library worth checking out during Preservation Week? The third floor of the Main Branch in downtown Shreveport houses several special collections. These collections include the Federal Depository Collection, a collection of specialized government documents; the Louisiana Collection, a collection of Louisiana history, authors, cookbooks and magazines; and the Petroleum Collection, a collection of publications and reference materials relating to the oil and gas industry dating back to 1917. You can get a glimpse into the past through the Microform Collection which includes back issues of The Shreveport Times, Shreveport Journal, Times Picayune, and various other newspapers, or brush up on your understanding of the law through the Main Branch's Law Collection, which contains books on pro se (or do it yourself) legal topics under Louisiana Law.
Not all collections are housed in libraries. Personal artifacts and family treasures passed down from one generation to the next are great sources of knowledge and are collections worth preserving. I, personally, love flipping through old photo albums and reading old cards and letters. So how do you preserve these precious memories for years to come? ALA suggests storing items in a comfortable environment away from direct sunlight and handling papers, books, and photos with clean, dry hands.
As we celebrate Preservation Week, I hope to see you digging through the stacks of Shreve Memorial Library's Special Collections. There's no telling what gems of information, history and art we will find. See you at the library!

Texto completo: 'Stony the Road'
By Henry Louis Gates Jr., Penguin, 296 pages, $30
Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. felt the first stirrings of what would become his latest book, "Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow," during his 1969-70 sophomore year at Yale. He was enrolled in his first African-American history course and was introduced to Reconstruction, the brief period after the Civil War when blacks exerted their newfound rights and leadership in the former slave states. The course also covered the racist reaction to Reconstruction, known as Redemption, Gates writes, "when the former Confederate states 'redeemed' themselves at the expense of black rights" and took up with vehemence and violence the dictates of white supremacy. "I have connected Reconstruction with Redemption ever since, as the apex and nadir ... of the African American experience."
During that academic year, Gates also took a course on the Harlem Renaissance, a period of black intellectual and artistic ferment from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s; he continued to study that period and the emergence in those years of what became known as the New Negro. "In this book," Gates writes, "I attempt to show that the New Negro was the black community's effort to roll back Redemption, which was itself a rollback to Reconstruction." The result is "Stony the Road" -- as Gates describes it, "an intellectual and cultural history of black agency and the resistance to and institutionalization of white supremacy." His title is borrowed from James Weldon Johnson's 1900 poem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," known as the Negro national anthem: "Stony the road we trod/ Bitter the chast'ning rod."
Gates' book covers territory well-known to scholars and Civil War buffs: how our received wisdom of the "tragic decade" of Reconstruction flows from two polluted streams, the myth of the Lost Cause and the Jim Crow segregation mania. For those wanting to know more about this dismal story of racial hysteria in places as high as Woodrow Wilson's White House and as low as the blackface minstrel show, "Stony the Road" is excellent one-stop shopping.
With a main text of about 250 pages, Gates offers a compressed yet surprisingly comprehensive narrative sweep, in addition to the usual catalog of political sins, an overview of the lesser-known stories of how our "best" universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, allowed two pseudo-disciplines -- "scientific racism" and eugenics -- to create a false dogma of black misrule and white suffering at the center of the Reconstruction narrative.
In tracing the emergence of the New Negro, Gates notes that Booker T. Washington "was named the very first new Negro" by the white press. But Washington was "problematic" -- he called for a regime of economic cooperation and social separation as a necessary condition of black progress. Gates observes that Washington was gradually eclipsed by more militant followers of Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois. The latter's scholarship in combination with the Harlem Renaissance saw the emergence of a "newer New Negro" and vigorous pursuit of the rights of equal treatment.
Gates is at his most fluent in defining the newer Negro as a feature of the Harlem Renaissance powered by Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and other key figures of the black creative pantheon. Locke is depicted as a flawed visionary who believed artistic achievement would be as sure a path to equality as politics or economics. "They saw themselves as members of the black upper class," Gates writes, "a cosmopolitan mobile elite that could be integrated into American society, even if 'the slow-moving black masses' (as head of the Urban League Charles S. Johnson would call them) could not."
Notwithstanding his high regard for the Renaissance, Gates clearly tilts toward politics, rather than art-for-art's-sake or pure commerce, as the most reliable vehicle for black progress. "No people, in all of human history, has ever been liberated by the creation of art. None," Gates asserts with a sense of certainty that is a signature of his rhetoric.

Clippers hope to avoid having to mount staggering comebacks vs. Warriors

Texto completo: PLAYA VISTA — You’ve just set an NBA record for biggest postseason comeback in NBA history – what are you going to do next?
Settle in for a critical film session, naturally.
“We came back and what we did was historic, but the reality tells a whole different story,” said Coach Doc Rivers, whose team’s epic comeback evened their first-round Western Conference playoff series with the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors at 1-1. Game 3 is Thursday night at Staples Center.
“The reality is that we were down 31, and the reality is we’re not going to win a lot of games against anybody doing that. The reality is they’re shooting over 50 percent and there’s a lot of realities in this series that don’t bode well unless we do something about it.”
The reality, Rivers stressed before (and likely at) Wednesday’s practice: “We have to play better. We understand we won the game, but we’re not going to win the game playing that way. I think we fully understand that. If not, we’re about to when we watch film.”
Yes, the Clippers outscored Golden State 72-37 – the best offensive 19 minutes of not just the season, but “of their lives,” Rivers said – down the stretch to win Game 2. But prior to the 7:31 mark of the third quarter on Monday, they were being outscored 215-167 in the series.
“I mean, 131 points (total),” said Clippers guard Patrick Beverley, whose job it has been to harass Kevin Durant. “Ain’t nobody really playing no defense, but we were fortunate to get stops when they mattered, to get loose balls when they mattered.”
They had squandered opportunities in Game 1 – which was encouraging, insisted the Clippers, who were pleased to have had chances. And it was true: Before the turnaround began in the third quarter, the Clippers had forced 28 turnovers. The problem was that they’d turned them into only 23 points. (Conversely, they’d coughed it up 27 times themselves, miscues the Warriors converted to 34 points).
Except for the production of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell off the bench, the Clippers hadn’t been nearly aggressive enough for Rivers’ liking – especially because against the Warriors, offense might be the best defense.
“We’ve just got to be more in sync offensively,” Clippers guard Landry Shamet said Wednesday. “I know they scored 70 points in the first half, but offensively, I think that made a big difference (in the comeback). We were more in sync, making plays for each other, on the same page. Our flow was a whole lot better in the second half.”
In the final 24 minutes, the Clippers’ offensive assertiveness and togetherness was rewarded: They went 17 for 19 from the free-throw line (to which they made seven more trips than in the opening half), and they shot 30 for 45 from the field, including 8 for 14 from 3-point range.
And as the Clippers – the biggest first-round underdogs in 30 years, at 100-1 – rallied from a statistical 0.1 percent probability of winning with 8:30 on the clock Monday, the nation took notice, either that night as it happened or waking up to the stunning result the next morning.
USA Today proclaimed the Clippers “the best thing to happen to the NBA playoffs,” the New York Times profiled Lou Williams (whose 36 points and 11 assists in the game were more than any other reserve in a postseason game since 1985), and ESPN invited Landry Shamet to share his reliable insight on “The Jump.”
“It’s been good,” Shamet said Wednesday of the attention, but he quickly added, “at the end of the day we’re 1-1 right now. By no means are we satisfied or feel like we’ve accomplished anything in its entirety, at least.
“It’s a good feat to come from behind and tie the series, but me personally, I’m trying to move past all that because we know we probably just (irritated) a sleeping bear. They’re going to be ready to go tomorrow.”
“I don’t care,” about the bear, Rivers said. “Because we have to have an extra something.”
And then, with his players taking their seats on folding chairs in a semi-circle around a television monitor, Rivers went to show them how.

Texto completo: Corea del Norte dijo el jueves que su líder, Kim Jong-un , había supervisado la prueba de disparo de un nuevo tipo de arma guiada táctica, informa New York Times.
La Agencia Central de Noticias Central de Corea del Norte no especificó qué tipo de arma estuvo involucrada en la prueba, por lo que no está claro si fue un misil.
Corea del Norte había declarado una moratoria sobre armas nucleares y pruebas de misiles de largo alcance, después del lanzamiento de un misil balístico intercontinental en noviembre de 2017.
El presidente Trump consideró la moratoria autoimpuesta del Norte como el mayor logro de su administración en sus tratos con Corea del Norte.
Estados Unidos ha intentado negociar con Corea del Norte durante meses para poner fin a sus programas de armas nucleares y misiles cada vez más sofisticados. Pero la última reunión cumbre en febrero entre Trump y Kim terminó abruptamente sin un acuerdo.
Aunque estaba claro de inmediato qué tipo de arma se disparó, la acción marcaría la primera prueba pública de armas desde la cumbre del presidente Trump con Kim en Hanoi en febrero y una señal de desafío por parte de Kim tras un punto muerto en las conversaciones de desnuclearización de alto nivel.

In 2007 The New York Times described her as "far and away, this country's best-selling poet." Mary Oliver believed poetry could be for every one and entertained and inspired as she documented her ongoing relationship with her natural surroundings. Lines from her poetry, such as "What will you do with your one wild and precious life?" have become a part of our consciousness-raising culture and can be found on inspirational posters.
Tamara Kist is a poet and the author of The Seven-Week Chakra Cleanse: A Guide to Choosing Happiness, Creating Satisfaction and Evolving Your Consciousness (now available on Amazon in paperback!)

Terry Loncaric, a Hampshire poet, is the author of Crashing in Velvet, an original collection of poetry. Her poems have appeared on storefronts, in magazines, journals, newspapers, and anthologies. She is the founder of Poetry Power, a unique collaboration of teen and adult poets at Hoffman Estates High School. She has lectured on feature writing at Columbia College and Roosevelt University. She has worked as a reporter, editor, feature writer, and teaching assistant.

Years later she has resurrected it as a network of artists of all disciplines, all dedicated to raising the global vibe. A Celebration of Mary Oliver is their first public event. Ms. Kist hopes to have many more interactive events in the future, featuring music, dance and art side by side.

Texto completo: Social media can be a fun way to keep tabs on your favorite famous people and even get the chance to have some one-on-one communication with them. But cybercriminals are taking advantage of some fangirls and fanboys by impersonating the people they love to follow online.
Ben Nimmo, with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Gizmodo there are millions of social media accounts that don’t belong to the person they claim to be.
The people behind these fraudulent accounts use various ways to try scamming innocent people, and most involve getting their hands on your money. Some imposter accounts of celebrities will try to sell followers tickets to fake private shows; others will claim to be supporting a charity and ask followers to send money. Many times, the fake famous people will attempt to strike up a romantic online relationship with a unsuspecting fan, only to attempt to get money from the follower using some lame story.
Country music stars got together last year to plead with fans to be cautious when following them online and to always look for the blue check that indicates a verified account on most social media networks. The website Social Media Safety Nashville reiterates, “Your favorite artists have not and will not ever ask you for your personal information or anything like that.” A video on the website has singers such as Blake Shelton and Keith Urban encouraging country music fans to report fakes.
It’s not difficult to create a fraudulent social media account since these networks only ask for an email address. But Facebook (which also owns Instagram) told The New York Times it had added software that automatically detects fakes and that it removed hundreds of millions of accounts in just a few months last year. But The New York Times also found in one of Facebook’s earnings documents that the company estimates it still has between 20 million and 80 million fake accounts on the site.
There are ways to steer clear of falling prey to any scams coming from these fake accounts. If it is a celebrity, their social media accounts should be verified. That means you’ll see a little blue circle with a white check mark next to the account name. But a problem arises when it’s a local celebrity. Sometimes these influencers have tens of thousands of followers, but social media networks won’t give them verified status.
So users need to be smart about it. If an account asks you for money for any reason, before you send cash, do your homework. Go to an official source (a website, a different social media account, an email) and ask some questions. Make sure the account is legit before you ever send money or give any personal information.
And if you find someone running a fake account, call them out. If possible, post to the account letting other followers know that the account is fraudulent. Then let the person running the account know you will be reporting them, screenshot the account for evidence and then block them.
Notify the social media platform about the fake account. On Facebook, simply click the three dots on the cover photo of the offending page and select “Give feedback or report this profile.” Twitter and Instagram each have specific forms for reporting an account for impersonation. Finally, let the Federal Trade Commission know about it.
Of course, you’ll want to take these steps if someone is dragging your good name through the mud by impersonating you on social media. But we should be responsible digital citizens and report any fake accounts we see online. You never know — your good deed could possibly save a fellow social media user from getting scammed.

Texto completo: I'm beginning to feel sorry for President Trump.
The attacks on him, his policies, his kids, his cabinet, his staff and everyone who's ever worked for him as a caddie by the Democrats and the Trump-hate media will never end.
The political attacks keep coming from dumbos in Congress like Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and the dozens of Democrats who are running for president in 2020.
The judicial attacks keep coming from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California, where Democrats routinely shop to get liberal judges to delay or stop Trump's executive orders for bogus constitutional reasons.
The legal attacks will be coming soon from the Department of Justice's Southern District of New York, which is using its investigation into the hush-money payments Trump made in 2016 to cover up affairs he had a decade earlier as an excuse to fish around in Trump's finances.
It will never matter to Democrats what Robert Mueller's report, Attorney General William Barr or even the U.S. Supreme Court concludes about Russian collusion, obstruction or any other alleged crime Trump did or didn't commit before or after he became president.
The Democrats and the liberal media will always believe Trump won only because he cheated with the help of the Russians. They will never let the facts or the truth get in the way of their permanent anti-Trump agenda or their impossible dream of impeaching him.
With collusion with Russia taken off the table (for non-deranged people, anyway), the Democrats and the people who play journalists on CNN and MSNBC will continue to look for anything else they can use to attack Trump. That includes sliming the reputations or characters of anyone who works for Donald Trump or fails to use their power to bring him down. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has become the first victim.
For two years, he was touted by Democrats and the liberal media as the bipartisan, fair-minded and super-competent Swamp hero who was going find the proof of Trump's collusion and obstruction. But now they see him as a bum, a failure, a partisan Republican hack who is part of a great Republican conspiracy to keep Trump in office.
The Trump-haters newest Devil is Attorney General Bill Barr. Until he wrote his summary of the Mueller Report's "no collusion" findings two weeks ago, he was seen as a fair-minded, by-the-book, respected member of the D.C. establishment.
Now Democrats in Congress are calling him just another untrustworthy Trump puppet who spun Mueller's findings to please his master.
The Democrats still hate Trump so much for "stealing" Hillary Clinton's presidency, they can never let him win anything in Washington. Their blind hate has hurt the country.
We'd have bipartisan healthcare reform, immigration reform and who knows what else if the Democrats weren't so hellbent on stopping Trump from getting legislation he wants through Congress.
There are a million things Donald Trump has done to tick me off. But I can separate his personal flaws and un-presidential manners from what he's been accomplishing in Washington — cutting taxes, boosting the economy, creating jobs, etc. with no help from Democrats and too little help from many Republicans.
I don't know any other human in politics who could have withstood the bipartisan onslaught of hate that President Trump has and still be able to walk around with his head high and a smile on his face. At this point, he can't be hurt politically by what the Democrats in D.C. say or do, or what The New York Times or Washington Post writes.
But sadly for the health and welfare of the country, the Swamp Democrats and the liberal media will never stop trying to destroy President Trump and his team — even after he's reelected in 2020.

Immigrants make the U.S. unique

Texto completo: Regardless of his inane immigration policies, you've got to hand it to President Donald Trump for his unique way of tossing a gauntlet into left-coast hotbeds of liberalism from San Francisco to Seattle.
That's what he did recently by threatening to send the thousands of Central Americans who are illegally entering the country to cities that declared themselves sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.
In typical feel-good liberal style, declaring themselves sanctuaries allowed the liberal mayors of these burgs to thumb their noses at the president's ill-conceived immigration policies without actually having to do anything. But the threat that they would actually have to deal with thousands of immigrants immediately raised the hackles of some big city mayors and their echo chambers in liberal media, such as the New York Times and MSNBC.
This is doubtless another one of the president's stream of consciousness declarations not meant to be taken seriously. But if Trump wants to "Make America Great Again," he should reverse his hostile stance toward immigration.
America needs more immigrants, not fewer. As our population ages and our birth rates go down, there aren't enough workers to provide Social Security and Medicare support for retiring Baby Boomers.
Agriculture and services businesses are starved for employees as the competition for those who are still young enough to work gives people a chance to avoid the drudgery of manual labor.
And in the biggest crime of all, America is educating thousands of foreign college students in the technology we desperately need - then shipping them to overseas competitors because our immigration system won't let them stay.
Several years back I was discussing the lack of skilled workers with a human resources employee at Newport News Shipbuilding. She told me the shipyard needed employees with a specific type of doctoral training but couldn't find any, because the only people studying the subject in American colleges were foreigners who are banned from working for American defense contractors.
Immigration opponents fear immigrants will take American jobs; some resent seeing formerly white, English speaking neighborhoods turn browner and multilingual. Change is inherently uncomfortable.
But there are plenty of jobs to go around, and we have always been a nation of immigrants, each of which enriched us by expanding our culture while enhancing the central tenet of America's exceptionalism.
Our nation's uniqueness is not white, Protestant or English-speaking in nature.
It is a yearning to prosper and be free to live to one's fullest potential.
I recently read an interview with a Columbia University professor of social policy, herself an Indian immigrant, who has studied our immigration system extensively.
Dr. Neeraj Kaushal told The Wall Street Journal the biggest difference between America's immigration culture and that of other nations such as Europe is that we welcome immigrants to be part of our American family, not just imported labor.
Some immigration reform advocates say we should use a point system such as Canada's to screen for education and skills. But Kaushal noted the wage gap between natives and immigrants is greater in Canada than here.
Immigrants to America show qualities that are hard to score, she told the Journal, like "motivation, creativity, imagination and enterprise" that are invaluable to our progress.
From Sikorsky helicopters to Google to Intel, many of America's most successful companies have been founded or grown by immigrants. They are what make America unique.

2020 Advice for Reporters: Assume Nothing

Texto completo: CHICAGO -- Journalists have no idea how the 2020 election will play out. And that's a good thing.
Some of the country's top political journalists came together last week for a gathering convened by the strategist David Axelrod to talk about how to cover the presidential race in a way that won't leave anybody dumbfounded on election night. The ideas that cropped up again and again on the panels were so basic to the practice of reporting that they are all too often ignored.
Travel the country. Talk to people. Assume nothing.
Such fundamentals may not seem fashionable in a media industrial complex that rewards logorrheic punditry and feigned certitude. But the inability of the media class to imagine the success of Donald J. Trump -- and its underappreciation of the grievances that drove his supporters -- has left reporters, pundits and producers wondering how they can be more prepared this time around.
The pressure is on for journalists to be smarter in 2020. Even as online and TV business models encourage scooplets and mini-scandals. Even as the sitting president works to erode trust in the press.
No one said it would be easy.
"We judge the marathon at every 100-yard marker, forgetting that it is a marathon," said Mr. Axelrod, a mastermind of Barack Obama's political rise, who founded the Campaign Journalism Conference in 2015 as a crash course for young reporters headed out on the trail. "There's this pressure between the 24/7 immediate gratification elements of the modern media environment, and covering the story as the story should be covered."
The two-day event, with about 250 people in attendance, was co-sponsored by Mr. Axelrod's political institute at the University of Chicago and Harvard's Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Google hosted the talks at its expensively amenitied office building in Chicago's hip West Loop neighborhood. Yes, lattes were served.
All of which prompted Ben Smith, the puckish editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, to quip that Fox News's take on the event "will be Axelrod and Google gather in Chicago to scheme how to stop Trump next time."
Mr. Axelrod called that "a glib and very typical-of-our-time interpretation of this," adding, "You have to gather somewhere."
In fact, the event featured Democratic and Republican speakers, with much of the discussion focused on practical, nonpartisan reporting advice.
Here is what's on the minds of leading journalists as the 2020 race begins.
Twitter isn't everything
Peter Hamby, the host of Snapchat's "Good Luck America," said he had an eye-opening moment while watching the second debate between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
"I was looking at Twitter: 'Trump's nuts; this is crazy; he's going to lose.' But I was getting text messages from regular people who were like, 'Trump's winning. I like this,"' Mr. Hamby recalled. "It's our duty to listen to voters."
Most political journalists spend a lot of time on Twitter tracking the real-time thoughts of pundits, activists, campaign operatives and reporters like themselves.
Most speakers here said that was not a great idea.
"You have to be skeptical of what you're seeing and reading on Twitter and applying it to the electorate," said Sam Feist, CNN's Washington bureau chief. "If you think you understand what's motivating voters because you're reading it on Twitter, you may be completely wrong."
Elite conversations are nothing new in politics, going back to the days when columnists like Robert Novak wielded huge power. But Twitter's rise coincided with a vogue for "tipsheet journalism," in Mr. Hamby's phrase: the who's-up-who's-down reporting that prizes tidbits over deeper dives.
"Even in the press, some of us in recent years scoffed at shoe-leather reporting: We have data now; we have so many elite voices who are so smart," Mr. Hamby said. "We lost sight of some very fundamental old-school habits of good political journalism."
That advice goes for editors, too. "The worst thing you can do to a reporter is: 'Oh, my God, did you see this tweet? Can you write it up?"' Mr. Smith of BuzzFeed said.
"Otherwise known as, every day covering the White House," quipped Margaret Talev, who covers Mr. Trump for Bloomberg News.
Know what polls say (and what they don't)
The CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny cautioned conferencegoers to steer clear of prognostication. "We're not in the predictions business, so don't act like we are," he said. "We don't know the outcome, and we should embrace that."
Or, as Amy Walter, national editor of The Cook Political Report, put it, reporters talking about polls are a lot like preteens talking about sex.
"They know all the words. They talk about it a lot. But they have no idea what they're talking about," she said.
Polling is crucial for campaign coverage, but in 2016 the attention on number-crunching sites like FiveThirtyEight led to a conflation of reporting and forecasting. (For some readers, the election night "needle" on The New York Times's home page remains a source of post-traumatic stress.) Journalists here said news organizations had an obligation to be clear that polls are about probability, not prophecy.
"A two-point race or a three-point race should be reported as either candidate can win," said Mr. Feist of CNN, referring to a poll's margin of sampling error. "There shouldn't be an assumption that a candidate is ahead. We need to help our viewers understand that."
Mrs. Clinton's pollster, Joel Benenson, expressed frustration that coverage of noisy horse-race polls last time around obscured broader trends. He urged reporters to weigh polling data with their own observations, like the language voters use to describe candidates.
Some news organizations are refocusing. HuffPost, whose forecasting model gave Mrs. Clinton a 98.2 percent chance of victory hours before Election Day, plans to analyze others' polls in 2020, but will not be modeling its own.
Assume nothing
Expertise is a coin of the realm among political journalists. But overconfidence can keep reporters from seeing what's in front of them. Mr. Axelrod warned that polling numbers, for instance, can be warped to justify a reporter's assumptions, right or wrong.
"The data out there didn't necessarily mean that Trump was going to lose, but people took it that way, because they couldn't imagine Trump winning," Mr. Axelrod said. "That was the fault in a lot of the commentary -- I was guilty of some of it -- and some of the reporting."
And with more than 18 months to go before Election Day, extrapolating any conclusions seems a losing game. "Trump showed us that we simply don't know what a viable presidential candidate looks like," said Eliana Y. Johnson, a reporter at Politico.
For reporters seeking a three-dimensional view of a campaign, the smartest path may be one of moderation.
Follow Twitter for "a directional sense of where the conversation is headed," as Mr. Smith said. Keep track of political shoptalk, like consultant hires and ad buys. Read polls, but understand their limits. Talk to as many voters as possible, in as many places as possible.
And expect the 2020 campaign to be like nothing you've ever seen.
"Don't be so focused on what happened in 2016 and trying to avoid those mistakes that you make all sorts of new mistakes," said Amanda Terkel, the Washington bureau chief for HuffPost. "And then we have to have a conference about them."
Mr. Smith was willing to make one prediction. "Every four years we have these gatherings," he said. "Then you look back and think, oh, my God, we were idiots."

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to soon join a group of Democratic presidential hopefuls — and campaign before a Democratic Party base — defined by antipathy toward the GOP and its policies.

Which begs the question: Can Biden get away with the many times he has spoken fondly of Republicans?

“One of my problems, if I ever run for president, is that I like Republicans,” Biden said in January at the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting.

On the other hand, Biden has shown he can convert purring praise to a nasty snarl, with both aimed at the very same person.

Here are seven incidences of Biden praising Republicans, a few of whom landed on his bad side too.

1. Attorney General William Barr

During Barr’s 1991 attorney general confirmation hearing, after being nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush, then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Biden praised Barr’s character and temperament.

“It's a presumptuous thing for me to say, but I personally like you. I think you're a heck of an honorable guy,” Biden said. “I think you're a person I can work with, and you've demonstrated that. When I say ‘can work with,’ I don't mean you do it our way. I mean you — when you sit down and negotiate, you genuinely negotiate.”

Such high praise could haunt Biden as Democrats begin to pile on Barr as a partisan Trump stooge, slamming him for saying Trump’s campaign had been spied on.

2. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush

Biden praised Florida Gov. Jeb Bush when they appeared on a panel together at the University of Pennsylvania Thursday to discuss the opioid epidemic.

"You were a hell of a governor," Biden told Bush.

In 2002, however, Biden suggested that Bush was involved in suppressing the black vote in 2000 to help his brother George to victory in Florida and with it, the Electoral College.

"It's not just a big deal because the whole world, not the whole nation, the whole world, looked at how many people of color were disenfranchised last time," he said during a 2002 campaign stop for Bill McBride, the Democratic running against Bush for governor, at a Baptist church near Miami. "It's a big deal because everything we stand for in this church is at stake."

3. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney

At a 2017 gathering of donors and business leaders that Romney hosted in Utah, Biden reportedly called Romney a man of integrity and encouraged him to run for Senate.

"By the way, you should run for Senate," Biden reportedly said at the closed-door event. Romney later went on to run for and win a Utah senate the following year.

When the two politicians were on opposite sides during the 2012 presidential election, with Romney as the GOP nominee, Biden was antagonistic, again suggested racial animus. He famously told a mostly black audience that Romney’s economic policies would “put you all back in chains.”

4. Vice President Mike Pence

During a February speech in Omaha, Neb., Biden called Vice President Mike Pence “a guy who’s a decent guy” who had to bear the antipathy of European leaders toward President Trump at the Munich Security Conference earlier that month.

After liberal activist and actress Cynthia Nixon criticized Biden for calling Pence decent, Biden apologized.

“There is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President,” Biden said in a tweet.

5. Michigan Rep. Fred Upton

Biden hailed Upton as a champion in the fight against cancer and “one of the finest guys I’ve ever worked with” at an event in Michigan just three weeks before the 2018 midterm elections.

Biden received $200,000 for the speech from the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan, the New York Times reported. The praise reportedly appeared to be sincere admiration rather than politically motivated, but Biden surprised Democrats with his friendly comments. Upton went on to win reelection by just 4.5 points.

6. Former California Rep. Darrell Issa

"Darrell Issa, not a Republican friend of mine. He's a friend," Biden said at a climate change summit in October 2015. "I don't consider Republicans enemies, they're friends."

Biden’s comment appeared to be a response to Hillary Clinton’s statement at a 2015 Democratic presidential debate. When asked which enemy she is most proud of, Clinton said, “In addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. Probably the Republicans.”

Issa was known as one of the Obama administration's toughest critics while he was in Congress. As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, he presided over a probe of the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS.

7. Late Arizona Sen. John McCain

“My name is Joe Biden. I’m a Democrat. And I loved John McCain. I have had the dubious honor over the years of giving some eulogies for fine women and men that I’ve admired. But, Lindsey, this one’s hard,” Biden said in a tearful eulogy at McCain’s funeral in 2018.

“John was a hero, his character, courage, honor, integrity. I think it is understated when they say optimism. That's what made John special. Made John a giant among all of us,” Biden said.

On the 2008 campaign trail, however, Biden and McCain were less than friendly to each other.

“What you are seeing is an angry man,” Biden said of McCain at a 2008 campaign stop in Florida. “I guess when you vote with George W. Bush 90 percent of the time, your best hope is to attack your opponent 100 percent of the time.”

At another 2008 campaign event, Biden criticized McCain for running a campaign ad that highlighted Biden’s gaffes.

“In my neighborhood where I came from, if you got something to say to a man, look him in the eye, and say it,” Biden said.

No, America is not ‘full’

Texto completo: President Donald Trump recently traveled to the Mexican border and delivered one of the most foolish and fallacious statements of his entire presidency. Speaking to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum here, he said, "We can’t take you anymore. Our country is full."
No, it is not full. It is not close to being full. In fact, the opposite is true. As aging baby boomers leave the workforce and depend more heavily on costly government services, more immigrants are desperately needed to fill jobs, pay taxes, have babies and revitalize areas that are losing population. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric serves only one purpose: to energize his supporters by inflaming the nativist fears that have periodically engulfed the country throughout our history. He firmly believes those fears helped elect him once, and will again.
From a political standpoint, that calculation is questionable. Trump’s denunciation of brown-skinned rapists and gangsters pouring across the southern border certainly helped his campaign in 2016, but last year, when he tried the same cynical scare tactics, his party lost 40 seats in the House. Clear majorities in national polls have consistently opposed his immigration policies.
From an economic standpoint, however, his war on immigrants is a disaster that would suffocate the sustained growth he loves to brag about. Under great pressure from business interests, Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security doubled the number of visas available for temporary guest workers this summer. Indeed, Trump’s own resorts and golf courses have long employed foreigners — a graphic rebuttal to his own inane comments.
There are short- and long-term implications here. Since June, for the first time since 1970, there have been more jobs available than workers seeking them. Many industries, from agriculture and food service to construction and health care, are frantically seeking immigrants to hire.
Dallas homebuilders tell the New York Times that a lack of workers is adding $6,000 to the cost of every new home and delaying completion by two months. Larry Cox, who farms in California’s Imperial Valley, said the labor shortage is driving "a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico." The problem is aggravated in areas like New England that are losing population. Older cities from Philadelphia to St. Louis are actively recruiting foreigners to restock urban neighborhoods as earlier settlers depart for the suburbs. "One of the key solutions" to urban blight is "to welcome immigrants into these communities," said Brooks Rainwater of the National League of Cities to the Times.
If anything, immigrants are even more important to the nation’s future economic health. U.S. birthrates are plummeting, and last year, population growth sank to its lowest level in 80 years. Newcomers accounted for nearly half of that increase. And by 2030, foreigners will be "the primary contributor to national population growth," estimates demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. These demographic trends, says Frey, require "a more serious discussion of U.S. immigration policy because of the future contributions that immigrants will make to growing America’s society and economy."
True, that serious discussion is imperative. But Trump’s tirade about a "full" America is totally wrong, and typical of his damaging determination to believe half-baked fantasies instead of proven facts.

Texto completo: Aunque durante el juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera se dieron a conocer cientos de documentos de testimonios de testigos y cooperantes, fiscales federales y defensores del mexicano decidieron sellar miles más, debido a que contienen información que podría ser perjudicial para el caso, a favor o en contra.
En octubre de 2018, a pocas semanas de que iniciara el proceso en la Corte Federal de Brooklyn, los fiscales del Distrito Este de Nueva York y el equipo legal de Guzmán Loera acordaron revelar versiones públicas de esos testimonios, a petición de los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News.
Uno de los primeros documentos que se reveló integra las declaraciones de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, sobre la contratación de menores de hasta 13 años por las que, supuestamente, el líder del Cártel de Sinaloa pagaba para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas.
Semanas después se dio a conocer otra parte de esos documentos, donde los fiscales federales y la defensa indicaron que algunos dichos de ese cooperante podrían afectar el proceso –de uno y otro lado– en caso de que se dieran a conocer. Aquellos documentos incluyen las creencias esotéricas de Cifuentes y más detalles de sus gustos sexuales.
Los documentos debieron ser publicados entre enero 22 y marzo 20, pero no ha ocurrido así, por lo que fiscales federales y defensores de Guzmán Loera pidieron al juez Brian Cogan una extensión, la cual fue concedida hasta el 3 de mayo.
“La extensión permitirá a las partes dedicar recrusos apropiados y exclusivamente a los esfuerzos de revisar los archivos previamente sellados” , indica una carta enviada al juez Cogan, quien aceptó la moción.
Se espera que los documentos contengan información sobre el comportamiento privado y público de Guzmán Loera y sus socios, datos que no fueron utilizados en el juicio.
Another deadline to unseal documents from the El Chapo trial passed this weekend with nothing released to the public.
Today, the government and defense filed a joint motion asking for a "modest extension" until May 3, which Judge Cogan has granted.https://t.co/65JPCnU7Uj pic.twitter.com/aSNNwzPYE5

Media provides a distorted portrayal of Venezuela

Texto completo: Backed by a chorus of U.S. corporate media singing in unison, the Trump administration has prepared the American people to believe that the United States is going to do whatever it takes to rescue the suffering people of Venezuela from their despotic and incompetent ruler, Nicolas Maduro.
The media behavior is quite stunning really, unless you happen to recall that the national media always respond this way when government propaganda prepares the public for a U.S. war or other form of intervention - from Vietnam and Central America to Afghanistan, Iraq, and many others.
From Fox News on the right spewing Trumpian rhetoric about the "failed socialism" of Venezuela to the New York Times, MSNBC and New Yorker on the so-called "left" side of the spectrum, the media have been cheerleading for what amounts to a Big Lie from this and previous administrations. Anyone wishing to examine the media chorus can check the media watch-dog www.fair.org and review any of its few dozen articles that document mass media coverage on Venezuela.
Let us first acknowledge that, yes, the Maduro administration, and to a lesser degree its predecessor under Hugo Chavez, has been increasingly authoritarian, suppressing opposition forces. Arguably, too, there has been mismanagement of the state-owned oil producer (PDVSA) and corruption among government officials. And, although the reasons are understandable, Chavez erred in failing to diversify Venezuela's economy when oil was such a rich resource.
But we need to be clear about a few things. This is not about authoritarian government in Venezuela.
The United States has over the decades supported scores of authoritarian regimes - consider, for example, that bastion of human rights, Saudi Arabia. Readers might check William Blum's documentation of case after case in his book, "Killing Hope." This is not about bringing democracy to Venezuela. And very importantly, it is not about bringing aid to the suffering people of Venezuela.
No, instead, the U.S. has engaged in economic warfare against Venezuela going back into the Barack Obama administration, and, prior to that, staged a brief coup against Chavez during the George W. Bush years. Donald Trump has sharply escalated the U.S. effort to strangle the Venezuelan economy through devastating sanctions and a financial embargo.
For U.S. policymakers, the Venezuelan government's cardinal sin has for years been that, in defiance of the United States, it used its ample oil revenue to provide the Venezuelan poor and working classes with a better life while also providing aid to other Latin American governments to free them from the boot of "Yankee Imperialism," i.e., centuries of U.S. hegemony over "our backyard."
As documented by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, poverty and extreme poverty declined precipitously under Chavez. Inequality, unemployment and infant mortality all fell significantly. The economy nearly doubled and the private sector grew faster than the public sector.
After Chavez's death, global oil prices dropped radically, severely straining the Venezuelan economy. Then, claiming Venezuela was "an extraordinary threat to U.S. national security," the Obama administration imposed sanctions that made it more difficult for Venezuela to attract investment and financing.
Meanwhile, the U.S. actively supported opposition groups through the so-called National Endowment for Democracy, a government funded organization with a record of working for regime change in "unfriendly" countries. Along with other opposition groups, the U.S. was grooming a young right-winger named Juan Guaido to this end.
The five separate Trump administration sanction orders have all but eliminated Venezuela's ability to produce oil for export in order to provide revenue for public needs. Indeed, the nation's economy is being strangled, and food and medicine shortages are increasing public desperation. Hence, the U.S. named Guaido as Venezuela's "legitimate" interim president and announced $20 million in U.S. "humanitarian aid."
The media provided unending visuals to back up administration claims about the heartless Maduro blocking aid for his people - what was in fact a publicity stunt designed to wean military supporters away from Maduro.
I believe the real aims of U.S. policy toward Venezuela are: 1) to gain control over Venezuelan oil reserves, the largest in the world, 2) to reassert U.S. domination over all of Latin America, after bringing about rightist regimes in Honduras, Brazil and Paraguay, and 3) to ensure that other nations do not seek a form of economic development independent of the U.S. neoliberal model.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, disclosed 10 years of tax returns on Monday, providing a more detailed look at his finances than what he offered when he ran for the White House in 2016.
The returns show that Mr. Sanders's earnings shot up after his first presidential bid, when he built up a vast national following. He and his wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders, reported income that topped $1 million in 2016 and 2017, lifted by proceeds from his books.
The couple had an adjusted gross income of $561,293 in 2018, according to their most recent tax return. Mr. Sanders had about $393,000 in book income last year, and he and his wife reported giving nearly $19,000 to charity.
Their federal taxes came to $145,840, for an effective federal tax rate of 26 percent.
Mr. Sanders's higher income in recent years has created some political awkwardness for the senator, who in his 2016 presidential campaign frequently railed against "millionaires and billionaires" and their influence over the political process.
His income now puts him within the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.
"These tax returns show that our family has been fortunate," Mr. Sanders said in a statement. "I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity."
The issue of tax returns has been in the spotlight because of President Trump's refusal to release his own, a position that defies decades of tradition. House Democrats are now demanding to see his returns.

Mr. Sanders's handling of the issue received attention in the 2016 race, when Hillary Clinton, his main rival for the Democratic nomination, pushed him to divulge years of tax returns, as she had done. At the time, Mr. Sanders said his wife did their taxes. "We've been a little bit busy lately," he said during a debate. "You'll excuse us."
In that campaign, Mr. Sanders disclosed his tax return for only one year, 2014, which showed that he and his wife had an adjusted gross income of $205,271, largely from his Senate salary and Social Security benefits.
More recently, Mr. Sanders has come under criticism for his expanding personal wealth. A post on the website ThinkProgress last week called Mr. Sanders's millionaire status "very off-brand and embarrassing," and a video suggested he had stopped referring to "millionaires" after he became one himself. The website is run by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the sister organization of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.
On Saturday, Mr. Sanders fired back, accusing the think tank of "using its resources to smear" him and other progressive presidential candidates. The think tank was founded in 2003 by John D. Podesta, a close Clinton ally who served as Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman in 2016. (The editor in chief of ThinkProgress said in a statement that the site was an "editorially independent journalistic entity.")
[On Fox News, Mr. Sanders rejected the idea that his wealth was proof of the "American dream."]
Tax returns released by other Democratic presidential candidates have shown that they also earned more than a vast majority of American households in recent years. Senator Kamala Harris of California and her husband reported an adjusted gross income of about $1.9 million last year, while Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and her husband had $846,394 in adjusted gross income.
Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas also disclosed 10 years of tax returns on Monday, though not his 2018 return. He and his wife, Amy O'Rourke, reported $366,455 in adjusted gross income on their 2017 return.
The couple reported donating $1,166 to charity that year, just three-tenths of 1 percent of their income, though it is possible they made other donations not listed on their personal return.
The filings showed the extent to which the O'Rourkes have benefited financially from family wealth. Mr. O'Rourke's income was boosted over the years through his interest, passed to him by his parents, in a shopping mall and an apartment complex. Ms. O'Rourke collects dividends and interest from family partnerships established by her father, the real estate investor William D. Sanders (no relation to Bernie Sanders). In some years, that dividend and interest income contributed over $100,000.
A picture of Senator Sanders's finances was already available through his annual Senate financial disclosure filings, but the tax returns provide a precise accounting of the income earned by Mr. Sanders and his wife over the years. Their 2018 return indicated it was self-prepared.
In the past three years, their income has soared as a result of Mr. Sanders's book writing. His book "Our Revolution" was published shortly after the 2016 election, and a young-adult book, the "Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution," followed the next year. Another book, "Where We Go From Here," was published last year.
Mr. Sanders reported receiving about $840,000 in book income in 2016 and about $856,000 in 2017. Ms. Sanders listed about $106,000 in income as a book author in 2017. The Sanders campaign said Ms. Sanders had received an advance for a book she is writing "about Jane and Bernie's experiences together in public service."
In an interview with The New York Times last week, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he had become a millionaire.
"I wrote a best-selling book," he said. "If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."

Me, you, and Elle Woods' story, too

Texto completo: Recently, I was lucky enough to win tickets to see Legally Blonde - The Musical at the Valentine Theatre. It's a great show, light and fun and filled with music that is still lodged in your brain days later.

The play is, naturally, based on the 2001 film of the same name. For the uninitiated, the story revolves around Elle Woods, a California sorority girl who follows her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School and ends up discovering her own power and brilliance (and forgets the guy) along the way.

A pivotal moment for Miss Woods is when her professor and boss comes on to her in a private meeting. She shoots him down but (briefly) resigns herself to abandoning her dreams.

I was 12 or 13 when I first saw the original movie. I loved it, loved watching a beautiful, kind, smart woman find herself and chase her dreams. But even as a child, I didn't question Elle's decision to leave everything she worked so hard for because she turned down her boss. What else was she supposed to do? In that moment, she could have her dignity or her job. She couldn't have both.

When watching the play at the Valentine, it was the first time I'd seen anything Legally Blonde related since the #MeToo movement took root in 2017. Even though I knew the plot well, it was a different experience watching the story play out in that new light.

Elle's jerk professor was an obstacle for her, yes. But it no longer seemed insurmountable, like there was more than one option for our brilliant, plucky heroine to pursue. Today, if her boss came on to her outside the glossy veneer of a Hollywood movie or a Broadway play, she would have a fighting chance.

It was a pleasant change to my understanding of the story, reflecting a long overdue change to the world for women. When I first saw Legally Blonde, I'd already experienced plenty of #MeToo movements of my own, and so had most of my friends. Our youth wasn't protection from cat callers or from being groped by strangers on the street. It was just the way the world was, so we accepted it. We shrugged it off when we could and tried to cope with it when we couldn't, just like almost every other woman I've ever met. In that universe, of course Elle would be the one whose life was ruined by a man's inappropriate behavior.

The fact that Elle Woods' story has become more believable in the last year and a half is beyond a good thing. In the 19 months since the first story about Harvey Weinstein was published by the New York Times, society has made huge strides. People who had faced no consequences for their actions are now being held accountable, and people are feeling empowered to speak out about these abuses of power.

But we can't afford to forget where we were when Elle first made her blond way to Harvard Law. Who knows how many brilliant women we lost because they weren't in a position to stand up to those in power. It's a brave, new, #MeToo world out there now. Make like Elle, and don't let anyone take that away.

Julian Assange affidavit unsealed

Texto completo: An affidavit detailing the alleged crimes of Julian Assange was unsealed Monday, revealing more about what investigators knew about the WikiLeaks founder’s communications with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.

Assange, 47, was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in connection to a charge in the U.S. of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010.

A possible arrest and extradition to the U.S. had been expected in recent months after prosecutors mistakenly revealed in November that the Justice Department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange. Following a U.K. Supreme Court ruling that he should be extradited to Sweden for questioning over sexual assault charges, Assange sought and was granted political asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012. He remained there until metropolitan London police arrested him last week.

The disclosure of a sealed indictment against Assange, which came during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, led to speculation that it was related to WikiLeaks’ role in disseminating emails stolen from Democratic officials during the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community believes Russian hackers were behind the theft.

But the indictment, unsealed last week, revealed Assange had not been charged in connection with Russian interference in the election nor had he been charged for publishing government secrets contained in the documents leaked by Manning almost a decade ago. Instead, prosecutors charged him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion by agreeing to help Manning crack a password that would have given her access to a classified military network.

The single-count conspiracy indictment against Assange carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, but national security experts speculate that there could be a slew of additional charges — including espionage — leveled at Assange if and when he is extradited to the United States.

FBI special agent Megan Brown wrote in the 26-page affidavit filed in December 2017 the two allegedly tried to gain access to the Pentagon network, but “it remains unknown whether Manning and Assange were successful in cracking the password.”

The indictment against Assange acknowledged an alleged agreement between Manning and Assange for the latter to help break a system to which Manning did not have access, though it did not indicate whether investigators knew if the system was breached.

Investigators said they were able to uncover the alleged crime by obtaining hundreds of chats from March 2010 between Assange and Manning on Jabber, an instant messaging platform.

Brown also wrote in her affidavit that Manning and WikiLeaks “had reason to believe that public disclosure of the Afghanistan War Reports and Iraq War Reports would cause injury to the United States.” Brown said the war reports purloined by Manning and disseminated by Wikileaks “contained information the disclosure of which potentially endangered U.S. troops and Afghan civilians, and aided enemies of the United States.” The reports contained potentially harmful identifying information about local allies on the ground who were assisting U.S. and coalition forces.

The affidavit also alleged the Taliban exploited the WikiLeaks disclosures to put U.S. allies in danger, citing a New York Times article headlined, “Taliban Study WikiLeaks to Hunt Informants.” It also said the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, showed that the terrorist was actively seeking information contained in the WikiLeaks disclosures and that al Qaeda was providing him with information from the leaked Afghanistan war reports. The Afghanistan war reports also contained specifics on improvised explosive device techniques and countermeasures espoused by the U.S. that “the enemy could use these reports to plan future lED attacks,” the affidavit said.

The criminal complaint that was unsealed last week alleged Assange encouraged Manning to hand vast amounts of classified information over to WikiLeaks to disseminate. “These databases contained approximately 90,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports, 400,000 Iraq war-related significant activity reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs, and 250,000 U.S. Department of State cables,” DOJ said.

Assange's attorneys say he plans to fight the extradition proceedings in London, which could drag on for months or longer. It's likely that Assange could eventually appeal his case to a higher British court and perhaps even to the European Court of Human Rights.

Manning, formerly known as Bradley, was convicted at a court martial trial in 2013 of leaking a trove of documents to WikiLeaks. Sentenced to 35 years in prison, Manning's sentence was commuted by former President Barack Obama just days before the end of his presidency in January 2017. Manning was recently imprisoned again after refusing to provide grand jury testimony in relation to the WikiLeaks case.

The Assange problem

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador's interior minister.
Assange's behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he's a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans -- including many in the U.S. media -- long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange's publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you're a journalist doesn't make you one.
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone's personal emails and under what circumstances?
One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn't accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government's decades-long campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham's bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts -- all while risking great personal and financial loss -- was epic.
Assange's process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
It isn't hyperbolic to say we're at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole -- and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal -- and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg's charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
Wikileaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that's just me.

Texto completo: Sydney Paige Monfries , una estudiante de 22 años, cayó de más de 12 metros de altura por querer tomarse una “selfie” panorámica de Nueva York, desde la torre del reloj de la Universidad de Fordham.
Los hechos ocurriero el domingo en la madrugada, alrededor de las 2:00 a.m., cuando la joven –becaria de la revista InStyle y estudiante de periodismo– y otros compañeros subieron a la torre, a pesar de que estaba prohibido.
Ella era asidua a las selfies, como se puede ver sus perfil de Facebook, pero el domingo murió, tras caer al interior de la torre, tuvo una fractura craneoencefálica, incluso los paramédicos lograron resucitarla en el lugar, pero la joven originaria de Portland, Oregón, murió más tarde en el hospital.

“Con gran tristeza informo que Sydney Monfries, estudiante del Fordham College en Rose Hill, murió hoy después de sufrir una caída dentro de la torre del Reloj Keating en las primeras horas de la mañana. Nuestros corazones están con los padres de Sydney, su familia y amigos” , escribió el presidente de la escuela, Joseph McShane . “No hay palabras suficientes para describir la pérdida de alguien tan joven y lleno de promesas, y solo semanas antes de la graduación”.
El funcionario académico indicó la joven recibirá una licenciatura póstuma, la cual entregarán a los padres.
La torre es un lugar prohibido para los jóvenes, pero eso no ha detenido a los estudiantes curiosos de echar un vistazo.
“Es como una cosa de alto nivel ir al edificio más popular del campus” , dijo Priscilla Morales, una estudiante de psicología, al New York Times. “Recientemente supimos que la puerta estaba abierta o se encontró un acceso. Por lo general, van tarde por la noche alrededor de la 1 o 2 a.m. para beber y disfrutar la vista”.

Donors Gave $3 Million To Gillibrand

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's presidential campaign raised $3 million in the first quarter of the year, a spokeswoman said on Sunday, a disappointing sum that ranked her last among the six senators currently running for president.
Ms. Gillibrand, New York's Democratic junior senator, has made running as a woman a central theme of her candidacy, and nearly two-thirds of the campaign's donors were women, said the spokeswoman, Meredith Kelly.
Ms. Kelly did not disclose how many donors the campaign had, but she said that 92 percent of contributions were under $200.
Given her modest haul so far, Ms. Gillibrand will likely need to rely heavily upon the roughly $10 million in campaign funds she had left over after her Senate re-election bid last year. Only a few 2020 candidates had such a large cash stockpile to supplement their presidential fund-raising.
Ms. Gillibrand transferred $9.6 million from her Senate account to her presidential campaign, and the campaign ended the quarter with $10.2 million in cash on hand, Ms. Kelly said.
In a memo on Sunday, Ms. Gillibrand's campaign suggested that her fund-raising had been hampered by a continuing backlash to her decision in 2017 to call for the resignation of a fellow Democratic senator, Al Franken of Minnesota, over sexual harassment allegations.
"There's no question that the first quarter was adversely impacted by certain establishment donors -- and many online -- who continue to punish Kirsten for standing up for her values and for women," the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times, said.
Monday is the deadline for candidates to report their first-quarter fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission, and the announcement by Ms. Gillibrand's campaign came after many of her rivals had already revealed their fund-raising totals.
Ms. Gillibrand's total for the first quarter ranks, at best, eighth among 2020 Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont leads the candidates with $18.2 million raised in the quarter, followed by Senator Kamala Harris of California with $12 million, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas with $9.4 million and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., with more than $7 million, according to figures announced by the campaigns.
Ms. Gillibrand also trails the other senators in the race who are not toward the top of the Democratic field in fund-raising. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts raised more than $6 million, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota raised more than $5.2 million and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $5 million, their campaigns have said.
Ms. Gillibrand's total, collected over a period of two and a half months, is roughly half of what Mr. Sanders and Mr. O'Rourke each raised in the first 24 hours of their presidential bids, according to their campaigns.

Unicorns Are Big Money, Especially in a Crisis

Texto completo: It's unicorn season and the money is gushing on Wall Street.
I've figured out a way to get hold of some of that money, and maybe you'd like to join me. It involves industry disruption and crisis management, with my own soulless twist.
This is high-tech stuff, so let me define a few technical terms.
First, by unicorns, I'm talking about fantastic beasts: privately held companies worth at least a billion dollars. (Insert your joke here about who can catch a unicorn.) Unicorns like Lyft are sold to investors in initial public offerings of stock (also known as I.P.O.s), enabling insiders to make a ton of money. The precise terminology for these lucky people is "obscenely rich."
As always, I've been wondering: How can I become even naughtily rich? The trick is to find a business I can bootstrap to billions.
Disrupting established industries seems to be the way to go: Even children know that Lyft and Uber have disrupted taxi service and Airbnb has disrupted hotels.
Now it's my turn to make a fortune. The crisis management business seems to be ripe for disruption.
Crises are everywhere, especially in the business world. A company called Theranos failed so spectacularly that it has generated a best-selling book, an HBO documentary and a big podcast. Theranos claimed to have revolutionized blood tests. It has been a disaster, like the Fyre festival, but with pricked fingers.
Then there's Boeing, not to mention a number of current presidential campaigns. You get the idea.
Crisis managers are already in great demand, but I intend to do something different: I'll create crises, then solve them, leading to a staggeringly successful unicorn I.P.O.
Lyft just had its I.P.O. and may soon be followed by some of the biggest names in tech, including Uber, Airbnb and Slack, the annoyingly ubiquitous program for sharing messages in the workplace.
Exciting, right? Hope you like roller coasters: Lyft's shares dropped below their offering price by their second day of trading, which means the stock price could use a ... well, you know.
The point with an I.P.O. is to be an insider, not a chump who gets fleeced by the insiders. Lyft's founders, employees and early backers are getting quite a payday. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, comes away with about $900 million in instant profit. Carl C. Icahn apparently made about $550 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, by selling his stake to George Soros.
That's the life for me: mogul. I've been driving the same car for 10 years. It's time to move up to something that extravagantly shows how much I love the planet. Not a mere Tesla, but the Jaguar electric E-Type Zero, which costs about $400,000.
That kind of ride requires I.P.O. money. So, fellow insider, here's my plan.
I formulated it with invaluable help from Eric Dezenhall. He runs Dezenhall Resources, which, among other things, does crisis management. In an email, I told him that my life is an unmanaged crisis, so I need advice if I am to build a future in his field.
His response was promising: "You do realize that the whole discipline is a farce, don't you?" That convinced me that crisis management would be a good fit.
He added: "All you need is a sport jacket and a cliché (such as 'Get ahead of the story,' a great-sounding phrase that has no meaning.)"
This was getting better and better. As a veteran journalist, clichés are my métier. And, as it happens, I own a sport jacket. There are some moth holes, but I've gotten pretty good at using a felt-tip pen to match the jacket color with the lining. Mr. Dezenhall was impressed by my inventive use of the felt-tip pen. That, in itself, "is crisis management," he said.
But he cautioned that crisis management is no longer a matter of simply altering perceptions so that a bad situation looks like something good. "What people think we're going to say is, 'We didn't dump PCBs in the river, we're shampooing the fish!' and people will say, 'Ooh, that's good,"' he said. But, no. That's old thinking, he said. His trade has evolved.
Instead of just changing perceptions, he said, the great crisis managers provide "operational solutions" that address root causes. That way, he said, a company can transcend the fickle and uncontrollable emotions that dominate the 24-hour news cycles and waves of Twitter outrage.
So he would not, for example, advise the chief executive of Boeing to go on a televised apology tour for two recent crashes and the loss of hundreds of lives. (And, in fact, the company's public response has been notably muted.) These days, he said, such gestures are instantly deemed inadequate. Instead, he said, it's better to help companies actually fix their problems, which will do more to vindicate them than any snappy patter.
That sounded hard.
"What you're saying," I said, "sounds like it takes actual management ability." I was beginning to despair. And that's when the thunderbolt hit me: I could work the other side of the market. Crisis creation!
I'd ferret out dire problems and make them much worse. Corporate executives already do that routinely, of course; I mean, just look at the series of apologies from Mark Zuckerberg over ... well, almost everything. But hotshot executives have been calling those problems "mistakes." I'd call them "my strategy."
Mr. Dezenhall ran with the idea: He said I could get paid by short sellers, or work directly with him to concoct scandals that expose companies to reputational crises, which he -- and I -- would be paid handsomely to relieve. Most of the time, we'd do nothing but wait for the situation to resolve itself and celebrate our success.
Ideally, he said, we would cause problems that look like random events and that don't besmirch the character of the company. He pointed to a spate of syringes found in Pepsi cans in the '90s. (The Pepsi problem, which I covered a lifetime ago, earning mere workingman's wages, turned out to be a hoax, with a splash of copycat effect.)
Our corporate slogan would be this: Plant a problem, find the problem, claim to fix the problem. All in a profitable day's work.
"The future is in crisis creation!" he said. "I am happy to secretly finance this, and we'll work together, and hopefully we'll be on the Forbes 400 list in a few years."
It sounded exciting. It sounded like big money. Also, it sounded like he was joking. Unfortunately, he was. He turned out to be one of those people burdened with a sense of ethics and even a conscience.
I need another partner.
It could be you! This is a can't-miss opportunity: We'll capture a unicorn, throw it into crisis, and reap unfathomable rewards.
It will definitely happen, though for now, I'll keep my day job: describing crises without capitalizing on them.
If I save my pennies, who knows? I might be able to get a new sport coat.

Texto completo: Arthur is one very lucky little boy. He has a doting grandmother he calls Nana who didn't object when the dog's name sometimes followed quickly along after hers and granddad's, making her "Nanapopgus."
Nor did she mind thinking Arthur was saying her name then coming to understand from the direction he was looking that he really wanted her to peel him a banana.
It helps her put things into perspective. "These are useful moments when we are made to understand where we really rate in the topography of family, if we are smart enough to pay attention and humble enough to accept the verdict," says Anna Quindlen in an interview. She relates stories of her journey with Arthur, who is almost 3, in her newest book, "Nanaville: Adventures in Grandparenting" (Random House Publishing Group: 2019), due April 23.
"Mama means Mama. Daddy means Daddy. But Nana might just be a piece of fruit," Quindlen, 66, writes in her first piece of nonfiction since her 2012 memoir, "Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake."
Grandparents mostly have a different role, she writes. "We provide color, texture, history, mythology. But we are not central."
The Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times columnist and bestselling author chronicles her new stage of life in a charming and warmhearted look at getting to know her grandson as she learns the ropes of modern grandparenting. She brings to the task her familiar, ruminative voice as she chronicles a stage of life and a state of mind.
In some ways it's a cautionary tale, with recommendations for not-to-do behaviors that will get you sidelined, but mostly it's a paean to her first grandchild and thoughts on being a grandmother in today's changing landscape.
The average age of a grandmother these days is 50, she writes, so there are many years yet to navigate, just as there are many styles of grandparenting, some of them hands-on and 24/7 by necessity.
"Where I once commanded, now I need to ask permission. Where I once led, I have to learn to follow. For years I had strong opinions for a living. Now I need to wait until I am asked for them, and modulate them most of the time," she writes.
Her understanding of this came when she was talking to a friend about a decision her son and daughter-in-law made that she didn't like and the friend said, "Did they ask you?"
"It really was my lightbulb moment," Quindlen says. "The moment where I thought, 'This has got to be my guiding light.' " She refers to that as the moment she got "Nana religion."
Grandparents who don't modulate their behavior, who offer advice when none has been sought, sometimes get relegated to visit only on major holidays. If grandparents overstep, they're likely to get a lot of pushback.
"There's a little bit of a delicate dance here, but I've been blessed to do it with two people who are really easy in their approach to this entire relationship and that's made all the difference," she says of her son Quin and daughter-in-law Lynn. The family also includes Quindlen's daughter, Maria, and her son Christopher and his wife, Azara.
She talks about hitting the jackpot with Lynn, with whom she has crafted a strong relationship. "I am so blessed to be able to do this, to live close by, to have Lynn so open to my involvement. I just feel really blessed," she says.
She and Pop took Mandarin lessons for a time to better share in their grandson's upbringing, although she notes the homework made her head hurt. "Maybe I will learn more, maybe not," she writes. "In the meantime, I'm speaking the Nana language of love and hoping Arthur recognizes, if not every word, then all the tones."
Quindlen says she hasn't read comments online about her writing for years now, having learned that it can be too punishing. "And reviews and comments about this book would at some level be irrelevant to me," she says. "There are only two people whose views I cared about and that was my son and my daughter-in-law, and my son had a comment that made the entire project worthwhile. When he finished reading the manuscript, which he liked very much, he said to me 'I'd forgotten some of that stuff.' And I thought, 'Well, then, my work here is done.' "
Being a grandparent offers a chance to love in a different way, she writes, "a love without the thorny crown of self-interest."
"I look at Arthur and see Arthur. It reminds you of how fraught parenting can sometimes be and how absent of that grandparenting can be, should be and often is. That's a great feeling, to just take the kid as he is, as she is."
Relationships with grandparents vary due to distance, disinclination and the fact that sometimes grandparents are still working and have busy lives, she says. "But most of the people I know have embraced this wholeheartedly. I think there's a sense of liberation you feel about being a grandparent because you have this profound connection without the ultimate responsibility.
"I don't have to worry about toilet training, I don't have to worry about school placement or reading readiness," she says. "I get all the gravy. And that's really liberating."
She sees the grandchild-grandparent relationship as them sharing a common nexus rather than them being united against a common enemy. "There's no moment more eye-opening for a little kid than when you need to explain that Pop is Daddy's daddy. It's mind-boggling, the idea that Daddy was ever a little boy...," she writes.
Grandparents tend to segue into the space not occupied by the children's mother and father, giving rise to the "persistent mythology that the job is inherently to indulge and spoil, which casts Nana not as the bad cop and not even as the good cop, but as the getaway driver."
Relationships that undermine the parents don't lead to an atmosphere of trust. "And trust is essential, not just to your relationship with your grandchildren but with their parents," she writes. While it's the nature of grandparenting to often make it up as you go, "Care must be taken and boundaries respected."
She thinks of Nanaville as a state of mind, "figuring out my rightful place in this new territory, with these new people." And she has two commandments in Nanaville: Love the grandchildren and hold your tongue.
What does she hope readers take away from their trip to Nanaville? "When I was writing the column for The Times, 'Life in the 30s,' people would say 'I feel like you're telling me the story of my life.' And I hope that for people who are already grandparents, that's how they'll feel. That they'll read the book and think, 'Yes, that's it exactly.'
"And for people who aren't yet grandparents and for people who have children of their own and who are navigating this terrain with their own parents, I hope it gives them some insight into the fact that we're imperfect people trying to negotiate a brand-new relationship and that that relationship is pretty darn divine."
Being a grandmother is not about the things you have to do, she's learned, it's about the things you want to do. "This is what we learn - that we imagine them and then they are different than our imaginings. I always realize that how I imagined Arthur didn't come close to the thrill of the reality," she writes near the end of the book.
She's learning again, this time how to be a grandmother to two grandchildren. Arthur's new sibling arrived Feb. 19, a baby girl named Ivy, and everyone is settling into their new roles. "No [crib] bumpers for the second," she writes. "I'm broken in now. That's the job of the first, to teach you the ropes.
"It's just as thrilling as it was the first time around, but it reminds me a little bit of having my own second child," Quindlen says. "You're just more chill."

Texto completo: One of the U.S. Congress' first House subcommittee hearings on the greenhouse effect and climate change was held almost 40 years ago, on July 31, 1981. In the book "Losing Earth,"New
Orleans-based author Nathaniel Rich discusses how such hearings tend to be stage-managed for maximum impact on the press and public, and how environmental and health issues tend to come equipped with heroes, victims and villains.
Rich quotes Tom Grumbly, staff director for then young congressman Al Gore, as being skeptical about the political value of holding a hearing for the greenhouse effect. "There are no villains," Grumbly says. "Besides, who's your victim?"
Gore answers, "If we don't do something, we're all going to be the victims."
Reflecting on the subsequent decades of relative inaction, Rich pulls no punches in identifying villains and the long-term consequences of the victims, who tend to be all the inhabitants of a warming planet.
Subtitled "A Recent History," "Losing Earth" dramatizes the increasingly dire findings in climate change research and the activism to minimize the effects of carbon emissions and global warming. Rich takes a unique perspective on the events by focusing on the science and politics of the issue from 1979 through 1989, arguing that we knew everything important then that we know now, but we squandered our first and best opportunities to address the problem.
"Losing Earth" originated as a 30,000-word magazine article that took up a full issue of The New York Times Magazine. Rich, the magazine's writer-at-large, has expanded the article into a 200-page book that reads partly like an accessible history of recent events and partly like an impassioned polemic.
It isn't meant to comfort the reader, and Rich's introduction lays out the stakes: a rise in average global temperature of more than two degrees Celsius (which currently seems inevitable) promises devastating consequences, such as starvation, drought, abandonment of coastal cities and increasingly violent conflicts over decreasingly available resources.
The book's two primary protagonists come across less as "heroes" than simply well-informed but ordinarypeoplemotivatedtospeakout. Rafe Pomerance is a tall, tweedy, emotionally demonstrative activist and lobbyist involved with groups such as Friends of the Earth. James Hansen is a calm, cool NASA atmospheric physicist who becomes one of the first and most outspoken researchers on the issue. But they're just two in a large cast of characters involved with an issue that drew bipartisan concern, at least in its early years, from the likes of EPA administrator and establishment Republican William Reilly.
Much of the book follows the climate change issue over the decade as it wends its way through a maze of scientific, corporate and governmental organizations. If you're not a policy wonk, it can require close reading to keep track of all the conferences, committees and institutes, and whether they have agendas beyond pure research.A glossarywouldhavecomeinhandy.
Fortunately, Rich has a novelist's instinct for finding quirky, memorable details. One scientific conference takes place in a coastal hotel nicknamed "The Pink Palace," which becomes a
candy-colored backdrop as scientists try and
fail to craft a strongly worded joint statement. "Losing Earth" offers brief tangents about such groups as The Jasons, a longstanding independent group of elite scientific advisers to the U.S. government.
At one point Pomerance and other activists watch jealously as the threat to the ozone layer in the mid-1980s steals the thunder from climate change: although a scientific misnomer, the "ozone hole" proved far more effective at inspiring chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) reduction than climate activism did in controlling carbon dioxide.
In the last quarter of the book, a colorful antagonist emerges in the person of John Sununu, the famously combative Chief of Staff of the Bush Administration, who effectively becomes the face of climate denialism of the time. Rich examines whether Sununu single-handedly torpedoed the 1989 Noordwijk conference's attempt to establish a binding global treaty to limit greenhouse gases.
The author steps back to suggest the real villain may not be any one person, but a collective institutional resistance to accept short-term costs in favor of longterm benefits. Repeatedly the book shows politicians, oil industry executives and other influential figures voicing abstract concerns over climate change, only to walk back their statements the closer they get to actually doing something.
The book's narrative is generally so strong that it leaves you wishing Rich brought similar research to bear on the subsequent decades, as the science grew more explicit, but climate denialism dug in even harder. It's like the failed Noordwijk conference marks the end of the first act, but Act Two is confined to a 27-page afterword.
Rich's righteous rhetoric, supported by a command of the facts, has a sharpness comparable to Thomas Paine's pamphlets arguing the case for U.S. independence from England. His afterword in particular pulls no punches: "When a government relaxes regulations on coal-fired plants or erases scientific data from a federal website, it is guilty of more than merely bowing to corporate interests; it commits crimes against humanity."
Losing Earth is not a book to be read at bedtime, assuming you don't want to be stressed out over the globe's fate while trying to sleep. Rich clearly wants to wake readers up.

Texto completo: Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.
"Optics." This word seems to be a trendy addition to our vocabulary. Like me, you have probably encountered it most often in political reporting.
By doing a little research, I was surprised to learn that William Safire wrote about this term a decade ago in his last column for On Language, a once regular feature in the New York Times Magazine.
In essence, Safire (and later his successor, Bill Zimmer) noted that the term "optics" is merely a scientific-sounding buzzword for image-making. How the "optics" are understood is critical; but it is not always the same for every person.
Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.
To interpret a picture in a children's book, a visually literate reader considers the composition of the picture and sees beyond the colors and lines to the social constructs that are revealed. (And, yes, children do this! But they do this better if adults help!)
If you want to enhance your children's visual literacy, start by selecting a few wordless books. Wordless books focus on making meaning from images ALONE! Here are a few strategies that parents, caregivers and teachers might use while reading a wordless book:
Develop vocabulary to help your children talk about the picture. Consider these terms: line, shape, size, color, space and point of view/perspective. For example, specifically ask your child why an illustrator used a particular color or why certain objects are larger or smaller, or why the illustrator drew the image from a specific point of view. Ask about that white space and why the illustrator chose to add that to the page.
When you come upon a particularly interesting picture in a wordless book, pause. Use these three questions as you look at a page: What do you see? What do you think about what you see? What do you wonder about this image?
Afterward, have your children draw pictures to help them express their response to the image.
There are so many superb wordless picture books, but here are three that will help enhance your child's visual literacy:
"Another" by Christian Robinson is a recently published wordless book that has received starred reviews from many sources. Reviewers have called this book a "work or art and a celebration of childhood." Join the main characters, a little girl and her cat, as they explore another world that seems to be both enchanting and puzzling.
"Wave" by South Korean author/illustrator Suzy Lee offers images of a child protagonist who is investigating the beach for the first time. This book provides extraordinary images for discussion.
"Shadow," also by Lee, provides another opportunity to "read" a story told in just three colors: black, white and yellow. The setting is a dark attic, but it is a lightbulb and the child's imagination that offer an ideal venue to expand your child's visual literacy.
Perhaps Henry David Thoreau provided the best summary for thinking about visual literacy when he wrote, "It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."
Anita N. Voelker, Ph.D., is a children's book enthusiast, reading specialist and scholar who writes occasionally for The Arizona Republic. If you have questions about children's literature, send her an email at avoelker51@cox.net.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, was arraigned on Friday and pleaded not guilty to charges that he lied to the Justice Department and withheld information about work he did for the government of Ukraine.
Mr. Craig appeared in federal court in Washington a day after he was indicted on the charges, which grew out of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
Mr. Craig was arraigned before Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson, who released him on relatively unrestrictive terms, ordering that he continue to reside at his current address and not travel outside the Washington metro area.
William Murphy, a lawyer for Mr. Craig, asked to revisit the terms of Mr. Craig's release on Monday, when Mr. Craig will appear before Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court in Washington for another hearing. Mr. Murphy also said he planned to ask that Mr. Craig be allowed to keep his passport.
The indictment alleged that, while a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Mr. Craig took on work on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine. The work was brought to Mr. Craig by Paul Manafort, then a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych and later the campaign chairman for President Trump in 2016. The charges stated that Mr. Craig lied in order to avoid registering with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and withheld information about the full scope of his activities.
At the heart of the case is whether Mr. Craig's interaction with a reporter for The New York Times triggered the requirement for him to register under the foreign lobbying law.
Mr. Craig is a prominent Democrat and a veteran of the Obama and Clinton administrations. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump complained on Twitter that the indictment had not received sufficient attention from the news media, despite the "very serious charges" it described.
Mr. Craig maintained his innocence in a video shared on YouTube on Thursday. He and his lawyers left quietly after the hearing without giving comment.

Candace Owens’ false statement that the Southern strategy is a myth

Texto completo: During a congressional hearing on hate crimes, conservative African American commentator Candace Owens said that the Republican Party never had a strategy of capitalizing on racism to lure voters.
Owens said that black conservatives face criticism from the left because they “have the audacity to think for ourselves and become educated about our history, and the myth of things, like the Southern switch and the Southern strategy, which never happened.”
The “Southern strategy” refers to efforts by the Republican Party to appeal to Southern white voters who were turned off by the Democratic Party advocating for civil rights.
Historians disputed her statement — Princeton historian Kevin Kruse called it “utter nonsense.”
Owens is a spokesperson for the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA and encourages black people to leave the Democratic Party (calling it “Blexit”). She did not respond to a request for comment. On Twitter, she said she was referring to the “myth” that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress switched parties.
The facts about the Southern strategy
For this fact-check, we interviewed historians and reviewed news articles from the civil rights era.
Joseph Alsop, an influential syndicated newspaper columnist, called it “basically a segregationist strategy” in a 1962 column.
When Republican Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, his Southern surrogates played up the fact that he had just voted against the Civil Rights Act. That paid off in the Deep South where he won a handful of states, but he ultimately lost to Lyndon B. Johnson.
By 1968, the Republicans fine-tuned their approach and packaged it in a way they could win, said Maxwell, the Arkansas professor and an expert on southern politics.
Republican nominee Richard Nixon reached out to white Southerners by opposing school busing and promising that his administration would not “ram anything down your throats” and would appoint “strict constructionist” Supreme Court justices.
The strongest evidence of the Southern strategy comes directly from Republicans at the time.
That includes Clarence Townes, who served as director of the Minorities Division of the Republican National Committee in the 1960s. Harvard professor Leah Wright Rigueur wrote about Townes in her book “The Loneliness of the Black Republican.”
When Nixon disbanded the division, Townes told reporters in 1970, “There’s a total fear of what’s called the Southern strategy. Blacks understand that their wellbeing is being sacrificed to political gain. There has to be some moral leadership from the president on the race question, and there just hasn’t been any.”
In 1969, Nixon White House aide Lamar Alexander, who now represents Tennessee in the U.S. Senate, wrote about the Southern strategy in a memo following the unsuccessful Supreme Court nomination of Clement Haynsworth, who was opposed by civil rights groups.
“SOUTHERN STRATEGY — we flat out invited the kind of political battle that ultimately erupted when we named a Democrat-turned-Republican conservative from South Carolina. This confirmed the Southern strategy just at a time when it was being nationally debated,” Alexander wrote.
Nixon strategist Kevin Phillips told the New York Times in 1970 that the Republicans were never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the “Negro vote and they don’t need any more than that.”
“The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans,” he wrote. “That’s where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats.”
Our ruling
Owens said the Southern strategy is a “myth” that “never happened.”
Efforts by the Republican Party starting in the 1960s to win over white Southern voters have been documented by scholars for decades.
The strongest evidence that it happened comes from the Republicans who were part of that strategy. There are numerous instances of them talking about the approach in documents or interviews.
We rate this statement False.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In an indictment that seized the attention of the capital's K Street lobbying corridor, Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel in the Obama administration, was charged on Thursday with lying to the Justice Department and concealing information about work he did in 2012 for the government of Ukraine.
The indictment of Mr. Craig, 74, stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
The charges represented a continuation -- and an expansion -- of a new focus on a long-neglected law governing foreign influence operations in the United States, which the Justice Department has begun prioritizing in part because of scrutiny related to Mr. Mueller's investigation.
Mr. Craig, in a video posted on YouTube on Thursday night, called the charges against him "unprecedented and unjustified," and expressed confidence "that both the judge and the jury will agree with me."
[Read the indictment.]
The Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, had been the basis for charges brought against several people who had been investigated by the special counsel. The 1938 law requires Americans to register with the Justice Department when they lobby or do public relations in the United States for foreign politicians, parties or governments.
Before Mr. Craig's indictment, the recent charges brought in cases initiated by Mr. Mueller had accused people of failing to disclose their lobbying work.
The charges against Mr. Craig, on the other hand, stem from public relations, rather than lobbying. While Mr. Craig was not charged with failing to register under the law, the indictment accuses him of lying to, and withholding information from, the Justice Department officials who oversee FARA in order to avoid registration.
Before the indictment, Mr. Craig's lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy, pointing out that Mr. Mueller's team had referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to foreign lobbying laws, but that they did not bring charges. Instead, the case was moved in January to Washington.
"Mr. Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration," Mr. Craig's lawyers, William Taylor and William Murphy, said in a statement on Thursday, referring to the part of the Justice Department that oversees the law. "That is what this trial will be all about."
By Thursday afternoon, the indictment and its implications were a hot topic for Washington's lucrative lobbying and communications consulting industry.
The charges will prompt even more diligent review of possible compliance obligations by consultants who represent foreign clients, said Thomas J. Spulak, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm who advises on lobbying compliance.
"It's pretty significant," he said. "It's not just trying to influence the government; it's trying to influence the American public." He added, of Mr. Craig's case, "If they can establish the facts, then I think it's a pretty serious violation."
Mr. Craig's indictment also attracted notice because he is the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel's investigation. An Ivy League-educated lawyer, Mr. Craig held prominent positions in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.
The charges "undermine the narrative of President Trump and congressional Republicans that the Mueller probe was a Democratic witch hunt meant to bring down Trump and the G.O.P.," said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.
The indictment said Mr. Craig "did not want to register as an agent for the government of Ukraine" partly because he believed doing so would make it less likely that he and others at his firm at the time, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, would be appointed to federal government posts. Mr. Obama had put rules in place restricting the work that former lobbyists could do in his administration.
The indictment said Mr. Craig also wanted to hide the identity of the Ukrainian oligarch who paid $4 million to fund the overwhelming majority of the fees received by Skadden Arps for the Ukraine work.
In his YouTube video, Mr. Craig identified the oligarch as Viktor Pinchuk, a steel magnate who has portrayed himself as pro-Western, and who has donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, as well as $150,000 to Mr. Trump's since-shuttered charitable foundation.
Mr. Pinchuk's representatives have said that "he had no connection to the project either professionally or personally" and "was not the source of any funds used to pay fees of Skadden in producing the report."
The work was done on behalf of the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine, and consisted primarily of producing a report on the prosecution and jailing by Mr. Yanukovych's government of one of his rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. The Skadden Arps team also agreed to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case.
The work was steered to Mr. Craig and his firm by Paul Manafort, who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr. Yanukovych. Mr. Manafort intended to use the report to quell Western criticism of Mr. Yanukovych.
Mr. Manafort, who went on to become Mr. Trump's campaign chairman in 2016, was sentenced last month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr. Mueller's team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA, as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine.
Mr. Craig is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday.
In his video statement, Mr. Craig said his team at Skadden Arps "researched the requirements for registration under FARA and agreed that the law firm did not need to register." He also said that the report the team produced "was critical of important aspects of the trial, which we found to be flawed."
After the report was released, and Mr. Craig was quoted discussing it in an article in The New York Times, the Justice Department reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government.
The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was required to register. But it reversed itself the next year after Mr. Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine.
After the initial determination, Mr. Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report. Rather, he claimed he distributed the report only "in response to requests from the media," according to a letter he sent to the department at the time.
In the indictment, prosecutors presented evidence that Mr. Craig did reach out to The Times and was involved in the media rollout strategy for the report.
A spokeswoman for The Times said, "To date, we have not received a subpoena in the investigation and have not provided information to the government."
Mr. Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort.
Skadden Arps reached a settlement in January with the Justice Department that allowed the firm to avoid prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay $4.6 million, to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA, to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine.
Taken together, the indictment of Mr. Craig and the settlement with Skadden Arps suggest that the Justice Department is trying to "make an example of this prominent lawyer and law firm so that parties receiving D.O.J. inquiries in the future will take them more seriously," said Matthew Sanderson, who advises clients on compliance with FARA and other lobbying laws for the firm Caplin & Drysdale.
"In the past, the department would send letters of inquiry to organizations that would receive only a cursory response or be disregarded altogether," he said. "That, apparently, will no longer be tolerated."

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence defended his opposition to same-sex marriage in an interview Wednesday in which he also scolded Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg for making comments "critical of my Christian faith and about me personally. "
"He knows better," Pence said in a CNBC interview scheduled to air Thursday. "He knows me. "
Asked by CNBC's Joe Kernen if his position on marriage equality had evolved in the past two decades as public opinion has shifted, Pence said: "My family and I have a view of marriage that’s informed by our faith. "
"And we stand by that," Pence continued. "But that doesn’t mean that we’re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view. "
His comments were the latest development in what Buttigieg, the openly-gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has called his "long and complicated relationship" with the former Indiana governor.
The Democrat and Republican worked together on economic development and other issues in Indiana.
“We had a great working relationship," Pence said on CNBC.
But Buttigieg was a vocal opponent of a "religious freedom" law Pence backed that critics called a license to discriminate against gay people.
As Buttigieg has been exploring a presidential bid that he's expected to make official Sunday, he's frequently criticized Pence and his record on gay rights issues.
In remarks Sunday that received widespread media attention, Buttigieg said he wished the “Mike Pences” of the world would understand that he didn’t choose to be gay.
“That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,” Buttigieg said at a fundraising brunch for a group that supports LGBTQ candidates.
After delivering a speech at the United Nations and before the CNBC interview Wednesday, Pence ignored shouted questions from reporters about whether he believes people choose to be gay.
Buttigieg vs. Pence: Tensions flare in 'long and complicated' relationship between Pete Buttigieg and Mike Pence
'A voice from the Christian left': Buttigieg to Pence: If you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is with my creator
Republicans have accused Buttigieg of attacking Pence to raise his own profile, even though he previously had a cordial relationship with Pence.
The vice president, likewise, told Kernan that he understands the Democratic field is crowded and "they're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are than the other. "
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Buttigieg's attacks "have miffed the vice president, who has privately told allies that if Mr. Buttigieg had questions about his religious beliefs, he could have asked him at any time during their friendship. "
Pence's wife and daughter have also weighed in this week as they've made media appearances promoting their new children's book about the family's pet rabbit.
“It’s perfectly OK for us to believe what we believe. People shouldn’t take that as us attacking what they believe,” Karen Pence said on Fox News Tuesday. “Mike Pence can believe what he believes. And Mayor Pete can believe what he believes. ”
In the children's book that Charlotte Pence wrote and her mother illustrated, the family rabbit visits places in Washington meant to illustrate the meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance. First stop is the Washington National Cathedral, which, the rabbit learns, is a symbol of religious freedom
"I wrote this book before religious liberty was a hot topic," Charlotte Pence said on Fox when asked about Buttigieg's criticisms of her father. "I think it is important for kids to learn at a young age that religious liberty means you can believe in God or you can not believe in God. And you don't have to be afraid to hold that belief. "
Buttigieg, who talks often about his faith on the campaign trail, told reporters Monday that most Christians understand that it's not OK to discriminate against gay people.
"It's time to move on to a more inclusive and more humane vision of faith than what this vice president represents," he said.

Texto completo: Four years after she says she was raped by Michigan State University basketball players, a former MSU student plans to hold a news conference Thursday about her federal lawsuit against the school.
"I don't want any other girl who has gone through this, or who God forbid may have to go through something like this, to feel for one second that they should be too afraid to come out and do something," Bailey Kowalski said in a phone interview last week with the New York Times, which published it Wednesday.
Kowalski, who had not previously been named, filed a federal lawsuit in April 2018 against MSU over the case. She has not named the players involved
MSU has fought the case in federal court and a motion to dismiss it is pending. MSU's lawyers have argued that Kowalski can't sue them because the rape didn't happen on campus.
"Plaintiff has every right to pursue appropriate criminal and civil remedies against the students who assaulted her," the filing says. "Plaintiff, however, cannot show that MSU is responsible for criminal actions that did not occur on its campus. Nor can she fault MSU's conduct after the assault where she never told any MSU employees who were in a position to take action, and she never requested any remedies from MSU that were not provided."
Kowalski told the Times MSU has attacked her in an effort to stop others.
"They went out to the press and essentially addressed my lawsuit as a lie," Kowalski said, "which basically was a message to anyone else coming forward with allegations similar to mine that, 'If you're going to do that, we're going to completely exploit you.'"
The suit alleges three unnamed players — identified only as John Doe 1, 2 and 3 — took the 18-year-old student, Jane Doe, home from an East Lansing bar between the evening of April 11, 2015, and the morning of April 12.
Kowalski alleges she was at Harper's Bar when the Spartans' basketball team arrived after midnight. One of the players offered to buy her a drink and asked whether she would like to meet "other guys" from the team. The woman, who was a sports journalism major, alleges one of the players then invited her to a party at an apartment and one player "lied" and told the woman her roommate was on her way to the party.
The lawsuit says the woman was having a difficult time holding her glass, though she said she did not have a lot to drink. She then accepted a ride to the party from two players — the party was at one of their off-campus apartments — but there was no party and her roommate was not there.
'Feeling discombobulated' The lawsuit alleges the woman "was feeling discombobulated" and tried to send a text but could not control her thumbs and believed she may have been drugged. Then the first player allegedly pulled her into a bedroom and told her, "You are mine for the night."
After the woman asked for water and to see basketball memorabilia, the second player then took her to another room when the lights went out.
According to the lawsuit, the woman said she was forcefully thrown face-down onto the bed and held so she could not move while the second player raped her from behind. The woman was crying and could not speak, her lawsuit claims, and she did not consent to the activity.
The lawsuit alleges the first player and a third player took turns raping her after the second player. The woman claims she does not remember anything until waking up on a couch a few hours later, then called a taxi back to her dorm. There, her roommate told her she did not know about a party.
The woman reported the rape to a counselor at the MSU Counseling Center on April 20, 2015, and completed an initial intake and assessment. When she disclosed to the counselor that the three men who allegedly raped her were MSU basketball players, the female counselor's demeanor reportedly changed and she told the alleged victim she needed another person in the room with them. According to the lawsuit, it was not clear who the additional person was or why the person was brought into the room.
'An uphill battle' According to the lawsuit, the MSU Counseling Center staffers then "made it clear to Plaintiff that if she chose to notify the police, she faced an uphill battle that would create anxiety and unwanted media attention and publicity as had happened with many other female students who were sexually assaulted by well-known athletes."
The staff members, per the court filing, then advised the woman they had seen a lot of these cases with "guys with big names" and the best thing to do is to "just get yourself better."
Kowalski never reported the alleged sexual assault to police, said Karen Truszkowski, the woman's attorney. The lawsuit asserts that the counseling center failed to properly advise her and even implied it would not be in her "best interest to report the incident to law enforcement."
After the lawsuit was filed, MSU issued a statement denying the counseling center suggested she keep quiet. That statement included details about her counseling center visits. After the Free Press wrote a story about how the statement likely violated student privacy laws, MSU apologized for the statement and took it down from its website.
The Free Press later reported that then-interim President John Engler was directly involved in the crafting of the statement. Engler has since been forced out of office.

Warren raises $6m in quarter

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren raised $6 million in her first three months as a presidential candidate, her campaign announced Wednesday, a total that falls short of several Democratic newcomers as she tries to stand out in a crowded field by swearing off some common funding tactics.
The senator's $6 million haul from 135,000 donors puts her near the back of the pack of top-tier Democratic candidates but is enough to keep her extensiveoperation afloat — a development that probably will ease the concerns of some allies who worried her first-quarter totals would be dismal after she decided to forgo courtingwealthy donors.
About 99 percent of contributions to Warren were for less than $200, demonstrating the breadth of her support among small donors. But she trails the leader among Democrats, Senator Bernie Sanders, who raised $18.2 million in the first quarter.
In a bright spot for her campaign, Warren gained considerable fund-raising momentum as the quarter wore on. She raised $1.4 million in the last week of March alone, after her campaign warned supporters in numerous e-mails she was being outraised by other candidates. The figure was nearly 25 percent of her total over the three-month period that began Jan. 1.
And the Massachusetts Democrat saw a spike in donations on the day she announced she was swearing off large dollar fund-raisers in February, suggesting to campaign officials that grass-roots progressives are responding to her strategy. Warren has more time to travel to unconventional primary states such as Mississippi and keep up a grueling campaign pace because she's not on the fancy fund-raising circuit, her aides argue.
“Because Elizabeth's been able to count on grassroots donations, she's been able to spend her time visiting as many states as possible, meeting voters, and calling grassroots donors to personally thank them for giving," Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau wrote to supporters in an e-mail announcing the total. Her adviser Joe Rospars, an Obama veteran, put it this way on Twitter: “Time is worth more than money."
Still, for a candidate who entered the 2020 race on Dec. 31 with high expectations, the total is a sign that it could be difficult for her to stay competitive in the money chase while relying solely on small-dollar donors. She burned through $5 million in three months, but still has $11 million cash on hand due to the hefty war chest she had going in as a candidate.
Warren raised more than Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, who pulled in about $5 million each. But she lagged behind less-established candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, the once little-known mayor of South Bend, Ind., who reported $7 million in contributions in his first quarter as a candidate; former Texas representative Beto O'Rourke, who pulled in $9.4 million; and Senator Kamala Harris of California, who raised $12 million.
Without directly naming Harris or O'Rourke, Lau suggested in his e-mail to supporters that those candidates are overly reliant on wealthy donors. “One of the other candidates who had more or less the same number of donations raised 55% more money because of big-dollar contributions," Lau wrote, in a veiled reference to O'Rourke's $9.4 million total.
Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg all reported having around the same number of total donors to their campaigns, but Warren's average donation size was much lower than theirs at only $28. This suggests she raised less than them because she received fewer big contributions from wealthy donors. Based on the limited information that candidates have shared so far, only Sanders has a lower average donation rate than Warren among the top-tier candidates, at $20.
Early fund-raising is just one measure of momentum, and the candidate with the most money in the bank is not necessarily the one with the most supporters. But Warren'sfund-raising total casts some doubt on the wisdom of her decision to do away with the hybrid model of fund-raising she had mastered as a senator. For seven years, Warren brought in cash online with fiery appeals to the left's small donor base as well as by hosting wealthy contributors in her Cambridge home and at restaurants in events that cost thousands of dollars just to walk through the door.
That model built her a reputation as a fund-raising juggernaut and heightened expectations for her as a presidential candidate. She raised $42.5 million for her first election in 2012, and another $35 million between then and her reelection bid last year.
“I remember times where she would go on Rachel Maddow on an issue around the campaign — we'd send an e-mail out and we'd raise 2, 3, or $400,000 just from that appearance," Doug Rubin, a top adviser to Warren's 2012 campaign, told the Globe last month.
But in February, Warren announced she would no longer hold private fund-raisers or call wealthy people asking for donations. The new limitations came on top of her pledge not to take money from any political action committees or accept help from super PACs, which can pull in unlimited contributions. That vow alienated her longtime finance director, Michael Pratt, who is leaving the campaign, a development first reported by The New York Times.
Still, making a bet to rely solely on online fund-raising is risky, especially given that there were signs Warren's star power as an online fund-raiser was fading before she decided to run for president. For years, Warren was a sought-after surrogate who helped Democrats around the country bring in campaign cash, and she socked away a cool $11 million for her own presidential run before she declared.
But by the 2018 midterms, she was competing with newer faces in the party who were out-performing her online. One adviser to a 2018 Senate candidate who requested anonymity to talk freely said Warren's e-mails on that candidate's behalf would bring in only about half as much money as e-mails sent by Harris. In the first quarter, Harris pulled in about $6 million from her online donor base and another $6 million in part from the kinds of fund-raisers that Warren has sworn off.
Warren has the campaign infrastructure of a front-runner, with 80 staffers in the four states with early contests and about 170 people on staff total, according to an aide. Veterans of presidential politics estimate it could take $100 million for a candidate to get through the four early states alone before confronting primaries in the giant states of California and Texas, where pricey advertising becomes more important to reach voters.
“Here's the problem: The new map of having California and Texas so early means money is going to be even more important in the Democratic primary, unfortunately," said Jim Messina, who was Barack Obama's campaign manager for his 2012 run. “And Senator Warren just decided to get rid of half of her fund-raising ability."
Yet those who have watched Warren's career closely say not to count her out.
“You don't have to outraise people, you just have to be competitive," said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based political consultant. “The real test is the next quarter."

Texto completo: Tonne Goodman has a mantra for when things start to get a little messy: "This is happening for a reason." She is known for saying it on fashion sets when a model calls in sick or a runway look is stuck in customs.
And also when far more serious situations arise, like when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 44. She finds it reassuring because, as she explained, whatever then happens is some kind of fate, and in that lies mystery and curiosity. Often, it leads you on a better path.
Certainly, Ms. Goodman whispered the mantra aloud last summer when it was decided, by the powers that be, that she would surrender her role as fashion director of Vogue, where she had worked for nearly 20 years, and become a contributing editor -- a growing trend, these days, in the struggling magazine industry. Without a doubt, she has found herself on a curious new path.
"My overriding feeling is this is exciting," she said, seated on a white slipcovered couch in her Greenwich Village apartment, where she has lived for two decades. But her "inner feeling," she said, is something like fear.
Dressed in her crisp, unwavering wardrobe of white Levi's, Italian driving loafers and a silk Charvet scarf wrapped precisely around her neck, Ms. Goodman cuts a rather cool figure. From afar, she is the reserved, aloof foil to the colorful Grace Coddington, another Vogue editor. In practice, though, she is "the nicest" of the magazine's editors, as many of those who have worked with her attest.
While at Vogue she is known for styling her subjects in a classic, clean-cut manner -- "the practical woman," as she put it -- Ms. Goodman said that she loves "to do crazy things."
Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who assisted Ms. Goodman for four years at Vogue before becoming the style director of Garage magazine, said: "She's quiet and not bombastic and wears a uniform every day, but Tonne changed this industry and the way Americans look at fashion. Tonne is rad. She is the definition of radical." And in this new phase of her life, Ms. Goodman, 66, seems eager to reveal as much.
Cue her forthcoming book, "Point of View," which features, on an opening page, a full-frontal of Ms. Goodman, from her modeling days.
Sam Shahid, the book's art director and a longtime friend, sneaked the nude in, and for a while tried to hide it from her, but Ms. Goodman loved the idea. "One assumes this is just another fashion editor's book, and it's not," she said.
Granted, it is filled with one gorgeous and iconic image after another, stretching from her early days as a fashion reporter for The New York Times through her seminal stints as vice president for advertising at Calvin Klein and fashion director of Harper's Bazaar, to her tenure at Vogue, during which she styled more than 150 covers.
It is also quite personal, revealing pictures and anecdotes from her days growing up on the Upper East Side, the daughter of an artist and a surgeon, both of whom -- not surprisingly -- were attractive and stylish. Her mother wore a floor-length circle skirt for dinner every night, paired with cashmere and pearls. Her father would change into a green velvet smoking jacket. According to family lore, the photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt proclaimed them the handsomest couple in New York.
There are also striking photos of Maarten, a Dutch sailor with whom Ms. Goodman ran off to sea for four months at the age of 17; and Rob, a troubled waiter she fell madly for and followed to the desert.
She does not include images of Bailey Gimbel, the man she married and with whom she had two children, though she does mention their split. In fact, she touches, sparingly, on several searing aspects of her life, among them her bout with cancer, which coincided with the end of her marriage; and the time she feared she was having a miscarriage while in Paris for the collections.
The photographer Mario Testino, whom she didn't know well at the time, drove her in his Fiat Cinquecento to the hospital, where they learned that her son, Cole, now 25, was alive and well. Mr. Testino became his godfather.
"It's all part of my fabric," she said of including such intimate details. "The reason any photo shows up is because of what I experienced." She recalled one particularly emotional picture, shot by Peter Lindbergh during her Harper's Bazaar days. It features Amber Valletta running through the city wearing a set of wings.
"I was pregnant with Cole at the time," said Ms. Goodman, who also has a daughter named Evie. "This was my angel."
When it came to the book's cover, Evie, an artist, balked at the idea of using the very classic and minimalist David Sims image of Daria Werbowy in a Calvin Klein gown. "She thought it was too obvious," Ms. Goodman said. "That it didn't reflect all of me." Alas, Evie's racier pick, a Steven Klein photo of Ms. Valletta looking like a 1960s housewife who is up to no good, was nixed.
"It's actually one of my favorite pictures," Ms Goodman said. "But it didn't look like me."
If Ms. Goodman's creative output is, in part, a reflection of her life, it appears that she is having a ball these days. With Ms. Karefa-Johnson, she styled a rollicking evening wear story called "Black Cotillion" for Garage magazine.
"We had these divine girls and a brilliant hair and makeup team," Ms. Goodman said. "It was just a blast."
She also stepped in front of the lens -- something she was never comfortable doing, even as a model -- for the spring fashion issue of New York magazine. In it, she posed alongside Ms. Karefa-Johnson, whom she recently referred to on Instagram as her best friend, each of them charmingly wearing clothes that the other had chosen.
Then, during this past fashion week, Ms. Goodman popped up on the runway for the first time since the summer after her sophomore year in high school, taking a turn for CDLM, the buzzy new label from Chris Peters, one half of the Creatures of the Wind twosome. She wore a blanket scarf and cowboy boots, which had a higher heel than what she prefers to wear. Still, she was happy to be there.
"I wanted to support them," she said of the label, all of it made from repurposed material, whether recycled or dead stock. "And the collection was so chic."
Ms. Karefa-Johnson believes this is just the beginning. "It's kind of like how Stella got her groove back," she said. "Everyone wants a piece of Tonne, and she holds the power of entering the fashion scene in a whole new way."
As for what's next, Ms. Goodman is tossing around a host of ideas. Among them, a second book, called "Killed," with all the fabulous shots that never made it into Vogue; and a sustainable capsule collection for Calvin Klein.
"I feel there is a huge opportunity for a large brand to embrace sustainability in a way that is uncompromising," she said. "And Calvin is the definition of American fashion. Period. The end."
And, she added, with a smile, "I think it would be really fun."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren released her 2018 tax return on Wednesday morning, joining a growing group of Democratic presidential contenders who have made the information public as they seek to use the issue of financial transparency as a cudgel against President Trump.
Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, reported a combined adjusted gross income of $846,394, and had $230,965 in total taxes, according to the return, a drop of about $67,000 from her adjusted gross income in 2017. Overall, they paid about a 26% tax rate, down from nearly 28% in 2017.
The couple's main sources of income were $402,897 from Harvard, which Mann earns as a law professor, Warren's $176,280 salary as a senator, and $324,687 in writing income related to her books (Warren is also a professor emeritus at Harvard, but does not draw a salary for that title). Those added up to a total income of $905,742 before various deductions.
After withholdings and other payments, Warren and Mann owed $24,477 in taxes for 2018, and made $50,128 in charitable gifts.
Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has called for more transparency in government as a way to curtail corruption and self-enrichment in Washington, put 10 years of her tax returns online last summer.
The release of tax returns from presidential candidates like Warren, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota comes as Democrats ramp up pressure on Trump to release his own tax returns, which he has refused to do in defiance of longstanding norms around the presidency. Congressman Richard Neal, the Springfield Democrat who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, requested Trump's returns last week, and other Democrats in the House are seeking ways to get to the returns.
Warren is among a group of candidates who have revealed more than a decade of their own tax returns, hoping to draw a contrast with Trump and pressure other Democrats, like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, to do the same.
But by drawing attention to their own personal finances, Warren and some other Democrats also are highlighting their own wealth, creating some awkwardness as they vie to take on the billionaire Trump by emphasizing issues such as economic inequality and the eroding middle class.
According to her reported financial disclosure forms, which list assets in ranges, Warren and Mann hold between $4 million and about $11 million in investment funds and retirement accounts. Last year, she also received a $300,000 advance for her book, “This Fight is our Fight."
Other candidates who have yet to release their tax returns may end up revealing aspects of their own financial successes if and when they do so.
Sanders, who has been criticized for not releasing more of his tax returns, told the New York Times on Tuesday that he plans to do so by April 15 — and said he had crossed into millionaire territory thanks to his book sales. O'Rourke had a net worth of nearly $9 million in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and has told reporters on the campaign trail he plans to release his tax returns soon.
Other millionaire candidates in the Democratic presidential field reportedly include former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman who has loaned his campaign more than $4.5 million.
It is hardly unusual for candidates for high office to be wealthy. Every president since Harry Truman has been or became a millionaire. And members of Congress tend to be wealthier than most Americans; Warren was the 28th-richest member of the Senate in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks political spending, and Roll Call, a Capitol Hill news publication, ranked her as the 19th-richest member of the Senate last year.
(In 2018, the four wealthiest members of the Senate were all Democrats: Mark Warner of Virginia, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri).
But, regardless of their level of wealth, many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are hoping transparency about their finances will help them in an era of government distrust. Warren has introduced a sweeping anti-corruption package that includes requiring tax returns for candidates for president and vice president to be released by the IRS — a proposal that sometimes draws standing ovations when she brings it up on the campaign trial.
Gillibrand, who was the first of the 2020 contenders to release her 2018 tax return, posted previous tax returns online going back to 2007. Klobuchar posted 12 years of tax returns in early April. Jay Inslee, the Washington governor who is focusing his presidential campaign on climate change, has posted 12 years worth of returns.

Texto completo: For the Democrats, it's still all about the collusion narrative.
They don't care that the Mueller Report concluded that Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians did not cooperate to steal the 2016 election.
President Trump's crazed enemies in Congress and in the liberal media will never believe Trump won fair and square.
You can give the House committees headed by Democrats Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler two more years of digging around in Trump World for impeachable crimes.
You can give them 800 pages, a thousand pages, ten-thousand more pages of interviews. You can give them another $30 million to waste on lawyers and investigators. They won't find anything, but it won't matter.
The "Russia collusion" narrative of the Trump Hating Industrial Complex will never die.
The Democrats just "know" that the epic tragedy of Hillary Clinton's defeat could only have happened because Donald Trump cheated.
The president himself was never under investigation for collusion. Yes, but, but, but, the Democrats say, his son took that meeting with a Russian woman peddling dirt on Hillary.
And his national security adviser for 24 days, Michael Flynn, met with that jolly Russian ambassador.
And his longtime pal Roger Stone supposedly tried to get more hacked Hillary emails from Wikileaks.
It wasn't against the law for Trump's son or the others to meet with or talk to those Russians, by the way. In the deranged minds of Trump haters and the liberal media, however, those and a few other brief encounters with Russians by Trump underlings are solid proof of collusion.
But Muller and his gang of lawyers, including several who were closely connected with the Clinton mob, obviously didn't agree. No collusion, no obstruction was their verdict.
Meanwhile, while we wait for Attorney General Bill Barr to release the full but redacted Mueller Report, I wonder how long it'll take the liberal mainstream media to investigate the folks who really colluded with the Russians in 2016 — the Democrats.
Their collusion was instigated by Hillary's campaign and the Democratic National Committee when they paid the research company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.
Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, an ex-British spy, who created a fake, salacious dossier on Donald Trump that Hillary partisans in the highest offices of the FBI used to get FISA surveillance warrants against low-level Trump staffers like George Papadopoulos.
So far, Fox News, talk radio and conservatives in Congress have been the only ones talking about or investigating the partisan origins and FBI's misuse of the so-called "Steele dossier."
You'd think the crack investigative journalists at the New York Times or Washington Post would be covering the heck out of this shocking and dangerous abuse of power by the FBI.
You'd think they'd want to expose how far the Democrats and some top political appointees in the FBI were willing to go to prevent someone they didn't like from becoming president.
But so far, the great institutions of the liberal news media are sticking to the "Trump Collusion" script.
They hope to find new stuff in the footnotes of the Mueller Report to fit their Russian collusion narrative, which they refuse to accept has turned out to be the political hoax the president always said it was.
With the economy strong, black and Latino employment at their highest levels and a trade deal with China in the works, the Russian collusion narrative is the only issue the Democrats have.
You know the Muller team tried its best to get anything they could to nail President Trump on collusion. But they came up with zip, ultimately because they were professionals.
Unfortunately, the Democrats in the House running their purely political sideshows are not professionals interested in fairness or the truth.
Schiff and Nadler are partisan, power-hungry hacks who are out to do whatever they can to stymie Trump's agenda and prevent his reelection chances.
Michael Reagan is the son of President Ronald Reagan.

Seized funds are focus of court bid

Texto completo: Lawyers for former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst will head to federal court in Boston next week to try to persuade a judge to release funds that authorities seized from Ernst's accounts following his arrest in the nationwide college admissions cheating scandal.
The hearing on Ernst's request to free up the funds is slated for April 17 at 10 a.m. at the Moakley Courthouse in the Seaport, according to a judicial order in the case entered Tuesday.
In court papers filed last week, attorneys for Ernst, a ­Cranston, R.I., native who owns homes in Falmouth and Chevy Chase, Md., said he needs access to the cash for legal fees, which will probably eclipse $250,000, and living expenses.
Ernst's request came a day after 13 parents, including Hollywood actress Felicity Huffman, and one coach agreed to plead guilty in the investigation that prosecutors dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues." Court documents filed Monday indicated that another parent is also considering a plea deal.
Federal authorities seized more than $1.1 million from four of Ernst's accounts pursuant to warrants, but Ernst's legal team says prosecutors haven't tied the money to alleged criminal activity.
Ernst is charged with racketeering conspiracy for allegedly collecting bribes totaling $2.7 million over several years in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Ernst once gave Michelle Obama tennis lessons and told The New York Times in 2014 that the then-first lady had a powerful backhand.
A total of 50 defendants were charged in the college scheme, in which wealthy parents allegedly paid bribes to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at elite schools, or to facilitate cheating on their children's SAT and ACT exams.
The parents cut checks to William “Rick" Singer, the admitted ringleader of the scheme whose entities collected roughly $25 million over several years and who funneled money to corrupt coaches and other accomplices, according to prosecutors.
“Even assuming that Mr. Ernst could sell his Maryland home (he cannot sell his Massachusetts condominium in light of the restraining order), its sale will not generate proceeds net of costs and commissions, sufficient for his legal defense," Ernst's lawyers wrote in the motion.
In related news, yet another parent caught up in the probe appears to be pondering a plea deal.
Toby MacFarlane is negotiating with federal prosecutors over a possible guilty plea, according to court documents. MacFarlane, 56, was a top-ranking official at a title insurance company and a resident of Del Mar, Calif., according to records.
Both the prosecution and MacFarlane's defense lawyers notified the court on Monday that “they are engaged in plea discussions and believe that Defendant will most likely plead guilty" before he is indicted, according to court records.
MacFarlane allegedly paid bribes totaling $450,000 to have his daughter and son falsely certified as USC athletic recruits, according to prosecutors. His daughter graduated from USC in 2018, and his son was accepted in 2017 but withdrew in May 2018, records show.
The daughter was presented as a soccer recruit and her brother, who stands 5-foot-5, was certified as a 6-foot-1 basketball recruit, according to legal filings. Neither sibling played sports at USC.

NYC declares health emergency amid measles outbreak

Texto completo: New York City declared a health emergency Tuesday after a measles outbreak was reported in a highly orthodox-Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn.

“Today, I am declaring a public health emergency due to the measles outbreak,” said Oxiris Barbot, the city’s health commissioner. “ [The department] is ordering all people in Williamsburg to get vaccinated against measles.”

Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is eyeing a 2020 run for president, called the recent measles outbreak “very troubling” during a news conference Tuesday.

The city has seen 285 confirmed cases since the outbreak began in the fall, according to the New York Times. A total of 21 of those cases led to hospitalizations, including five admissions to the intensive care unit.

Days earlier in nearby Rockland County, a northern suburb of the city, public health officials banned unvaccinated children from public spaces, a measure that was later struck down by a judge.

The city said Tuesday it would fine or possibly shut down Jewish schools in the Brooklyn neighborhood that do not mandate people receive the measles vaccination.

Texto completo: Allison Mack, actriz de la serie de televisión “Smallville” sobre Superman, se declaró ayer culpable de crimen organizado en el caso de la secta Nxivm, cuyos dirigentes están acusados de tráfico y esclavitud sexual en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y de conspiración, pero aún tienen pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
“He llegado a la conclusión de que debo asumir toda la responsabilidad sobre mi conducta y es por eso que me declaro culpable hoy”, dijo la actriz, citada por el medio Hollywoodlife.
Mack se encontraba en libertad condicional desde el año pasado, así como Clare Bronfman (40), una de las herederas del conglomerado de licores tradicionalmente conocido como Seagram’s.
El supuesto líder del grupo, Keith Raniere (58), es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Mack también pidió perdón a su familia y a todas aquellas personas que hirió por su “adherencia equivocada a las enseñanzas de Keith Reniere”, líder de la secta, reseñó EFE.
Según la fiscalía, la actriz recibió beneficios financieros a cambio de reclutar esclavas sexuales para Reniere.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación.
Otras acusadas son su hija Lauren Salzman y Kathy Russel.
Según la acusación, Nxivm formaba parte de un entramado piramidal formado por varias entidades. Entre los crímenes de los que se les acusan están “robo de identidad, extorsión, trabajos forzados, tráfico sexual, lavado de dinero, fraude y obstrucción a la justicia”.
Raniere exigía a su círculo cercano una lealtad absoluta.
Raniere llevaba dos décadas impulsando supuestos programas de autoayuda bajo la empresa paraguas Nxivm, de la que era fundador y que abarcaba centros operativos en Estados Unidos, México, Canadá y varios países de Suramérica.
En el año 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes” o “El voto”, donde era el único hombre y el líder, mientras que Mack era “una de las mujeres en el primer nivel de la pirámide, inmediatamente después” de él.
DOS operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”, y se esperaba de estas últimas que reclutaran a otras nuevas.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

New York Democrats aiming to get Trump tax returns

Texto completo: ALBANY - Some New York Democrats think they have a new way to get at President Donald Trump's tax returns.
A bill introduced Monday by a Democratic senator would allow the state Tax Department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Holyman, D-Manhattan, said the measure would be a way to assist the Democrat-controlled House in its efforts to review the president's state returns, which would have a bevy of information since Trump and his businesses are based in New York.
The bill is latest attempt by Democrats in the state Legislature to try to find a way to compel the president to release his state taxes.
What would the Trump bill do? The proposal would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request from the state Department of Taxation and Finance the president's federal tax returns.
The New York bill comes after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., last week asked the IRS to release six years of Trump's tax returns by April 10. But the Trump administration has resisted.
White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday called the efforts by Democrats a "political stunt." He said the issue of Trump's tax returns "was already litigated during the election."
State GOP Chairman Ed Cox ripped the measures proposed by Democrats in New York.
"The Democratic legislature and Governor Cuomo are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and playing politics at the expense of doing the people's business," Cox said in a statement.
Could the bill pass? Some New York Democrats believe they are in a unique position to pass a state law that would force the release of Trump's state taxes because he is a New Yorker.
"There's a copy of President Trump's tax returns right here in New York state, in an office somewhere," Assemblyman David Buchwald, D-White Plains, who sponsors one of the bills, said at a news conference Monday on the issue.
"And the only thing that prevents that state income-tax from being made public is a state statute that we, the state Legislature, have the power to amend."
Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-Manhattan, told The New York Times the New York bill would be helpful.
"The state return, presumably, has to match the federal return," he said, adding, "It just makes the work of the federal committee, that has a legitimate reason to look into this, a little easier to see the complete picture."

Texto completo: The new limited series "Fosse/Verdon" shimmies onto FX. And Nicole Kidman's crime thriller arrives on Hulu.
What's on TV
FOSSE/VERDON 10 p.m. on FX. This eight-part series stars Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams as the dance world's most famous power couple: the choreographer-director Bob Fosse and the actress-dancer Gwen Verdon. Based on Sam Wasson's biography of Fosse, and told over a period of five decades, it charts their ability to bring out the best -- and worst -- in each other, paying particular attention to Fosse's affairs and Verdon's decision to put his career before hers. We get a glimpse of the creative process -- and whirlwind of emotions -- that fueled famous works like "Sweet Charity" and "Cabaret." "This series tap-dances as fast as it can, often stunningly," James Poniewozik wrote in his New York Times review. "But look past its sleek moves and what you're mostly left with, in a #MeToo era, is another #HimAgain? story."
THE BOLD TYPE 8 p.m. on Freeform. Season 3 is here, and with it comes plenty of changes. The last time we saw our three best friends they were in Paris wrestling with big life decisions. Now they are back in New York moving onward and upward. Jane (Katie Stevens) picks her new beau, Kat (Aisha Dee) tries her best to get over her breakup and Sutton (Meghann Fahy) considers moving in with Richard (Sam Page). Back at Scarlet Magazine, Jane is furious because a man has been hired to take over the digital division, relegating Jacqueline (Melora Hardin) to print editor. But Jacqueline isn't sweating it; she may have upset the board by running Jane's piece on Safford's health care policies, but at least it brought about change.
THE CODE 9 p.m. on CBS. This new drama series revolves around professionals who often work behind the scenes: prosecutors, defense lawyers and investigators tasked with managing legal challenges for the United States Marine Corps. The show opens with John Abraham (Luke Mitchell) and Maya Dobbins (Anna Wood) handling a case about a commanding officer who was murdered by a soldier in Afghanistan.
RECONSTRUCTION: AMERICA AFTER THE CIVIL WAR 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Henry Louis Gates Jr. hosts this four-hour documentary about the aftermath of the Civil War, chronicling the accomplishments of black leaders and activists and the setbacks they faced. The first half airs tonight; the second half airs next Tuesday.
What's Streaming
DESTROYER (2018) Stream on Hulu. Nicole Kidman, transformed by makeup nearly beyond recognition, delivers a powerful performance in this gruesome crime thriller. We first meet her in the present as Erin, a boozing mother and tormented detective with the Los Angeles Police Department whose red-rimmed eyes and sunken cheeks scream trauma. When she visits a murder scene with connections to her past, she's pulled back into a dangerous world she'd worked hard to escape. Flashbacks introduce us to younger Erin, an officer working undercover for the F.B.I. who became involved with her partner (Sebastian Stan) and chose a darker path.

16 Saudis Barred From U.S. Entry in Khashoggi Death

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, facing criticism that the Trump administration has sought to sweep away the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi's brutal killing, announced on Monday that 16 Saudis, including one of the closest aides to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were being barred from entry to the United States.
The list included the close aide, Saud al-Qahtani, who officially served as the royal court's media czar, but appeared to have overseen the operation to seize Mr. Khashoggi. It was one of a dozen or so operations by what American intelligence officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, set up by Mr. al-Qahtani to silence or eliminate dissent about Prince Mohammed's rapid rise to become the de facto Saudi leader.
But conspicuously missing from the list is Prince Mohammed himself, despite the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that he was ultimately responsible for sending the team to Istanbul to kill Mr. Khashoggi, and for other actions by the Rapid Intervention Group. More than a year before Mr. Khashoggi's death, American intelligence officials intercepted a communication from the crown prince saying that if Mr. Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist who lived in Virginia, did not voluntarily return to the kingdom and cease publishing his criticism, the state should go after him "with a bullet."
Based on the findings of the C.I.A., which he led until last year, Mr. Pompeo would have been free to add the crown prince to the list, though that would have been an unusual move to take against a leader of a close ally. But Mr. Pompeo has at times also sounded passive about the investigation, saying he was giving the Saudis time to complete their own inquiry.
By moving to name the Saudis and barring them and their immediate families from traveling to the United States, the Trump administration appears to be trying to tamp down an unusual uprising in Congress that has involved members of both parties.
But it is far from clear that the relatively minor penalty, against Saudis who would be unlikely to enter the United States under current conditions, will be viewed as sufficient. Mr. Pompeo and President Trump are likely to still face the accusation that they are deliberately ignoring the C.I.A.'s intelligence findings in an effort to put the killing behind them. Mr. Trump once called the report about the crown prince's involvement a "feeling" by the C.I.A., and has insisted that the evidence is not conclusive.
It is unclear whether their effort to move on from the killing will work: Congress has already moved to stop all American support for Saudi military action in Yemen, and there are questions about continued military transfers. And Mr. Trump's administration has been negotiating for two years now on a deal to sell civilian nuclear power designs and equipment to Saudi Arabia, an action that would require congressional approval and raises concerns about whether the Saudi government might use the technology to seek a nuclear weapon. The crown prince has been explicit that if Iran got a weapon, Saudi Arabia would as well.
The administration regards Saudi Arabia as its key partner in confronting Iran.
The announcement appeared timed to generate little news and less embarrassment for the Saudi crown prince. Mr. Pompeo's list was published Monday evening, on a day in which upheavals at the Department of Homeland Security and Mr. Pompeo's decision to name the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization dominated headlines. Mr. Pompeo had appeared at the State Department press room and took questions on the Iranian designation earlier Monday, making no mention of the approaching announcement on Saudi Arabia.
One American diplomat involved in Saudi affairs who was not authorized to speak on the subject said the decision to act had taken considerable time.
The Saudis have never publicly talked about the whereabouts of Mr. al-Qahtani, who was the crown prince's chief enforcer and one of the architects of the effort to consolidate his power. In private, Saudis say he is under house arrest. But there is no indication whether he is being criminally prosecuted, and some reports indicated that he continued to hold power until the investigation became too hot, and someone near the crown prince had to take the fall.
The list of barred Saudis also included several members of the team sent to Istanbul, where Mr. Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi Consulate in an encounter that the Saudis insist was intended to forcibly bring him back to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. It includes the leader of that team, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, an intelligence officer who knew Mr. Khashoggi from their days working together at the Saudi Embassy in London. He often traveled with the crown prince abroad.
Mr. Mutreb and another Saudi listed by the State Department, Thaar Ghaleb al-Harbi, a member of the royal guard and a favorite of the crown prince's for his role in fighting off an attack on one of Prince Mohammed's palaces, are standing trial, Saudi officials have told The New York Times.
Also listed was Salah Tubaigy, whom The Washington Post recently identified as a "medical specialist" for the Saudi Interior Ministry who is said to have administered a powerful sedative to Mr. Khashoggi during a struggle inside the consulate. He died shortly thereafter, perhaps because of the sedative, or his asthma, or because of strangulation.
His body was cut up and has never been recovered.
Much of the evidence against the men named in the State Department's list came from Turkey, which had surveillance videos outside the consulate and had apparently bugged the consulate itself, resulting in an audio recording of the killing.

Texto completo: CAPE CHARLES - As a Navy SEAL, Don Mann trained for brutal tests of mind and body.
With his life and those of his teammates often at stake, failing was not an option.
Retired since 1998, Mann hasn't been able to shake the urge to go to extremes. He's one of the original competitors in the Ironman Triathlon and a world-class adventure sports participant with more than 1,000 competitions under his belt. He attempted to climb Mt. Everest in 2016, but suffered from brain swelling and fluid in the lungs due to high altitude. He had to be helicoptered off the mountain.
"My life is based on pushing myself and helping others push themselves," said Mann, 61 and now a resident of the Eastern Shore. "Being in the SEALS has shaped all aspects of my life."
That career undoubtedly played a big role in Mann's selection out of hundreds to participate in "The Brigade," a new Outdoor Channel reality show that is right up his alley.
Billed as "The Race for the Hudson," the show features five Americans and five Canadians working as one team to finish a 750-mile portion of the York Factory Express, a centuries-old fur traders route from the Pacific coast to York Factory on the southeastern portion of the Hudson Bay.
The series was filmed last July and debuts later this month.
Chosen for their varying skills sets, any or all of the 10 who make it to York Factory in the allotted 28 days splits $500,000. Because of production restrictions, Mann is not yet allowed to talk about the outcome of the show.
"At first, I was really skeptical of these other folks," said Mann, who, on average, was twice as old as all but two of his teammates. "But they were all chosen for their particular strengths, and I realized what a great team this was going to be."
The group included a nurse, a hunting and fishing guide, a firefighter/paramedic, a whitewater rafting guide, an outdoor education instructor and a canoe guide, as well as several business community problem solvers.
During portions of the trip that included rapids, paddling and carrying their 29 foot, 2,500 pound Voyageur canoe over and down mountain passes, teammates were tested differently.
"Where we needed strength, some of us had to carry more of the weight," said Mann, a New York Times bestselling author who has written 12 books. "Some were better at paddling. It all just depended on the situation at the time."
Because no one on the team has seen the show, Mann said he's anxious to see how the trip is portrayed. There were some interesting experiences, he said, like when a teammate suffered a serious injury and when they discovered a crack in their canoe just before a big lake crossing and the most dangerous rapids on the journey. They dealt with storms, freezing temperatures and a lack of rations.
"And I went in the woods to use the bathroom one day and a big bear followed me out," said Mann, who's also a motivational speaker and SEAL team trainer. "We had to sleep with armed guards one night. There were grizzlies everywhere."
Mann said the experience, one he hopes to do again, bore some similarities to his SEAL missions that included covert operations and four years in South America helping with the fight against drugs.
"In the teamwork, the planning, figuring things out and pushing yourself and others," he said. "We just weren't carrying any guns and nobody was shooting at us."
The show debuts at 8 p.m. April 22 and runs eight weeks on the Outdoor Channel.

Texto completo: Watch: John Oliver discusses mobile homes
Warning: This video includes content some may find offensive
During Sunday's episode of “Last Week Tonight," host John Oliver dug into the mobile home industry, laying out the efforts of wealthy investors to extract profits from what he called “one of America's last affordable housing options."
Oliver introduced the segment by laying out the pervasive nature of mobile — or “manufactured" — homes. More than 20 million Americans live in manufactured housing, which is produced for about 50 percent of the price per square foot of traditional, site-built homes. Oliver's glad about that inexpensive standard, but warned his viewers about the rise of private investors in the industry.
“So the homes of some of the poorest people in America are getting snapped up by some of the richest people in America," Oliver noted. “And luckily, there've been no problems whatsoever.'
He paused.
“Except I'm obviously kidding. It's going terribly."
The comedian suggested that a rise in fees and rents associated with mobile homes is no coincidence, given the industry's influx of wealthy investors. He pointed to Clayton Homes, the country's most popular mobile home manufacturer, controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett. Clayton pitched its manufactured housing as no different from site-built homes in an advertising campaign featuring stars of the show “Duck Dynasty." But Oliver dismissed Clayton's celebrity endorsement, which doesn't point out the financial danger of owning a mobile home, which goes down in value, unlike a site-built home.
Big companies like Clayton, Oliver noted, benefit from that twice over, because not only do they sell homes that inevitably drop in value, they offer short-term loans with high interest rates to customers, trapping them in loans they can't afford.
Addtionally, Oliver explained, many residents are stuck paying for their home — via a loan — and paying rent to a company that owns land in mobile home parks. That, Oliver warned, is where things can get difficult for home owners.
Through the remainder of the segment, Oliver highlighted the business practices of a pair of other companies who deal with mobile homes.
He criticized the Carlyle Group for purchasing mobile home parks and immediately hiking prices on residents. The comedian also took aim at Frank Rolfe, whose company is one of the country's largest mobile home park operators. Rolfe offers a course called “Mobile Home University," which the New York Times called “a three-day course on how to strike it rich in the trailer-park business."
Rolfe's practices are “predatory," Oliver said.
The host ended his show with a note of caution and a fake infomercial for mobile homes starring “The Good Place" actress D'Arcy Carden.
“Buying a mobile home and renting the land underneath it can be financially catastrophic," he said. “It's important that anyone considering doing that knows the risks involved."

Texto completo: A former executive at the Rupert Murdoch-controlled News Corporation said Sunday he left the company in part because of a change in Fox News' tone.

"I noticed a significant change in tone. I'm a big believer in the marketplace of ideas, right? And I was fine working with and for people who had different values and opinions than I did. But I noticed a significant shift in the ferociousness, and frankly, the relationship with facts, you know, particularly on the Fox side," Joseph Azam, former senior vice president and group chief compliance officer at News Corp., said on CNN's "Reliable Sources."

Azam said the change took place around the time of the 2016 election when President Trump was elected to the White House.

"It became very profitable to fall in line with an anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim rhetoric and I was affected by that," he explained.

Azam joined News Corp. in 2015 and left in 2017. News Corp. is technically a separate entity from Fox News' parent company, but both have ties to Murdoch. Because he was on the legal side of the company, Azam said he "hadn't been exposed for a long time to a lot of what was going on on the opinion side."

"I was in the legal department, you know, I was working with people who were not a part of that world. But every day in the elevators, I would have to endure the coverage, right, of a lot of the opinion shows, and frankly and interact with the folks who are on on TV," Azam said. "We had small talk. I understood what they were doing as soon as they got off the elevator. But in those couple of seconds, you know, we were colleagues, or at least we shared space, so I was exposed to it every day."

Others at the company were similarly dissatisfied with the company's shift, he said.

"I'm comfortable saying I wasn't the only one that's troubled," by the "dehumanization taking place in some of the coverage and the opinion shows, by the 'other-ing' that was taking place, and frankly, what I viewed as a lack of decency," Azam said. "When people don't agree on facts, it's troubling for a lot of folks."

Azam said the New York Times' three-part story published this week on Murdoch's media empire "was a great report and it accurately described a lot of things that I heard and saw."

"It's a place I loved working. In addition to the big personalities in the top, my experience was that there were a lot of inherently smart, hard-working descent people there that are left to do the work. But by and large, I thought it was fascinating and pretty accurate," Azam said.

Texto completo: President Trump tore into special counsel Robert Mueller's team on Sunday, accusing the "angry Democrats" of "illegally leaking" information to the media.

Weeks after the Russia investigation came to a close, and amid a fight in Congress over the release of Mueller's roughly 400-page report, Trump reignited his war of words with the team behind what he has for years called a "witch hunt."

"Looks like Bob Mueller’s team of 13 Trump Haters & Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest Mainstream Media, they are a Joke!" Trump said.

Trump appeared to be reacting to reports last week in the New York Times and Washington Post in which anonymous sources said members of Mueller's team were frustrated with the way Attorney General William Barr portrayed the findings of their years-long investigation in a four-page summary.

Trump initially reacted to the Times report by accusing the outlet of not using "legitimate sources."

After the release of his summary, Barr said he expected a redacted version of Mueller’s report to be released in mid-April, "if not sooner." The attorney general also volunteered to testify publicly after Mueller’s report is released to the public and said he is available to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1 and the House Judiciary Committee on May 2.

But that hasn't been good enough for Democrats who are frustrated with Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's report that Trump and his allies claim provided him exoneration.

The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to subpoena Mueller’s full report, along with the underlying documents, and calls have been mounting among top congressional and political leaders to get the report out to the public quickly.

Adding fuel to their wrath were reports Wednesday evening cited officials saying some of the investigators involved in the 22-month inquiry are worried public perception of the investigation has been improperly shaped by Barr’s initial summary, a four-page memo to Congress in which he said Trump did not collude with Russia.

Obamacare is under threat, lives are at stake

Texto completo: White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said recently that he could guarantee Americans would not lose health coverage if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in a court challenge.
Apparently, MAGA means unaffordable health care By Frederick Isasi
At a time when one in four Americans are forgoing needed health care because they simply can't afford to see their doctor or buy their prescription drugs, the Trump administration is making the situation worse.
It is waging war on some of our country's most vulnerable people — children, the terminally ill, people with disabilities and the elderly — by urging the complete judicial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Such an action would leave millions of families without health care coverage, their health care costs would increase exponentially, and our nation would erase hard-won protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Is this what making America great again looks like? Having people choose between paying rent or buying critical medication that keeps them alive? Apparently, to the Trump administration, it does.
Beyond supporting judicial activism to repeal the ACA, President Donald Trump's administration has authorized multiple forms of junk insurance coverage that can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, deny essential health benefits like life-saving prescription drugs, refuse to cover catastrophic medical costs, and destabilize the consumer-protected market by luring young and healthy adults out of that market.
In sharp contrast to this, we see action from Congress to support meaningful coverage and financial security for our nation's families. For example, Democratic House chairs have introduced the Protecting Americans with Pre-existing Conditions Act, which repeals policies that permit the broad operation of the president's junk health insurance policies.
Let's be clear, people's lives and the future of our nation's families hang in the balance. Take, for example, the Eilers family in California. Nine-year-old Myka was born with an undiagnosed heart defect and, as a result, will forever be labeled as having a pre-existing condition. She spent the first few weeks of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit and had two open heart surgeries before her first birthday. At some point, she will require a heart valve replacement. Without the ACA and the protections it offers for individuals with pre-existing conditions, the Eilers worry that Myka will be unable to secure coverage for her heart, or that she will be subject to the return of lifetime caps.
We live in one of the wealthiest nations in the world. We spend twice as much on health care than other high-income nations on health care. The Eilers and all in our nation deserve the ability to receive the health care they need to live to their greatest potential. It is one of the most important measures of our society, and it's what making America great truly looks like.
Frederick Isasi is the executive director of Families USA. You can follow him on Twitter: @FrederickIsasi.
What others are saying Nicholas Bagley, The New York Times: "The Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over, that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress, and that it doesn't care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone. It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They'll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration's zealous commitment to taking away their health care."
Alexandra Petri, The Washington Post: "The GOP is the party of health care! The Justice Department is asking an appeals court to invalidate the entire ACA, but don't worry, the GOP is going to be 'the Party of Great HealthCare,' and it is going to replace what currently exists (a health care system) with something even better: the void; oblivion; the rush of wings of an enormous eagle departing, never to return!"
Robert Henneke and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, FoxNews.com: "First, President Donald Trump is recommitting our nation to health care freedom and to removing the constraints placed on market forces. Second, he is putting the force of the Department of Justice behind the very legitimate constitutional issue originally raised. ... Instead of letting fear and tepidity rule the day, we should embrace the opportunity to present a third way for health care in America, a way past the current broken regulated 'managed' care system — made worse by Obamacare — and the top-down, budget-busting 'Medicare for All.' "
What our readers are saying If Republicans have a great health care plan — better than what we have with the Affordable Care Act — why don't they present it in Congress? The answer is easy: They simply do not have a plan.
— Ed Wilts
Translation on Mick Mulvaney's guarantee that no one would lose their coverage even if the ACA were to be struck down: We're going to say whatever we need to say so we can repeal Obamacare and replace it with Trumpcare, which will be the exact same thing only with a different name that Republicans will unanimously love simply because it has Trump's name on it.
— Austin Williams
Mulvaney's point is probably that insurance will still be available, but you may no longer be able to afford it — and that is your problem.
— Joseph Breckenridge
Coverage is not really the issue. What is covered and the costs are the issue. We need an affordable national health insurance that guarantees care for all, just like some of the other high-income countries.
— Patricia Tally

Running away from presidential race

Texto completo: Today I am announcing that I have decided not to run for president in 2020. I am doing this, in part, to stand out from the crowd. But there are many other reasons, beginning with the fact that the country really doesn't need an old white guy in the Oval Office who has not previously been elected to anything.
In reaching this conclusion, I weighed several factors. I have no interest in conducting a listening tour through Iowa or New Hampshire; it's still pretty cold in those places this time of year. Also, I have determined that I don't have a single political adviser. Or a speechwriter. And my donor base is nonexistent.
Name recognition, too, would be a problem on the stump. I acknowledge that I'm not well known by voters outside my state - let alone in my immediate neighborhood. And though I have traveled widely, I confess never having set foot in Hawaii or South Dakota. That's seven electoral votes I probably couldn't count on.
Then there's the matter of the relentless media scrutiny that is inevitable in a national campaign. The failure to receive my college diploma until I paid a $5 parking ticket in 1969 was an oversight, a thoroughly innocent memory lapse. But some aggressive snoop from The Washington Post or The New York Times, bent on winning a Pulitzer Prize, no doubt would make a big deal of that.
My international agenda might be another drawback. I took a Russian history class in college. But it covered ancient Russian history, and I didn't exactly ace the course. Same with a "Power Politics" class. That was mostly about the 1930s and 40s. In 1991, I was in Cuba and saw Fidel Castro several times, but we never spoke. Besides, he's gone now. So I'd have to get up to speed on a lot of things.
Economic policy: I read the Ron Chernow biography of Alexander Hamilton, founder of the nation's financial system, before it inspired the smash Broadway musical, but I can't say I possess much fiscal savvy. What's a bitcoin, anyway?
Nevertheless, I believe I'm on the same page as many of my fellow Americans regarding several pressing matters. I think the NFL has to figure out a way to substantiate pass-interference calls when the Super Bowl is at stake. I advocate the Oscars' no-host format. I ascribe to no specific political ideology, though I do empathize with the semi-Libertarian tenet that you can do anything - but don't step on my blue suede shoes.
Bottom line, though: A campaign is just too daunting. Too exhausting. All those babies to kiss and selfies to pose for. All those "spontaneous" drop-ins at diners, interrupting folks just trying to eat their pancakes in peace. All those debates, mixing it up with a fair number of blowhards trying to one-up each other with tales of humble upbringings, pulling up bootstraps and walking miles to school in the snow.
And the good campaign slogans already have been used. Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too. He's the One. Happy Days Are Here Again. A Chicken in Every Pot and a Car in Every Garage. The People's Choice. Where's the Beef? I considered "He Means Well," but it sounds a bit wishy-washy.
It would be cool to go on "Meet the Press," though. And it would be fun to have, you know, a lawn sign with my name. But, no. I'll leave it to others.
Vice president? I'm not seeking it, I'm not requesting it. I don't expect it to happen.

Texto completo: There's a theory of human psychology that holds that the time you enter maturity becomes fixed in your mind as a civilizational peak -- with everything since a falling-off that conveniently matches your own stagger toward the grave. Thus it doesn't matter if you came of age in the Great Depression or some other nadir; because you were 18 then, it must have been a golden age.
Some of us are lucky, though: Our solipsism actually matches the wave function of history, and the moment we entered adulthood really was a peak. That's the case for my cohort, for Americans born around 1980. Whether you choose to call us "Xennials" or "Generation Catalano" (after the heartthrob on "My So-Called Life," our first teen show), the important thing is that we became legal adults at the end of the 1990s, and bliss it was in that time to be alive.
Not that we knew it then, of course, because no punk 18-year-old knows anything. But I've been thinking about how good we had it lately because we're 20 years out from 1999, and the cultural press is thick with reminders that it was a pop-culture annus mirabilis -- from the premiere of "The Sopranos" that defined a golden age of television, to the yearlong cascade of brilliant movies (The Ringer recently wrote up a top 100 films list for '99; in 2019 it was a struggle to write up a top 10) from a Hollywood not yet captive to the superhero era.
Widen the aperture a little, so that the "Xennial" cultural era covers 1995 to 2005, and you get everything from the perfection of the sitcom (late "Seinfeld," season one of "Friends," the silver age of "The Simpsons," "Arrested Development") to the peak of HBO (when "The Wire" and "The Sopranos" and "Deadwood" and "Sex and the City" were all airing). Oh, and those were also the days when George R.R. Martin could publish three "Game of Thrones" novels in five years, inventing all the good parts of the TV show's plot in an end-of-millennium rush.
De gustibus non est disputandum, and if you prefer a zillion algorithmically-generated Netflix shows and endless Marvel sequels to "The Matrix" and "The Sopranos," then God bless you. But cold hard economic data also suggest that ours was a uniquely blessed coming-of-age: a time of low unemployment, surging productivity, strong working-class wage growth -- and all without a huge overhang of public and private debt.
In March, a Time magazine writer, Charlotte Alter, attracted some conservative sneers on Twitter for explaining the youthful vogue for socialism by arguing that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's generation had a coming-of-age "defined by financial crisis, debt & climate change ... No wonder she and her peers are moving left."
The sneerers argued that the Ocasio-Cortezans exaggerate the burdens borne by twentysomethings, which is fair -- this is still a rich country whose young people are relatively privileged.
But as a statement about generational experiences, Alter was basically right. If you were born around 1980, you grew up in a space happily between -- between eras of existential threat (Cold War/War on Terror, or Cold War/climate change), between foreign policy debacles (Vietnam/Iraq), between epidemics (crack and AIDS/opioids and suicide), and between two different periods of economic stagnation (the '70s and early Aughts). If you were born later, you experienced slow growth followed by financial crisis followed by a recovery that's only lately returned us to the median-income and unemployment stats of ... 1999.
And even with under-4 percent unemployment, the differences between our economy and 1999's are notable: Our current expansion features lower work force participation rates and weaker productivity growth, a fertility collapse instead of the modest 1990s baby boom ... plus it's all floated by deficits that seem necessary but aren't a sign of deep economic health.
But perhaps the best way to understand the lost world of 20 years ago is that it was the just-enough-internet era. There was just enough internet to boost economic productivity (the Facebook-Amazon era has not had a similar effect), just enough to encourage subcultural ferment, just enough to challenge cultural gatekeepers and give lonely teenagers succor. It was the early blogosphere instead of Twitter mobs, serendipity instead of ruthless curation, geek culture as an insurgency rather than a corporate establishment, online as an escape for eccentrics rather than an addictive dystopia for everyone.
Still, we should have seen the bad days coming. The filmmakers of 1999 did, as Reason magazine's Jesse Walker noted when The Ringer's top-100 list came out. "Election," "The Matrix," "Fight Club," "The Blair Witch Project," "Office Space," "The Talented Mr. Ripley," even (God help us) "The Phantom Menace" ... it's all there, everything that followed, class anxiety and workplace alienation, end-of-history discontents and internet-fueled hoaxes, disputed elections and virtual-reality prisons, plus a tottering republic waiting for its Palpatine.
We should have listened. Instead, we took that stupid red pill from "The Matrix," and now we'll never find our way back up.

Texto completo: Matt Mooney is living his dream playing in a Final Four, but he wouldn't be in this position if the NCAA had already passed a rule it will be considering later this month.
The proposed change to the graduate-transfer rule would put colleges on the hook for a two-year scholarship commitment, instead of just one season. The program would be docked a scholarship the next year if the grad transfer does not earn his secondary degree within a year.
"I'm not going to finish mine in a year," said Mooney, a Texas Tech senior guard. "I don't know how many graduate degrees you can finish in a year."
If the rule passes, programs would not be able to fit a grad transfer into their plans as easily as so many do now.
Grad transfers can be gold in recruiting. They don't have to sit out a year like typical transfers, and they avoid the headache of going through the NCAA's waiver process. Grad transfers can immediately impact a team, with their experience and opportunity to provide leadership.
Two of the most notable grad transfers in the country for the 2018-19 season were Minneapolis natives and former DeLaSalle standouts Geno Crandall (North Dakota) and Reid Travis (Stanford), who fell just short of their goal to play for a national title in their hometown with Gonzaga and Kentucky, respectively.
Texas Tech's run to the Final Four was aided by grad transfers Mooney from South Dakota and Tariq Owens from St. John's.
Mooney, who is getting his master's in interdisciplinary studies, said Owens, like him, won't be finishing up his grad program this year, but they will only use up a scholarship for one year under current NCAA rules. That could change in the near future.
The Division I council will vote on a proposal this month that would mandate grad transfers take up scholarships for two years or until they complete their master's degree at the new school, according to the New York Times.
"Hopefully they can figure something out," Mooney said, "because I do think the grad-transfer rule is beneficial for teams and players. It does hurt some midmajor teams that lose some guys, but I think it helps a lot more than it hurts."
NCAA President Mark Emmert said at his Final Four news conference Thursday he wouldn't be surprised if the graduate-transfer rule is revised.
"There's been a lot of debate and discussion about whether there should be modifications of that rule," Emmert said.
The proposal could become a rule as soon as Aug. 1. Besides men's basketball, it would also cover football and women's basketball.

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Hiring boycott called against Sanders, Miller, Nielsen, other Trump immigration aides

Texto completo: Fortune 500 firms are being urged to rip up the resumes of Trump immigration aides linked to policies that led to the separation of illegal immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“Many of you spoke out against this barbaric policy. However strong the opposition, your words are meaningless unless they are backed up with resolute action,” said a letter from a group called Restore Public Trust promoting its Trump Administration Separation campaign.

“We call on you to make it clear that you will not hire for employment, contract for consulting, or seat on your boards, anyone involved in the development or implementation of the Trump administration’s family separation immigration policy,” added the letter signed by several other liberal groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center, Moms Rising, American Bridge, and Allied Progress.

The group names several officials including White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, chief immigration aide Stephen Miller, and Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The letter shown below also mentions former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his former spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, now at CNN.

The groups are making their case in a letter to CEOs and in a New York Times ad set to publish Sunday and shown above.

It also wants a hiring boycott on Trump immigration aides in lobbying shops and any think tank or political action committee companies work with.

The separation of children was controversial, and targeted parents for arrest and deportation who had criminal records. It had been part of immigration policy for years, though the administration stepped it up in hopes it would scare families from trying to enter the U.S. After a wave of negative stories and comments, the administration ended it.

Still, the groups want those who have worked on immigration policy punished.

“There are some lines that simply cannot be crossed,” said the CEO letter.

“It’s been one year since the Trump administration announced their ‘zero tolerance’ immigration policy and ripped innocent children from the arms of their families seeking refuge at our border,” said Karl Frisch, spokesperson for Restore Public Trust. “Unfortunately, this shameful episode in our nation’s history still hasn’t ended. And while the American people are still demanding answers about this heinous policy, many of the individuals involved in crafting, implementing, and defending it have yet to be held accountable. Some of these individuals have already left the administration, others will in the future. Regardless of when they leave, they shouldn’t be allowed to seek refuge in America’s boardrooms or corner offices.”

Texto completo: Eight women have gone public in the last week with stories of unwanted contact from former Vice President Joe Biden in recent days.

Biden, who is expected to announce a 2020 presidential bid soon, said in a video posted on Twitter Thursday that he will be more mindful of personal space in the future, though he did not directly apologize to the women.

Friday in Washington, during his first public appearance since the wave of allegations, he said he felt bad if he made anyone uncomfortable, but he still wasn't apologizing. "I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman," Biden said.

Here are the women who have spoken out against Biden so far.

1. Lucy Flores, the 2014 Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada, was the first to come forward with a story of unwanted contact from Biden.

She wrote in a post on the Cut that Biden attended a campaign rally in support of her candidacy in 2014. Just before her speech, she said Biden came up to her from behind, smelled her hair, and planted a kiss on the back of her head.

2. Amy Lappos , a Connecticut resident, said Biden inappropriately rubbed noses with her in 2009 at a fundraiser for Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.

"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head," Lappos, 43, told the Hartford Courant Monday. "He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth."

Lappos was the first who wrote about her experience in a Facebook post.

3. D.J. Hill, a writer, said that at a 2012 fundraising event in Minneapolis that Biden put his hand on her shoulder and slowly dropped it down her back in a way that made her “very uncomfortable.”

“Only he knows his intent,” Hill, 59, told the New York Times in a story published Tuesday. “If something makes you feel uncomfortable, you have to feel able to say it.”

4. Caitlyn Caruso said when she was 19, Biden rested his hand on her thigh and hugged her “just a little bit too long” when she met him at event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The incident with Biden came just after she talked about her own sexual assault at the event. “It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she said.

Caruso, now 22, told the New York Times. “These are supposed to be people you can trust.”

5. Vail Kohnert-Yount said that when she was a White House intern in spring 2013, Biden introduced himself to her as he was passing by in the White House basement.

“He then put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me. I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ‘pretty girl,’” Kohnert-Yount told the Washington Post.

Kohnert-Yount said that she does not consider the incident sexual assault, but rather, an issue of equal respect for women in the workplace.

6. Sofie Karasek was pictured with her forehead pressed to Biden’s at the 2016 Oscars. She was part of a group of sexual assault victims who appeared onstage with Lady GaGa.

Karasek, then 22, told Biden about a story of a sexual assault victim who had recently died by suicide. Biden then held her hands and put his forehead to hers.

She told the Washington Post that Biden’s response felt awkward and uncomfortable and that she did not know how to respond.

“He emphasized that he wants to connect with people and, of course, that’s important. But again, all of our interactions and friendships are a two-way street ... Too often it doesn’t matter how the woman feels about it, or they just assume that they’re fine with it,” Karasek said.

7. Ally Coll said Biden squeezed her shoulders, complimented her smile and held her for “a beat too long” when she met him at reception she helped run in 2008.

Coll now runs the Purple Campaign, a nonprofit group that fights sexual harassment in the workplace. She said at the time she felt excited about meeting Biden, she now thinks his behavior was out of place.

“There’s been a lack of understanding about the way that power can turn something that might seem innocuous into something that can make somebody feel uncomfortable,” Coll told the Washington Post.

8. Alexandra Tara Reade, a Nevada resident, said that when she worked in Biden’s Delaware Senate office in 1993, he touched her several times in ways that made her uncomfortable. She was in her mid-20s at the time.

“He used to put his hand on my shoulder and run his finger up my neck,” Reade told The Union. “I would just kind of freeze and wait for him to stop doing that.”

Biden cracked a joke Friday about unwanted contact.

"I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie," Biden said, referring to Lonnie Stephenson, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, who introduced Biden.

He later told reporters that he "wouldn't be surprised" if more women came forward.

¿Fiscal general “ocultó información” del reporte Mueller que afecta a Trump?

Texto completo: Algunos de los investigadores del fiscal especoal Robert Mueller han advertido que los hallazgos de su investigación son mucho más perjudiciales para el presidente Donald Trump de lo que se ha dado a conocer.
Hasta el momento, el fiscal general William Barr sólo ha dado a conocer un resumen de tres páginas y media donde señala que no indagará al mandatario sobre posible “obstrucción de la justicia”, dado que el reporte de Mueller no halló pruebas concluyentes al respecto, aunque no lo exonera.
El New York Times cita a funcionarios del gobierno y otros personajes familiarizados con el caso, quienes creen que Barr debería haber incluido más del reporte integral sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
A pesar de la alerta, no hay detalles sobre qué información sería “más perjudicial” para el presidente Trump.
El procurador general se comprometió a publicar el informe de casi 400 páginas a mediados de abril, con ciertas partes bloqueadas, como la protección de la información secreta del gran jurado y las fuentes y métodos de recopilación de información.
El presidente Trump reaccionó a la revelación del Times al afirmar que el periódico no tiene “fuentes legítimas”, incluso consideró que quizá el diario “¡no tenga realmente fuentes!” , acusando que su reportaje es “falso”.
The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The Justice Department defended its handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's report as Capitol Hill Democrats ratcheted up pressure to obtain the entire document by threatening to issue a subpoena in the coming days if their demands aren't met.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that every page of Mr. Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump was labeled with a warning that it may contain grand jury material, which by law is confidential and cannot be released without the approval of a judge. As a result, no part could be released without extensive review and possible redactions, the department said.
"The department continues to work with the special counsel on appropriate redactions to the report so that it can be released to Congress and the public," said Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman. The full document, with redactions, is expected to be released by mid-April, Attorney General William Barr has previously said.
The Justice Department is under extraordinary pressure from Congress and the public for a fuller accounting of what Mr. Mueller found during his 22-month probe. So far, Mr. Barr has only released a four-page letter in which he summarized Mr. Mueller's conclusions. Mr. Barr has said the letter wasn't meant to be a summary of what Mr. Mueller found, only what his conclusions were.
Most Americans believe the full Mueller report should be released. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in February found that two-thirds of those surveyed wanted the full report released, and more recent polls also show majorities with the same view.
On Capitol Hill, congressional leaders are threatening a subpoena if they don't receive a full unredacted document—a dramatic escalation of the fight between Congress and the executive branch that could well end up being decided by a federal court.

Mr. Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, their top advisers and a member of Mr. Mueller's team are reviewing the report for grand jury material, classified information and other information to protect the privacy of individuals not charged with a crime. It wasn't clear how involved Mr. Barr was in the intricacies of the process, as he has been preparing this week for his appearance Tuesday before the House Appropriations Committee.
Some investigators on Mr. Mueller's team have told associates in recent days that they believe the report is more critical of President Trump on the issue of whether he obstructed justice than Mr. Barr indicated in his summary, according to people informed of those conversations.
The Justice Department's statement came in reaction to news reports late Wednesday of such complaints about how Mr. Barr handled the summary, which he released to Congress two days after he received the document from Mr. Mueller. The New York Times first reported about those complaints.
Mr. Barr wrote in the summary that Mr. Mueller hadn't made a "traditional prosecutorial decision" on whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, saying that the report neither finds the president committed a crime nor exonerates him. Mr. Barr said he and Mr. Rosenstein then decided that Mr. Trump's actions didn't meet the bar of a crime. It didn't appear that Mr. Mueller himself had spoken to anyone about concerns regarding Mr. Barr's summary or process for redacting the nearly 400-page report, one person familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Mueller's investigation didn't establish that Mr. Trump or his 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in its interference in the U.S. election, which was the other question central to the special counsel's probe. Mr. Trump and his allies have seized on the summary to say the Mueller report exonerates the president of any wrongdoing.
A House committee this week threatened to subpoena the full report , authorizing Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) to issue a subpoena for it. Mr. Nadler hasn't said when he may seek to issue the subpoena.
"We are going to issue a subpoena in very short order if we don't get the cooperation we want," Mr. Nadler told reporters on Thursday. "It's important later in terms of enforcing subpoenas that we show we have made a good-faith effort to work with the department to get what we want."
After reading reports that some people on Mr. Mueller's team were critical of Mr. Barr's initial summary, Mr. Nadler asked Mr. Barr in a letter to produce all communications between the special counsel's office and the Justice Department regarding Mr. Mueller's report. He said his request included communications about the disclosure of the report to Congress, to the public and regarding Mr. Barr's summary sent to Congress.
Mr. Nadler also urged Mr. Barr to release as soon as possible any summaries that may have been prepared by Mr. Mueller as part of the report. The special counsel's office submitted several summaries of the report to Mr. Barr, a Justice Department official said, all of which contained grand jury material that wouldn't be releasable to the public.
The fight over access to the report is complicated by Mr. Mueller's use of a grand jury in writing the report. By law, grand jury material cannot be released without the permission of a judge—typically the judge who oversees the grand jury. But the question could also be considered as part of any litigation Congress undertakes to enforce its subpoena and thus could land before another federal judge.
In previous investigations involving presidential misconduct, prosecutors sought and received permission from a judge to unseal grand jury evidence and present it either to Congress for impeachment considerations, or to the public in the interests of transparency.
If Mr. Barr doesn't comply with a congressional subpoena, the issue could head to court where there is scant precedent about what kinds of material Congress is entitled to and under what circumstances.
Judges in two notable cases in recent decades involving congressional-executive showdowns have been sympathetic to congressional demands for information, though none involved grand jury material.
In 2007, House Democrats went to court to force former White House counsel Harriet Miers to testify about her role in a scandal involving the firing of U.S. attorneys. A judge rejected her claims of executive privilege and she was forced to testify two years later.
In 2012, a Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt and filed a civil lawsuit to force him to release documents about a gunrunning scandal called Fast and Furious. The Justice Department eventually settled with the committee, but some legal wrangling in the case continues.

Orlando commissioner pushes for sign language interpreters at council meetings

Texto completo: As important decisions are made in local governments across the state, advocates for the deaf and hard of hearing say their participation is difficult.
That's because city and county government bodies often don't have interpreters at meetings, and the state doesn't require interpreters to be licensed or registered with a national organization.
In Orlando, Commissioner Tony Ortiz is pushing for the city to move toward being more inclusive to those who can't hear by providing more resources, including interpreters at City Council meetings.
"It saddens me that people cannot participate in City Council or other activities because they know that they won't have somebody to translate for them," Ortiz said this week. "City Council should have somebody translating, not only for the person that may be there [in person] but for the person that's watching on TV. Because they're human beings and they want to know what's going on in our community."
The twice-monthly Orlando council meetings are aired on Orange TV, the county's government-access channel, and on the city's YouTube account. Ortiz said deaf taxpayers may be discouraged from watching at all, knowing they won't be able to easily follow along.
"We need to allocate a budget to address this issue," Ortiz said. "To me, this is a right they have and we should be addressing that."
At the city's Engelwood Neighborhood Center, six-week American Sign Language courses reached their halfway point this week. About 60 people enrolled, though only about half of those were in attendance Monday.
The class is run by Silent Hope, a nonprofit organization started by Marilu Santos after she feared she wouldn't be able to communicate with her non-verbal son.
The course is designed to teach students the basics of ASL, including family signs and the basics of communication. Some work in places with deaf and hard-of-hearing customers, she said, while others want to communicate with family members or are losing their hearing and want to learn to sign.
Santos said she's disappointed when she goes to official events and doesn't see an interpreter.
"I don't think that's equal access," Santos said. "I don't think that's fair and just and I think that they're a forgotten population."
Lisa Rose, president of the Florida Association for the Deaf, which advocates for 3.1 million deaf, blind and hard-of-hearing people across the state, said the civil rights organization has tried to lobby the Legislature to require qualified interpreters, though action has never been taken.
At the local level, she said she's heard stories of numerous deaf and hard-of-hearing people requesting interpreters, only to be rejected.
"For local governments, I would say it's not accessible yet at all," Rose said through an interpreter. "If a deaf person is asking for an interpreter, they should provide that."
Orlando spokeswoman Karyn Barber said the city uses interpreters for speeches, such as the annual State of Downtown and State of the City. Ortiz recalls sign-language interpreters being present at city media briefings prior to hurricanes at the emergency operations center.
Orange County officials, meanwhile, had an interpreter on hand last week at its regional economic summit.
Florida doesn't require licenses for interpreters, according to the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, a national organization that creates standards and ethics for ASL interpreters.
In recent years, controversy arose over the qualifications of interpreters at press conferences in Tampa and Manatee County.
In Tampa, as police announced the arrest of a serial killer in 2017, an interpreter standing near city officials wasn't able to be understood, alarming ASL teachers and the deaf community, the Tampa Bay Times reported.
In Manatee County, as officials warned of a mandatory evacuation as Hurricane Irma approached the state a man standing next to officials signed "pizza" and "bear monster," according to the New York Times.
"There are interpreters on the news that have no business being there," said Santos, calling it a public-safety issue. "They're not skilled or qualified."
If Ortiz is successful, Rose said the city would be a leader in providing access to the deaf.
"If they did that, the deaf community would respond very positively," Rose said.
After first raising his concerns up at a meeting last week, Ortiz said he'll continue pursuing it.
"I'm going to keep bringing it up," he said.

Elon Musk’s compensation at least 40,000 times more than median Tesla worker

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Texto completo: Two more women claim that former Vice President Joe Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable.
Caitlyn Caruso told The New York Times that Biden kept his hand on her thigh and hugged her "just a little bit too long" at a University of Nevada event about sexual assault when she was 19.
"It doesn't even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that," she told the newspaper. "These are supposed to be people you can trust."
The second woman, 59-year-old D.J. Hill, claims that Biden moved his hand from her shoulder to lower down her back while taking a photo at a fund-raiser in Minneapolis in 2012.
"Only he knows his intent," she told the Times, saying it made her "very uncomfortable."
Hill said that her husband noticed Biden's dropping hand and put his own on the politician's shoulder to disrupt him.

Texto completo: An intellectual rock star, Nicholas Christakis has taught at the University of Chicago, Harvard and, since 2013, Yale. He has done trailblazing work on how our social networks shape us. All of the most esteemed academies that validate scholars' brilliance have validated his. In 2009, Time magazine put him on its list of 100 most influential people.
But to many Americans, he is best known not for what he has accomplished but for what he absorbed: taunts and insults from furious Yale students who swarmed him in a campus courtyard one day. "You should not sleep at night!" one of them screeched, as he miraculously kept his cool, a mute punching bag. "You are disgusting!"
Perhaps you saw the video. It became a viral sensation in the fall of 2015, Exhibit A in the tension, on so many campuses, between free expression and many minority students' pleas for an atmosphere in which they feel fully respected and safe.
Mr. Christakis's wife, Erika, who also taught at Yale back then, had circulated a memo in which she questioned a university edict against culturally insensitive Halloween costumes, suggesting that students could police themselves and should have both the freedom to err and the strength to cope with offense. She wrote that her husband concurred.
And all hell broke loose. Hundreds of students signed an open letter denouncing her and hundreds demanded that the couple be punished. There were protests. And when, in that courtyard, Mr. Christakis apologized for any pain that the memo had caused but refused to disavow its content, he was pilloried.
So imagine my surprise when an advance copy of his new book, to be published next week, arrived. Titled "Blueprint," it's no lament for the mess that we humans make of things. It's an argument that we're transcendently and inherently good - that we're genetically wired for it, thanks to a process of natural selection that has favored people prone to constructive friendships, to cooperation, to teaching, to love.
"For too long," he writes in the preface, "the scientific community has been overly focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for tribalism, violence, selfishness and cruelty. The bright side has been denied the attention it deserves."
The bright side? From a man who had students refuse to shake his hand at graduation; who lost friends among Yale's faculty; and whose wife, a respected expert in child development, was so thoroughly ostracized that she had to leave the university?
I had to hear more from him. And I did, in emails, on the phone and over lunch last month.
"I do not want to be defined by that event, either personally or professionally, which is why I only very rarely discuss it in public," Mr. Christakis, 56, said. "While it was in the top 10 worst things to happen in my life, there are other competitors for that honor."
He told me that few people realize that he listened to those students for more than two hours, and that they hadn't intercepted and surprised him: He went out to meet them, knowing how angry they were. "I felt that I had to model the principles that I believed - which is that I am committed to free and open expression," he said. "I hardly could cower in my house."
Although he stayed calm - which he attributes to years of training in karate and its premium on self-control - he was rattled, deeply, by the encounter. He soon took his first sabbatical. He read books about equanimity in the face of injustice. "I did not want to become a different person," he said. "I certainly did not want to become embittered."
His work on "Blueprint" was already long underway, and he lost himself in it, devoting "my heart and soul and all my learning." It shows. The book is a hefty, dazzlingly erudite synthesis of history, philosophy, anthropology, genetics, sociology, economics, epidemiology, statistics and more. It uses everything from shipwrecks to the primatologist Jane Goodall to make its pro-kindness case, and it inadvertently shames you into realizing that while most of us, standing at the buffet of knowledge, content ourselves with a pork chop and rice pudding, Mr. Christakis pillages the carving station and the omelet station and the soup array and the make-your-own-sundae bar.
"Blueprint" and its theory about the evolutionary origins of virtue became his balm. That's clear in the book itself, which makes unmistakable allusions to the Yale ugliness. "I have seen the effects of overidentifying with one's group and witnessed mass delusions up close," he writes. He rues America's intense polarization, which perhaps makes this "an odd time for me to advance the view that there is more that unites us than divides us." But advance that view he does.
His reasoning, oversimplified, is this: Complex societies are possible and durable only when people are emotionally invested in, and help, one another; we'd be living in smaller units and more solitary fashions if we weren't equipped for such collaboration; and human thriving within these societies guarantees future generations suited to them.
Yes, there are hideous wars and horrid leaders. But if that were the sum of us, how to explain all the peace and progress? Mr. Christakis urges a wide angle and the long view.
"To accept this belief that human beings are evil or violent or selfish or overly tribal is a kind of moral and intellectual laziness," he told me. It also excuses that destructiveness. "The way to repair our torn social fabric is to say: Wait a minute, that's not quite right."
I asked him if the book's dedication ("The world is better the closer you are to Erika.") was especially important to him given what had happened at Yale. His eyes filled with tears. He said he was telling the world: "You guys have no idea who she is. You have no idea what an extraordinary person she is - just astonishing, full of grace and goodness."
Last summer, long after the din died down, Yale awarded him the Sterling Professorship, the school's highest faculty honor, held by no more than 40 scholars at once. Maybe "Blueprint" is right. We find our way to decency, but in a jagged line.

Texto completo: Capt. Jonathan Bratten, historian for the National Guard, will give "A History of Camp Keyes"
National Guard historian to present ‘A History of Camp Keyes’ Tuesday
The Sidney Historical Society’s April public presentation “A History of Camp Keyes” will begin at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the Sidney Grange on Middle Road in Sidney.
For more than 100 years, Camp Keyes has been known as the headquarters of the Maine National Guard in Augusta. But how did that site on the hill come to be chosen? Who is it named for? Who trained there and why?
Capt. Jonathan Bratten, historian for the National Guard, will answer those questions and describes the role that Camp Keyes has played in five different conflicts for generations of Maine soldiers and airmen, according to a news release from the historical society.
In this capacity, Bratten has produced multiple articles on the history of Maine’s soldiers, appearing in such publications as The New York Times, The Washington Post, Army History, On Point and Army Magazine.
He has also appeared in a Smithsonian channel documentary, “Americans Underground: Secret Cities of WWI” and served as a historian in France for the Army’s World War I centennial commemorations.
Bratten is the commander of 251 Engineer Co. and a veteran of the Afghanistan war. He and his wife live in Portland.
To ask questions or get more information, call 242-6913.

Chicago mayoral election will make history

Texto completo: The Chicago mayoral election in February was the most crowded in city history, with 14 candidates on the ballot, including respected local government leaders, a charismatic entrepreneur who routinely hands out $100 bills to strangers and even a candidate named Daley, whose brother and father were mayors before him.
They were all beaten by two women, Lori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle, who are now headed for a runoff Tuesday in a history-making race.
Chicago will be the largest U.S. city to ever elect an African-American woman as its mayor. It previously had two Black men in the office, Harold Washington and Eugene Sawyer, and one woman, Jane Byrne.
Preckwinkle, 72, is the head of the Cook County Democratic Party and the president of the Cook County Board. She's a seasoned politician who made her name decades ago as one of Chicago's most progressive Democrats.
Lightfoot, 56, is more of an unknown. She's a lawyer and former federal prosecutor who was president of the Chicago Police Board, which in 2016 produced a report accusing the police department of systemic racism.
The mayoral hopefuls are not far apart ideologically. So for many voters who encountered the candidates as they slogged through campaign events during a chilly spring, the choice will come down to whether they want a familiar face touting her vast experience, or someone who has never held elected office before, promising a new order in Chicago.

Sacklers Dispute Claims They Directed Alleged Illegal Marketing of OxyContin; Family members argue that they were fulfilling their ordinary duties as board members of Purdue Pharma

Texto completo: Members of Purdue Pharma LP's controlling Sackler family are disputing allegations brought by the Massachusetts attorney general that they personally directed illegal marketing of prescription opioids, arguing that the family members were simply fulfilling their ordinary duties as board members.
Eight Sackler family members and five other current and former board members on Monday submitted motions to dismiss the Massachusetts lawsuit, arguing that the board "did exactly what one would expect of directors of a company: They received management reports on Purdue's nationwide activities, posed questions to management, and participated in routine board votes" concerning staffing changes and budgets.
The lawsuit, they say, "fails to specify how any individual director, much less all of them, personally engaged in unlawful promotion of prescription opioids or instructed anyone else to do so."
The Massachusetts lawsuit is one of more than 1,600 actions filed against Purdue Pharma by cities, counties and states seeking to recoup the costs of an opioid epidemic they say the company helped spark. An amended complaint in the Massachusetts case filed in January garnered national attention because it included sweeping allegations that the Sackler family personally directed marketing of Purdue's signature drug, OxyContin, even as reports of abuse came to light.
The Sackler family and other board members argue the lawsuit should be thrown out because it fails to state a legal claim against the individuals and because they don't have enough ties to Massachusetts to be sued in that state.

A spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said the motions to dismiss "are an attempt to avoid accountability" and that the state "makes clear the role that Purdue's executives and directors played in creating and profiting from the opioid crisis."
The Sacklers disputing the claims are descendants from two of the three brothers who bought Stamford, Conn.-based Purdue's predecessor company in 1952. They include Richard Sackler, a former Purdue executive and longtime board member, his son David Sackler and brother Jonathan Sackler, as well as his cousins Kathe and Mortimer D.A. Sackler. As of earlier this year, no Sacklers remained on the company's board.
Massachusetts' allegations of illegal marketing begin in 2007, the year Purdue pleaded guilty to federal charges of misleading the public about the addictive risks of OxyContin and agreed to have its compliance program monitored for several years. The motions to dismiss argue that board members were consistently told by the company that it was adhering to the terms of its corporate integrity agreement and that when problems did occur, they were quickly resolved.
The Monday motions also dispute the description of an initiative code-named "Project Tango," which the Massachusetts complaint called a secret plan to expand into the business of selling opioid-addiction treatment drugs. The state suggests that Purdue saw an opportunity to make money from the millions of people addicted to opioids, including OxyContin, and become an "end-to-end pain provider."
In their filings, the board members don't dispute that the company explored deals involving opioid-addiction treatment but say there was nothing unlawful about it.
"Project Tango," they say, was a recommendation by a private-equity firm to acquire the manufacturer of a medication-assisted treatment. The motion notes that the acquisition didn't happen and disputes the characterization that Kathe Sackler played a key role in pitching it, saying she actually opposed the idea.
Purdue also considered a deal involving Braeburn Inc., a Plymouth Meeting, Penn.-based company that had developed an opioid-addiction treatment, the board members said in the filings. A Braeburn spokeswoman said she can't comment on confidential interactions with other companies.
The board members also argue that emails cited in the complaint have been taken out of context, including one sent by Richard Sackler in which the lawsuit says he responded "This is not too bad. It could have been far worse," to a report that 59 people died from OxyContin in one state. In reality, the board members say in their filing, he was responding to a lengthy New York Times article that included that statistic.
Purdue separately submitted a motion to dismiss the Massachusetts complaint in March, arguing the company neither created nor caused the opioid epidemic in the state and that the lawsuit is "oversimplified scapegoating."

Texto completo: When thriller author Joel C. Rosenberg was invited into an impromptu Oval Office visit, he offered up a surefire way for President Trump to have fun with the Russia collusion story, dismissed in a new report to Justice.

The author, on a tour promoting his latest New York Times best-seller "The Persian Gamble," told the president about his prior book "The Kremlin Conspiracy," assuring Trump that it had nothing to do with him.

“I suggested that next time he walked out to Marine One, he should carry the book with him,” said Rosenberg. “He could hold it up for reporters and photographers and point to the title and say, ‘It’s fiction people, it’s fiction.'” …
• Conservative radio host and columnist Hugh Hewitt has been picked to head the Richard Nixon Foundation. He has strong ties to the ex-prez — he was hired by Nixon as a researcher from Harvard University 40 years ago to help with the building and opening the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif. …
• When any secretary of state appears before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to pitch their budget, it’s usually standing room only with all members lining up to praise or criticize the nation’s top diplomat. This week’s appearance by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened to be explosive, since he had ripped Democratic member Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Israel comments. But she didn’t show up. ...
• He’s new to Congress and a Republican from Wisconsin, so it was a natural for Rep. Bryan Steil to be featured on Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy’s latest insider podcast called Plaidcast. In Duffy’s “buzz saw” section, he asked Steil which Democrat he likes most. “ John Lewis is a pretty amazing guy,” he said of the Georgia civil rights leader and lawmaker. “When you talk to him about his personal story, what he saw, that’s really a generation before you and I, what an amazing, amazing individual. We’re all blessed that he’s there.” …

Texto completo: Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is the leading Democrat demanding the release of the Mueller Report “in its entirety” without redactions.

His committee is planning to subpoena the Justice Department for the full report.

But back in 1998, as a member of the same committee, he vociferously opposed the release of the full Starr Report, saying that “as a matter of decency and protecting people’s privacy rights, people who may be totally innocent third parties, what must not be released at all.”

Then, the president was Bill Clinton. Now, it is a Republican, Donald Trump.

Ken Starr, the independent counsel investigating then-President Bill Clinton, delivered his report to Congress on Sept. 9, 1998. That night, Nadler went on Charlie Rose's show to push back against the Republican demand that the voluminous report should be made public. “It’s grand jury material. It represents statements which may or may not be true by various witnesses," Nadler said. "Salacious material. All kinds of material that it would be unfair to release,”

What Nadler, 71, said in 1998 echoes what Attorney General William Barr told Congress last week. Barr, 68, wrote that he might redact grand jury testimony, information related to ongoing investigations, sensitive or classified information, and “information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties” from the report that he provides to Congress and the public.

In a New York Times op-ed Monday, Nadler wrote: “We — the members of the Judiciary Committee, the House of Representatives, and the entire American public — are still waiting to see that report… We have an obligation to read the full report, and the Department of Justice has an obligation to provide it, in its entirely, without delay.”

Twenty-one years ago, Nadler said that the Starr Report was inherently biased against Clinton: “'We should always remember this is a prosecutor's report — by its nature it's a one-sided report.” He complained about Clinton not being allowed to get a sneak peak at the Starr Report before it was made public: “The President is asking for two days. The Republicans say no.”

In October 1998, Nadler attacked the legitimacy of the independent counsel investigation: “Starr thinks he is going to be investigating things in four years … I find that astonishing and appalling. Is this a permanent inquisition against the president?” The language Nadler used was reminiscent of the “witch hunt” language used by Trump in reference to Mueller’s investigation.

In a February 1999 article in the New York Times, Nadler called the Starr Report and impeachment efforts by Republicans a “partisan coup d'etat.” He said he didn’t think Clinton had obstructed justice and that even if he had, it would not be an impeachable offense. “An impeachable offense is an abuse of Presidential power designed to or with the effect of undermining the structure or function of government, or undermining constitutional liberties,” Nadler said.

Last month, before Mueller had finished his investigation, Nadler was already claiming that “it’s very clear that the president obstructed justice.” He said impeachment was a possibility: "We have to do the investigations and get all this … We do not now have the evidence all sorted out to do an impeachment … Before you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen.”

Special counsel Mueller declined to charge anyone associated with the Trump campaign of coordination with the Russians, but did not reach a decision on obstruction. Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Trump had not obstructed justice.

Colorado author Peter Heller tapped personal life in new novel 'The River'

Texto completo: Everything hinges on that first sentence for novelist Peter Heller.
Then Heller unfurls his story, focused more on the poetic language for which he’s praised than on the plot’s ins and outs, which come to him from the ether.
“That’s the great thing about fiction,” said the Denver resident. “Stuff just flutters down on your laptop.”
That’s how he wrote his much-acclaimed 2012 post-apocalyptic novel, “The Dog Stars,” and that’s how he’s written his most recent outdoors thriller, “The River.” The New York Times called it a “modern day survival tale” and named it one of a dozen new books to watch for in March.
“They had been smelling smoke for two days,” reads the first line of his prologue.
“That’s what I wrote first — the beginning,” Heller said. “I came up with the poetry. I’m interested in the music of language. The story rides the back of the language. It’s the reverse of what other people do.”
“They” are Jack and Wynn, best buddies in college who decide to canoe the Maskwa River in Northern Canada, a trip based on Heller and his wife’s fourth date running the Winisk River in northern Ontario. What the men envision as a low-key adventure and escape from modern distractions turns into a fight for their lives as they wade into a domestic disturbance and a forest fire rages before them.
“(A) poetic and unnerving wilderness thriller. … Full of rushing life and profound consequences. Every move Jack and Wynn make along the river has the chance to kill them or those they’re trying to save, and the result is a novel that sweeps you away, each page filled with wonder and awe for a natural world we can quantify with science but can rarely predict with emotion,” critic Tod Goldberg wrote in USA Today.
As Heller fleshed out his main characters, they became more familiar to him. Then he realized he was Jack, and Wynn was his longtime friend, the artist Jay Mead, whom Heller met at freshman orientation in college, where they talked books, the environment and expeditions into the wild.
“I try to not think about it. I follow the voice,” said Heller. “I train myself to immerse the readers as quickly as possible. I use a lot of sense detail. You always hear, ‘Show, don’t tell.’ But in some ways, if you let the reader smell the country and feel the warmth of the sun and hear the splash of the stick bobbing in the current, those details help a reader get fully immersed. They don’t want to be anywhere else.”
His fictional characters aren’t identical to their real-life counterparts. Heller isn’t a ranch kid, nor is he as tough as Jack. But there are glaring similarities, such as Wynn’s habit of creating ephemeral art out of sticks and feathers he collects as they camp beside the river. Or Jack’s keen spidey senses, which play a vital role in the novel.
Heller was 17 and at a party in New Hampshire when he noticed a despondent-looking man whom everyone treated cautiously. Heller struck up a conversation with the geochemist, who made his living on the river, only to learn that his wife had died two months earlier on their canoe trip down a remote river. One morning she went over a berm to go to the bathroom and never came back, the man told him.
“I said, ‘Bear attack?’ He said there were no tracks. He said he searched for three days. I walked away and knew he was lying. My antennae was up. I thought that SOB killed his wife, or something happened and he covered it up.”
The story marinated in his subconscious for four decades before Heller was writing it into his new book. That’s an aspect of fiction writing he likes best: Life experiences accidentally on purpose get woven into his work.
“I came up as a kayaker and love running rivers I’d never run,” he said. “Narrative can be like a river. You follow it around a corner, and you never know what’s going to be there. Before you know it, the story comes into something I’d been really concerned about for a long time.”
Before Heller embarked on novel writing, he was an award-winning adventure writer and contributing editor at Outside, Men’s Journal and National Geographic Adventure. He’s also written nonfiction, including “The Whale Warriors” and “Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet’s Tsangpo River.”
Fiction was always his first love, but nonfiction paid the bills. He still accepts travel writing assignments, mostly from Travel + Leisure magazine, but his heart’s in the novels.
“Once you start making it up, you can’t go back,” he said. “I enjoyed what I was doing before. Taking expeditions all over the world — these stories were beyond my wildest dreams. I’d been wanting to write fiction since I was 11, so it’s such a thrill to do what you’ve wanted to do since you were a kid.”

In defense of payday and small dollar loans

Texto completo: Attorneys general from California and other liberal states - many of which already ban payday loans - sent a nasty letter to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathleen Kraninger last week opposing her proposal to relax the Obama-era rules that would severely restrict the availability of payday, vehicle title, and other small-dollar loans.
The liberal AGs promised to sue the CFPB over the issue, and they might even find a sympathetic judge who will find that Obama administration executive actions cannot be reversed by Trump appointees. But that would be an unfortunate outcome for millions of Americans who rely on small-dollar loans as a necessary last resort - and who would end up suffering serious consequences if the Obama rules came into effect.
Obama-appointed CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a protege of Elizabeth Warren, was still on the job in 2017 when the agency issued rules requiring mandatory underwriting for small dollar loans. Underwriting is the process of looking at a borrower's overall financial obligations and ability to repay a loan. Mandatory underwriting for typical payday and other short-term loans would present an enormous administrative burden, add lengthy delays to products that are often used in urgent, emergency circumstances, and create a significant barrier for many borrowers when they lack any other options.
Small dollar lenders are heavily regulated in the states and there are also a dozen federal laws in place and ongoing CFPB oversight. The Cordray rule is a solution in search of a problem that would have serious negative consequences for the millions of Americans who find their last resort for credit eliminated.
The Democratic AGs are backed by the usual constellation of liberal community organizers and advocacy groups - led by the so-called Center for Responsible Lending, which was founded by Martin Eakes, the inventor of subprime mortgages - and funded by Herb Sandler, whose negative amortization "Pick-a-Pay" home loans were called the "Typhoid Mary of the housing crisis" by the New York Times. Sandler sold his bank to Wachovia for billions before the loans collapsed and blew up Wachovia. Only in the upside-down world of consumer finance advocacy could these people portray themselves as the good guys.
U.S. Bank announced with much fanfare an alternative to payday loans, but its product ended up being priced similarly to the payday industry standard $15 per $100 borrowed - in fact, exactly that amount for manual payments and $12 for automated withdrawals.
If somebody could meet the needs of high-risk, low-dollar borrowers inexpensively, they would. But it's a tough business and making regulatory burdens even more draconian could cause it to collapse. Over 50,000 jobs could be lost as up to 90 percent of storefront financial service centers would become unprofitable if the Obama/Cordray rule takes effect. And that means desperate consumers who currently turn to low dollar loans as a last resort would face even worse circumstances - potentially turning to criminal lending syndicates or facing evictions and utility shutoffs.
The bottom line: Director Kraninger is doing her job - protecting consumers - and should stay the course no matter how viciously liberal activists and politicians attack her.

Pizza-flavored ranch dressing is excessive - just the way we like it

Texto completo: In a recent campaign stop at an Iowa City pizza parlor, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was interrupted by a woman making her way through the crowd. "Sorry, I'm just trying to get some ranch, said Hanna Kinney, and in an instant, an internet folk hero was born.
These days, it seems as if we're all just trying to get some ranch. The dressing, which has long vacillated between derided symbol of American caloric excess and nostalgic favorite, is on the upswing once again. "Haters, it's time to come back to the ranch (dressing), proclaimed a recent Wall Street Journal headline. A September 2018 New York Times story deemed America "Ranch Nation.
Is it millennial nostalgia? A wearied resignation to mayonnaise? A stressed-out nation eating its buttermilk-dipped feelings? Ironic appreciation for the lowbrow condiment turned earnest?
When we talk about ranch, we're actually talking about class anxiety. It's a dressing and a metaphor. Ranch is "the kind of topping serious chefs correctly disdained for decades as extravagant and trashy, wrote Ben Adler in a 2016 Washington Post essay titled "Ranch dressing is everything that's wrong with America. Despite its West Coast roots - yes, Hidden Valley Ranch is a real place, outside Santa Barbara, California - it's unabashedly Midwestern. It actively sabotages any noble goals you had in choosing to eat vegetables, by covering them in caloric fats. And it's the perfect ingredient for fat-shaming scolds like Adler (he calls out "a shocking number of inexplicably skinny young people for eating pizza with ranch) to lord over the unenlightened ranch-eating masses with sneering statements, like declaring ranch "the culinary equivalent of setting your air conditioner to 62 degrees or driving a Hummer. (Eating meat is worse for the environment.)
When people are snobby about things that a lot of Americans like - see: "The Bachelor, and McDonald's - it can be about more than just that show, or restaurant, or flavor. It's wrapped up in our judgment of the people who like that thing, and the place that they hold in our socioeconomic hierarchy. Correlation is not causation. But populism is back in politics, and, lately, some "trashy ranch is taking up more space in the grocery aisle.
It's all very good news for Hidden Valley, which is capitalizing on the latest wave by releasing three new flavors of its classic dressing. The new "Blasted ranch dressing comes in bold buffalo wing, ranch-dipped pizza and "zestier ranch, boasting "2 x the zesty ranch taste, though I'm not sure exactly how one measures ranchiness on any quantifiable scale. Suffice to say, it's an extra ranchy ranch.
That dressing of buttermilk, garlic and herbs has come and gone in phases, and when it comes back, it's usually as a joke. A cool chef might put a housemade version of it on their menu as a sort of retro wink - like how some top-rated restaurants serve Miller High Life, the "Champagne of beers. But then people order it because they love ranch, and before you know it, other chefs are doing it too, and then the media comes calling with "Ranch is back stories - just like this one. Ranch is to food as normcore is to fashion.
Besides, the 90s are back in style. And in the 90s, Hidden Valley had a series of flavored ranch dressings, too. And the word "Blasted! with its Guy Fieri-esque punch, feels distinctly of that era. There were "flavor-blasted Goldfish crackers, berry blue blast Go-Gurts, and Gushers fruit snacks were "a fruity blast. Zesty, too, is a hollow word that is often paired with ranch. What is zest? Zest is lively, lively is a blast, blasted ranch is zesty, zesty is meaningless.
So, I will tell you: The extra zest in this Hidden Valley "Blasted zestier ranch, I think, is just more onion and garlic. It is a stronger flavor, but not in an unpleasant way. The buffalo ranch is spicy, if you believe ranch dressing is capable of being spicy. It makes a good dip for chicken wings, naturally, but it also denies you the hot-cool contrast of a blue cheese or a regular ranch. Still, it is a solid flavor combination.
The pizza ranch - and let's just say that Blasted pizza-flavored ranch dressing might be the most American condiment there is - has a hint of tomato sauce and smells strongly of oregano. When you taste it, you might have the peculiar experience that some people get from cheap Parmesan cheese, or certain other stinky cheeses, which is: It toes the line between tasting like something good, and also a little bit like vomit. This quality is not as pronounced when you put it on actual pizza - but you could also just put regular ranch on your pizza and avoid the possibility altogether.
As for the question of whether or not ranch belongs on pizza: Look, you should do what makes you happy. It would not be a great idea, I'd say, to top a fancy chef-made pizza, or a Neapolitan pizza, with ranch. But a piece of crappy frozen pizza? Honestly, it's pretty good! It's excessive. It's "trashy. It's zesty, it's blasted, but most of all: It's American, for better or for worse.

Texto completo: As Democrats on Capitol Hill and the campaign trail present an array of ambitious and expensive policy proposals, from a Green New Deal to Medicare for All , the question they face most often is, "How will the government pay for it?"
The answer, increasingly, comes from a professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island, Stephanie Kelton, who has become the public face of an unorthodox strain of economics called modern monetary theory. It is pitting mainstream economists and deficit hawks against left-wing progressives.
Ms. Kelton argues the government doesn't need to worry so much about how much it borrows to pay for spending programs. Unlike a household or business, it can never run out of money. The government can always print money to pay for debts. The constraint, according to MMT, isn't the deficit, but whether the borrowing and spending spurs inflation and disrupts economic activity.
With inflation and interest rates now very low, the government has plenty of room to borrow and spend more, MMT advocates say. The notion has gained traction among Democratic presidential hopefuls, helping to fuel ambitious policy proposals.
"If you were being responsible, you'd want to approve new spending not because you can demonstrate that it won't add to the deficit, but because you can demonstrate that it won't create dislocation, inflationary pressure—real problems in the economy," Ms. Kelton said in an interview.
The theory, which Ms. Kelton helped establish in the late 1990s, has gotten approving nods from Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), the presidential contender whom she advised in 2016, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.).
The rise of MMT comes as mainstream economists are reconsidering the danger of deficits . Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard, former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Jason Furman and Harvard University economics professor Kenneth Rogoff have all said recently the U.S. appears to have more room to borrow than they once thought.
Republicans, too, have backed away from past opposition to large deficits. With Republicans in control of the White House and Congress in 2017 and 2018, deficits marched toward $1 trillion, in part because of tax cuts and increased military spending.
The deficit totaled 4.5% of economic output last year, compared with an average of 2.9% over the previous 50 years. Debt-to-GDP has more than doubled, from 35% at the end of 2007 to 78% by the end of 2018, and is on track to hit 93% by 2029.
"MMT has been standing with its feet in the same spot for decades," Ms. Kelton said. "The mainstream economists keep inching, inching, a little bit closer. It's something we've been watching for a very long time."
Ms. Kelton is everywhere these days—on cable television and public radio, penning opinion columns and keynoting financial industry conferences. She has a book on MMT being released in April 2020.

* Capital Journal: Worrying About Deficits Falls Out of Style
* Senate Democrats Evade GOP Attempt to Expose Rifts Over 'Green New Deal'
* Medicare for All Loses Momentum Among Democrats
Still, many mainstream economists on the left and right say MMT takes the idea of deficit spending too far.
In a survey by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business of 38 mainstream academic economists, 88% disagreed or strongly disagreed that countries that borrow in their own currency don't need to worry about deficits.
The critics say MMT will lead to the very outcome Ms. Kelton and other proponents says it is designed to avoid: surging inflation and interest rates. They also say rising government spending will crowd out more productive private investment.
"How much more debt can you have on the U.S. balance sheet and not have global financial markets react? I don't know the answer to that," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank, and former Congressional Budget Office director. "I see no reason to run the experiment, 'When do we have a crisis?' Let's just not."
Mainstream economists say the government must tax businesses and households to pay for spending. Whatever it doesn't raise through taxes it borrows by issuing bonds.
MMT rejects this as backward. Spending isn't constrained by the government's ability to raise taxes or borrow, because the government can always create more money to fund itself. The real constraint on spending is the ability of the economy to absorb new spending without creating shortages and inflation.
In this worldview, fiscal and monetary policy are more tightly intertwined than in conventional economics. The central bank could accept IOUs from the Treasury to fund new spending—a step it can't necessarily take under current law—and inflation can be tamed by fiscal policy makers by raising taxes, cutting spending or imposing new regulations. Critics say it is politically impractical and the central bank is best left to manage inflation independently, as it is called on to do in all advanced economies today.
Some of Ms. Kelton's toughest criticism has come from the left. Some say more government spending is justified now because interest rates are low and would help facilitate it, but they see MMT as the wrong framework for justifying such action.
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a Democrat, in a Foreign Affairs article panned MMT as a "poor guide to policy in normal economic times." When Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in economics and a liberal columnist for the New York Times, tweeted last month, "Still don't see what we get out of it," referring to MMT, Ms. Kelton shot back , "How about a superior analytic framework and better predictive record (20+ years running) than any other macro approach."
She continues to advise the senator on a plan for a federal jobs guarantee, though she hasn't formally joined any 2020 presidential campaign.
"I don't feel like just because we're staring down trillion-dollar deficits we're out of room and Congress can't be considering ambitious spending," she said, predicting the debt-to-GDP ratio could easily reach 150% without causing problems for the economy.

Resumen: Outside of the ivory tower and millions of weekly "Good Place" viewers, May has taken his teaching to at least one other venue that might cause Foucault to raise his eyebrows: prison. On a chance invitation from a friend, May started teaching philosophy classes this year at Perry Correctional Institution, a South Carolina prison about 40 miles from Clemson University. With the third season on hiatus during the month of December, May recently sat down for some lengthy on-camera interviews on basic topics like utilitarianism, psychological egoism and Kantian deontology (the study of duty and obligation).

Texto completo: CLEMSON, S.C. >> Todd May isn't sure how his book "Death" ended up in the hands of a sitcom writer at NBC, but he aims to find out one day. It was the beginning of a fruitful, if unlikely, relationship.
May, a philosophy professor at Clemson University, is one of a handful of experts the television network consults on its quirky series "The Good Place." The show follows the moral quandaries of characters in an afterlife paradise gone haywire.
After May's 2009 treatise on mortality made an impression on one of the writers, who passed it on to his boss and show creator Michael Schur, May found himself having long, fascinating conversations with Schur.
"We had one Skype, which then turned into a series of Skypes," May said.
The network has since flown him out to Los Angeles for hours-long talks in the writers' room.
As it turns out, Schur who made his name with hit shows like "The Office," 'Parks and Recreation" and "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" wanted to make people laugh, but he also wanted to get the details right.
When a character made a joke about Aristotle, Schur wanted to fact-check the punchline. When the moral philosopher character Chidi loosened up on his strict Kantian position, he wanted the shift to look believable to folks who have read some Kant.
Consulting on a network TV show is an odd career turn for an expert on poststructuralism and other esoteric topics in 20th century continental philosophy. May's work was not always this accessible: In classic academic form, his 1989 doctoral thesis at Penn State was titled "Psychology, Knowledge, Politics: The Epistemic Grounds of Michel Foucault's Genealogy of Psychology."
But with three decades of college teaching and research under his belt, May said he was ready to share what he'd learned with the world.
"When you start in academics, you've got to show that you've got chops in the field that you're in you can speak the lingo, make the moves," May said. "So I did all that early on, but as I went on, I started thinking I could probably write for a wider audience. The machinery's all there, but I don't have to show all the machinery."
Outside of the ivory tower and millions of weekly "Good Place" viewers, May has taken his teaching to at least one other venue that might cause Foucault to raise his eyebrows: prison.
On a chance invitation from a friend, May started teaching philosophy classes this year at Perry Correctional Institution, a South Carolina prison about 40 miles from Clemson University. He now teaches two class groups: one for general population, one for lifers.
"The students were really responsive, the questions they asked were great, they did the reading. I'd give them just a few pages of reading for each class, but you could see they had it all marked up," he said.
The inmates have pondered the meaning of life, he said, and they've had lively debates on gun control and the death penalty.
Back on campus in the spring of 2018, May's undergraduate students were studying Aristotle at the same time as the inmates. When the students asked how the inmates were handling the material, May told them, "Your goal should be to be as motivated as the prisoners are."
Later in the year, May made waves with a provocatively titled Dec. 17 op-ed in The New York Times: "Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?" The site closed the comments section after 1,630 responses.
Meanwhile, on NBC, the topic of death has provided rich soil for comedy. "The Good Place" was recently renewed for its fourth season.
"In the book (Death'), I write that death is something that on the one hand takes away meaning from us because it cuts us off, but on the other hand it gives us meaning because if we were immortal, life would be shapeless," May said. "So we construct our lives and we try to live our morality within our mortality."
With the third season on hiatus during the month of December, May recently sat down for some lengthy on-camera interviews on basic topics like utilitarianism, psychological egoism and Kantian deontology (the study of duty and obligation).
The hours-long interviews have been boiled down into YouTube clips for a web series.
His four-minute breakdown of existentialism has racked up 65,000 views since mid-December.

Texto completo: Columbine. Newtown. Fort Hood. Aurora. Charleston. Virginia Tech. Mass shooting locations read off with chilling familiarity. Missing and almost forgotten among the communities that have suffered through the bloodshed is Binghamton.
What factors may have led many to forget the ACA shootings Not that the community wants to be solely identified by its own active shooter at an immigrant center that claimed the life of 13 victims 10 years ago.
But with each subsequent mass shooting, it seems the shocking incident that gripped this community in fear and mourning on a rainy and chilly Friday morning fades further from the nation's collective memory, creating a double tragedy for the innocent, many of whom were foreign nationals in an English class.
"The narrative of the story did not resonate with the mainstream," said Angie Chuang, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who has studied the media reaction to Binghamton's mass murder. "It was very much a perception of immigrants killing other immigrants."
Eleven of the 13 victims were from distant locales — China, Haiti and Iraq among them. Many of the mourning kin were out of reach for media interviews in the days following the shooting. Days after the Front Street scene was wiped clean, so was the searing impact of what was then one of the deadliest mass shootings in America — at least, in the eyes of the nation.
"I know a lot was said, maybe because they were immigrants, people didn't care as much," said Dr. Jeffrey King, son of Roberta "Bobbie" King, the beloved teacher who was targeted in the English as Second Language class. "I'm not so sure about that. I think it got diluted down as well because all of a sudden, (mass shootings) were happening every several months almost, a couple a year."
The American Civic Association killings were the seventh-deadliest shooting in U.S. history at the time, the same as Columbine High School. Today, it remains the 13th-deadliest mass shooting.
Each time a mass shooting occurs, media and politicians tick off a list of previous deadly killings, using shorthand like "Parkland" and "Aurora" to represent the horrors that occurred there. Binghamton is nearly always left off that list. The slight has mostly gone unnoticed beyond Binghamton, with one notable exception: Four years ago, The Boston Globe ran a front-page story headlined, "The deadliest mass shooting everyone forgot."
"In response to the shootings in San Bernardino, the New York Times published a historic op-ed titled 'End The Gun Epidemic In America' on its front page. It referenced, among others, the mass shootings in Colorado, Oregon and Charleston. It made no mention of Binghamton. Neither did editorials on gun violence in the Washington Post, L.A. Times and other major outlets," the Boston Globe writer observed.
Memories last long in Binghamton. The lives lost still bring a collective sting to longtime residents and relatives.
"At first, we started to realize, a few years out, after more and more shootings, all these articles were (saying), 'Oh, Columbine,' then Virginia Tech and Fort Hood and all this, and we're like, 'Wow, where are we?" King said. "We were one of the largest massacres at the time, you know — 13 people killed and others injured. And it actually really was very insulting, I mean, I was furious."
Barely 24 hours after shots rang out on April 3, 2009, at the American Civic Association, a horde of national media descended onto Binghamton to cover one of nation's most deadly mass shootings.
How the news may have influenced what's remembered National television networks and media outlets sprang into action, dispatching crews to bring news of the latest shooting tragedy to their viewers and readers. All the biggies were there: ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN.
"Today" show reporters set up a temporary canopy just across the street from the ACA to update its audience on the latest developments on the morning following the shooting. Random residents were plucked off the street for reaction.
A crush of media attended the day-after news conference at City Hall, where then-Binghamton Mayor Matt Ryan spoke about the tragedy and Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski described the ugly scene.
Within a few days, the media gaggle dispersed, moving on to other stories. Out of the spotlight, Binghamton's hurt became just one of several.
"The bigger issue is that outside the central New York area, Binghamton was never a high news draw," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University College at Oswego, who studies mass shootings.
For America, the killings had become all too commonplace. The media's mass shooting drill was well-oiled. In the 10 years prior, there had been 13 mass shootings — Columbine and Virginia Tech among them — across the nation, claiming the lives of 116 and injuring 105.
If Binghamton wasn't eclipsed because of its size, then why? Since Binghamton, there have been 26 more active-shooter incidents in America. The death toll, 281; injured, 243. Several of those locations stand out, too: Tucson, San Bernardino, Orlando, Fort Hood, Newtown and Charleston.
Binghamton has become little more than a footnote.
"These were poor immigrants in a poor town that had a Rust Belt vibe," said Chuang, trying to explain why the memory of Binghamton's tragedy has faded. "These were people that were affected — they've dealt with hardship before."
Once the immediacy of the tragedy fades, so does the collective attention of the American public.
"It's very easy for society to turn a blind eye because it's not their community," Schildkraut said.
After a decade, Zikuski is at a loss to explain how the American Civic Association seemingly became forgotten in the national conversation of mass shootings.
When looking at other shootings, back to Columbine, it's not as though Binghamton became eclipsed because of its size or even the number of victims.
"Do I agree with that? Yes, I do, it is sort of like the 'forgotten massacre,'" Zikuski said. "Not that we want to be known for this — this is one of the most tragic things that's happened in this community."
Zikuski said he hopes the fact that the American Civic Association involved an immigrant population didn't push it out of the national spotlight. But, he said, that's seemingly the most obvious explanation.
But perhaps more important than being ranked among the nation's mass shootings is being known for how the community healed, he said.
"I think this community took it hard, so I certainly don't think it was any less tragic because of who got shot," Zikuski said.
"Nobody wants to be known for what happened here, but they don't want it forgotten. People want people to know this community pulled together."

Texto completo: Jimmy Butler will have a homecoming that could feature many more boos than cheers.
The 76ers will visit the Timberwolves on Saturday. It will be Butler's first game in Minnesota since he was traded to the Sixers on Nov. 12 with Justin Patton for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a 2022 second-round draft pick.
Last year, in his only full season in Minnesota, Butler helped lead the Timberwolves to their first playoff appearance in 14 years. But Butler, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer to become a free agent, didn't endear himself to Timberwolves fans right before the start of this season. Shortly before training camp, he told the team he wanted to be traded.
Butler did play 10 games this season with the Timberwolves before being dealt.
Earlier this week, he told the New York Times, "They are going to boo me." Then he added, "I would boo me, too."
*The Celtics have banned a fan from their games for two years for being verbally abusive toward the Warriors during their only visit to Boston this season.
The team says it didn't enforce a lifetime ban because its investigation couldn't prove that the fan used a racial slur toward Golden State forward DeMarcus Cousins.
According to a Yahoo! report, Cousins said the fan "muttered" a racial slur at him on Jan. 26.
The Celtics say the fan, who is a minor, was ejected from the game immediately after they received the complaint.

Texto completo: Mientras Donald Trump recorría el país intentando convertirse en presidente, sus hijos viajaban en ocasiones al sur de Florida en avión y eran recibidos en el aeropuerto por un miembro de su equipo de seguridad, Zoltan Tamas, armado con pistola, que los conducía seguros hasta el campo de golf que la familia posee en Jupiter, a 80 millas al norte de Miami.
Tamas, de 38 años, había emigrado legalmente desde Rumanía en 2011. Logró la residencia permanente, pagaba sus impuestos, y se compró una casa.
Pero desde hace ocho meses está encerrado en un centro de detención del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés), y no ha podido ni siquiera ver a su esposa y a sus dos hijos de 11 y ocho años, según informa el diario The New York Times. La mujer y los niños son estadounidenses, pero dependían del salario del hombre para subsistir.
¿Qué sucedió?
Tamas fue arrestado después de que aplicara para conseguir la ciudadanía en 2016, cuando un control de antecedentes reveló que había sido condenado en Rumanía por un fraude con un seguro.
Su abogado ha recurrido ante la corte migratoria para evitar su deportación, y ha recibido cartas de apoyo de empresarios y antiguos empleadores, pero ICE considera que debe permanecer detenido hasta que se aclare su caso.
“A Zoltan no le atraparon cruzando la frontera”, ha explicado su abogado, Mario Urizar, “estaba en el país legalmente, pagando sus impuestos, y no tiene antecedentes criminales en Estados Unidos. ¿Por qué mantenerle detenido?”.
Tamas comenzó a trabajar para una propiedad de Trump en 2006, según el citado diario. Tenía entonces 25 años, y llegó al complejo vacacional de Mar-a-Lago con un visado H-2B de trabajo temporal.
Era camarero y estacionaba carros. Su novia de entonces, rumana, vino de vacaciones y se casaron en Las Vegas (Nevada). Fueron de luna de miel a Hawaii. Volvieron a Rumania, tuvieron un hijo, y en 2011 lograron la residencia permanente en la lotería de green cards, que permite cada año a 50.000 extranjeros emigrar legalmente a Estados Unidos por sorteo.
Tamas volvió a Florida, y logró trabajo en Mar-a-Lago, mientras su esposa se quedaba en Rumania esperando el nacimiento de su segundo hijo. En 2013, fue trasladado al campo de golf de Jupiter, y allí se convirtió en guarda de seguridad y, con los años, fue ascendiendo hasta convertirse en vicedirector de seguridad.
En 2016, transcurridos cinco años como residentes permanentes, la familia intentó conseguir la ciudadanía. La mujer y los niños lo lograron en abril de 2017. En junio, ICE citó a Tamas, y luego lo detuvo.

Texto completo: The 2011 thriller "Hanna" is reimagined as an Amazon web series. And Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner star in "The Highwaymen" on Netflix.
What's Streaming
HANNA Stream on Amazon. How would a person act if he or she had been raised outside of society? The question has been considered in works like the Austrian playwright Peter Handke's drama "Kaspar," about a 19th-century German who claimed to have grown up without any human contact, and "Captain Fantastic," the 2016 feature that cast Viggo Mortensen as a father who lived with his children in the woods. But "Hanna," a 2011 thriller, asked it with a fresh angle: what if someone were raised outside of society -- to be a meticulous killer? The movie cast Saoirse Ronan in the role of Hanna, a teenager whose father trained her in the wilderness to be an assassin. This new adaptation, created and written by David Farr (a writer of the original movie), puts a new spin on the tale, with Hanna (now played by Esme Creed-Miles) hunting and being hunted by a C.I.A. agent (Mireille Enos).
HURLEY (2019) Rent on Amazon, Fandango Now, Google Play, iTunes and Vudu. Near the beginning of this documentary, the driver Hurley Haywood is asked what makes him a legend of Daytona. He offers a basic response: "I guess the fact that I won it five times." Haywood is a soft-spoken racer who rose to fame in the 1970s, after he won the two best-known 24-hour races, Daytona and Le Mans, in the same year. But the documentary focuses on another fact about him: Throughout his career, he had hid his sexuality. Through interviews and archival footage, the film reframes Haywood's life as the story of a closeted gay man in the hyper-macho world of late-20th-century auto racing.
THE HIGHWAYMEN (2019) Stream on Netflix. The buddy cops have streaks of gray hair in this based-on-true-events crime drama, which stars Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner as two older Texas Rangers in the 1930s. They're given the job of tracking down Bonnie and Clyde, the infamous criminals who were turned into romantic outsiders -- a reputation cemented by the landmark 1967 film named for them. This drama instead romanticizes the authorities. "'Bonnie and Clyde' magnified the mystique of '30s bank robbers by refracting it through the lens of counterculture revolt," A. O. Scott wrote in his review of "The Highwaymen" for The New York Times. "This movie opposes that one with every fiber of its ornery being, including by its insistence on procedural tedium over cinematic excitement."
What's on TV
SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN (2012) 10:30 p.m. on TNT. "There is nothing cute about this movie," A. O. Scott wrote in his review in The Times of this reimagining of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. That's a compliment. Kristen Stewart plays a warrior Snow White and Charlize Theron is the angry queen, ratcheting down the cuteness associated with the Disney version and ramping up the darkness. It's more "Game of Thrones" than "Heigh-ho."

Texto completo: Illustration Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., will deliver the Molly Ivins Memorial Plenary to close the University of Colorado's Conference on World Affairs on April 13 in Boulder. Klobuchar announced her bid for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election in February.

If you go What: Amy Klobuchar at the Conference of World Affairs
When: 4 p.m. April 13
Where: Macky Auditorium at University of Colorado, 1595 Pleasant St., Boulder
Cost: Free
More info: Tickets are required. Learn when and where to get them in the schedule at colorado.edu/cwa
A presidential candidate who made headlines for allegedly mistreating her staff will close out the University of Colorado's Conference on World Affairs in April.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, announced her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential election primary in February. In a news release sent Thursday, CU announced she will deliver the Molly Ivins Memorial Plenary at 4 p.m. April 13.
Tom Zeiler, a CU professor of history and director of the program in international affairs, will moderate the discussion, which will cover "pressing issues facing communities like Boulder across the country." Klobuchar will also take questions from the audience, which must be submitted beforehand via the Conference on World Affairs cellphone app.
Klobuchar was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in Minnesota's history. In 2016, she passed more legislation than any other senator, and a recent Vanderbilt University study named Klobuchar and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, the "most effective senators" in the 2017-18 Congress.
However, news reports that surfaced shortly before Klobuchar announced her candidacy alleged that she mistreated her staff.
The New York Times reported that several former staff members alleged that the senator's behavior "was not just demanding but often dehumanizing."
Some staff alleged that she threw objects, sent hostile emails in the early hours of the morning, and made a staff member clean a comb after using it to eat salad on a flight.
In response to the allegations, Klobuchar said on CNN that she can be a tough boss, but her expectations are high because she wants the country to have and meet high expectations.
The conference's program committee, made up of CU faculty, students and community members, chooses speakers with the goal of representing a wide range of perspectives, said Erin Rain, marketing and media relations manager for the conference.
Rain said the subcommittee that chose Klobuchar also invited other presidential candidates, but they chose not to attend the conference.
When asked about whether the allegations against Klobuchar aligned with CU's values, Rain pointed to the university's free speech policy, which says that campus groups can invite anyone to speak regardless of past controversies.
The CU event is free and open to the public, but tickets are required. The public can pick up tickets beginning April 12, and CU students can get tickets starting April 11.A minimum of 500 tickets will be available for nonstudents.

Q&amp;A with RUTH REICHL

Texto completo: Ruth Reichl is no stranger to the memoir. She covered her NYC childhood in "Tender at the Bone," her career as a restaurant critic in "Comfort Me with Apples" and "Garlic and Sapphires," and her relationship with her mother in "For You Mom, Finally."
In her latest, "Save Me the Plums," out April 2, the James Beard Award-winning writer follows her 10-year tenure as editor-in-chief of Gourmet, until the influential food magazine closed in 2009.
amNewYork spoke with Reichl, a former New York Times restaurant critic who now lives upstate, about the book.
You've written several memoirs - why did you want to revisit this time in your life?
I always knew from the moment that I went to Gourmet that I would want to write about it. But I really thought I would write a different kind of book. I thought I would write ... [about] the strange and wonderful world of Condé Nast. And then, you know, when I actually sat down to write the book I realized, what an extraordinary time period that 10 years was in American publishing. And that the book had to be much deeper than what I had originally thought. I originally thought it would be a breezy book. There's certainly all of that in it, the Condé Nast lifestyle. But then for me, it was not only about the sort of golden age of American magazine publishing, and the end of it, but also, in this #MeToo moment, I started thinking I wanted to write about what it was to be a woman learning to be a boss, a working mother. I actually had something useful to say to other women.
Reflecting on that, what did you want to impart?
I think that women are different kinds of leaders than men are. I really wanted to talk about how what I came to understand, the longer I was there, was that I had 65 people working for me, and how important it was for me to make it a good workplace. I am proud of what we did at the magazine. But I am equally proud of the fact that I think that most of the people who worked at Gourmet really enjoyed working there.
In the years since it's closed, what has continued to be the legacy of Gourmet?
It really is amazing, there's not one day that has gone by in the almost 10 years that the magazine has been closed that someone doesn't come up to me say how much they miss the magazine, and start telling me stories of what Gourmet meant to them in their lives. I don't just mean my Gourmet, but Gourmet in all its history. ... I feel like we lost something important when we lost that magazine. It's especially sad to me because this has become such an important moment in American food, the last 10 years have been amazing. Food has become a part of popular culture in a way it never was before. And the fact that we didn't have Gourmet magazine sort of weighing in on it feels like a huge loss to me.
The book is very vivid. What did you rely on to recall that time?
I kept really good notes. I am one of those people who's a pack rat. When I left there, unlike many companies, Condé Nast didn't march me out the door and say you can't have any of your stuff. In fact I took everything. I have files on every issue we ever did. I printed out emails. I got stacks of stuff that helped me remember what was going on. It really helped that, unlike all my other memoirs, this one was something I literally always knew I was going to write. I was very careful to keep notes and diaries. When an important conversation took place I went back and wrote it down. I was a newspaper journalist, I had never lived in that world at all, this world of clothing allowances and hair dressers and makeup, limousines. I just never lived like that before. I knew that there was going to be something really interesting to write.
You mentioned how much the food culture has changed over the years. What have been some things that have really piqued your interest?
When I was growing up, the people who drove food culture were rich, old white people. And today, the people who drive food culture are young people. That's a huge change. The people who matter most are mostly people between 20 and 35 and they have changed the way we all eat. And the other huge change is that food trends used to come from the top down, so what happened in fancy restaurants eventually trickled down to people's tables. Now it's the other way around, and food trends are coming from the street up. What happens in food carts now comes to our tables.
That seems to be something you kind of championed in your career as well.
Oh, absolutely. When I got to The New York Times, one of the first things I did was go out and do a review of street carts. I've always loved that food.
Are there restaurants you've been to recently in the city that you enjoyed?
I was in for the opening of Hudson Yards, and I was really blown away by José Andrés' Mercado Little Spain. I can't wait to come back and eat my way through that food hall. He has fantastic paellas and amazing seafoods and incredible roast pork. I am enthralled with Atomix, the Korean restaurant. I don't think we've ever seen anything quite like that in the city, or maybe anywhere in the United States, before this - really gorgeous, high-end Korean food, that's like a lesson in Korean gastronomy. And I had dinner at the Standard Grill last week. Rocco DiSpirito is cooking again, which makes me very happy. The amazing thing is, most chefs, when they're running a kitchen, they just expedite. He's actually on the line cooking. And I thought the food was wonderful.
Are there places that are your go-tos?
There are lots of them. Probably the place we go most often is Pearl Oyster Bar. They do a few things perfectly, which makes me very happy. I also to go Via Carota a lot. I love their food. And I am a regular at Gray's Papaya. It's probably actually my favorite New York breakfast. I get myself a hot dog and then I walk down to the river and walk along the river. It's just a great way to start the day.
Are there other things that you're working on?
I have a column in Town & Country. And I actually still owe Random House two novels, so I'm working on those. But that will be a while coming. And I'm doing a project with Netflix soon. They optioned "Comfort Me with Apples," so hopefully that will happen.

Texto completo: Mitt Romney turned 72 on March 12. Belated happy birthday. Dude looks good. Romney is a politician. At any given moment in American history, I lose track of whether he’s in office or out of office or running for office or even what state he lives in. I think he’s now mayor of Butte, Montana, or something like that. He ran for president (I think of the United States) several times, but I don’t believe he won. You should be able to look that up.
On his recent birthday, Romney shared a video of himself with a birthday cake on Twitter. But not just any birthday cake. A special birthday cake. A Romney birthday cake.
“My team surprised me with a cake made out of my favorite snack — twinkies! Looking forward to all this year has in store,” he wrote in the tweet.
A couple of things here. First, how did a guy who professes his allegiance to Twinkies not get elected president? (I’ll pause while you amuse yourself with a little joke about our current president’s nutrition regimen.) Second, it’s Twinkies, not twinkies, because it’s a registered trademark of Hostess Brands for its popular golden sponge cake
with creamy filling. How important are Twinkies to Hostess? The company’s NASDAQ symbol is TWNK, that’s how important.
(As some sage sometime so sagely saged, it’s scientifically solid that the three things best equipped to survive when all else is gone from God’s good green earth are Twinkies, armadillos and Cher.)
“Look at that!” Romney says on the video as he internalizes the full glory of a cake constructed of 24 Twinkies, each festooned with a birthday candle. “Holy cow!”
FYI, “Holy cow!” is what people like Romney involuntarily exclaim when overwhelmed by the combined forces of excitement, ecstasy and the real-life, rapturelike realization of their wildest dreams.
And then he blew out the candles. But not the way most Americans do. He pulled each one individually from the cake and extinguished it with focused exhalation. So, yes, he blew out his birthday candles. But, no, he didn’t utilize the generally accepted protocol of blowing them out in unison while they were on the cake.
For this nontraditional effort, Romney drew the full snark of the world.
“This is the most bizarre technique for blowing out birthday candles that I’ve ever witnessed,” tweeted journalist Bradford Pearson. “Mitt Romney is a deeply weird dude.”
From the New York Times’ Julie Davis: “Just think if this had surfaced during the 2012 election. ‘New video of Republican presidential nominee extinguishing birthday candles by removing them 1 by 1 from his cake and blowing on them individually has raised new questions. …’”
At this point, I have a question for you: OK if I blow on your lunch before you eat it?
Thank you, Sioux City Councilman (or whatever and wherever you are now) Romney. Thank you for opening my eyes to the weirdness of eating a piece of birthday cake after somebody else (perhaps a germ-hosting 6-year-old) blew on it.
Ick. And retroactive ick for all those birthday parties I’ve attended at which I ate blown-on birthday cake. I’m lucky to be alive. And so are you, if you’ve ever eaten birthday cake after somebody else blew on it.
“The Journal of Food Research reported that blowing out candles on a birthday cake increases the amount of bacteria on frosting by 1,400 percent,” according to NBC in 2017.
From the abstract atop the Journal of Food Research’s 2017 study: “Preliminary tests of blowing on nutrient agar indicated that bioaerosols in human breath expelled from the mouth may be a source of bacteria transferred to cake surfaces. To test aerosol transfer to cake, icing was spread evenly over foil, then birthday candles were placed through the foil into a Styrofoam base. After consuming pizza, test subjects were asked to extinguish the candles by blowing.”
(We must assume the pizza was introduced to fully simulate a kid’s birthday party. There also might have been a pony ride.)
“Icing samples were sterilely recovered then surface plated to determine the level of bacterial contamination. Blowing out the candles over the icing surface resulted in 1,400 percent more bacteria compared to icing not blown on. Due to the transfer of oral bacteria to icing by blowing out birthday candles, the transfer of bacteria and other microorganisms from the respiratory tract of a person blowing out candles to food consumed by others is likely.”
You know what that means, don’t you? Me neither, but it doesn’t sound good. And 1,400 percent sounds like a lot.
From the results section of the study: “Birthday celebrations routinely include the ceremonial blowing out of candles on top of a cake. Some food safety concern exists in light of previous research on bioaerosols generated by breathing, coughing and speaking supported by the results of the present study finding that bacterial levels averaged 15 times higher in icing due to blowing out candles.”
You should know that the report also includes these words: “staphylococcus,” “streptococcus,” “corynebacterium,” “haemophilus” and “neisseria.”
This is why we must be thankful for inventor Michael Tropeano, who applied in 2008 for a patent for his “sanitary birthday covering and candle system for use with a birthday cake, having a sanitary cover, a plurality of candles and a serving tray.”
From his application: “After you blow out the candles, and pull the candles out of the cake, divots are left that ruin the cake’s appearance. But, that’s not the most important problem. The blowing out of the candles presents an even bigger dilemma because when someone blows out the candles they inevitably blow out saliva, food spat and thousands of germs. Who wants to eat a cake with live bacteria and germs sprayed thereon? In addition, everyone who has been to a child’s birthday party knows that there is always the curious finger or two dipped into the frosting. The current invention seeks to eliminate these problems entirely.”
And that’s why, to this very day, you see Tropeano’s invention, the one for which he won a Nobel Prize, on most birthday cakes. In fact, it’s mandatory in California.
OK, so it didn’t catch on (not even in California) and no Nobel (but he should get a NoGerm). But now, maybe with Romney doing the infomercials, perhaps its day has come.
Romney’s right. The lambasters should retract their lambastes and apologize forthwith. And, when it comes to birthday cakes, we should all do as Romney does.
“I have a bit of a cold,” he told TMZ, “and I didn’t want to spray my germs all over the Twinkies for everybody else to eat.”
A grateful nation gives its thanks.
Oh, and I probably should mention that several medical experts quoted in the NBC story said there’s little to no health hazard in eating birthday cake after somebody blew on it.
Experts, shmexperts.
Who are you going to follow? Some lab-coated, petri-dished scientists who’ve spent their professional lives studying this stuff, or a guy who’s the Sioux Falls sheriff or something?

Texto completo: James Beard-award winning food writer Mark Bittman is known for his crisp, witty New York Times food columns, his accessible cookbooks and impeccable food sense.
And if he once rolled his eyes over the Bay Area's mad passion for Meyer lemons, all it took was a 2015 stint as a distinguished fellow at UC Berkeley and a Meyer lemon tree in his own front yard to convert him.
Bittman may be back in New York City now, but he's also back in our kitchens with a new cookbook his 21st. "Dinner for Everyone" (Clarkson Potter, $40) takes 100 iconic dishes and reinvents each one with a trio of recipes easy, vegan and "perfect for company" for everything from gumbo and chowder to stroganoff, pot roast and pot pie. Think of it as a recipe flight for your favorite fare.
Everyone's favorite pasta Bolognese? Bittman offers us a laid-back Pasta with use-whatever-you've-got Bolognese, a rigatoni with ratatouille bolognese and an everything-from-scratch fresh pappardelle with bolognese. Something, in other words, for everyone.
RECIPES
Mark Bittman's pasta use-what-you've-got Bolognese
Serves 4
Salt
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 pound ground beef or other ground meat
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
Pepper
1 teaspoon dried herbs, like oregano, thyme or marjoram
1 teaspoon spices, like fennel seeds, ground coriander or celery seeds
¼ cup tomato paste
1 cup dry red wine or water
½ cup milk or heavy cream
1 pound any pasta
1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese (about 4 ounces), divided
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Put the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat with the beef, onion and garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently and breaking the meat up until it's browned and the vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes.
Add the herbs, spices and tomato paste and stir until fragrant and the tomato paste has caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine, raise the heat a bit, and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping any browned bits off the bottom. Add the milk and adjust the heat so the sauce bubbles gently; cook until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Cover and keep warm.
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, then start tasting. When the pasta is tender but still has some bite, scoop out 2 cups cooking water, then drain the pasta. Immediately add the pasta and ½ cup cheese to the skillet and toss to coat; if it's too dry, add enough of the reserved cooking water to coat the noodles in sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning, toss again and serve, passing the remaining cheese at the table.
Rigatoni with ratatouille Bolognese
Serves 4
Salt
1 pound eggplant, peeled if you like and cut into chunks
1 onion, peeled and cut into chunks
1 fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into chunks
1 zucchini, cut into chunks
1 red or yellow bell pepper, cored and cut into chunks
6 garlic cloves
¼ cup and 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided use
1 cup tomato paste
28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
Pepper
1 pound whole wheat rigatoni or other cut pasta
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, for garnish
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Put the eggplant, onion, fennel, zucchini, bell pepper and garlic in a food processor with the ¼ cup oil. Pulse, stopping to scrape down the sides once or twice, until finely chopped but not pureed.
Put the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it's hot, add the vegetables and cook, stirring often, until the onion becomes translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the tomato paste, turn the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomato paste caramelizes, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat so it bubbles gently but steadily. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, then start tasting. When the pasta is tender but still has some bite, scoop out 2 cups cooking water, then drain the pasta.
Immediately add the pasta and a splash of the cooking water to the skillet and turn the heat to medium-high.
Toss to coat in the sauce, adding a little more reserved pasta water if necessary to create a slightly creamy, but not soupy, sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning; then garnish with the parsley and serve.

Resumen: The alleged assault was reported by Irish media at the time of the event, but the fiery fighter was never named based on Irish law, according to The New York Times. Earlier this month, the $100 million athlete was arrested in Miami Beach and charged with strong-arm robbery and criminal mischief after he allegedly slapped a phone out of a fan's hand, then "stomped" on it several times. McGregor pleaded guilty to simple disorderly conduct at a Brooklyn Criminal Court hearing in July stemming from the April attack on a competitor's bus, during which a colleague threw a chair through the windshield.

Texto completo: Newly retired UFC star Conor McGregor is reportedly being investigated for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman in December in Ireland.
An unidentified woman claims that McGregor, 30, assaulted her at the Beacon Hotel in Dublin, just outside his hometown of Crumlin, last winter, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
The famed Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter was reportedly arrested in January, questioned and released without being officially charged.
Police have reportedly collected physical evidence from the hotel, where McGregor stayed occasionally in the penthouse suite, and are reviewing video footage, according to The Times.
"This story has been circulating for some time and it is unclear why it is being reported now," Karen Kessler, a spokeswoman for McGregor, said in a statement to the Daily News.
The alleged assault was reported by Irish media at the time of the event, but the fiery fighter was never named based on Irish law, according to The New York Times.
The perpetrator had been referred to as a "sportsman" in the Irish Times and not at all in other outlets.
"Investigations are ongoing in this case and at this time a file continues to be prepared for the director of public prosecutions," local police told the newspaper.
Hours before The Times' report, the pro brawler mysteriously announced his retirement.
"Hey guys quick announcement, I've decided to retire from the sport formally known as 'Mixed Martial Art' today," he tweeted early Tuesday morning. "I wish all my old colleagues well going forward in competition. I now join my former partners on this venture, already in retirement. Proper Pina Coladas on me fellas!"
Kessler, insisted the two events were unrelated.
"The assumption that the Conor retirement announcement today is related to this rumor is absolutely false," she told The News. "Should Conor fight in the future it must be in an environment where fighters are respected for their value, their skill, their hard work and their dedication to the sport."
Before his announcement, McGregor, who welcomed his second child in January with girlfriend Dee Devlin, had been expected to make a July comeback after his six-month suspension for a brawl during UFC 229. He recently said on "The Tonight Show" that he was negotiating with UFC to return.
The fighter has "retired" before, though, stepping down in 2016 before reversing his decision two days later.
Earlier this month, the $100 million athlete was arrested in Miami Beach and charged with strong-arm robbery and criminal mischief after he allegedly slapped a phone out of a fan's hand, then "stomped" on it several times.
Last year, he was also arrested after he and about 20 others attacked a bus of other fighters outside Barclays Center. McGregor pleaded guilty to simple disorderly conduct at a Brooklyn Criminal Court hearing in July stemming from the April attack on a competitor's bus, during which a colleague threw a chair through the windshield. Two of the fighters on the bus were injured by flying glass.
McGregor recently completed five days of court-ordered community service at a pair of Brooklyn churches. His case is scheduled to wrap up in a hearing later this week.

Texto completo: Laptops replace teachers, kiosks replace clerks, tablets replace nurses, and iPhones replace friends. For America’s middle class and working class, this is the future, and increasingly the present, as told by the New York Times’ technology reporter.

“Human contact is becoming a luxury good,” the reporter Nellie Bowles writes.

“As more screens appear in the lives of the poor, screens are disappearing from the lives of the rich. The richer you are, the more you spend to be offscreen.”

Why? Because despite the bottomless hype about the glories of the digital age, the endless subsidies for tech in the classroom, and the outsized reverence we have for Silicon Valley innovators, it hasn't been healthy for us to move our lives to the Internet and or our ties to screens.

The science isn’t settled, but there’s plenty of reason to believe that hours spent staring at and poking at screens is not good for us, particularly for our children. Perhaps the most telling evidence is the behavior of the very people making and selling the screens.

Wealthy Silicon Valley engineers and executives go to great lengths to limit their children’s screen time. As the recent Times piece spells out, America’s elites are exerting impressive effort to maximize human contact and interpersonal experiences in their own lives. This isn’t easy. It takes money.

For parents, minimizing kids’ screen time requires immersing your children in an environment where social media and smartphones are restricted or shunned. Such environments are very rare for those in the middle class and the working class. Working-class parents simply have fewer resources to tear their kids away from addictive screens. One result: “as wealthy kids are growing up with less screen time, poor kids are growing up with more. How comfortable someone is with human engagement could become a new class marker.”

America’s relationship with tech, screens, and social media, is still developing, but it’s also very familiar. Just as the Bolshevik Revolution echoed the French Revolution, which echoed Oliver Cromwell’s English Revolution, we’ve had reverberating revolutions in postwar American culture: The touchscreen revolution is echoing the globalization revolution, which echoed the suburban revolution, which echoed the sexual revolution.

These swift and radical changes in American culture, all hailed unequivocally as progress, have created a world that is more convenient for the elites. They can navigate the new reality they have helped create, but it can be very trying for everyone else.

The birth control pill, the embrace of no-fault divorce, and changing morality ended the norm of marriage and the moral precept that sex, love, marriage, and family formation all belong together. After a brief spasm of decadence in the early 1970s, the elites have returned to the old norms. They generally finish school, get a job, get married, and then have kids. But the damage has been permanent for the working class. Of women who didn’t go to college, half are unmarried at age 40. Half of all babies born to noncollege women are born out of wedlock. Noncollege men are twice as likely as college-educated men to get divorced.

Sprawling suburbia has been built for cars rather than humans. Local walkable downtowns have given way to inhuman strip malls at the periphery. The old idea of a neighborhood has become scarce. It is less common to bump into neighbors, as picking up a gallon of milk requires a car. There’s a lot less letting kids run around and play and walk to school.

As a result, we’re less likely to find our tight-knit community in a human-scale physical space such as a block or a village. The elites, who can afford two cars, whose office jobs offer flexible work schedules, and who are more likely to be married, can build their institutions of civil society more deliberately when little platoons are less likely to form organically.

Globalization and automation have created an economy in which it’s easier for the highly educated to leverage their skills into high pay. They (probably I should say "we") then leverage that high pay into a place in elite communities (neighborhoods, colleges, private schools, et cetera) that set their children upon the same path to success. The working-class guy, in contrast, now has less leverage in the economy. The result isn’t merely lower wages but destroyed communities and, as a result, more disability claims, more dropping out of the labor force, less marriage, and more depths of despair.

These rapid changes are sold to us as progress. We’re told that our kids cannot succeed in the modern world if they’re not fluent with the newest tech. We’re told the screens are democratizing and efficient.

But rapid changes to complex systems always create disruptions. The elites who usher in these rapid changes typically benefit from them. The rest of society often finds itself as a stranger in a new land.

Texto completo: The software believed to be linked to the catastrophic crashes of two new Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes in less than five months is getting a makeover.
Pilots from five airlines, including the three U. S. carriers that flew the MAX jets before they were grounded worldwide, tested upgrades to the flight-control system over the weekend at Boeing’s facility outside Seattle, the aircraft manufacturer confirmed.
Boeing will also host more than 200 airline pilots, technicians and regulators in an informational session Wednesday that’s among the initial steps in its attempt to get the MAX planes back in the air.
Investigators have pointed to the stall-prevention system known as MCAS – Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System – as a likely factor in the Oct. 29 crash of Lion Air Flight 610, which killed all 189 aboard when it plunged into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia.
Aviation authorities have noted clear similarities between that airplane’s movements and the path taken by Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed March 10 just outside the capital city of Addis Ababa and took the lives of the 157 passengers and crew on board.
'A red flag': From the flight manual to automation, why pilots have complained about Boeing's 737 MAX 8
Training inequality? Are pilots outside the U. S. getting the training needed to fly jets, including Boeing 737 Max 8?
Both of them exhibited drastic changes in airspeed and altitude, plummeting a few minutes after takeoff as the pilots made futile attempts to return to the airport.
On Monday, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told the Wall Street Journal he believes the MCAS was activated when his company’s ill-fated flight nosedived to earth, becoming the first aviation official with inside knowledge of the accident to make such a statement.
Gebremariam told the newspaper he would wait until for the results of the ongoing investigation to make a final determination.
In a statement, Gebremariam also disputed reports that the pilots of Flight 302 – veteran captain Yared Getachew and first officer Ahmed Nur Mohammed, a relative newcomer – did not have the proper training to handle the new aspects of the MAX 8.
“Contrary to some media reports, our pilots who fly the new model were trained on all appropriate simulators,” Gebremariam said. “The crews were well trained on this aircraft. ”
Boeing has been under fire for installing MCAS – a counter to the new plane’s tendency to pitch up – while providing scant information about it to the pilots and declining to offer extra training. When sensing the plane may be in danger of stalling, the software automatically lowers the nose of the aircraft to help it regain speed.
That software feature relies on readings from only one of the two angle of attack sensors on the MAX, and a faulty sensor is believed to have activated MCAS on the Lion Air flight and possibly also the Ethiopian flight even though the jets were not in danger of stalling.
A Reuters report based on the contents of the cockpit voice recorder indicated the Lion Air pilots couldn’t understand why the plane insistently lurched downward, even checking a manual in a desperate attempt to regain control.
Searching for answers: FBI joins criminal probe into Boeing 737 Max 8 safety certification in wake of crashes
On Saturday, pilots from Southwest, American and United airlines as well as foreign airlines Copa and Fly Dubai took simulated flights using the MCAS in its original form and with the proposed updates, and all we able to land safely, the New York Times reported.
“We had a productive session this past Saturday and plan to reach all current and many future MAX operators and their home regulators,’’ Boeing said on its website. “At the same time, we continue to work closely with our customers and regulators on software and training updates for the 737 MAX. ’’
As part of the computer upgrade to the MAX series, Boeing said it would adjust MCAS so it relies on data from two sensors, and instead of repeatedly pushing the nose down, the system would do it just once and less steeply.
Ask the Captain: What's that strange drilling sound on a plane?
In apparent response to criticism, Boeing plans to add as standard feature of the MAX a warning light that illuminates when the angle of attack sensors disagree, the Seattle Times reported, adding that previously delivered planes could have it installed at no cost. Previously, that display was optional and came with an extra charge.
The Federal Aviation Authority is expected to mandate the flight-control system upgrade by April, but getting the approval from domestic and foreign regulators for MAX planes to fly again figures to take months.

Texto completo: Illustration Freeman

Whenever my schoolteachers gave out writing assignments, I had to hide my excitement. While all the other kids hated putting words on paper, I always thought it was fun. Whenever given a word minimum, my teachers (and my saintly newspaper editors) can attest that I wrote (and write) too much.
In college, I started off in pre-med but switched to undeclared after learning that college chemistry was as lot frigging harder than high school chemistry. When I re-realized that I'd always wanted to write, I quit my "smart career path," moved to New York City, enrolled in a uni there and became an English major. Later, I took journalism classes and went on to work for newspapers and magazines.
As an adult, I like leaving Yelp reviews, and I keep blogs and a journal. I've published four textbooks and written three novels and two screenplays, but those last few things aren't quite finished. Yet.
A bit ago, I came across this article in the New York Times asking "Does It Pay to Be a Writer?" So far for me, the answer has been a solid "No." The Colorado Daily pays me, but definitely not enough to stay afloat.
As much as my grumbling stomach and empty bank account beg to differ, I don't care about giant paychecks. As a bright-eyed wannabe writer, I thought Stephen King would be barking at me for knocking his stuff off of people's bookshelves.
Unfortunately, I still work a day job. For the past few forevers, whenever somebody asks me what I do, I say, "I work as a blah blah blah, but I'm actually a novelist. I just haven't been published. Yet." I don't care about my desk job except that it pays my bills and gets me health insurance.
Sooner or later, one of my novels will get picked up. My books are funny, fun, cool, interesting and new — and I'll work for cheap. For the first novel or so.
But what if I actually suck? Should I just quit my dream of writing sci-fi, fantasy and comedy books?
Will I always want to be a writer? Or would it be nice to become an air traffic controller without spending weekends and nights re-editing my novel because I don't think the third act works as well without the scene where my main character reveals his true sadness after his hamster dies?
Hopefully I'm not forgotten before I'm appreciated like the guy who wrote "Moby Dick" or kill myself like the "Confederacy of Dunces" dude. People piss and moan about never reaching their potential and hating their lives. I want my career and calling to be something fun, so, I'll keep typing.

Mueller and the Obama Accounting; The former President now owes the country an explanation for the historic abuse of government surveillance powers.

Texto completo: The Mueller report confirms that the Obama administration, without evidence, turned the surveillance powers of the federal government against the presidential campaign of the party out of power. This historic abuse of executive authority was either approved by President Barack Obama or it was not. It's time for Mr. Obama, who oddly receives few mentions in stories about his government's spying on associates of the 2016 Trump campaign, to say what he knew and did not know about the targeting of his party's opponents.
If he was briefed, for example, on plans by the Justice Department to seek wiretaps on Trump campaign associates, it's hard to believe Mr. Obama would not have been highly interested in the matter. Going all the way back to his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois, Mr. Obama had aggressively advocated for preventing federal abuse of surveillance powers.
In September of 2004, the Chicago Tribune reported that candidate Obama "is ripping the controversial USA Patriot Act for violating U.S. citizens' civil liberties in the battle against terrorism." The Tribune reported:
Answering a Tribune questionnaire on the issue of terrorism, Obama vows to support the repeal of several provisions of the act because he believes it failed to strike the appropriate balance between homeland security and protection of civil liberties.
..."The act goes too far in violating our fundamental notions of privacy, thus seriously eroding the very ideals at the heart of our country's greatness," Obama said in his questionnaire.
According to the Tribune, Mr. Obama said that "a cornerstone of our democracy" is "that actions of a sometimes overzealous and overreaching Executive Branch are subject to challenge."
The next month, Madison, Wisconsin's Capital Times reported on the Illinois candidate's visit for a campaign event:
Barack Obama, the Illinois U.S. Senate candidate who became a national political phenomenon when he delivered the keynote address at this summer's Democratic National Convention, says he would like to think he would be as courageous as Russ Feingold was when he cast the sole vote in the Senate against the Patriot Act...
"I like to think that, had I been in the Senate, I would have cast the second vote against the Patriot Act," says Obama, who like Feingold is a lawyer and a passionate defender of the Bill of Rights.
It's time for this lawyer and alleged passionate defender of the Bill of Rights to explain the actions of his overzealous and overreaching executive branch. If he didn't find out about the wiretapping until after the fact, when exactly did he learn about it and how did he respond?
What has always seemed clear is that Mr. Obama never actually believed the now-discredited claim that the Trump campaign worked with Russia to rig the 2016 U.S. elections. In April of 2017, three months after Mr. Obama left office, this column noted that the former President had offered little criticism of the new President:
At the end of January, Mr. Obama broke his public silence, but it wasn't to reveal a grand conspiracy among former or current Trump associates. The former president instead released via a spokesman a statement supporting protests of a new Trump executive order on immigration. "Barack Obama and his aides expected to take on President Donald Trump at some point, but they didn't think it would happen this quickly," Politico noted at the time. "Now they're trying to find the right balance on issues that demand a response." Politico further reported that from "his vacation spot in the Caribbean, Obama has been keeping up with news from Washington," as well as following the anti-Trump protests that were occurring around the country.
If a former president, who had enjoyed unrivaled access to the relevant intelligence, believed that the country had been taken over by a cabal of Kremlin cronies, would he really be lying on a beach wondering which issues compelled him to criticize his successor—and having done so, decide that a Russia-engineered coup didn't quite rise to that level?
If Mr. Obama never bought into the collusion conspiracy theory, then the question is why he endorsed or allowed the use of federal surveillance tools against the party out of power—a direct threat to the democratic process that is at the heart of our country's greatness.
Mr. Obama might have room to deny any knowledge of the details of the surveillance abuses, given the story his FBI director told Congress—if anybody could believe that story .
The absolute bare minimum that Mr. Obama owes this country is an explanation of the actions of his government in spying on a presidential campaign.

Here's why smart investors should think globally when watching for recessions

Texto completo: Forty-five years ago, in a world unlike now, I loved exploring old books from libraries’ back stacks.
Among my favorite finds was Wesley C. Mitchell’s 1927 opus, "Business Cycles: The Problem and Its Setting. " Mitchell, a visionary, spearheaded the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which pioneered economic data collection to understand recessions and expansions.
In Mitchell’s book, I found a crazy-fun chart I highlighted in my 1987 book, "The Wall Street Waltz," called “Conspectus of Business Cycles in Various Countries, 1790-1925,” which lines up U. S. and other nations’ economic cycles.
Starting with America and England in 1790, it expands to include major European nations in the 19th century. By 1890, it covers Europe, Australia, Asia, Canada and big Latin American nations. It demonstrated that recessions and expansions worldwide lined up globally earlier than anyone thought (via data that weren’t perfectly accurate but basically correct).

Trump vs. Fed: Donald Trump takes fresh shot at Federal Reserve, picks fierce critic for its board
Long before globalization became a buzzword, the world was pretty darned global. The global business cycle linkage was always stronger than commonly perceived – still is.
Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, America paralleled England. Maybe European nations’ cycling together in the 19th and early 20th centuries isn’t so shocking.
But China, India and Japan paralleling them, along with North and South America? All had long, 1890s recessions. All suffered recessions paralleling America’s infamous Panic of 1907.
Individual nations wiggle a ways occasionally, but major trends are global. If you understand this, then you understand why and how what goes on overseas affects you directly here at home.
Old books demonstrate the same global patterns for interest rates. Country to country, both long-term interest rates and inflation tracked each other more than people thought 150 years ago or still think now.
U. S. and Western European bond rates have typically aligned since World War II ended. But A. C. Pigou’s 1929 classic, "Industrial Fluctuations," showed retail prices in Germany, England and the U. S. moving in virtual lockstep from 1860 through 1910.
A brutally fun fact? Since our Revolutionary War, inflation spiked routinely, here and overseas, during and right after major wars. People remember the Vietnam-era 1970s’ high inflation but forget prices spiked surrounding the Korean War and the two world wars. Even the Civil War and War of 1812 brought inflation spikes. We don’t have those big disruptive wars anymore, thankfully.
These old studies demonstrate that today it’s highly unlikely interest rates soar and bond prices plunge unless the cause carries global heft. Wobbles in one country don’t ripple globally. It’s the reverse. The bulk of the world pulls wobblers back toward average.
This is truer now than 20, 50 or 150 years ago, due to technology. The biggest global banks from every continent can borrow in one country and lend to another faster than you can read this column. Any huge American bank can arbitrage long-term interest rates globally, effectively ensuring ours move parallel to overseas. So if you’re worried about mortgage rates, bank borrowing, buying or selling bonds, or interest rates’ business impact, think global.
An easy online source for global data including inflation, interest rates, GDP and much more is tradingeconomics. com.
You'll spare yourself lots of angst by thinking globally. Last year, people lost lots betting Italy’s rising long-term rates would continue tied to populist political fears.

Texto completo: Dozens of marijuana advocates and business owners piled into the Boston City Council's chambers last Tuesday for what was supposed to be a legislative hearing — a chance for officials to get feedback on proposed changes to the city's cannabis permitting process.
But the session quickly devolved into a cathartic airing of grievances. Frustration with what critics say is a lack of speed, transparency, fairness, and equity in the city's marijuana industry had clearly reached a boiling point, as the crowd heckled and groaned at remarks by officials, and speaker after speaker railed against City Hall.
“We're in that limbo phase … We're trying to hold onto properties, pay lawyers, pay architects, and we are going through an indefinite process where maybe at the end we have a license, maybe we don't," said Jon Napoli, the owner of the Hempest clothing store and a member of a state-certified “economic empowerment" group seeking a retail pot license. “Really, all the advantages are going to the big-money people right now."
The hearing concerned Councilor Kim Janey's proposal to ensure that locals who suffered during the drug war benefit from the lucrative new recreational pot industry. If passed, the measure would mandate that for two years, officials only give local permits to Boston residents who are black or Hispanic, from certain neighborhoods with high rates of pot arrests, have low incomes, or have a drug conviction or a family member with one.
Of course, getting capital is one of the hardest obstacles for applicants without big investor-backing, as banks aren't lending because of marijuana's federal illegality.
While Janey's proposed ordinance calls for helping entrepreneurs raise funds, it doesn't outright provide them with capital. But the chairman of the Cannabis Control Commission last weekspilled some details on his idea for solving the problem to the Globe's editorial board — more on that in a minute.
Council members didn't vote on Janey's proposal last week, though each expressed general support for her ideas. And some councilors criticized Mayor Marty Walsh's administration for what they said was an opaque and achingly slow process that has left dozens of entrepreneurs paying rent on empty properties that may or may not ever host a licensed marijuana establishment.
Two top Walsh officials involved in local marijuana approvals defended their handling of the issue, saying the administration is doing its best and learning as it goes. Walsh, who didn't attend the hearing, hasn't directly said whether he supports Janey's proposal. But after a long period of silence, the mayor late last year adopted equity as his central talking point about legalization, which he strongly opposed in 2016.
“Boston is taking proactive steps to ensure much-needed equity in this new industry," Walsh wrote in a letter published Thursday by The New York Times. “Boston is a city that pioneers social change, and we are also a city that does things the right way. Our goal is to set a new national standard for equity in the emerging cannabis industry."
So that's where Boston stands — nine businesses have received city approval through host community agreements to become licensed, with the recent wave including three firms whose owners were local residents or racial minorities, or both. As slow and opaque as the city has been, at least it's doing something. Most other cities and towns can't say the same. Only a handful of others — like Somerville — have passed equity measures. Elsewhere, businesses that lack the backing of wealthy investors face a tough-to-near-impossible road on the local level.
Which is where the state comes in. Local governments don't have to care about social justice — and, in fact, many appear to be favoring the highest bidders. But under state law, the cannabis commission does have to care — it's mandated to create a diverse and inclusive industry.
Commission chairman Steven Hoffman came to the Globe's newsroom last Thursday to chat with the paper's editorial board. There, he divulged some new tidbits on the social equity issues plaguing the industry. (Interestingly, he said he hasn't tried cannabis since the Fourth of July a couple years ago, when he smoked a joint in Colorado. “I'm a vodka guy.")
First, he defended his commission's slow pace of allowing stores to open, which I reported has led to underwhelming tax collections so far.
“If we had opened 200 stores on day one, it would've been really hard" to address a lack of diversity in ownership, Hoffman said, since established businesses would scoop up the prime spots.
Secondly, using perhaps his strongest language yet on the issue, Hoffman criticized municipalities that are making outlandish demands for money when negotiating host community agreements with prospective cannabis operators.
“Some cities and towns are using host community agreements as a way to get more money than the law allows them to, and/or creating obstacles to entry," Hoffman said. On social equity, he added, “Cities and towns can be part of the solution, but they can also be part of the problem."
Citing legal ambiguity, the commission has asked the Legislature to give it explicit authority to regulate the contracts. The law limits payments between marijuana businesses and municipalities to 3 percent of annual sales, though many agreements include additional payments that cities and towns insist are not subject to the cap. Those limits were intended to level the playing field for small businesses — but they're currently unenforced.
“There seems to be clear flouting of these requirements," Hoffman said. “There are some [municipalities] that are playing games."
Thirdly, Hoffman revealed that he's shopping a draft proposal to lawmakers and other officials that calls for the state to offer loans to marijuana entrepreneurs harmed by the war on drugs. The interest-free financing would come from a $10 million bucket and be paid back over a five-year term, he said, with recipients permitted to use 20 percent of each loan to navigate the licensing process, 60 percent to build out their physical facilities, and the remainder held in reserve for unexpected expenses. Business assets, not personal assets, would serve as collateral.
To create the fund, Hoffman suggested diverting a portion of the state's 10.75 percent excise tax on recreational marijuana sales — though he also said at least one bank that serves recreational operators has offered to pitch in 1 percent of the profits from its cannabis business.
It's still unclear which agency would administer the loans. The CCC cannot, Hoffman said, as it would be a conflict of interest for the commission to help fund the same companies it's charged with regulating.
Hoffman said he's received only supportive responses so far, and hopes it will work.
“I'm new enough to politics that I don't have a way of assessing the probability of success," Hoffman said. “But I think getting capital into the hands of the people we're trying to help is incredibly important."

Texto completo: The remarkable number of notable writers who have studied or taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop includes Flannery O'Connor, Robert Lowell, Dylan Thomas, Rita Dove, Sandra Cisneros, Kurt Vonnegut, John Irving and Marilynne Robinson. In "A Delicate Aggression," David O. Dowling, an associate professor at Iowa's journalism school, tells the "cultural and industrial history" of the workshop through a series of biographical portraits. He captures writers "in their formative years taking their first tentative steps toward professional careers, forming alliances and rivalries among intimidating world-renowned faculty and high-powered peers." He writes about the program's blend of mentoring and marketing, its rigor and its wiles. Below, he discusses the workshop's founder, Irving defending Vonnegut's honor in a fight, how Ralph Waldo Emerson helped to inspire this book and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
I had written a book called "Emerson's Protégés," published in 2014. It was about how the promotion of young literary talent took place in Concord, Mass., and how the growth of creative writing happened within this enclave, this literary circle. Then I thought: How does that promotion move into the 20th and 21st centuries? I wanted to follow how the growth of young talent becomes institutionalized.
I didn't have to look too far. Doing some preliminary research, I strolled into Prairie Lights bookshop and asked the bookseller Paul Ingram what they had in the way of histories of the workshop. He took me over to a big shelf of books, and said: "Everything here is either a memoir or retrospective collection of commemorative pieces. These are all inside jobs." There wasn't one book there by someone who wasn't an alumnus or a former faculty member. "So," Paul looked at me, "someone's got to write this book."
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
Too many to tell you. One was the business savvy of many of the authors -- their ability to move themselves into favorable positions in the marketplace. For example, Flannery O'Connor advocated for herself in a way that demonstrated her business acumen by essentially pulling out of a deal that she had originally arranged with a publisher -- standing up for herself and having the wherewithal to know when she was working with an editor who was blind to her talents.
Kurt Vonnegut hosted wild parties at his house. And John Irving got into a barroom brawl with someone who insulted Vonnegut, his adviser, by calling him a "science fiction hack."
I thought this was going to be a Darwinian shark tank, with writers suffering in isolation as they struggled to survive the workshop method. Paul Engle was the first and most noteworthy director of the workshop. His father was a horse trainer. Engle saw the workshop as breaking the writer, the way you would break a horse. If you can survive, as he said, without losing too much blood, then you'd be able to handle the critics and editors who were going to be so tough on your work. So I was expecting more individualism, but I saw lots of collaboration, lots of humor, lots of mutual support and unlikely alliances of support forming.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
I first thought of doing a biography of Engle. But then I realized that no comprehensive history of the workshop had been done. There were important questions about intellectual history that hadn't been answered. Publishers were showing up at Vonnegut's parties, which turned into handpicked parties, where the best of the students would be matched with the publishers and put on a fast track. I learned that this book was going to be about the writer and mass culture, about media industries and the intellectual history they shape.
Engle solicited the attention of mass culture -- for instance, trying to get Esquire magazine to sponsor a conference. And it got all the way to the point where the workshop wasn't reaching out; others were reaching out to the workshop.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
I'll go back to the foundation of a lot of my thinking, research and writing, which is the Hudson River School of painters; specifically, Asher B. Durand and his painting "Kindred Spirits." It depicts Thomas Cole and William Cullen Bryant standing on a rock discussing something. What that signifies to me -- that moment and the Hudson School as a whole -- is a collection, a constellation of creative artists. The link to Emerson and the Transcendentalists is there, of course. There's a reciprocal enrichment. Indeed, one of Emerson's protégés was a painter, Christopher Cranch, who made the "transparent eyeball" illustration of Emerson as an eye on long legs walking through nature. That's where I go for my source of inspiration: that very fertile ground for creativity that happens in circles.
Persuade someone to read "A Delicate Aggression" in 50 words or less.
It brings you inside the mechanism of fame that has produced America's most important writers since World War II. It tells of their struggles and triumphs, the lasting impression the Iowa Writers' Workshop forever left on them, and the influence they had on the world's most powerful creative writing program.

Blueface: Can we catch up to his beat?

Texto completo: Before we try to leap outside of temporality itself, let's hear a round of applause for Blueface, the most inventive voice on the Billboard Hot 100 right now - inventive enough to make the concept of "right now" feel slippery.
He's a rapper from the dystopian paradise of Los Angeles who vocalizes as if he's allergic to time, frequently rushing out in front of the beat with such audacity, his music has ignited a months-long argument inside the digital rap bubble over whether we're hearing new-school virtuosity or old-fashioned ineptitude. It's obviously the former, or at least something like it. But until all of that noise dies down, the best thing we could possibly hope to hear in this 22-year-old's blessed anti-flow is opportunity - an opportunity to think about how we use rhythm to measure time, and what it means when a rapper refuses.
Theorizers have theorized that instead of responding to the beat, Blueface is actually rapping to some fugitive tempo inside his head. Even so, he takes a persistent approach to his most exhilarating lines, starting and ending pretty much where we expect him to, but accelerating through the internal syllables like he's revving an alien dirt bike. Here's another vehicular visualization: Imagine a train wreck. The locomotive plows into an immovable object, and while the engine and the caboose stay pinned to the ground, every boxcar in between goes flying off the tracks. That's how Blueface raps. Sometimes. And instead of a big disaster, it sounds like a tiny miracle.
That doesn't make it holy. When Blueface blurts out his most jumbled threats and hectic sex-brags, it's as if he's peeking into the future and smirking back at us. It's rule-breaking music - a tacit reminder that America's dominant rebel art form is also a rebellion against time.
All music plays with the clock, and when it gets fun, it imbues rhythm with meaning. When we say that a beat "swings," we're hearing a series of surges and hesitations that suddenly make existence feel less rigid. Swing forces time to loosen its grip, and that freedom feels good. Or when we talk about "polyrhythm," we're essentially talking about two different tempos running in simpatico parallel - and when those paired grooves nestle against one another, it sparks all kinds of metaphors about empathy and cooperation. To understand polyrhythm - or even just to dance to it - is to understand that there's more than one path forward through our shared experience of time.
Most rappers incorporate swing and polyrhythm when they arrange their rhymes over a beat, but because rap is such an intimate and intense mode of autobiographical mouth-music, a rapper's time-play can feel more heroic than that of others. Rappers are sonic protagonists who turn words into sounds, and whenever they break our collective contract with time, they're literally telling us how to get outside of life.
So why do people feel so chafed when they hear Blueface rapping "offbeat?" Because they've been conditioned by decades of vacuum-sealed rap verses. The importance of rapping tightly to a rhythm was practically written into rap music's Magna Carta - "Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat" - and at the dawn of hip-hop, such measures probably felt necessary. These were marginalized voices who wanted the rest of the world to hear them. Rapping close to the beat was a way of aligning your human voice with the unstoppable clarity and authority of time.
Expectations changed in the '90s as new faces from the West Coast and the South began rapping slightly behind the beat with cool consistency. The effect remains mesmerizing - a defiant expression of comfort and a comfortable expression of defiance all at once. Plus, rapping behind the beat doesn't freak us out with its riskiness because we're entirely familiar with the near past. The memory is fresh, we were just there. Our heroes have figured out how to stay there a little longer.
Maybe that's why rapping ahead of the beat makes so many of us feel so anxious. It's not just that it's atypical; it's that nobody has been to the future. So whenever Blueface gets ahead of himself, it puts our ears on edge. He's pushing us into a place we can't go.
And when he isn't crashing into the future, he's taffy-stretching the present. Blueface recently explained his approach to Billboard magazine like so: "Maybe I'm fitting too many words in, but if I didn't fit those words in, you wouldn't get [the effect] as much."
He goes on to describe his affection for overcrowding the center of his lines with bonus details, citing a lyric from "Respect My Cryppin'," perhaps his most mischievous song: "Mop the floor, hide the wet sign, just to catch him slipping." Yeah, he could have left it at, "Mop the floor just to catch him slipping." But there was more to say, and he was willing to warp time to say it.
Which is astonishing, right? When Blueface speeds up, everything else around him starts to get slow, which gives him a little more time to talk a little more trash. He isn't speeding up his words. He's slowing down the world.
If all of this clock talk makes you feel like I'm overestimating Blueface as a rapper, I'd encourage you not to underestimate yourself as a listener. His sound is what got him here, and instead of flying off into the imaginative possibilities of what his sound might mean , the pixelated blab has focused on whether his verbal arrhythmia is intentional, or who he might have inherited it from, or if it might actually be incidental to his expedited journey into a new tax bracket.
As far as intentionality goes, it should be obvious that he's rapping with artful, joyful purpose. And if it isn't, Blueface has every reason to feel flattered that his feigned carelessness sounds so convincing, that dizzy ears keep mistaking it for actual amateurism - that instead of hearing miraculous train wrecks, some people are still hearing a wobbly kid learning to ride his bike. Their loss, though. And if they don't want to listen harder, they should at least look both ways before crossing the tracks.
Others have been eager to put Blueface's time traveling in context. Many say he most resembles Suga Free and E-40, two California syllable jammers of the highest order. Those more attuned to Blueface's erratic vocal timbres - which can make him sound like he's experiencing an overconfident puberty - hear distant echoes of Mystikal. On top of that, Blueface has plenty of peers working ahead of the beat, coast to coast - from Drakeo the Ruler, a fellow Angeleno who mutters with unfathomable precision, to Goonew, a rapper from Maryland whose hurried whispers can chill your blood like an atemporal death breeze. But ultimately, these rappers only sound like themselves.
Meantime, somehow, the impact of Blueface's rogue sound is being overwritten with the most boring industry narrative imaginable, and Blueface isn't helping.
"Getting to this point probably took about 25 percent music," Blueface recently told the New York Times in a profile where the critic Jon Caramanica described his subject as "a first-rate character actor of the meme era," largely crediting the rapper's success to his Instagram savvy; to the viral dances associated with Blueface's street-hit-turned-national-hit, "Thotiana"; and to the large tattoo of Benjamin Franklin decorating Blueface's right temple. "In today's hip-hop ecosystem, distribution and starmaking systems are well-oiled," Caramanica writes. ". . . The music - the musician - is often merely an accent."
The first part is totally right, but the second part is totally depressing and, in this case, totally wrong. (Blueface is only about 75 percent wrong.) No rapper has ever climbed so high on the charts sounding quite like this. His sound isn't an accent. It's the source. Everything else follows.
It's easy to confuse what makes an artist famous and what makes art important. Sometimes, the only way to understand a song's magnetism is by parsing all the stuff that the song has magnetized - but these songs are doing new things, making time feel blurry in new ways, and they deserve more. To dismiss Blueface as an amateur, or to downplay him as a stylistic facsimile, or to think of him as a spritz of social media ambiance is to deny his music the breadth of its mystery.

Texto completo: With the wicked one-two punch of "Get Out" in 2017 and now "Us," opening Friday, director/writer Jordan Peele has brought a distinctively Black flavor to the horror-movie genre. You could argue he is the best to do so. But he's hardly the first. Horror was mining the African-American experience for scares and social commentary well before "Get Out" became an Oscar-winning cultural flashpoint.
It makes sense. African-American history started with a tremendously hostile, forced and, yes, horrific migration to a strange new land. That history contains stories of triumph but also scars of racism, lynching, legal and social discrimination, and so many other forms of horror. The horror movie seems like a natural fit.
"There are certain ideas around gothic horror, like the doppelganger or the grotesque other," says John Jennings, a professor of media and cultural studies at University of California-Riverside, who studies Afro-futurism, Black science fiction and horror, in a phone interview. "When a Black writer deals with these things through the lens of race, you get this really rich commentary about the nature of how we exist in the world.
"There's nothing more fictitious than race and how it affects our life," Jennings adds. "It's not real. It's almost like a phantom."
Underneath 'The Hood'
That phantom can take many forms, and it doesn't require high art to display itself. Take "Tales From the Hood," the 1995 cousin of the popular "Tales From the Crypt" franchise. Writer/director Rusty Cundieff and writer Darrin Scott conjured what at first glance looks like a quick-and-easy collection of scary and gory stories. But it doesn't take long to realize there's an awful lot going on in those tales.
The opening chapter takes on police violence against Blacks. Another tackles the issue of slavery reparations, as a David Duke-like gubernatorial candidate, living in an old family plantation house, does battle with dolls representing the victims of a slave massacre. A third takes a page out of "A Clockwork Orange" by putting a young gangbanger through a social reconditioning program that focuses on the horrors of Black-on-Black crime. "Tales From the Hood," which spawned a 2018 sequel, is a remarkably topical film that works as both pure horror entertainment and societal commentary.
Such social consciousness is rarely far from the surface of the Black horror movie. In Wes Craven's 1991 "The People Under the Stairs," the herb is a Black child (Brandon Quentin Adams) stuck in a house of horrors with a maniacal white couple and, well, the people under the stairs.
The couple is flat-out homicidal crazy. Significantly, they're also what used to be called slumlords, rich people who jack up rents and hoard money that comes in from the largely Black community. In this case, lest you miss the point, they have a cellar that is literally filled with cash and gold coins. You may want to tell the scrappy protagonist to get out and stay, but not before he pulls off an explosive Robin Hood plan to redistribute cash into the neighborhood.
Not just about race
Yet Tananarive Due, an author of several supernatural novels and executive producer of the documentary "Horror Noire: A History of Black Horror" (available on Shudder, AMC's horror streaming service), says it's a mistake to see these films only through a racial prism. "Black horror isn't always specifically about race," Due says via email.
"A more common theme throughout Black horror, as in all horror, is the will to fight back and survive against overwhelming force," continues Due, who also teaches a class at UCLA about Black horror inspired by "Get Out" called "The Sunken Place: Racism, Survival and the Black Horror Aesthetic."
"Because Black Americans so often feel relegated to outsider status, our horror will often examine isolation and everyday experiences from a unique perspective, or invoking intergenerational magical mythologies and faith we inherited from our grandparents raised in the South or the Caribbean."
The '70s saw its share of B-grade black horror, with exploitation films including "Blacula" and the "Exorcist" knockoff "Abby," and the more creative vampire take "Ganja & Hess" (the inspiration for Spike Lee's "Da Sweet Blood of Jesus").
The star of "Ganja," Duane Jones, holds a special place in the horror pantheon. He played the hero of George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead," made on a shoestring in 1968. In that film, he battled not just zombies but an armed mob of cops and vigilantes. The parallels to news footage of the civil rights movement were impossible to miss for contemporary audiences. (Today, parallels could even be made to the many "living while Black" videos of African-Americans being questioned or harassed in public spaces while lawfully going about daily routines.)
"I was teaching this course this quarter, and one of the students was saying, 'I don't really like horror movies because I step outside and I could be killed,'" Jennings says. "You look at the current political climate, it is steeped in a type of existential dread, and we don't necessarily have to relive that... (But) when you have a Black director, Black producer and Black writer looking at these things, and marrying it with the lived experiences of African-Americans in this country, through the lens of horror, you get a really particular remix of how horror is seen."

Texto completo: From the first track of Jazzmeia Horn's 2017 “A Social Call," it's not difficult to see why she won the 2015 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocal Competition. On that cut — jazz vocal deity Betty Carter's “Tight"— you can hear within a few bars that Horn's voice has range and heft and a warm, grainy character. She tackles the intricacies of the uptempo rhythmic steeplechase with unruffled aplomb. She knows how to land on a syllable and make it count in a way that animates an entire lyric. And when her phrasing spins off from the lyrics into effusive scatting, with the occasional trill or yodel, it is, as Carter herself proclaimed about scatting, “not nonsense" — it's the ineffable meaning beyond words.
Horn, 28, first played Boston in one of the Celebrity Series' Stave Sessions last year at this time. On Thursday, she plays the Gardner Museum's RISE series, with Dorchester rapper Latrell James opening.
Aside from prize-winning jazz technique (she also won the 2013 Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition), Horn has a wide-ranging sensibility. On “A Social Call," the Dallas-born singer assays R&B like Norman Whitfield's “I'm Going Down" and the Stylistics' “People Make the World Go Round." She brings her early church-music experience to the gospel standard “Lift Every Voice and Sing" as well as the spiritual “Wade in the Water." The former segues to the Bobby Timmons hard-bop standard “Moanin,' " while the latter is part of a medley, with Mongo Santamaria's “Afro Blue" (with lyrics by Oscar Brown Jr.) and Horn's spoken-word “Eye See You."
The medley crystalizes the themes of the album — a “social call" (echoed in the Gigi Gryce-Jon Hendricks tune of that name), which can mean a night on the town or, as Horn writes in the liner notes, “the social issues that are alive today." An intricate arrangement, it moves from African percussion and wordless vocal improvisation to the hard-bop Santamaria theme, to a spoken-word section of bearing witness (amid police sirens and crowd noise), and the consolation of the concluding spiritual.
The “I'm Going Down" finale gives “A Social Call" the satisfying arc of a dramatic narrative, from that jazz-swing curtain raiser through ballad tenderness (a lovely version of Jimmy Rowles's “The Peacocks," with Norma Winstone's lyrics), the emotional extremes of the “Afro Blue" medley, and R&B affirmation. It has a concept-album's thematic unity and the pacing of a satisfying live concert.
When I reach Horn on the phone in New York, she says that her interpretive skills and facility with lyrics are based in her emphasis on storytelling. “Generally, I just try to keep it very basic and do a storytelling theme. Whatever the lyrics are, I just think of a story in my life that pertains to the music or the story that the lyricist wrote."
That connection informs her choice of standards. On “A Social Call," “the stories matched my life. I always try to find stories that I can tell naturally. I love doing that because then I'm being true to the art, but also being true to myself and true to my audience."
For a long time she says, “I didn't sing the song 'Lush Life,' because I had never drunk alcohol, and I didn't understand what that meant. I didn't go into clubs or bars, so I didn't understand the 'lush life,' so I wouldn't sing it."
Horn's next album will include more of her poetry, such as listeners got a taste of with “Eye See You," and similar wordplay — in that case “I" representing the physical body, and “eye" representing consciousness.
“I'm choosing the conscious realm to see you, I'm choosing to see you with my 'third eye.' " She relates her poetry to black speech. “In the black community we have a tendency to say 'I feel you' a lot, because it honors a person more than 'I see you' or 'I understand you.' We don't 'understand' people, we don't stand under people, we stand with them." It's similar, she says, to saying “I be happy."
“People will say that's grammatically incorrect. For me, it isn't, because 'I be happy' is a way of being. . . . I'm not speaking English when I create poetry, I'm not thinking about grammar so much as I'm thinking about translating the feeling of my soul."
Due for a summer release, the new album will include about a dozen of her own songs as well as one by Rachelle Ferrell and another by Jon Hendricks.
“'A Social Call' was just to introduce my audience to my voice and my sound and my storytelling capabilities, whereas the new album will be introducing [people] to my entire self, and not just someone else's compositions. It will be my compositions and the complete story of my artistry."

The losers running for the Democratic nomination

Texto completo: Look at the losers running, or considering a run, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I don't mean that pejoratively. I mean it literally.
Beto O'Rourke's presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president. At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn't accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run. But at least he won. O'Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.
Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O'Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he "brought a great deal of vitality" to his work "preserving our planet and protecting our people." (In fact, O'Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, "What would you say is Beto O'Rourke's top accomplishment that he brings to the table?" Hinojosa could not name a single one. "I'm not even talking about Congress," Henry said. "What has he done in his life?" "Your question is meaningless," Hinojosa replied.
So, if O'Rourke hasn't accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right? Nope. The Post reports that "unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O'Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country's toxic politics." The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair's Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O'Rourke "can't deny the pull of his own gifts." He tells a reporter, "Man, I'm just born to be in it."
He's not the only statewide loser taking the national stage. Stacey Abrams lost the governor's race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union – a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well. "I think that I am a skilled communicator," she said. "I think I'm a very good thinker. No, I know I'm a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience."
Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as "former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations" (a temporary membership for young people) as well as "a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations." That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O'Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.
Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president. That's true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O'Rourke, he had actual accomplishments – including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.
This is not to dismiss O'Rourke's chances. He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders's first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, "In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007."
Apparently, Democrats like losers. We'll soon see if one can win the presidency.

KABUL, AFGHANISTAN--Two U.S. service members were killed during a joint operation with Afghan forces in northern Afghanistan on Friday, bringing to four the American combat deaths in Afghanistan so far this year, Afghan and American officials said.
What happened
A spokeswoman for the U.S.-led NATO mission in Afghanistan confirmed the two deaths in a brief statement, but it did not release any details of the attack.
"The incident is under investigation, and we have no additional information to provide," said the spokeswoman, Sgt. 1st Class Debra Richardson.
Qayum Nuristani, a spokesman for the Afghan special forces, said the operation was in northern Kunduz province. One Afghan commando was killed and three others were wounded, he said, adding that many Taliban had also been killed in the fighting.
Amruddin Wali, a member of the provincial council in Kunduz, said the Afghan and American forces were conducting a military operation against the Taliban in Gul Tepa District.
"Both Afghan and U.S. forces suffered casualties in the operation," he said, without providing an exact figure. "The district is completely in the Taliban control."
In 2018, 13 U.S. troops were killed in combat in Afghanistan, up from 11 in 2017. Two U.S. soldiers were killed in separate attacks in Uruzgan and Badghis provinces in January.
Afghanistan drawdown
There are roughly 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. In December, the Trump administration ordered the military to begin plans to withdraw about 7,000 U.S. troops from the country in coming months. But the drawdown has not yet started, and military officials have been unable to clarify how many troops will leave the country, or by when.
After the latest talks between U.S. and Taliban officials in Qatar, Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American peace envoy, said the two sides had reached a draft agreement on two of four elements necessary for a settlement: assurances that Afghanistan would not become a haven for terrorism, and a timeline for a U.S. military withdrawal.
'Both Afghan and U.S. forces suffered casualties in the operation. The district is completely in the Taliban control.'

College Admissions Scandal Highlights Rampant Inequality

Texto completo: Headnote Guest Columnist
I have probable cause to believe that the defendants conspired with others known and unknown: (1) to bribe college entrance exam administrators to facilitate cheating on college entrance exams; (2) to bribe varsity coaches and administrators at elite universities to designate certain applicants as recruited athletes or as other favored candidates, thereby facilitating the applicants' admission to those universities; and (3) to use the facade of a charitable organization to conceal the nature and source of the bribe payments. - FBI College Admissions Bribery Scheme Affidavit
In a few weeks, the National Urban League will release report cards on states' plans to address inequity in their education system - plans they are required to submit to the federal government under the Every Child Succeeds Act.
The task is daunting, as inequities are stark, everywhere in the United States.
That's why the nation was outraged by the news that wealthy parents - whose children already have inconceivable advantages over low-income families - allegedly resorted to outright bribery and fraud to get their children into elite colleges.
More than 50 people, including two Hollywood actresses, were charged on allegations that ranged from included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to claim falsely that certain students were athletic recruits.
That money plays a big role in elite college admissions has been no secret. A donation of $500,000 or more can equal 500 points on the SAT, according to journalist Daniel Golden, author of "The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges - and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates."
Given the outrageous advantage wealthy families already legally have, the cheating scandal throws new light on the disparity of opportunity for low-income students and children of color. Disadvantaged students and their families who are striving with all their might and resources to overcome systemic challenges viewed the scandal with particular despair.
"Just knowing that due to circumstances outside of school, you do give your best in all that you can, but you also have to kind of balance being an adult," high school senior Khiana Jackson of Kansas City told The New York Times. "To know that these parents are throwing money at all of these people and being like, 'Can you do this for my child,' it's kind of discouraging. Some of us will probably have to work our whole lifetime to see money like this."
African-American students have far less access to college preparatory courses. According to the United Negro College Fund, only 57 percent of Black students have access to a full range of math and science courses necessary for college readiness, compared to with 81 percent of Asian-American students and 71 percent of white students.
When Black students do attend schools that offer honors or advanced placement courses, they are vastly underrepresented. Black and Latino students comprise 38 percent of students in such schools, but only 29 percent of students enrolled in at least one AP course.
African-American students are often located in schools with less qualified teachers, teachers with lower salaries and novice teachers, according to UNCF.
Black students are twice as likely to have their education disrupted by suspension, nearly four times as likely to receive out-of-school suspensions, and more than twice as likely to be referred to law enforcement or subjected to a school-related arrest.
Students of color are much more likely to attend schools where three-quarters of the students or more are poor or low-income, and poor districts with a higher proportion of students of color have been shown to receive substantially less state funding than comparably poor districts that have more white students.
Anyone convicted of engaging in criminal activity to bypass an already-rigged college admissions process should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. But more importantly, we need to address a system riddled with bias and inequality.

Texto completo: If President Trump is indeed guilty of some sort of obstruction of justice, he should be particularly worried at the news that former White House communications director Hope Hicks is cooperating with the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation of her former boss.

This is not to say that Hicks is anything but loyal to Trump. But if there’s anyone whose truthful testimony or production of documents might inadvertently snare the president, that someone is Hicks. She was so well ensconced in Trump’s inner circle, and so trusted, that if, repeat, if, anything was legally amiss, she likely would have witnessed it or been a part of it, whether with any ill intent on her own part or not.

According to multiple reports about the subjects of committee Democrats’ interest in Hicks, one of the most prominent items on their list, sometimes the very first subject mentioned, is “the drafting of a 2017 press statement about a 2016 meeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. and some Russian officials.”

We have been told, from public statements of a key player in that episode, that Hicks made statements easily construed as suggesting that key evidence be withheld.

Longtime Washington public relations veteran Mark Corallo, who was handling communications for Trump’s outside legal team, has told special counsel Robert Mueller that Hicks suggested, in Trump’s presence, that emails involving that Trump Tower meeting “will never get out.” As described by the New York Times, “that left Corallo with concerns that Ms. Hicks could be contemplating obstructing justice.”

Corallo reportedly cut off the conversation right there, saying that Hicks must not realize the legal jeopardy the discussion might put the president in. Through her lawyer, Hicks denied Corallo’s account. But Corallo, known as a stickler for proper procedure, was so bothered by the White House’s handling of the matter that he resigned from the Trump account three days later.

As Corallo has told the story, the impression is that Hicks, whose background was in public relations for fashion companies rather than in politics, may have spoken out of naivete about the legal standards pertaining to ongoing investigations rather than with corrupt intent. What that could mean, though, is that in Trump’s famously unstructured White House, Hicks or even Trump himself could have stumbled into violations rather willy-nilly.

According to CNN, the committee has demanded from Hicks “documents from ‘any personal or work diary, journal or other book containing notes, a record or a description of daily events’ about Trump, the Trump campaign, the Trump Organization and the executive office of the President.”

That is potentially a lot of raw material, if she cooperates fully, which is what she apparently plans to do. Trump is so mercurial, and so apt to change his stories as the mood strikes him, that one can easily imagine Hicks taking notes that, in hindsight, show Trump improperly hindering the investigation.

This is not to make any assumptions that Trump is guilty. It is to say that if he is guilty of something, Hicks’ testimony is probably the most likely to reveal it, even if she doesn’t intend to implicate him in wrongdoing.

As we now know for a fact, the Trump team’s original statements about the now-famous Trump Tower meeting were false. Hicks was intimately involved in drafting that statement, and then in trying to clean up after that original hiccup. If the modus operandi, then or in any other instances, was as sloppy as Corallo has described, that’s where Democrats trying to nab Trump will seek evidence of malfeasance.

Women Who Worked with Billionaire Philanthropist Michael Steinhardt Say He Asked for Sex

Resumen: Goldfein, now 58 and a Chicago-based consultant to nonprofits, said Steinhardt repeatedly made inappropriate comments to her between 2000 and 2002, when she worked as the national program director of Synagogue Transformation and Renewal, a nonprofit he co-founded in 1999 and to which he was giving about $250,000 a year, public filings showed. After requesting an interview with Steinhardt, the Times received unsolicited praise for his warmth and generosity from former and current employees and some prominent friends, including Bronfman; Martin Peretz, the former owner of The New Republic; and Betsy Gotbaum, the former New York City public advocate. Though he was not named as a defendant, he appeared in two sexual harassment lawsuits filed in state court in Manhattan, in 2012 and 2013, against an Upper East Side art gallery. Last year, as Hillel International conducted an investigation into Steinhardt’s behavior, the organization did not pursue a $50,000 donation he had pledged, and removed his name from its international board of governors, an advisory board for major donors, according to the person with knowledge of the investigation.

Sheila Katz was a young executive at Hillel International, the Jewish college outreach organization, when she was sent to visit the philanthropist Michael H. Steinhardt, a New York billionaire. He had once been a major donor, and her goal was to persuade him to increase his support. But in their first encounter, he asked her repeatedly if she wanted to have sex with him, she said.
Deborah Mohile Goldberg worked for Birthright Israel, a nonprofit co-founded by Steinhardt, when he asked her if she and a female colleague would like to join him in a threesome, she said.
Natalie Goldfein, an officer at a small nonprofit that Steinhardt had helped establish, said he suggested in a meeting that they have babies together.
Steinhardt, 78, a retired hedge fund founder, is among an elite cadre of donors who bankroll some of the country’s most prestigious Jewish nonprofits. His foundations have given at least $127 million to charitable causes since 2003, public filings show.
But for more than two decades, that generosity has come at a price. Six women said in interviews with The New York Times and ProPublica, and one said in a lawsuit, that Steinhardt asked them to have sex with him, or made sexual requests of them, while they were relying on or seeking his support. He also regularly made comments to women about their bodies and their fertility, according to the seven women and 16 other people who said they were present when Steinhardt made such comments.
“Institutions in the Jewish world have long known about his behavior, and they have looked the other way,” said Katz, 35, a vice president at Hillel International. “No one was surprised when I shared that this happened.”
Steinhardt declined to be interviewed for this article. In a statement, he said he regretted that he had made comments in professional settings through the years “that were boorish, disrespectful, and just plain dumb.” Those comments, he said, were always meant humorously.
“In my nearly 80 years on earth, I have never tried to touch any woman or man inappropriately,” Steinhardt said in his statement. Provocative comments, he said, “were part of my schtick since before I had a penny to my name, and I unequivocally meant them in jest. I fully understand why they were inappropriate. I am sorry.”
But through a spokesman, Steinhardt denied many of the specific actions or words attributed to him by the seven women.

A lifelong New Yorker, Steinhardt has given millions to city institutions. NYU Steinhardt is New York University’s largest graduate school, with programs in education, communication and health. There is a Steinhardt conservatory at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and a Steinhardt gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
But he wields his widest influence in the tight-knit world of Jewish philanthropy.
Along with Charles Bronfman, a billionaire heir to the Seagram liquor fortune, Steinhardt founded Birthright Israel, which has sent more than 600,000 young Jews on free trips to Israel. He spearheaded the creation of a network of Hebrew charter schools. A new natural history museum in Tel Aviv bears his name.
While Steinhardt has been celebrated for his largess, interviews with dozens of people depict a man whose behavior went largely unchecked for years because of his status and wealth.
None of the women interviewed by the Times and ProPublica said Steinhardt touched them inappropriately, but they said they felt pressured to endure demeaning sexual comments and requests out of fear that complaining could damage their organizations or derail their careers. Witnesses to the behavior said nothing or laughed along, women said.
“He set a horrifying standard of what women who work in the Jewish community were expected to endure,” said Rabbi Rachel Sabath Beit-Halachmi, a Jewish scholar. She said that Steinhardt suggested that she become his concubine while he was funding her first rabbinical position in the mid-1990s.
The spokesman, Davidson Goldin, said Steinhardt had never “seriously, credibly” asked anyone for sex.
Rabbi Irving Greenberg, who was the president of the Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life for a decade, said he repeatedly rebuked Steinhardt for using belittling language toward both men and women. That tension was a factor in his deciding to leave the job in 2007.
Steinhardt could be harsh with men, but his comments to women focused on their appearance and fertility, Greenberg said. When Steinhardt talked to women, the rabbi said, “the implication was that they were not on par with men.”
He said that the comments were made in a bantering, not threatening, tone and that he never saw Steinhardt directly proposition anyone. Still, he said, “I understand that the women felt more shaken or threatened than I recognized at the time.”
Katz said she was hoping Steinhardt would become a funder of her work at Hillel when she met with him in his Fifth Avenue office in 2015 to interview him for a video Hillel had commissioned about Jewish entrepreneurs. But she said that as the filming got underway, he repeatedly asked if she would have sex with the “king of Israel,” which he had told her was his preferred title for the video. He then asked her directly to have sex with him, she said.
When she turned him down, he brought in two male employees and offered a million dollars if she were to marry one of them, she said. After the filming ended, Steinhardt told her it was an “abomination” that a woman who looked like her was not married and said he would not fund her projects until she returned with a husband and child, said Katz, who has not previously spoken publicly about the incident.

Through his spokesman, Steinhardt denied most of the details of Katz’s story and said he did not “proposition” anyone. Goldin said Steinhardt was not aware that Katz was courting him as a donor when they met.
Katz said she was shaken and reported the comments the next day to Eric D. Fingerhut, the chief executive officer of Hillel. He apologized and promised that she would not have to meet with Steinhardt again, she said. Hillel confirmed generally that Katz reported the incident but would not comment on specifics.
Hillel continued to accept donations from Steinhardt until last year, when it hired a law firm to conduct an investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The investigation, which ended in January, concluded that Steinhardt had sexually harassed Katz and another employee in a separate incident. The findings, which were communicated to Hillel staff in an internal memo that did not name Katz or Steinhardt, were first reported in The New York Jewish Week, a community newspaper that has reported on some allegations against Steinhardt.
A Brash Boss. A Big Benefactor.
Steinhardt, who grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, was known for his intelligence and a combative management style when he ran his hedge fund, Steinhardt Partners, which he closed in 1995. In interviews, Steinhardt’s supporters acknowledged he could sometimes be brash and crude, especially when talking about a signature interest: the survival of the Jewish people.
Some of Steinhardt’s most prominent philanthropic efforts are centered on encouraging Jews to marry other Jews and strengthen their ties to the community. He has said his efforts have been driven by the losses of the Holocaust as well as by more contemporary concerns about the effects of intermarriage and secularization.
Steinhardt, who is married with three adult children, is known to goad single Jews into kissing, dating or marrying, and to insist that Jewish women have children, sometimes offering money or the use of a Caribbean home as an incentive, dozens of people said.
“Michael is very passionate, and he is passionate in everything,” Abraham H. Foxman, a longtime friend of Steinhardt’s and the former head of the Anti-Defamation League, said of Steinhardt’s matchmaking. “Call it a passion, call it an obsession, call it a perversion. Some may. I don’t — I understand it. It’s just the way it comes out, which may disturb people.” He said he had never witnessed Steinhardt asking women to have sex and would not expect it of him.
But the behavior described by the women in interviews went well beyond matchmaking.
Goldberg, the director of communications for Birthright from 2001 to 2010, said she was used to Steinhardt being “inappropriate.” Still, she was shocked when Steinhardt suggested that she and a co-worker at a donor reception in Jerusalem join him in an intimate encounter.
Goldberg recalled Steinhardt asking for a threesome; her former colleague, who asked not to be identified, recalled Steinhardt inviting her and Goldberg to leave with him, but did not recall his referring to a threesome.
“We were working Joes, pretty vulnerable, and here he is with all his authority, coming over and propositioning us,” Goldberg, who is now 48, said.
Steinhardt’s spokesman called the account “simply not true.”
Two women who worked at a small Jewish nonprofit recalled Steinhardt using similar language in 2008. They both said that during a meeting at his office to make a pitch for funding, Steinhardt suggested that they all take a bath together, in what he called a “ménage à trois.” One of the women, the executive director of the organization, asked that her identity be withheld because she feared that people on her board would pull their donations if she spoke publicly.
Her former colleague asked that her identity be withheld to protect the executive director.
Steinhardt said in a statement that he did not recall this meeting; his spokesman added that Mr. Steinhardt did not make the comment.
Goldberg said she believed her encounter took place in 2005. She said that soon after, she shared her account with Shimshon Shoshani, who was then Birthright’s chief executive officer.
Shoshani, who later became the director general of Israel’s Education Ministry and is now retired, said in an interview that he did not recall Goldberg’s allegations. He said he had heard “rumors” that Steinhardt had made inappropriate comments, but said he never heard Steinhardt make such comments.
He praised Steinhardt for his commitment to Birthright. “I appreciate him very, very much. Even if there were some comments, about sex, about women, I wouldn’t take it seriously,” Shoshani said, “because he made important decisions in other areas concerning Birthright.”
Steinhardt has given about $25 million to Birthright, public filings show.
Out of Bounds
While Hillel and Birthright are among the nation’s most well-known Jewish nonprofits, Steinhardt also has given millions of dollars to smaller organizations. Some women who worked at these places described being particularly dependent on his favor.
Goldfein, now 58 and a Chicago-based consultant to nonprofits, said Steinhardt repeatedly made inappropriate comments to her between 2000 and 2002, when she worked as the national program director of Synagogue Transformation and Renewal, a nonprofit he co-founded in 1999 and to which he was giving about $250,000 a year, public filings showed.
Still, she was surprised when, during one meeting at his office to brief him about the organization, he suggested that he could set her up in a Park Avenue apartment and that they could have redheaded babies together, Goldfein said.
She said she felt demeaned by his treatment but tried to make light of the comments because Steinhardt was a director of her organization.
“I always felt that it was like a game to him and that I had to put up with it and play along. But it wasn’t an equal playing field,” Goldfein said. She said his behavior left her disillusioned with the job.
Steinhardt disputed her account. He denied “ever saying anything that was intended to ask anyone to have sex with him,” Goldin said.
After requesting an interview with Steinhardt, the Times received unsolicited praise for his warmth and generosity from former and current employees and some prominent friends, including Bronfman; Martin Peretz, the former owner of The New Republic; and Betsy Gotbaum, the former New York City public advocate.
Some acknowledged his tendency to make bawdy or inappropriate comments, but said Steinhardt was always speaking in jest.
“Michael has his unique sense of humour,” Bronfman wrote. “He loves to tease males and females, and certainly his very good friends. I can attest to that! Always has. But to conjure up intentions that he never had or has is more than a disservice. It’s downright outrageous!”
Shifra Bronznick, a consultant to nonprofits, said she was criticized by her colleagues in 2004 after publicly admonishing Steinhardt for commenting on a woman’s fertility at a conference. She said she believed that his comments were hurting women and their careers in a way that his supporters may not have realized.
“When people say bad things about Jews, our community leaders are on red alert about the dangers of anti-Semitism,” she said. “But when people harass women verbally instead of physically, we are asked to accept that this is the price we have to pay for the philanthropic resources to support our work.”
Rabbi Rachel Sabath Beit-Halachmi said she was 27 when Steinhardt, who was funding her first rabbinical position, suggested she should be his concubine. (Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times)
Steinhardt’s behavior stretches back to at least the mid-1990s, said Sabath, who recalled visiting him in his office during the 1995-96 academic year as one of the first Steinhardt Fellows at a rabbinical leadership institute.
She was 27 years old, and it was the first time she had met Steinhardt. He harangued her about being unmarried and said she should put her vagina and womb “to work,” Sabath said. He then suggested she become a “pilegesh,” an ancient Hebrew word for concubine, she said.
Taken aback, Sabath said she tried to engage Steinhardt in a discussion about the centuries-old practice of concubinage, which he said should be reinstituted. When an associate of Steinhardt’s walked into the office, Steinhardt told Sabath she should consider having sex with him, she said. Then Steinhardt proposed that she should become his own concubine.
“I have never uttered the word pilegesh, and don’t even know how to pronounce it,” Steinhardt said, through his spokesman. He also denied saying that Sabath should put her vagina and womb “to work.”
Another woman who was a fellow at the institute at the time, Rabbi Dianne Cohler-Esses, said she did not witness that conversation. But she said Steinhardt had separately suggested, in a meeting at his office that year, that she should date a married rabbi at the institute. She said she and Sabath complained to Greenberg about Mr. Steinhardt’s comments.
Greenberg, who at the time was president of the institute, recalled the conversation. He said he told Steinhardt that his behavior was “out of bounds.”
“It doesn’t excuse it and it doesn’t justify it, but I don’t believe that he seriously was recruiting Rachel to be his concubine,” Greenberg said. “It’s typical outlandishness.”
Sabath, who is now 50, went on to become a professor of Jewish thought and director of admissions at the nation’s largest Reform Jewish seminary, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. But the experience lingered. For more than two decades, she said, she avoided being in the same room with Steinhardt and could not bring herself to teach about the Torah’s concept of concubines.
She said she did not come forward earlier because she feared for her career and because Steinhardt was a “great benefactor” who supported values in which she believed. “But his being a megafunder can’t allow for, or excuse this behavior, and it has,” Sabath said.
External Scrutiny
None of the six women interviewed by the Times and ProPublica had ever spoken publicly about their experiences, but in recent years, Steinhardt’s behavior has faced some external scrutiny.
Though he was not named as a defendant, he appeared in two sexual harassment lawsuits filed in state court in Manhattan, in 2012 and 2013, against an Upper East Side art gallery.
Two women who worked at the gallery alleged that Steinhardt often made sexually loaded comments to them, which they were expected to endure because he was an important client. Steinhardt is a prominent collector of antiquities.
Steinhardt has been a major benefactor to New York City institutions, including the largest graduate school at New York University. (Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York Times)
Karen Simons, an employee, said in her 2013 lawsuit that in one instance, Steinhardt asked over the phone whether her husband satisfied her and asked her to have sex with him, the suit alleged. In a deposition taken in Simons’ case, Steinhardt said he did not remember making sexual remarks to the two women.
Court documents indicated that Simons’ lawsuit was discontinued in November 2017; the other was settled in 2014. Both suits “were resolved amicably with confidentiality agreements,” said the women’s lawyer, Jeffrey D. Pollack. A lawyer for the gallery, Electrum, which is also known as Phoenix Ancient Art, did not respond to requests for comment.
Goldin, the spokesman for Steinhardt, did not directly address the allegations in the lawsuits, but pointed out that a judge had sanctioned Simons for destroying evidence during the course of her suit. He added that Steinhardt had played no role in the resolution of either case.
Last year, as Hillel International conducted an investigation into Steinhardt’s behavior, the organization did not pursue a $50,000 donation he had pledged, and removed his name from its international board of governors, an advisory board for major donors, according to the person with knowledge of the investigation.
On Jan. 15, lawyers from Cozen O’Connor, the firm conducting the investigation, met with Katz to tell her they had found her complaint against Steinhardt justified, said Debra Katz, Katz’s lawyer, who attended the meeting. She is not related to her client.
The investigators also said a second Hillel employee had come forward during the investigation with a complaint that Steinhardt had made an inappropriate comment to her, Debra Katz said.
Steinhardt apologized “promptly” in 2011 when he found out he had offended this woman, his spokesman said. Steinhardt said in a statement that if he had been told at the time about Katz’s complaint, he would have apologized immediately.
“It pains us greatly that anyone in the Hillel movement could be subjected to any form of harassment,” said the organization’s Jan. 11 memo to employees, signed by Fingerhut and Tina Price, the chairwoman of the board of directors.
Katz, who still works for Hillel, said she decided to speak publicly in part because her role in the Hillel investigation had become known and she feared possible fallout. Her lawyer complained to Hillel in January that people using Katz’s name had called members of its board, upset about the investigation. Hillel declined to comment.
“I want to let other women who went through similar things to know that they are not alone,” Katz said. “And I want organizations, and in particular Jewish organizations who take his money, to consider the impact that’s had on people like me.”
This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times. Hannah Dreyfus, who reported this story for ProPublica, is a staff writer for The New York Jewish Week, where she has written about some of the allegations recounted in this story.

Update, March 21, 2019: The Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life has posted a statement to its website in response to this article.
Also, this article has been updated to reflect a comment from Steinhardt’s spokesman. In an interview with ProPublica and the Times before publication, the spokesman read a statement from Steinhardt saying he did not recall the meeting at which two women said he suggested that the three of them take a bath together in what he called a “ménage à trois.” Later, in the same interview, the spokesman said Steinhardt did not make the comment about the bath.
Correction, March 21, 2019: This story originally misspelled the given name of Sheila Katz’s lawyer. She is Debra Katz, not Deborah.

Texto completo: Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly referenced Messenger Kids.
When it comes to Facebook and security, it seems there is one potentially damaging lapse after another.
The latest was uncovered by the KrebsOnSecurity security news site, flagging hundreds of millions of Facebook users who had their account passwords stored in plain text that could be searched by more than 20,000 Facebook employees – in some cases dating to 2012.
The author of the report, Brian Krebs, says Facebook told him that none of the employees, to the company’s knowledge, abused the data.
Facebook later admitted as much publicly, in a newsroom blog posted by vice president of engineering for security and privacy Pedro Canahuati.
"We have fixed these issues, and as a precaution we will be notifying everyone whose passwords we have found were stored in this way," he wrote. The issue first came to light in January.
"To be clear, these passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook, and we have found no evidence to date that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them," Canahuati continued. "We estimate that we will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users. "
(Facebook describes Facebook Lite as version of Facebook predominantly used by people in regions with lower connectivity. )
Facebook outage response: For some, being off of Facebook during outage 'was like a nice short vacation'
iPad mini review: iPad mini review: In an age of larger iPhones, does Apple's small tablet still make sense?
Citing an unnamed senior Facebook employee as the source, Krebs says the social network is probing the causes of a series of security failures in which employees built applications that logged the unencrypted password data, which apparently numbers between 200 million and 600 million.
Facebook has been a magnet for disturbing news the past couple of years, leaving some people to break up with the service for good and placing CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the hot seat.
Last week, The New York Times reported Facebook’s data practices were under criminal investigation. And Facebook has been riddled by scandals ranging from Cambridge Analytica and fake news to the court documents that revealed youngsters and their parents were duped into spending money on online games earlier this decade.
Krebs told USA TODAY that “Facebook's motto has long been 'move fast, break things,' and this situation seems to be one unfortunate manifestation of that mantra. It's easy to see how a Facebook engineer or developer might enable password logging for a short period of time – to troubleshoot a specific problem, for example. But it's also easy for that developer to forget to undo that logging. ”
Were consumers harmed here? “The more people at Facebook who have access to this data, the greater the likelihood that someone will abuse that access,” Krebs says. “When you start getting into the realm of tens of thousands of employees with that opportunity over as much as seven years, the chances for harm or abuse would seem to go up considerably. ”
Engin Kirda, co-founder and chief architect at the Lastline network security firm, has a similar take: “This is not only a bad situation, but it is actually terrible. It is a major relapse of operational security practices. "
"Storing passwords in clear text is a terrible idea because it would allow employees and potential attackers who steal this data to easily use these passwords and potentially log on to other, non-Facebook-related services as well because users often reuse passwords," Kirda added. "If this data leaks out, or a Facebook employee who has access to this data ends up becoming malicious, having this data lying around might lead to other, easy account compromises that are not directly hosted on Facebook. ”
While Facebook claims none of the passwords were exposed externally, it points users to settings where you can change your passwords on Facebook and Instagram.
It also recommends such common sense security practices as choosing strong complex passwords that you don't repeat elsewhere, and enabling additional protections like two-factor authentication.

Texto completo: Sometimes stories are simpler than they’re made out to be. That appears to be the case with Jeff Bezos. When the National Enquirer reported that Bezos, the Amazon founder who is the world’s richest man, was having an extramarital affair and had sent racy texts, including photos of his penis, to his girlfriend, Bezos assembled a high-priced legal and PR team to mount an aggressive defense.
All of a sudden, sympathetic commentators began suggesting Bezos had been hacked. There was word that a "government entity" had gotten hold of the texts and photos. There was dark speculation of international intrigue, that Saudi Arabia might have used the Enquirer to target Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, in retaliation for the Post’s coverage of the murder of the columnist and Saudi regime critic Jamal Khashoggi. And of course, President Donald Trump played some sort of behind-the-scenes role.
Bezos orchestrated it all, using his security consultant to feed information to his newspaper, and also writing a much-discussed personal statement published on Medium.
"This statement that (Bezos) has released tonight is absolutely extraordinary," MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell said on Feb. 7, "and I think it is a gigantic moment, actually in this history of our digital communication, which everyone has known has been at risk for quite a while, that any one of us could be hacked. We could have private things revealed through stolen emails, stolen texts, that sort of thing. And here is someone who stands up and says, I’m not going to take it anymore."
"The Saudis are being brazen," MSNBC’s Chuck Todd said on Feb. 8. "We’ve caught them being brazen with Qatar. We’ve caught them being brazen with Jamal Khashoggi. This would not surprise if it ends up being more connected to them because they’ve been acting this way."
"The Saudi connection aspect of the allegation from Jeff Bezos," said CNN’s Chris Cuomo, also on Feb. 8. "Bezos says ... that you had (National Enquirer chief David) Pecker go to the White House with a Saudi guy that he was trying to raise money from. The dinner was a reward from the president. The Khashoggi reporting that The Washington Post did would really bother the Saudis, the Saudis wound up giving Pecker the money. Pecker’s now going after Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, maybe this has something to do with the Saudis, maybe even the president."
And so on. The Bezos team spun quite a story. But holes quickly appeared in their handiwork.
In early March, The New York Times published a detailed look at how the long-married Bezos came to be involved with his girlfriend, former Los Angeles local news anchor Lauren Sanchez. As the two got together, the paper reported, a smitten Sanchez was not shy about sharing intimate details of the relationship with her friends.
"By last year, they were having an affair," the Times wrote. "Three people in Ms. Sanchez’s extended social circle said she was giddy and in love, showing amorous texts to a number of Brentwood and Beverly Hills moms."
Sanchez was, to say the least, not particularly discreet in handling the revealing texts and photos Bezos sent to her. And then there was, in the Times’ description, Sanchez’s "fame-hungry brother-manager," Michael Sanchez, described as a "loose cannon" and an "incorrigible gossip even in a town full of them."
Now, The Wall Street Journal reports that Michael Sanchez, "a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges," has also "long been a source for the Enquirer." And, according to the paper, Michael Sanchez sold the Bezos texts to the Enquirer for $200,000.
Imagine that. Mogul sends deeply private texts to gossipy L.A. girlfriend who has gossipy, fame-hungry brother, and somehow it gets out! No Saudis required.
It is not unusual for men caught sexting with women not their wives to claim they have been hacked, or that their texts have somehow been stolen. Remember that Anthony Weiner tried the same thing. But few have the resources of Jeff Bezos, and few could rely on so many media commentators to spread the story.
At the same time, the Bezos spectacle also attracted the attention of more serious journalists, who found out that the real Bezos story is much simpler than all the Saudi speculation. It is, in fact, an old story, of people acting foolishly in the course of an extramarital affair. All the money in the world couldn’t change that.

I'm With Her will sing their sirenic harmonies around a single mic

Texto completo: This year's International Folk Music Awards' "Artist of the Year," I'm With Her, is an example of what happens when things click into place - and a reminder that sometimes, it takes a minute.
Bandmates and successful solo artists Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz and Aoife O'Donovan - whose trio the New York Times has called "a supergroup" - were orbiting around the idea of a collaboration since long before their first gig together nearly five years ago.
On March 29 at 7:30 p.m., they'll take the Lucas Theater stage at the Savannah Music Festival, where the superpower of their voices combined will be in the spotlight.
O'Donovan is a guitarist, vocalist and songwriter from a legacy of Irish musicians. Jarosz, a mandolin player and banjoist since age nine and signed her first recording contract in high school. Watkins debuted as a fiddle prodigy with landmark bluegrass band Nickel Creek when she was just eight-years-old.
Throughout their careers, they had performed, recorded and toured in every combination of two, sharing bandmates, sessions and festival rosters. Finally, in 2014, their orbits collided in an impromptu appearance at Telluride Bluegrass Festival. Knowing they were onto something, they began to write songs together and soon planned a tour, the 2015 European I'm With Her Tour, and the name stuck.
Within a year, the women recorded an album of songs they wrote together, but were too busy with their independent careers to release right away. All three were touring on acclaimed solo albums, one landed a Grammy, and if they weren't busy enough, between the album's recording and its 2018 release, two of the three women became mothers.
The 2018 release of "See You Around" was celebrated with an airtight tour to the tune of 150 shows, many of which were played with two infants in tow.
Now, "See You Around," with its lush violin, virtuosic finger-picking, and harmonies to stop one in their tracks, has been out for a year. The trio has been touring almost constantly from their homes in Brooklyn, New York and Los Angeles, and with all that going on, they haven't missed a beat.
If perfect harmonies are a learned skill, these singers had a good shot at learning it. All are from musical families: Of the bandmates' parents, four of six of them are music teachers.
But when they sing together on tunes like the light-hearted title track about heartbreak, which Jarosz leads, or the sultry lovesong "Ryland (Under the Apple Tree)" which O'Donovan leads, or whole-souled, westward travel anthem "Overland," which Watkins leads, one hears both total control and an effortlessness that feels instinctive.
They fluidly blend and contrast the different colors of their voices, sometimes playfully, and skillfully, switching from the high to the low part within a single track.
The audience can mull this nature versus nurture harmonies question at the Lucas while watching O'Donovan, Watkins and Jarosz channel their bluegrass spirit guides by singing a full, intimate set around one single, shared mic.

Texto completo: "Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime" a quote attributed to Lavrently Beria, former Russian Dictator Josef Stalin’s longest serving and arguably most ruthless Chief of Secret Police. Beria targeted "the man" first and searched until he "found" the crime or allegedly fabricated one if need be. Democrats in the House of Representatives have resorted to those same tactics Democrat Politics in 2019 has taken on the mantra of fighting everything Trump related and threatening anyone with the audacity to oppose them. Case in point: the Russia collusion hoax. U. S. taxpayers have spent close to $30 million dollars on an investigation by a Special Counsel because the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, and Department of Justice, DOJ, colluded to prevent Donald J. Trump from being elected president.
Various "news" organizations have speculated that the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller will be released soon despite having no word directly from Mueller or anyone on his team. Nothing revealed through indictments by the Mueller Probe thus far have implicated President Trump or his campaign of Russian collusion or any wrong doing, so, the House Democrats have decided to go fishing … or phishing.
On March 5, 2019, The Associated Press reported that on Monday, March 4, 2019, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) announced that he was opening a probe into possible obstruction of justice, corruption, abuse of power and is sending document requests to 81 people linked to President Trump and his associates. Representative Nadler claims this sweeping probe is designed to "begin building a public record" just in case the Department of Justice chooses to "conceal the work of the special counsel’s investigation from the public".
The democrats have switched tactics, after screaming for 2 years that President Trump better not fire Mueller and ginning up the voter base with the implication of obstruction, to democrats either don’t trust Mueller or don’t trust the DOJ. This new probe by the House Democrats is simply the next car linked to a train going nowhere except that it keeps their voting base fired up with hopes of impeaching the president.
Remember, Nadler is fully aware that it was the FBI who misled the FISA Court, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to obtain warrants allowing them to spy on the Trump campaign which included wiretaps and at least one mole infiltrating the Trump campaign during the summer of 2016. Nadler is aware that Former FBI Director James Comey was justly and legally fired by President Trump.
Comey has since admitted that he intentionally leaked information about the counterintelligence investigation they had dubbed "Crossfire Hurricane" to The New York Times through a friend specifically to prompt the Attorney General to appoint the Special Counsel Investigation. The FBI got the FISA warrant renewed at least twice using the infamous and discredited Steele Dossier without revealing to the FISA Court that this dossier was "opposition research" paid for by the Hillary Clinton Campaign.
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has recently claimed that he and other senior members of the FBI believed that Donald Trump was an agent working for Russia. Andrew McCabe, well known as "Andy" from the text messages related to former FBI Agent Peter Strzok and Lawyer Lisa Page as they discussed the "insurance policy" designed to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president, was fired at the behest of the Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, an appointee of President Obama, for "lacking candor under oath" and misleading investigators.
Now, two years and $30 million into the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and fearing that Mr. Mueller will stand on national television and declare that neither Donald J. Trump nor any member of his campaign have committed an impeachable offense, meaning "treason, bribery, and other high crimes or misdemeanors" according to the U.S. Constitution, Democrats are searching for anything they can use to help in the 2020 election cycle.
This should scare everyone because if you use the "shoe on the other foot" test, your party affiliation is irrelevant. The United States Congress should not be utilized to harass the citizens of this country, they work for us, not we them, right? The upcoming election cycle motto is impeach, impeach, impeach but to impeach a president, any president, and to ruin innocent American citizen’s lives because of hate and politics is wrong. Winning against Hillary is not a high crime or misdemeanor and talking to a Russian is not illegal and doesn’t constitute treason. Are we impeaching half of congress?
The 2016 election has exposed a few things that many people may not have been aware of including the idea that Washington D.C. is more corrupt than might have been thought before. Also, that many of our representatives believe they "know better" than we do and have a hubris about them that makes Narcissus look humble.
The Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS hearings proved it’s all theater, it’s not about truth. Trump’s election exposed this arrogance too, it didn’t start with him. How many of us remember lie after lie about "keep your doctor" and "Benghazi was the result of a video" and the smugness to never apologize when those lies were revealed? The Hillsboro Journal had a big article announcing that Senator Dick Durbin was having a meet and greet in Hillsboro on March 2, however, it was not open to the public and at least three people said they were told it was "invite only" when they tried to enter the venue, which proves yet again that no matter what the leftists say, walls work!
That’s arrogance! The sweeping probe by the House Democrats to obtain documents from 81 people is being used the exact same way, as a means of getting votes in 2020. Every one of us should stand against that sort of banana republic tactic no matter which party tries it.

Texto completo: The day before a Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off of Indonesia last year, killing all 189 people aboard, pilots struggled for control of the same aircraft but were saved by an off-duty pilot on the plane, a report says.
Lion Air Flight 610 slammed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, and a preliminary investigation has focused on a malfunctioning flight control system. Information from the cockpit voice recorder suggests the pilots of the doomed plane pored over a handbook trying to determine why the jet was lurching downward in the desperate moments before the crash, according to multiple media reports.
The day before, a different crew struggled with the same issue on the flight. The problem was correctly diagnosed by the "deadhead" pilot flying in a jump seat, Bloomberg reported, citing multiple sources familiar with Indonesia's investigation of the crash.
The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn’t contained in Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s report, according to Bloomberg.
“All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have been submitted to the Indonesian NTSC. We can’t provide additional comment at this stage due to the ongoing investigation on the accident,” Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro told Bloomberg.
According to a preliminary report issued last year, the first officer on board the doomed Lion Air flight reported a “flight control problem” to air traffic control two minutes after takeoff. Reuters reported Tuesday that it obtained the additional details, from the flight's voice recorder, via three investigation sources.
Less than five months after the Lion Air crash, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was minutes into a Nairobi-bound flight from Addis Ababa when it slammed into a field March 10. The pilot immediately noticed trouble as the plane accelerated wildly after takeoff. The planeoscillated up and down by hundreds of feet before the crash.
Investigators said they found similarities in the Boeing disasters. Both flights crashed after drastic speed fluctuations during ascent. Both pilots made ill-fated efforts to return to their airport of origin after takeoff.
The 371 Boeing 737 Max jets flown around the world have been grounded pending further investigation. Also hanging in the balance are orders for more than 4,500 of the hot-selling planes. Boeing said last week it "paused" deliveries of the 737 Max although production continues.
The flight control system, new to the 737 Max planes, was designed to keep planes from stalling. The FAA said it expects Boeing to complete Max 8 flight control system enhancements – prompted by the Lion Air crash – by month's end.
It is not clear when the the planes will get the international green light to fly again.
Records show that federal aviation authorities received at least 11 reports concerning perceived safety problems with the 737 Max aircraft before the crashes.
Two pilots reported their planes unexpectedly pitched nose down after they engaged autopilot following departure. Another pilot reported a “temporary level off” triggered by the aircraft automation. Another pilot called part of the aircraft’s flight manual “inadequate and almost criminally insufficient. ”
In an open letter Monday addressed to airlines, passengers and the aviation community, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said his company will soon release a software update and offer related pilot training for the 737 Max to “address concerns. ”
"The tragic losses of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 affect us all, uniting people and nations in shared grief for all those in mourning," the letter said. "Our hearts are heavy, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board. "

Use Scandal To Make College More Accessible

Texto completo: For most people trying to figure out how to send their kids to college, the bribery-laced admissions scandal recently revealed by the Department of Justice is sickening. But even more so, it is tragic.
The DOJ has secured indictments against an array of 1-percenters including CEOs and actors, along with some college coaches and administrators. The wealthy suspects are charged with paying up to $1.2 million to guarantee their kids’ acceptance into elite colleges.
Beyond the absurdity of it - the student beneficiaries already have advantages far beyond almost all other applicants - is that the slots secured through bribes are thus denied to students who might have gained them by merit.
A 2014 study by economists Alan Kreuger and Stacy Dale, cited in The New York Times analysis feature, the Upshot, found that admission to an elite college did nothing to alter the prospects for students already in position to succeed because of other factors.
Admission made a huge difference, however, to good students from poor families because the elite schools provided them with social capital to which they otherwise would not have access.
For a kid in the top 1 percent, social mobility isn’t dependent on being admitted to Yale. But for a smart kid from the bottom 20 percent, admission to an elite school could accelerate him up the ladder.
Yet, as a policy matter, the gravest concern about college admissions usually involves affirmative action programs that attempt to open opportunities to students for whom it would make the greatest difference.
Policymakers should use the scandal as a lens on the need to make college accessible and affordable.

THE LEGEND OF KITTY GENOVESE HER MURDER BECAME A TOUCHSTONE OF HER TIME, BUT HER STORY HAS NOT BEEN RELIABLY TOLD

Texto completo: It began with a lunch at a place called Emil's, not far from police headquarters in New York, and the trigger was a six-word sentence. "That Queens story," the police commissioner said to A.M. Rosenthal, then the metropolitan editor of The New York Times, "is something else."
It was something else, though in the Times it was something small - a four-paragraph story about the death 55 years ago this month of a Miss Catherine Genovese of 82-70 Austin St. Stories like that appeared in the newspaper every day, terrible murders that did not rate terribly much space, or terribly much attention. New York was a big, crowded city, and people got murdered there with sad and senseless regularity. Four paragraphs. Just one murder in a city in which 636 were committed that year.
But there was something different about this murder - not about the way that Kitty Genovese was killed: a hunting knife, following an attempted rape and a robbery - but about the circumstances of the crime. It occurred in front of witnesses, more than three dozen, according to legend, passive men and women who watched this drama unfold as if they were watching it through a pane of glass or, more likely, through a television screen.
They watched it begin, they watched it continue, they watched it end, goes the narrative that has entered history. And by the very passive act of watching - watching, and not acting - they became bit players in one of the signature crimes of the era. Bit players who soon would be swept to the center of the stage: witnesses so numbed by violence, or so disinterested in their neighbor, or so dismissive of their moral responsibilities, that they did nothing, and by doing nothing became the most important part of the drama.
That transformation occurred because Mr. Rosenthal, a hard-bitten onetime foreign correspondent with a sharp intellect that oftentimes was overcome by an almost febrile emotion - this man who inspired terror in colleagues and news sources and yet was a serial hugger and often was reduced to tears - saw a big story inside the small death of Kitty Genovese. Over the newsroom loudspeaker, he summoned Marty Gansberg and asked him to look into a story that his own staff had determined rated so little attention. The result shook New York and startled the world.
It also helped lead to the establishment of 911 emergency telephone numbers. It transformed the name Kitty Genovese from a noun into an adjective. It produced an image of New York - so sprawling that an individual human is subsumed, so dense that human instincts are suppressed, so violent that human life is devalued - that endured for years. It stained an entire neighborhood, then an entire city, then an entire generation. And it made the phrase "I didn't want to get involved," attributed to a neighbor in the Gansberg piece, a symbol of cold-hearted complacency that prevailed far beyond Kew Gardens.
The debate over Kitty Genovese has many dimensions, but one of them is the debate over what really happened. How many witnesses were there, really? (The narrative says 38, but there are many who say there were far fewer, and some who believe that some of the witnesses saw only part of the encounter, not an actual murder in the making.) Is it true that no witnesses reacted? (Kitty's brother argued that one woman tried to scare the attacker by bellowing from her window, and he suggested that calls were made to police.)
Then there were questions about what kind of people intervene and what kind of people simply watch. About whether the Genovese murder spawned an "era of apathy." About whether the Genovese murder and the Great Society Lyndon Johnson proposed two months later were twin products of the contemporary view that government, and not mere citizens, was responsible for civic functions that earlier were assumed by individuals. About whether the American instinct for risk-taking in commerce did not convey to risk-taking in the community.
Kitty Genovese was the oldest of five, the daughter of a man who operated a coat and apron supply company, a graduate of Prospect Heights High. She was a bartender at EV's 11th Hour tavern, kept the books there, oversaw the inventory. She listened to The Beatles, liked to dance, loved to laugh.
The killer was Winston Moseley, a father of two with a quiet, dark, desperate, craving side, which apparently was what took him, in his sporty Corvair, to the rendezvous that would change his life, end her life and give life to one of the most powerful urban myths in American life. He was given to stealing televisions, later admitted to eight rapes, more than three dozen burglaries and two other murders - and, once imprisoned at the Attica Correctional Facility, would escape on a hospital visit, rape another victim and hold hostages at gunpoint. He would also be involved in the 1971 Attica uprising.
Moseley's trial, ending with a death sentence, was part inquiry, part spectacle. He said that he didn't feel sorry for the crime, that he knew what he was doing, that after sexually assaulting her he took $49 from her wallet - and, pointedly, that he heard someone yelling from an open window so clearly that it frightened him. Later, he returned to the scene to stab Genovese in the throat to silence her cries.
But those cries were heard, contrary to legend and lesson. A man who lived seven floors above the crime scene testified that he heard a young woman say "Help me, help me" and then yelled, "Leave that girl alone!" (That interchange obliterates the say-nothing, do-nothing narrative.) Others testified they saw the incident, or heard it and went back to bed.
In a sense, what really happened is far less important than the reaction to flawed news stories. Because several important questions linger:
What is personal responsibility? What makes for community? Where do moral imperatives begin? Is personal responsibility inversely related to the number of people in a group? Does a broad sense that injustice is pervasive in society lead people to ignore their better instincts, even in the last 35 minutes of a young woman's life? And - this one cannot be ignored - can great truths be revealed in a story that itself is not entirely true?

Texto completo: The problem is more obvious than half a leech on the sneeze guard of a salad bar: we're paying much too much attention. Our national obsession with new news concerning the man blundering about the Oval Office has obscured any overview at all. He has the unique ability to blot out the big picture. Especially when standing sideways.
Every time we think we've hit rock bottom, another subbasement gets dug, hidden in a cloud of smoke and mirrors. Donald Trump hasn't just lowered the bar - he's buried it so deep you couldn't come close with a hydraulic excavator equipped with space-age sonar.
We still pour over his tweets like anthropologists dusting the bones of a calcified civilization, but the outrage is wearing off. After decades of press pimping and 17 months of campaigning and two years into his reign of error, the world is becoming numb to the president's dumpy trumpy trampy shenanigans.
It becomes routine. Every day, the White House is discovered to be involved in some dastardly situation. Either there's proof they did something they swore up and down they didn't do, or they get caught in an astonishing lie. Or somebody says something out loud that would have sunk a previous Administration so deep in a swamp of disgust they'd be found floating upside down like tropical fish after a week of not being fed.
It's a dance, and all the players know their part. The Smoky Hokey Pokey. We got ourselves a bad case of the deja voodoos.
First comes the shocking revelation. The hasty denials soon follow.
The New York Times trots out evidence that not only did this happen, but even more egregious stuff went down as well.
The official White House response - courtesy of Sarah Huckabee Sanders - is that it never happened, and even if it did, Barack Obama did way worse.
Democrats argue amongst themselves over whether the latest disclosure is an impeachable offense- coming to no conclusion.
Mitch McConnell makes turtle noises.
Donald Trump says he doesn't know the guy, can't remember what happened, everyone besides him is lying and that the revelation bolsters his claim there was "no collusion."
Some Republicans are outraged, then they aren't, then support the president.
The Washington Post needs three pages to print a graph that documents this sort of thing happened 18 gazillion times before.
Fox News hosts call for more hearings on Benghazi.
Some pundit on MSNBC becomes so overwrought a blood vessel in his head bursts on air.
Donald Trump's base laughs and laughs.
Rudy Giuliani says he doesn't believe it happened, and if it did, Hillary Clinton would have done way worse. And she's a woman.
Bernie Sanders supporters say this is further proof that Bernie would have won.
The National Enquirer prints a cover photo with Michelle Obama holding a bloody knife in front of what looks to be a pizza parlor.
Mike Pence says he doesn't know anything.
Snow falls. Or it doesn't.
And then, the very next day, it starts up all over again. This nation is stuck on a rollercoaster of spin with a minimum of two years before we can get off.
Strap on your seat belts extra tight, everybody. It's going to be a bumpy rest of a first term. Pass the Dramamine please.

O'Rourke packs house in Muscatine

Texto completo: It was supposed to be a quiet little thing. Or that's what the chairman of the Muscatine Democratic Party relayed to Randy Naber.
Naber, a retired teacher and on-again-off-again Muscatine school board member, had volunteered and organized with the party.
So on Tuesday, March 12, when the party called looking for a location for a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Naber, who that morning was still reading in bed, said, "You know what, I don't mind. I'll do it."
Fast-forward two days and Naber, having placed some hors d'oeuvres on the table, walked from his kitchen into the occupied foyer. Squeezing through a crowd of reporters from The Guardian, Austin American-Statesman, Muscatine Journal, and The New York Times, he was wide-eyed watching a TV anchor testing his mic — his forehead inches from shaking the glass tendrils of a chandelier. And spilling over the stair rail, videographers from CNN and MSNBC white-balanced their shots preparing to transmit live at thousands of kilowatts.
"It was supposed to be quiet," Naber said.
And it may well have been, but that morning Beto O'Rourke — after milking a discernment period — announced he was throwing his hat in the 2020 scrum for the White House.
"Hey everybody. What's going on?" O'Rourke said, entering Naber's front door. O'Rourke previously lost a high-profile race to unseat U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2018.
"This is the first day of our candidacy to run to serve you as the next president of the United States of America," O'Rourke said. "Given the problems that we are facing, we will not overcome them with only half the country, with only one party, with only some people that feel a certain way. ... We have to get past those divisions and find the common ground from which we can work for those things that we want to change and make better."
From the top of a wooden box supplied by a campaign aid, O'Rourke unpacked a few items common to 2020 platforms: universal health care, justice reform and climate change, but also issues like ending the prohibition of marijuana and expunging the arrest records of those imprisoned for crimes related to it.
"Though imperfect, sometimes frustrating, this democracy is the most effective system of government known to man," O'Rourke said. "We have the potential to call forth the genius of more that 320 million people to face every single one of these problems."
The first question was given to John Dabeet, a business professor at Muscatine Community College, who began with a hardball: What did O'Rourke make of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements about Israel being "the national state, not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people?"
Not missing a beat, O'Rourke said the United States needed to be involved in brokering a two-state solution.
"I'm the only one who asked about foreign policy, which is a very important issue to me," Dabeet said. "Really, I think he is very good in many areas domestically, but foreign policy-wise, I'm still a bit shaky on him."
Dabeet said it was a start.
"We will continue to connect with him and find out what he can do," Dabeet said.
Duffy De France, a retired librarian, said health care was a large mobilizing issue for her.
"Not everyone is lucky enough (to have health benefits)," De France said. "It's a life-or-death matter. He seems to know that."
Karen Cooney, a local retiree and volunteer with the Muscatine Democratic Party, said she'd seen a lot of politicians come and go.
"We had Hillary. We had John Kerry. We had Al Gore," Cooney said. "They all had that big-name stuff. They had the informed platform and a party behind them, and they were seasoned. And that still didn't make a difference."
"Obama, on the other hand," Cooney said, "He had something: intelligence, likability. That's what I'm seeing tonight."
But while she said his presence in the Nabers' living room was impressive, she wanted to see how his bid in a red state race translates to rural Iowa.
"In Iowa, we are talking about Joni Ernst voters. How are you going to grab those people?" Cooney said. "It's going to be similar to what you saw in Texas."
Tom Furlong, another local, said he liked what he saw.
"I think Beto is a very inspiring speaker," Furlong said. "He has a lot of enthusiasm, very knowledgeable. I would like to see him go into a little more depth on the solutions. But I suppose that will come as the campaign goes on."
With the national, state and local press having come and gone, some locals sat around happily munching charcuterie and cupcakes. All that was left of the evening were a couple of muddy footprints and forgotten iPhone charger.
Naber, who missed his bowling night to host the event, said O'Rourke was young, charismatic and a centrist.
"I think he will do just fine."

Will Dewan return to Fox's 'Resident' alive or dead?

Texto completo: Q: On "The Resident," Jenna Dewan was playing the representative of a medical company and starting to have a relationship with one of the doctors. She was run off the road by some thugs and we have not seen her since. Did she die or will she be back on the show?
A: Actress-dancer Dewan will be back in the Fox drama's March 25 episode. Fox says Devon (Manish Dayal), who had become attracted to Dewan's character, Julian Booth, will finally discover the truth about what happened to her. But we don't know if she is alive or dead, and Fox is keeping mum about that.
At the same time, if you want to see more of Dewan, she still makes occasional appearances on NBC's "World of Dance" (though she no longer hosts the show), is in the current movie anthology "Berlin, I Love You," and has a new series, "Mixtape," coming to Netflix.

Q: Recently the name Ferrante appeared in literature and television as the author of a very popular book. She claims to be a woman from Naples, Italy. But the personal details describing the characters, especially the men, make it obvious (to me) that the author is male, not female. Surely there must be others who have come forward with the same surmise.
A: There are. Elena Ferrante has written four connected, best-selling novels starting with "My Brilliant Friend," which inspired an HBO series. Because Ferrante writes under a pseudonym and shuns face-to-face interviews, there have been attempts to guess her real name and speculation about her gender.
A New York Times story in 2014 noted rumors "regularly recycled in the Italian press that she is the Italian novelist Domenico Starnone," which Starnone himself called a "groundless hypothesis." In written answers to interviewers' questions, Ferrante maintained she is female. She told Vanity Fair in 2015 that she stays out of the public eye "to liberate myself from the anxiety of notoriety."
Talking about claims that women writing certain kinds of stories must in fact be men, Ferrante said that women "know how to think, we know how to tell stories, we know how to write them as well as, if not better, than men." Still, guessing games went on. In 2016, the Times reported on new talk about an Italian professor possibly being Ferrante; denials followed. But at least the professor was a woman.

Q: Back in 2016 there was a short series about an alien invasion that primarily affected members of Congress. It was called "Braindead," starred Tony Shalhoub among others and was, at times, hilarious. Are there any plans to replay it any time soon? In view of the craziness that is currently surrounding our government, the timing would be very interesting.
A: "Braindead" indeed aired for 13 episodes on CBS from June to September 2016. I do not know of any plans for a repeat on the network. You can still find the episodes on the CBS All Access subscription streaming service, on Amazon Prime Video and on DVD.

Q: On reruns of "Perry Mason" I saw a series of episodes where Perry was in the hospital and guest stars took his place - Barry Sullivan and Bette Davis among them. Was Raymond Burr, who played Perry, sick for real?
A: Yes. Burr was quite outspoken about the strain of doing the series, and there were times during its run when he had health problems. Surgery (sources vary about what kind) and illness were responsible for fill-ins in several episodes, among them the ones you remember with Sullivan and Davis.

Doctor Resigns Over Graphic Posts That Mocked Transgender Patients

Texto completo: A well-known Florida surgeon who specializes in transgender health care has resigned from his position at the University of Miami amid an uproar over pictures he posted on Instagram that showed surgical procedures and patients' genitals alongside captions and hashtags that mocked transgender people and Asians.
The surgeon, Dr. Christopher Salgado, 50, worked at the L.G.B.T.Q. Center for Wellness, Gender and Sexual Health at the University of Miami Health System until last month. Interspersed with photos of himself smiling with friends and colleagues, he posted images and text on his Instagram account, @sexsurgeon, that many people found disturbing. He deleted the account last month.
One post showed a CT scan of a patient with a sex toy in his rectum next to a photograph of a surgeon holding the toy after it had been retrieved, while the patient lay on a nearby table with his legs in the air. Another post showed human tissue molded into the shape of a heart alongside the message, "There are many ways to show your LOVE." At least one other post had hashtags mocking Asian men's genitals.
In an emotional interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Dr. Salgado defended the posts. But he said many of them had been misunderstood and he claimed not to have written many of the hashtags, which he said he suspected were the work of hackers. He said he regretted joining Instagram a few months ago at the urging of a friend.
"It was a bad decision to even open an Instagram account, looking at it now," he said. "The purpose really was to be educational with it, but it went awry."
Dr. Salgado said he deleted his account on Feb. 16, after complaints from a user who he suspects tipped off L.G.B.T. news outlets to his posts. That user also complained to the university, he said, and he was told that he would be suspended while an investigation was conducted.
He thought administrators had prejudged him, he said, so he resigned via email.
Last week, the online magazine Trans Advocate published the first article about the doctor's social media activity. The magazine reported that his Instagram posts had been shared in several Facebook groups devoted to transgender medical care and that people quickly became alarmed by the graphic images and mocking captions.
"One expects a certain level of professionalism and decorum from medical professionals, and it's hard to imagine what Salgado was thinking when he made these posts," wrote Noah Adams, the author of the Trans Advocate piece.
A petition demanding action from the American College of Surgeons and the Florida Board of Medicine was soon posted online. A spokesman for the Florida Department of Health said the agency could not comment on a practitioner until 10 days after probable cause of wrongdoing was found. The American College of Surgeons said that it was not a national governing body for American surgeons and that many surgeons, including Dr. Salgado, are not members.
"Beyond Dr. Salgado's blatant disrespect for trans people, his public vulgarity, lack of professionalism, and questionable ethics around patient privacy must be immediately addressed," the petitioners wrote.
Dr. Salgado defended himself on Wednesday, saying that he had "devoted a lot of time to this patient population." He said he could now see that some of his posts were in poor taste, but emphasized that his goal had been to raise awareness.
"Yeah, these are patients' genitals, but it was teaching," he said. "It was basically educational: This is how we do this transformation. I felt like it really was educational."
The doctor said he did not write some of the hashtags, including some that were sexually graphic. He said that he suspected hackers' involvement and that he had received an email (which he ignored and then deleted) from Instagram last month warning that someone had logged into his account from Turkey.
He added that some of the posts had been misunderstood. Some pictures, he said, were uncredited images from other sources that had been mistakenly attributed to him, including the picture of the sex toy. Others, like the heart-shaped human tissue, had been misconstrued by nonmedical audiences, he said.
"That post was a dermal thigh graft, but they said it was a penis," he said, referring to other news articles about his posts. "I probably put the hashtag penis on it, but it wasn't a penis. It was a specimen."
But he acknowledged that he did write some of the inflammatory hashtags, including several about Asian men beneath an image explaining the medical condition of micropenis.
"I put that there were options for fixing micropenis, then I put the hashtag Asian penis," he said. "That was probably in poor taste, but it was mine."
The doctor said he thought his posts did not violate anyone's privacy because patients at the university hospital give their consent for non-identifying pictures to be used in publications, news media and conference presentations. A university spokeswoman did not respond to a message on Wednesday asking to confirm its policy.
"I don't think any of that even applies because there are no patient identifiers, so no one is going to come and say, 'Oh that is my neo-clitoris,"' Dr. Salgado said, using the term for a surgically constructed clitoris.
He added: "I was using no patient identifiers and no hospital identifiers, so you can't tell who the patients are, what the hospitals are. You can't even tell who is who."
He thought the hashtags were his downfall, he said.
"The hashtags were what people found the most offensive," Dr. Salgado said. "It doesn't seem like it is related to the content that much because it was meant to be educational. But once the hashtags were added it became different."
Lisa Worley, a spokeswoman for the University of Miami Health System, confirmed in a statement that the university no longer employed Dr. Salgado. She focused on the language used on his Instagram page and did not mention any potential privacy concerns.
"The University of Miami is committed to promoting and supporting diversity in its students, faculty, and staff and finds any transphobic comments unacceptable," she said. "As health care providers, we continue to have a team of experts dedicated to delivering the full continuum of care for gender reassignment patients."

Texto completo: Stocks indexes barely budged on Wall Street Thursday as the market's three-day winning streak stalled.
The benchmark S&P 500 index finished essentially flat as losses in communications, industrial and health care stocks outweighed gains in financial and technology companies. Several retailers and homebuilders also declined.
Reports of a criminal investigation into Facebook's data-sharing practices weighed on the social media giant's shares.
The market was coming off a solid three-day rally as it reclaimed some of the momentum it had in January and February.
Investors are still waiting for more news on trade negotiations between the United States and China before they feel comfortable pushing the market much higher. Media reports had stoked hope that a summit would take place this month, but no concrete announcement has been made.
The S&P 500 index slipped 2.44 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,808.48. The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 7.05 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,709.94. The Nasdaq composite dropped 12.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,630.91.
Take-Two Interactive Software led the slide in communications companies. The stock tumbled 3.8 percent.
Facebook dropped 1.8 percent after The New York Times reported that its data-sharing practices are now under criminal investigation. The investigation into how it sells data is the latest in a list of privacy scandals that the social media giant is tangled in. Its privacy practices have already been scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission. The company and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have also faced congressional inquiries.
Boeing sank 1 percent. The stock has slumped throughout the week as nations and airlines ground its newest 737s over safety concerns. A second deadly crash over the weekend involving its 737 Max 8 and safety concerns stunted the aerospace company's stock gains.
Retailers were among the big decliners Thursday. Tailored Brands, which owns Men's Wearhouse, plummeted 25.1 percent after giving investors a surprisingly weak first-quarter profit forecast. The company has been trying to increase sales at both Men's Wearhouse and its Jos. A. Bank stores, but is facing a tougher retail market.
Shares in other apparel retailers also fell. L Brands dropped 3.1 percent, while Gap gave up 1.8 percent.
Dollar General slid 7.5 percent after the company's fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The discount-store operator also gave investors a weak full-year profit forecast. Rival discount chain Dollar Tree sank 1.9 percent.
The Commerce Department said sales of new homes nationwide slumped 6.9 percent in January, a possible sign that would-be buyers paused during the government shutdown even as mortgage rates continued to decline. The report also showed that sales prices fell 3.8 percent.
Homebuilder stocks were mostly trading lower following the report. Hovnanian Enterprises dropped 2.5 percent.
Technology companies and banks led the gainers. Apple rose 1.1 percent and Wells Fargo added 0.9 percent.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.63 percent from 2.61 percent late Wednesday.
The dollar strengthened to 111.73 Japanese yen from 111.05 yen on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.1300 from $1.1329.
The price of United States crude oil rose 0.6 percent to settle at $58.61 a barrel, while Brent crude dropped 0.5 percent to close at $67.23 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline declined 0.4 percent to $1.85 a gallon, heating oil slid 0.4 percent to $1.98 a gallon, and natural gas picked up 1.2 percent to $2.86 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The price of gold fell 1.1 percent to $1,295.10 an ounce, silver dropped 1.8 percent to $15.17 an ounce and copper lost 1.5 percent to $2.89 a pound.

Texto completo: Facebook said it quickly removed videos of a gunman opening fire inside a New Zealand mosque on Friday who appeared to have live-streamed his attack in a 17-minute video that looked to be recorded on a helmet camera.
The Facebook video began with the man driving up to Masjid Al Noor mosque in the city of Christchurch. After parking his car, the man armed himself with at least one weapon and walked into the place of worship, immediately shooting a person in the doorway.
In a statement posted to Twitter, Facebook said police alerted them to the video shortly after the livestream commenced and removed both the video and the gunman's Facebook and Instagram accounts.
"We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware," Facebook said. The social network said they will continue working with police in New Zealand as their investigation is underway.
Google-owned YouTube said in a statement on Twitter that it is "working vigilantly" to remove any violent footage. "Our hearts are broken over today’s terrible tragedy in New Zealand," said YouTube in its statement.
In statements to the Washington Post, Twitter and Reddit said they were working to remove any videos from their platforms.
In a more than 70-page manifesto posted to various sites, including Twitter and Scribd, that appeared to belong to the gunman, he identified himself as a 28-year-old white male born in Australia and listed white nationalist heroes.
In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Friday that an Australian citizen had been arrested in the mosque shootings.

The names of mass killers were written in white on his weapons, multiple media outlets reported.
The New Zealand Herald, which watched the live-stream video, reported that the gunman "began shooting indiscriminately" upon entering the mosque.
He shot a second victim who was crawling in the main hallway, then blocked the hallway and began shooting at people who were cowering in corners of a room. He stopped to reload several times, the Herald reported, and then resumed firing repeatedly.
After three minutes inside, the gunman exited through the mosque's front door. Video showed him shooting randomly at cars. He got more ammunition out of his car trunk, the Herald reported, then shot at no apparent target on the street.
"Looks like we won't get the bird today, boys," he said in the video.
At another point, he said, “There wasn’t even time to aim, there was so many targets,” the New York Times reported.
He then re-entered the mosque, firing at people lying motionless on the ground. The video ended with him driving away from the scene, the Herald reported.

Texto completo: Headnote Featuring West Coast premieres of "Lazurus" and "Kairos" as well the Los Angeles premiere of "The Call
Sentinel News Service
The Music Center welcomes one of America's most popular dance companies, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, back to Los Angeles with the dance company's 60th anniversary celebration tour at The Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from April 3-7, 2019. Led by artistic director Robert Battle, Ailey's remarkable dancers - including Danica Paulos of Huntington Beach and rehearsal director and guest artist Matthew Rushing of Los Angeles, who has been with the company for more than 25 years - will perform four different programs of diverse repertory featuring West Coast premieres, new productions and returning classics. Part of the 2018/2019 season of Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at The Music Center, which is curated by The Music Center's artistic division The Music Center Arts (TMC Arts), the engagement includes four special programs: "Trailblazers," featuring the West Coast premiere of "Lazarus" by Rennie Harris - the company's first two-act ballet; "Bold Visions," featuring West Coast premiere of Wayne McGregor's
"Kairos" and the Los Angeles premiere of "The Call" by Ronald K. Brown, alongside Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's "Shelter"; a Timeless Ailey program with rarely seen gems by one of America's greatest cultural leaders; and a musical inspirations program featuring the Los Angeles premiere of Ailey star Jamar Roberts' "Members Don't Get Weary," a new production of Robert Battle's "Juba," and his tourde-force duet, Ella.
Each of the four programs will feature Ailey's American masterpiece "Revelations." Since its creation in 1960, "Revelations" has been seen by more audiences around the world than any other modern work, inspiring generations through its powerful storytelling and soul-stirring spirituals. Springing from Ailey's childhood memories of growing up in the South and attending services at Mount Olive Baptist Church in Texas, "Revelations" pays homage to the rich African American cultural heritage and explores the emotional spectrum of the human condition.
"Given our commitment to both excellence and relevance, it is an honor for TMC Arts to welcome the return of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater to The Music Center for the company's 60th anniversary celebration," said Rachel Moore, president and CEO of The Music Center. "It's no wonder that Angelenos have a strong affinity for Ailey. The company is a national treasure and a vital cultural institution that reveals our shared humanity through the power of dance. Ailey's legacy transcends cultural boundaries and reminds us of a universal sense of connectedness that will uplift and inspire for many generations to come."
"Alvin Ailey forever changed the American landscape by raising up the lives and cultural heritage of African Americans for all to see, opening the hearts and minds of people of every background and elevating the world of the performing arts," said Robert Battle. "During this milestone season, we are thrilled to return to Los Angeles, the city that was home to Mr. Ailey for many years, and where he fell in love with dance and launched his career. We honor Alvin Ailey's storied legacy with performances across North America, educational programs that enlighten young people and develop the next generation of performing artists. What Mr. Ailey gave us is more than a repertory and a tradition. It is a movement, a direction, a desire, a conviction that if the spirit is to live it must rise. We dedicate our 60th anniversary to the next ascent."
Audiences will experience Ailey's first ever twoact work with the West Coast premiere of Rennie Harris' "Lazarus." Inspired by the life and legacy of Alvin Ailey, and addressing the racial inequities America faced in 1958, when the company was founded and which continue to challenge today, "Lazarus" is an ensemble work featuring a soundtrack that melds Nina Simone, Terrence Trent D'Arby, Michael Kiwanuka, Odetta, original music by Darrin Ross, and the voice of Alvin Ailey. The New York Times said, "... Mr. Harris gives us something like heaven," and "... the style has a spiritual force that's uplifting, and the pleasure of it is mixed with a revelation of the past in the present, of Black history in the body language."
Wayne McGregor's "Kairos," the second piece the choreographer set on the company following "Chroma" in 2013, is performed to a reimagined Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons" by experimental composer Max Richter in the "Bold Visions" program. The dance enthusiast described the company's performance of "Kairos" as "the dancers of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater stay true to Wayne McGregor's intellectual brilliance without sacrificing the trademark spirituality of Ailey." The Music Center opened its current season of Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at The Music Center with Company Wayne McGregor/Autobiography and will again present McGregor's work during its upcoming presentation of "Ade's & McGregor: A Dance Collaboration" this coming July. Richter was at the helm of another Music Center presentation, "The Music Center Presents Max Richter's SLEEP," this past summer in Grand Park.
Ronald K. Brown's seventh work for Ailey, "The Call," will make its Los Angeles premiere at The Music Center and is included in the Bold Visions program. Brown, a 2018 Dance Magazine Award recipient, describes the work, which seamlessly blends modern and West African dance idioms, as "a love letter to Mr. Ailey." The music includes Johann Sebastian Bach (recorded by Chris Thile, Edgar Meyere & YoYo Ma), Mary Lou Williams Trio, and Asase Yaa. Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's "Shelter," a passionate statement about the physical, is also featured on the Bold Visions program.
The Music Center Celebrate Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre's 60th Anniversary Honoring Ailey's 60th anniversary, the company will showcase "Timeless Ailey," a program that brings treasures by the company's iconic founder back to the stage. Excerpts from rarely seen gems, including "Blues Suite," "Streams," "Mary Lou's Mass," "The Lark Ascending," "Hidden Rites," "Phases," "Opus McShann," "Pas de Duke," and "For 'Bird' -With Love," will be joined by perennial favorites such as Memoria, Night Creature, and Cry.
The Musical Inspirations program includes Robert Battle's first work for the company, "Juba" (2003), a quartet with a score by frequent collaborator John Mackey; Ailey dancer and 2016 "Bessie" Award recipient" Jamar Roberts' first work for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, "Members Don't Get Weary," set to the powerful music of the legendary American jazz saxophonist and composer, John Coltrane; and Ella, a high- energy comical dance originally created as a solo and reinvented as a duet in anticipation of the legendary singer, Ella Fitzgerald's centennial in April 2017.
One hour prior to each performance, The Music Center will host DANCETALKS featuring interviews with Ailey company members. Ticketed guests can join this fascinating behind-the-scenes pre-performance discussion and also have the opportunity to learn a segment from the famed Ailey masterpiece "Revelations."

Texto completo: Facebook faces a federal criminal investigation into consumer data sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung, according to The New York Times.
At least two major companies that make smartphones and other devices have been subpoenaed by a grand jury in New York seeking records from the firms, the Times reported, citing two people familiar with the situation.
The two unnamed companies were among more than 150 companies that had sharing deals with Facebook, reported by the Times in December 2019. Those deals gave companies greater access to its users' data, sometimes without the user's permission, according to the Times. Examples of the data sharing included letting Netflix and Spotify read a user's private messages and allowing Amazon to gather names and contact information.

An earlier report from the Times in June 2018 – denied by Facebook – charged that the social network had allowed companies such as Apple and Samsung access to users' friends without explicit consent.
Facebook issued a statement on Twitter late Wednesday acknowledging it has been cooperating with "ongoing federal investigations," including those by the Justice Department. "We've provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged that we'll continue to do so. "
The focus of the grand jury, conducted by the U. S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, is not known, according to the Times.
Facebook already is being investigated by several federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission about U. K. -based Cambridge Analytica's improper acquisition and possible misuse of personal data of as many as 87 million users.
The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating whether that scandal resulted in Facebook violating a 2011 consent decree reached with the FTC barring the social networking giant from misrepresenting the privacy or security protections of consumers' personal information and required it to ask users before any changes that overrode privacy preferences.
The Cambridge Analytica scandal has also attracted the attention of the Justice Department, including special counsel Robert Mueller's charging 13 Russians and three companies in February 2018 with using social media and other efforts to subvert the 2016 presidential election.
The Eastern District would comment on the report.
Facebook has attempted to weather the growing concerns about privacy on its platform and social media. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a multiyear plan to increase privacy on the social network, as well as its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms.
Then on Wednesday, Facebook suffered its largest-ever outage, as the social network and Instagram went down for most of the day across the globe and on Thursday continued to fully restore operations.

Texto completo: Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports. The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
It is unknown if the list of 125 stories includes any in the Southern Tier.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store.
The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.
Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market.
On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102.6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3.1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores — including ones in Binghamton, Vestal, Horseheads and Ithaca — along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores (including one in Big Flats), according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown Business Council for gun safety.
Dick's announced it will remove firearms from 125 of its sporting goods stores.

Texto completo: Before he pleaded guilty and began assisting federal prosecutors last summer, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former fixer, spoke with a lawyer who agreed to reach out to the president's legal team on his behalf.
The lawyer, Robert J. Costello, had about a dozen conversations with Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, according to emails and documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with people involved in the matter. In one email, the discussions were characterized as a "back channel of communication."
During one of the conversations last April, Mr. Costello said in an interview, he asked whether Mr. Trump might put a pardon "on the table" for Mr. Cohen, who was under federal investigation for a variety of possible crimes, including arranging hush-money payments to two women who had said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani told Mr. Costello that the president was unwilling to discuss pardons at that time, Mr. Costello said in the interview, and they did not discuss it again.
Now federal prosecutors have requested the emails and documents from Mr. Costello, according to a copy of the request, which cited an investigation into "possible violations of federal criminal law" but offered no further detail. The request, sent last week, was for any documents related to Mr. Cohen as well as any bills Mr. Costello had sent him.
In one of the emails, sent by Mr. Costello in April 2018 after a conversation with Mr. Giuliani, he assured Mr. Cohen, "Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places." He added, in a postscript: "Some very positive comments about you from the White House. Rudy noted how that followed my chat with him last night."
A spokesman for the federal prosecutors, from the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to comment.
There was no indication that prosecutors suspected Mr. Costello of wrongdoing, and the focus of their inquiry is not clear.
Before calling Mr. Giuliani to ask about a pardon, Mr. Costello -- a former federal prosecutor who had worked with Mr. Giuliani -- warned Mr. Cohen that it was premature to broach the subject, but raised it anyway, he said Wednesday.
"He got a little annoyed," Mr. Costello said, referring to Mr. Giuliani, his friend for decades. "I got the message. You only have to tell me once, Rudy."
Mr. Giuliani insisted Wednesday that the discussions had primarily been about Mr. Cohen's concerns that Mr. Trump "was very mad at him" and the fact that the investigation into Mr. Cohen had been assigned to the Manhattan prosecutors. Speaking by telephone, Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Costello and others in touch with Mr. Cohen had described him at the time as deeply distressed.
Last month, Mr. Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee in closed-door testimony about his dealings with Mr. Costello, which took place between April and July of last year, before he was charged with any crimes, according to two people familiar with his testimony.
He told the committee that Mr. Costello had raised the concept of a "pre-pardon" in his discussions with Mr. Cohen, the people said. In his public testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, however, Mr. Cohen did not mention conversations about a pardon, and insisted he had never sought one from Mr. Trump.
By late last summer, after Mr. Giuliani had publicly discussed aspects of the case related to Mr. Cohen and the Trump organization had balked at paying some of his legal fees, Mr. Cohen had taken a new approach to his legal difficulties: turning on Mr. Trump and speaking with federal prosecutors and with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.
In August, he pleaded guilty to an array of crimes, including arranging the hush-money payments. And in testimony to Congress last month, he described Mr. Trump as a con man and a cheat, and said he was "ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts." He is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison term in May.
Less than a year ago, Mr. Cohen remained firmly entrenched in the Trump camp, and his extensive exchange with Mr. Costello suggested that he -- and they -- expected things would turn out differently.
In an email sent the day Mr. Giuliani was named as Mr. Trump's lawyer, Mr. Costello told Mr. Cohen, "I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team." He added that he had told Mr. Cohen about his "relationship with Rudy, which could be very very useful for you." Mr. Cohen wrote back, in part saying, "Great news."
Within a day, Mr. Costello spoke by phone with Mr. Giuliani to tell him that Mr. Cohen was planning to hire Mr. Costello's law firm. Soon after that call, Mr. Costello emailed Mr. Cohen to say, "Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you," noting that Mr. Giuliani knew and trusted Mr. Costello. Mr. Giuliani, he added, "said thank you for opening this back channel of communication."
Later the same weekend, Mr. Costello sent the email about "friends in high places." Those two emails were first reported by CNN.
The Times reported last week that Mr. Cohen had described to the prosecutors how Mr. Costello had spoken with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Costello declined to comment at the time, citing attorney-client privilege, but has since learned that Mr. Cohen waived the privilege, freeing him to discuss his experience with Mr. Cohen.
In the interview, Mr. Costello accused Mr. Cohen of smearing him to the prosecutors as part of a bid to reduce his sentence. He also said that Mr. Cohen repeatedly told him that he had committed no crimes and misled Mr. Costello's law firm about his intentions to hire them.
"Cohen lied to us from day one," Mr. Costello said, adding that neither he nor Mr. Giuliani dangled a pardon in front of Mr. Cohen.
A lawyer for Mr. Cohen, Lanny J. Davis, said he could not comment on the documents requested by prosecutors, but suggested it was "impossible to deny or try to spin your way out of what documents say." He added that Mr. Cohen had clarified his testimony about pardons in a letter to the House committee this week, and that Mr. Cohen stood by his statement to the committee about not having sought a pardon. Mr. Davis said after the testimony that Mr. Cohen had inquired about Mr. Trump's intentions after the president's legal team "dangled" the possibility of pardons.
In an email sent to Mr. Cohen on June 13, Mr. Costello suggested Mr. Giuliani was about to speak with the president, "his client," and asked if he had a message to convey.
"Michael, Since you jumped off the phone rather abruptly, I did not get a chance to tell you that my friend has communicated to tell me that he is meeting with his client this evening and he added that if there was anything you wanted to convey you should tell me and my friend will bring it up for discussion this evening. I would suggest that you give this invitation some real thought."

Texto completo: "The Good Fight" returns on CBS All Access. And Hirokazu Kore-eda's "Shoplifters" hits Hulu.
What's Streaming
THE GOOD FIGHT on CBS All Access. If you're looking for escapist fantasy, look elsewhere. But if you want an uncommonly topical legal drama with a great title sequence, look here. The previous season of this spinoff of "The Good Wife" went all in with its fictional portrayal of America under President Trump, incorporating into its plot talk of a relationship between the president and a porn star and whispers of Democrat-led impeachment proceedings. The show follows Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a high-powered, white Chicago lawyer at a chiefly African-American firm. The second season ended with a birth. The new season introduces a corrupt, fact-averse lawyer played by Michael Sheen.
SHOPLIFTERS (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "I don't portray people or make movies where viewers can easily find hope," the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda told The New York Times. That audacious hopelessness is on full display in this, his most recent feature, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018. The story revolves around a family of shoplifters who take in a girl (Miyu Sasaki), saving her from abusive parents. It is the first of many morally complex scenes this movie delivers. Our questioning of the family's morals increases as we get a fuller picture: Midway through the film, the plot "no longer seems to hold much mystery," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "But it's at this point where other mysteries take over and where 'Shoplifters' deepens, opening up a story about a family with a declaration of moral principles and lifting what had been a good movie into greatness."
WILL SMITH'S BUCKET LIST Stream on Facebook Watch. It's easy to see why Will Smith signed on to do this web series: The premise is to follow the actor as he goes on brief, somewhat frightening but extremely fun-looking excursions, crossing items off his bucket list. The first two episodes have followed Smith skydiving and sea diving. The latest one has him doing stand-up comedy, which Smith describes as "the hardest thing in entertainment." Luckily, he has a good coach in Dave Chappelle, who appears here and advises Smith that, in comedy, "confidence is key." Chappelle introduces the nervous-looking but staggeringly famous Smith to an audience near the end of the episode with the line, "Make some noise for what's-his-face."
What's on TV
SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) 9 p.m. on Syfy. Snakes slithering through a rib cage capture the tone of this Tim Burton film that adapts the Washington Irving story. Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, Irving's pencil-thin schoolteacher who is here reimagined as a late-18th-century New York City policeman sent to investigate a string of murders upstate. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin called the film "enthusiastically bleak."

How to find out if your flight is a grounded Boeing Max 8 or 9 airplane

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.
Travelers who need to check flight status and aircraft type can do so a couple of ways. First, check your ticket to determine the aircraft type. It’s often listed as “equipment.”
Flight tracking websites also can help determine what’s flying at any given moment. For example, FlightAware.com shows United 1117, operating a Boeing 737 Max 9, is due to land at LAX by 2:22 p.m. The site said the flight, with the aircraft type listed as “B39M,” is running 8 minutes late. Two other Max 9 aircraft (United 2373 and 417) and were heading to the Hawaiian islands from LAX.
A more generic search for the Max 8 aircraft (listed as aircraft type B38M) shows dozens of the twin-jet airplanes in the sky worldwide.
The travel website kayak.com told MarketWatch it would begin including aircraft type.
If you want to switch flights based on the assigned aircraft, be warned: That will most often come with steep flight-change fees.
Trump’s order to ground the two aircraft types came hours after Canada’s transport minister said newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Trump’s announcement, the FAA also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets, the New York Times reported.

Trump ordena suspender vuelos de Boeing 737 como el que se estrelló en Etiopía

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo que firmará una orden de emergencia para aterrizar todos los vuelos de aviones Boeing 737 Max 8 y 737 Max 9 de las aerolíneas estadounidenses.
De este modo, cualquier avión similar al que se estrelló en Etiopía que actualmente se encuentre en el aire irá a su destino y se mantendrá en tierra hasta nuevo aviso.
“Esos aviones serán aterrizados de inmediato “, dijo Trump en la Casa Blanca. “La seguridad es nuestra principal preocupación” .
Estados Unidos fue la única nación que pilotea aviones Boeing 737, después de que Canadá anunció el miércoles que estaba aterrizando dichas naves. Esta decisión afectaría, aún indeterminadamente, vuelos programados.
La Unión Europea y varios países ya habían tomado la decisión el fin de semana de retirar las aeronaves mencionadas, pero el CEO del fabricante de aviones buscaba evitar que el presidente Trump tomada una decisión similar, luego del siniestro con una aeronave de de Ethiopian Airlines.
Dennis Muilenburg , director ejecutivo de Boeing, con sede en Chicago, habló con el presidente Trump por teléfono el martes por la mañana para evitar que sus aviones fueran retirados, informó The New York Times.
El Times citó a dos personas familiarizadas con la llamada, sobre lo cual Muilenburg afirmó que expresó al mandatario estadounidense que las aeronaves eran seguras.
Desde el fin de semana, el valor de las acciones de Boeing se han desplomado y se espera que bajen más tras el anuncio del presidente Trump.
El martes, el presidente Trump abogó por aviones “más simples”, pero no habló de suspender las operaciones de los Boeing.
“Los aviones se están volviendo demasiado difíciles para volar. Ya no se necesitan pilotos, sino científicos informáticos del MIT”, dijo en su cuenta en Twitter, en referencia al Instituto de Tecnología de Massachusetts. “Lo he visto todo el tiempo con varios productos… siempre buscando pasos innecesarios…”
Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
“Las decisiones en décimas de segundo son necesarias y la complejidad crea peligro. Todo esto por un gran costo pero muy pocos beneficios. No sé tú, pero yo no quiero que Albert Einstein sea mi piloto. ¡Quiero excelentes profesionales de vuelo que puedan tomar el control de un avión de forma fácil y rápida!”, afirmó.
….needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
El siniestro en Etiopía murieron 157 personas; se reportó que las víctimas son de al menos 35 nacionalidades, incluyendo al menos un estadounidense y 18 canadienses, algunos de los cuales viajaban a ese país a buscar sus orígenes, ya que sus familiares migraron a Estados Unidos hace varios años.

Texto completo: Marc Mathieu, chief marketing officer for Samsung Electronics America Inc., has left the company.
"Marc has left Samsung Electronics America to pursue opportunities outside of the company," said a Samsung spokeswoman in an email. "Marc was a valued leader who made significant contributions during his tenure at Samsung. We thank him for his time and efforts, and wish him the best in his future endeavors."
Mr. Mathieu, a seasoned marketer who has served in senior roles at Unilever PLC and the Coca-Cola Co., may be best known for helping Samsung through its exploding battery crisis several years ago. He's also known for unique marketing deals, such as a partnership with the New York Times that included the distribution of Samsung "360" cameras to hundreds of Times reporters.
The company hasn't released any other details about Mr. Mathieu's departure or his replacement at this time.
"Samsung has truly unlocked the power of technology for me and taught me how it can enhance peoples' daily lives and the greater good of humanity," Mr. Mathieu told The Wall Street Journal. "I have been privileged to lead a talented team of marketers, which has led to incredible brand growth during my tenure at the company."
Samsung, one of the world's biggest marketers, spent around $4.8 billion on advertising in 2017, according to estimates from Ad Age.
The largest seller of smartphones by market share, Samsung unveiled a line of new products in February , including the industry's first mainstream foldable-screen smartphone.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden told a senior Democratic lawmaker he will run for president in 2020, The Hill reported Tuesday.
The congressman, who remained anonymous in the story, told the political website that Biden said he is "giving it a shot" during a phone call last week.
The lawmaker interpreted this as a sign that Biden will be running for president, The Hill reported.
During this brief phone call, Biden asked the lawmaker if he "could bounce some campaign strategy ideas off the lawmaker and invited the lawmaker to sit down with him in person in the near future," The Hill reported.
Biden said he and his wife Jill had just gotten back from a vacation in St. Croix in the Caribbean, according to the Hill. The Associated Press has reported that the Bidens discussed potential dangers of running for president during this trip.
Spokesman Bill Russo told The Hill that Biden has "not made a final decision" regarding a run for president.
This comes one day after Delaware U.S. Sen. Chris Coons said on "CBS This Morning" that he is "confident" Joe Biden is going to run for president and provided some insight into how the former vice president will run his 2020 campaign.
"I'm optimistic he's going to run," Coons, Delaware's junior senator, said on CBS This Morning. "Everything is put in place but that last decision, which understandingly is a big decision."
On Tuesday morning, Biden addressed an enthusiastic gathering of union firefighters in Washington, D.C., to chants of "Run, Joe, run," news outlets reported.
Biden again declined to make any official announcement, but told the crowd at the International Association of Firefighters gathering to save their energy, because "I may need it in a few weeks," the Associated Press reported.
Biden covered a number of potential campaign themes, the AP noted, including criticizing Trump and Republicans on policies he said favored the wealthy, and warning of divisiveness in politics.
Speculation surrounding Biden announcing his campaign for president has grown in the past week. The New York Times reported last week that Biden's strategist Steve Ricchetti was telling Democrats the former vice president was 95 percent of the way toward deciding to run.
Announcements of members of Biden's inner circle, including daughter Ashley, leaving their jobs last week, also fueled rumors.
Biden is also leading in the polls, despite not being an official presidential candidate. The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found that 27 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers say Biden is their first choice for president.
While this is a decrease from 32 percent in December, he's still ahead of the 19 other declared and potential candidates tested, the poll found.

Guac and the meaning of life When we last left Pastor Dave Jahn of Advent Lutheran Church, he was offering drive-through blessings for motorcyclists. The eclectic Jahn is back this time to discuss "The Big Questions" in front of a nice bowl of salsa at a Mexican restaurant.
Jahn will lead a no-holds-barred discussion of faith's gnarly issues during weekly sessions at 7:30 p.m., March 13 to April 10 at Fiesta Azteca, 6765 N. Wickham Road, Suntree. He is using the guac and the chips to more comfortably and casually engage with believers, non-believers and seekers.
"Compared to all that there is to know, even the most brilliant among us knows nothing, so we need to begin every discussion with humility and openness," he said.
The Lutheran minister has been an open-minded student of the mysterious and sacred, scientific and secular, for more than 50 years and is the author of "Faith on the Edge of the Universe."
For more information, call 321-259-8515 or visit AdventBrevard.org.

Texto completo: Howard Stern is poised to hit the bestseller lists again.
More than 20 years after the publication of "Private Parts" and "Miss America," the radio shock jock has written another book.
Simon & Schuster announced Tuesday that it will publish "Howard Stern Comes Again," by the talk show host who was raised in Roosevelt and Rockville Centre. It goes on sale May 14 and was already No. One, based on preorders, on Amazon Tuesday morning.
Simon & Schuster released the cover of the new book - Stern, 65, appears clothed, thank you very much - but revealed little about the contents except to claim that it was "worth the wait." Publisher Jonathan Karp said he had waited two years for Stern to deliver the manuscript.
Stern's literary debut, "Private Parts," was a massive bestseller when it was released in 1993, selling out its first printing of 250,000 within a couple of hours, according to S&S. As Newsday reported the day after the book's release, at least 10,000 fans showed up for a signing at a Barnes & Noble in midtown Manhattan; the crowd "made Fifth Avenue look like the Long Island Expressway at rush hour."
"Private Parts" spent 20 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list and became a hit 1997 movie starring Stern as himself.
A publicist would not say if any Long Island appearances were scheduled for Stern's book tour.

Texto completo: Doug Mills, a staff photographer for The Times, has been covering the White House since 1983. He spoke with James Estrin this week about photographing President Trump after he returned from covering the Hanoi summit with Kim Jong-un. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Q. How much time do you usually have when you photograph the president?
A. With previous administrations, going back to Reagan, you were in a cabinet room for maybe two or three or four minutes. With Trump you can be in there up to 90 minutes.
What does that mean photographically?
Sometimes you feel like you're a fly on the wall because you can pretty much move around the room, change angles and change lenses. You can study him and look for other people in the room.
How was this most recent trip to the Hanoi summit?
On a foreign trip, there are a lot more variables, but nobody thought the president would answer questions when he was sitting next to Kim Jong-un, and certainly nobody expected that Kim Jong-un would actually respond to a U.S. reporter's question. So we were in there a little more than we expected.
It was negotiated that we could preset and wait for them to come into the room. That brought the temperature down so there wasn't a complete scrum. I don't think President Trump likes seeing the scrums either but they happen, no matter what, with everybody.
But this one had more decorum and more formality -- plus the North Korean photographers and the Americans were in different positions.
The North Korean photographers like to be elevated because President Trump is taller than Kim Jong-un -- so most of the U.S. still photographers, there were four of us, knelt down and the North Koreans stood above us, or up on ladders, so Trump wouldn't look like he was so much taller.
Are you concerned how the president might react to your pictures?
President Trump obviously is a very visual person and he looks at The New York Times daily and online, and on Twitter. So he knows the pictures that I'm producing. People ask, does that make me think twice about taking pictures that are not flattering, and my answer is no.
He's told me about pictures that he hasn't liked of mine on a couple of different occasions. He's very camera-conscious. But he still makes compliments about me or my work.
I appreciate his recognizing good and fair photography and I think that's what I do. I have no agenda, and I photograph what's in front of me, and it doesn't matter whether I think he looks flattering or not flattering, or he looks upset or he looks happy -- that's irrelevant to me.
My job while I'm in with the president at any event is to try to capture the most storytelling photograph. If it's a meeting that is jovial or happy, then it's going to show in the pictures. But if he's upset or frustrated or angry then those pictures will reflect that.
Is photographing this president different in any ways from the previous four you've photographed.
Obama was the most photogenic president I've covered, and Trump is the most iconic. No matter where you see Trump, what light you see him in, what situation we photograph him in, you know right away it's him. Whether it's the hair, his tall stature, his black jackets, the 45 embroidered on his shirts. You just know it's him.
We have more access to him than we ever had to any other president that I've covered. Much more. We're in photo ops much longer. He knows the power of driving the news cycle. And he does that day in and day out, and in order for him to do that we have to have access to him. He can drive it with Twitter, but if there's a huge story going out that may not be positive to him, all of a sudden we're in and there's something else going on.
When I photographed him in New York before he was president I found that he was very conscious about camera angles.
He knows exactly what our job is.
There was a controversy with Obama when there were fewer and fewer events that the press were allowed into and more situations where his photographer was taking pictures. That's not what's happening with Trump, is it?
The Obama folks had a knack for controlling President Obama's image, and circumvented the media by going around us through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. There were a lot of situations that we normally would photograph but they chose to use their government photographer to photograph the event and then put it out on social media.
There was a lot of criticism from photographers who covered Obama as well as the White House Correspondents Association and the White House News Photographers Association
Trump calls the media fake news, and particularly criticizes The New York Times and The Washington Post, yet photographically you are having more access than with previous presidents you've covered.
It does bother me when I hear him say that, because I know there's nothing about my photographs that are fake. We are just there doing our jobs. Clearly I don't think The New York Times is putting out any fake news.
When you have access to him it's also less controlled in some ways.
He is not very controlled. His aides can try to control an event, but President Trump will undoubtedly do something unexpected. He's not a politician and he is not somebody who has been groomed by handlers. So he is more likely to go off-script, more likely to be himself, more likely to do things that are not done by traditional politicians, like letting us in for a cabinet room for 90 minutes.
You're on the White House Correspondents Association board. What do you do?
I am the representative for the still photographers. And that includes all of the camera and sound people. I am constantly in contact with people who are making decisions about the media at the White House so all of us can do our jobs better and have as much access as we can as a group.
You've covered George W. Bush, President Obama, and President Trump for The Times. Before that you also, for The Associated Press, covered Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Reagan. How has it been different covering each of them?
Every administration is different. You try to build a relationship of trust with every administration -- that they know you're doing your job fairly and have no agenda. Every administration, every president, treats photographers differently.
Reagan was an actor, so when he went on stage he had this charisma and he would light up. His personality just grew as he spoke and as he gestured.
Bush 41 had one of the closest relationships with photographers because he was vice president for eight years before becoming president. He knew a lot of us by first names and had a nickname for us, "photo dogs." He would invite us to play horseshoes with him and to go jogging with him. He wasn't trying to play us, that was just his personality. He respected what we did.
When Clinton came in it was a totally different feel. We had plenty of access. He was very energetic and never stopped working. He loved rope lines, knew they made for great pictures and he seemed to get energy from going into a crowd and staying there for 30-40 minutes shaking hands after an event.
His relationship with photographers was not as close as it was with Bush 41 and after the Lewinsky scandal there was less access.
Because of his dad, Bush 43 really liked photographers. He'd also call us photo dogs. He was very athletic and would invite photographers to bike ride with him. He liked to hang out and talk to reporters and photographers at times, just to feel them out, mostly off the record while on the plane or at social events. He was a lot of fun to photograph. He didn't have the stage presence of other presidents, but he was a character and would do things that made for good pictures.
Obviously 9/11 was important in his presidency. That really drove the image of him being a strong president, although he was the first president I ever saw cry in the Oval Office.
When was that?
Shortly after 9/11, he teared up while talking about the people who had been killed at ground zero.
Well you had a unique experience with the younger Bush while you were with A.P., didn't you?
I was with him on 9/11, and I asked to go up on the plane with him. We were flying all over the country on the only aircraft in the air. I think he trusted me.
Part of your job of course is journalistic but it's also historical.
We are in historic times. Trump's presidency drives every photographer in town that I work with, and compete against, because there has been so much drama. You never know what's coming next.
Like when he refers to The Times as the enemy of the people ...
Yes, that's disturbing to me.
Yet he speaks well of you during the summit with Kim last week, where he said your are "one of the best photographers in the world."
I think he obviously looks at my pictures and likes them -- but not all of them. And that's not my job, for him to like them all. I think he understands that I've been around there a long time and that I am a fair news photographer who does not have an agenda.

Democratic Chaos Is on the Ballot in 2020; The only thing we know about the race for president is it'll be full of surprises.

Texto completo: With due respect to Santayana, it often seems that those who can remember the past are no less doomed to repeat it, if only as observers. This is the sentiment among many Democratic Party veterans as the presidential nomination contest begins.
In the 10½ months until the Iowa caucuses, Americans will be awash in punditry. Here's a hard-won tip for readers: The more confident the tone, the less you should buy the spiel. The past half-century has yielded an almost nonstop series of surprises.
At this point in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson, elected in a landslide in 1964, seemed to have a lock on his party's 1968 nomination. Less than a year a later, after a narrow victory over a previously obscure Minnesota senator in the New Hampshire primary, he had withdrawn from the race, opening the door to a tumultuous contest.
Four years later, Sen. Edmund Muskie, the party's vice-presidential nominee in 1968 and hailed as Lincolnesque, was anointed the front-runner. He turned out to have a glass jaw and was swept aside by Sen. George McGovern, whose campaign understood that the rules of the game had changed.
Four years after that, a previously unknown one-term Georgia governor captured the mood of the moment with his promise never to lie to the American people. Jimmy Carter won 30 primaries on his way to the nomination and the White House.
Run the reel forward eight years to 1984. On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, former Vice President Walter Mondale was hailed on the front page of the New York Times as the most prohibitive favorite for the presidential nomination in the modern history of the Democratic Party. Twenty-four hours later, he had lost New Hampshire by 10 points to Sen. Gary Hart and was fighting for his political life. The epic contest that ensued, one of the closest in recent times, was not decided until June, after the final primaries in New Jersey and California.
Nineteen eighty-eight? Long before the first votes were cast, a parade of oft-mentioned candidates had declined to enter the race, and a scandal had forced Mr. Hart to withdraw. Those who remained were lampooned as the Seven Dwarfs (with Rep. Patricia Schroeder briefly playing Snow White). The eventual winner, Michael Dukakis, survived an unimpressive third-place finish in Iowa and emerged from the hardest-to-handicap field in modern times.
The result closest to the widely predicted outcome came in 2000, when Bill Bradley's attempt to overtake Vice President Al Gore fell short in New Hampshire. Yet this expected outcome was a mere exception. Two thousand eight continued the parade of pundit-defying surprises. So did Bernie Sanders's charge in 2016, which resembled Mr. Hart's challenge in 1984.
And so, with a bow to history, here is a partial list of "known unknowns" that will figure in the 2020 Democratic race:
We do not know for sure that Joe Biden, who entered the Senate when Richard Nixon was president, will join the race. If he doesn't, others who are hanging back probably will get in. If he does, he will bring with him enough baggage to fill the Amtrak to Wilmington, Del. How much time will he be forced to spend playing defense, and to what effect? Will Democrats care that he would be the oldest man—by far—ever to receive a major party's nomination?
Now that Mr. Sanders has entered the race and re-emerged as a leading contender, he will face the age issue (he's a year older than Mr. Biden) as well as the serious scrutiny of his record that he avoided in 2016.
As for the rest:
Will Elizabeth Warren's earnest, idea-laden geek-chic campaign catch fire in Iowa's frozen tundra?
Can Kamala Harris match her large campaign personality with sure-footedness on the issues central to the nominating contest?
Can Amy Klobuchar put the staff-abuse controversy behind her and jump-start her campaign in the state just south of her own?
Will angry Democrats give Cory Booker's happy-warrior campaign a hearing? What about John Hickenlooper's "I can get it done" message? Or Pete Buttigieg's fresh-faced self-presentation?
If the Hamlet on the Rio Grande enters the race, will he show enough substance to persuade voters he can be president?
And looming over the fray, four defining questions:
In the time of #MeToo, will Democrats unite around any man with blemishes on his record?
In the age of Black Lives Matter, will Democrats accept candidates whose past positions contradict today's orthodoxies?
Will revolution-minded but victory-hungry Democrats nominate an avowed socialist, or will they settle for a center-left incrementalist who endorses their goals but not their policies?
And finally: In the era of Donald Trump, do traditional qualifications such as foreign-policy experience even matter anymore?
We'll find out.

Texto completo: "Hamilton" will be back, but first, Broadway's more recent hits will get their shots at opening in Pittsburgh.
The atmosphere at the Benedum Center Monday was tropical, as visitors were greeted with leis for the announcement of the 2019-20 PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh season.
Kevin McMahon, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, noted in his introduction that, in a record-breaking 2018-19 season for ticket sales, about 90,000 people saw "Hamilton" at the Benedum, and for those 90,000 or so others who missed out ... he then said "stay tuned" and left the "Hamilton" news for last.
News that the blockbuster musical "Hamilton" will return to Pittsburgh in 2020-21 was included with the lineup for next season, which opens with the Tony-nominated "Mean Girls." The Tina Fey musical comedy is based on her movie about the new girl in town and high school cliques. Announced dates have the tour opening Oct. 1 in Minneapolis before the show arrives in Pittsburgh on Oct. 28.
In March 2020 comes critical darling and last season's best musical "The Band's Visit" - winner of 10 Tonys - that finds power in intimate moments and illustrates the universal language of music.
Other shows making their first trips from Broadway to Pittsburgh are "A Bronx Tale," based on the Chazz Palminteri-Robert De Niro film; the disco queen biographical musical "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical"; and, for all you Parrotheads, "Escape to Margaritaville."
There were 1,500 Trust subscribers on hand for the announcement. They got to bounce around mini beach balls, witness taped messages especially for Pittsburgh by Ms. Fey and Jimmy Buffett, and cheer on live performances of songs from "Mean Girls," "A Bronx Tale," "Miss Saigon" and one of a very few pre-tour performances by the band of "The Band's Visit."
Sami Shukry, an Arab-Israeli singer-musician who was educated in New York, joined the Broadway company as the band's violinist and oud player. He was one of the uniformed members of the band at the Benedum Center Monday night.
"It has a big message, this show," he said. "It's so touching. I feel it every night. The show talks about reach and help, and understand. I come from the same background. I come from Israel, I speak Arabic, and I speak Hebrew. And when I sing, I sing about peace. They call me a 'bridge to peace.'"
2019-20 PNC BROADWAY IN PITTSBURGH SEASON
At the Benedum Center, Downtown, unless otherwise indicated.

Based on Mr. Palminteri's true life story, it begins in 1960, as the Pirates beat a Bronx boy's beloved Yankees in the World Series.

Milwaukee picked as site of 2020 Democratic National Convention

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee has selected Milwaukee as the site of its national convention, placing a spotlight on a key Midwestern battleground state that Democrats lost for the first time in three decades in 2016 and see as central to the party's efforts to reclaim the White House.
The convention will be held next year on July 13-16 in the newly built Fiserv Forum, a 17,500-seat arena that is home to the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.
Milwaukee was selected over a pair of larger Sun Belt cities, Houston, and Miami, to host the event.
Milwaukee organizers raised more than $10 million and reassured officials that they had secured sufficient hotel capacity for the event, ameliorating concerns that the city lacked the finances and infrastructure to support an event that regularly draws tens of thousands of out-of-town activists, officials, and media.
Wisconsin holds a searing place in the Democratic Party psyche after Hillary Clinton, the party's last presidential nominee, opted not to campaign in the traditionally blue state during the general election — a decision that some blamed for her 22,000-vote defeat in the state.
Democrats won back the governorship of the state in 2018, assuaging some concerns that Wisconsin was drifting away. Still, some in the party are urging the 2020 candidates to broaden their focus beyond the upper Midwest to the rapidly growing Sun Belt states.
Democratic officials worried about the optics of hosting a convention in Houston, a city dominated by the oil and gas industry, at a time when Democratic activists are focused on combating climate change.
Republicans will hold their convention Aug. 24–27, 2020, in Charlotte, N.C.

Gillibrand backs handling of aide's sex misconduct claim
Democratic presidential contender Kirsten Gillibrand is standing by her Senate office's response to a former staffer who resigned over the handling of her sexual harassment claims.
Politico reported Sunday that the female staffer alleged that one of Gillibrand's closest aides made repeated unwelcome advances toward her and then retaliated after she reported him. The aide lost his expected promotion but not his job. Gillibrand's office concluded the woman's allegations "did not meet the standard of sexual harassment."
The New York senator, who has been a forceful public advocate for victims of sexual misconduct, said Monday that it's important to believe women who make allegations so that "serious investigations can actually take place, we can learn the facts, and there can be appropriate accountability."
Gillibrand says, "That's exactly what happened at every step of this case last year."
The aide was fired after Politico presented the office with additional allegations.
Associated Press
No comment on if Trump thinks Dems 'hate' Jews
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday repeatedly refused to say whether President Trump really thinks Democrats "hate" Jewish people.
Before Trump left the White House on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he said: "The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They've become an anti-Jewish party, and that's too bad." Later in the day, Trump told Republican National Committee donors that Democrats "hate" Jewish people, according to a person who heard the remarks but spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the president's comments at a private event.
Trump's comments followed an emotional debate on Capitol Hill about statements made by freshman Representative Ilhan Omar, a Muslim lawmaker from Minnesota who suggested Israel's supporters were pushing lawmakers to take a pledge of "allegiance" to a foreign country — comments that some viewed as anti-Semitic.
Democrats wrestled for days over whether a House resolution should call Omar out by name, what other types of bias should be mentioned in the measure and whether the party would tolerate dissenting views on Israel. When the final resolution passed the House, it did not mention Omar by name.
Sanders refused several times to say whether Trump really thinks Democrats "hate" Jews. "The president has been an unwavering and committed ally to Israel and the Jewish people and, frankly, the remarks that have been made by a number of Democrats and failed to be called out by Democrat leadership is frankly abhorrent and it's sad," she said.
In January, the House approved a Democratic measure disapproving of comments that Representative Steve King, Republican from Iowa, made about white supremacy. King had a long history of controversial rhetoric about immigrants, but it wasn't until he defended white supremacy in an interview with The New York Times that Republicans in Congress moved to strip him of committee assignments and called for his resignation.
In August 2017, after violence erupted at a white nationalist "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va., Trump said "both sides" were to blame, a comment some saw as a refusal to condemn racism.
Associated Press
Pelosi: Impeaching Trump 'just not worth it'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is setting a high bar for impeachment of President Trump, saying he is "just not worth it" even as some on her left flank clamor to start proceedings. 
Pelosi said in an interview with the Washington Post that "unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country."
While she has made similar comments before, Pelosi is making clear to her caucus and to voters that Democrats will not move forward quickly with trying to remove Trump from office.
Associated Press
LePage suggests Democrats mostly get money from Jews
Former Governor Paul LePage suggested Monday that the Democratic Party's money comes from Jewish people, for the most part.
The Republican's comments told WGAN-AM that Jewish people should be "insulted" by a Democratic congresswoman's statements that some viewed as anti-Semitic. "The Jewish people in America have been great supporters of the Democratic Party," LePage said. "In fact, that's where their money comes from for the most part. They should be absolutely insulted for what she's been saying."
LePage, who has previously grabbed headlines for remarks critics deem racist, said he felt "completely vindicated from anything" he has said in light of freshman Representative Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota. She suggested Israel's supporters were pushing lawmakers to take a pledge of "allegiance" to a foreign country, reviving an anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalties.
LePage's representatives didn't respond to request for comment.

NEW YORK TIMES WRITES ARCHITECT JULIA MORGAN'S OBIT 62 YEARS LATER

Texto completo: Looking back, the first Saturday of February in 1957 was a newsy day on the international front, but not much was happening around this country. According to OnThisDay.com, the United Nations adopted a resolution calling for Israeli troops to leave Egypt. And the play "Candide" closed in New York after just 73 performances.
But somehow the New York Times managed to overlook the death of one of this country's most famous architects, Julia Morgan, the designer of the legendary Hearst Castle.
This week, the newspaper of record made amends for that oversight.
As part of its "Overlooked No More" series, the paper has published an extensive obituary feature on Morgan 62 years after her Feb. 2, 1957, death in San Francisco.
The introduction reads: "Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked,' we're adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times."
The article by Alexandra Lange chronicles Morgan's life and career, from her birth in San Francisco and upbringing in Oakland to her civil engineering studies with Bernard Maybeck at UC Berkeley and the challenges she faced as a pioneering architect.
"As the first woman to receive an architect's license in California, in 1904, Morgan early on was used to skepticism about her abilities," the article says. "But she came to allay those doubts by building a sterling reputation with projects now known around the world, including the Asilomar conference grounds on the Monterey Peninsula and, most notably, the Hearst Castle at San Simeon. By the time she retired in 1951, at 79, she had designed hundreds of buildings and sites."
One early challenge came after the 1906 earthquake left the Fairmont Hotel in ruins just days before its opening. The owners hired Morgan, based partly on her success with an earlier project in Oakland.
"Only three years earlier she had built a bell tower on the campus of Mills College, and it had withstood the earthquake unscathed proof that Morgan was as experienced in reinforced concrete as she was in European design," Lange wrote.
But skepticism about her work persisted, and the San Francisco Call sent reporter Jane Armstrong over to the building site in 1907 to talk with the foreman.
Lange quoted the Call article: "Yes, the foreman answered, it was in the charge of a real architect, and her name happens to be Julia Morgan, but it might as well be John Morgan.'"
A decade later, Morgan was designing buildings at Asilomar for Phoebe Apperson Hearst, when she undertook the commission of her career, the Hearst Castle project with William Randolph Hearst, which would last 25 years.
Besides those landmark projects on the Central Coast, she notably designed the Berkeley City Club, San Francisco's Chinatown YWCA and hundreds of other buildings. In the South Bay, a piece of her legacy is currently on the market. The 1910 home-turned-office, located at 1650 The Alameda in San Jose, has been listed for $3.4 million by Cushman & Wakefield.
So why did the Times fail to write about her death? "In the 1950s, the emphasis was on the new, the modern, and the heroic not to mention on architecture to house the masses," Lange wrote. "Morgan was largely forgotten."
Thanks to the efforts of biographer Sara Holmes Boutelle and other architects, Morgan's "reputation was restored" years after her death, the obituary says. In 2014, she was posthumously awarded the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal a first for a woman.
Morgan is buried with other California luminaries at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

AJC WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH HOLLY HUNTER: Oscar-winning actress got her start on local stages

Texto completo: Oscar-winning actress Holly Hunter grew up on a farm in Conyers in the 1960s and 1970s but wasn't allowed to partake in any of the heavy lifting.
"Boys had chores and girls did not," she said to Jane Pauley of "CBS Sunday Morning" in 2016, "i.e., drive tractors, bale hay, take care of cattle."
Hunter, the youngest of seven children, told the U.K. Metro last year that "I was very jealous of my brothers. I wanted to drive a tractor. I wanted responsibility. I wanted to be able to do a good job. I wished for that."
Instead, "I was mainly left unattended to play and pretend. Probably that's where I started thinking about acting."
That career choice has suited her well.
At age 60,Hunter has a résumé that covers verdant territory.TV movies.TV series. Broadway. Prestige films. Quirky indie films. Action films. Animation. She's worked with A-list actors such as Al Pacino, Tom Cruise, Robin Williams and Sigourney Weaver and legendary producers such as Steven Spielberg, Jonathan Demme and Sydney Pollack. She has garnered four Oscar nominations ( "Broadcast News," "The Firm," "The Piano" and "Thirteen"), winning for "The Piano."
Hunter was willing to jump between film and TV long before that became fashionable. She had an Emmy-winning turn in "Roe vs. Wade" for TV after "Broadcast News." Following her challenging role as a mute in "The Piano," she went full-on felonious in HBO's descriptive "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom." She won an Emmy for that, too.
Given her relatively diminutive size (5 feet, 2 inches tall) and her distinctive Southern drawl, she doesn't fit the traditional Hollywood starlet mold along the lines of Smyrna-born Julia Roberts.
"I've always kind of drifted between being a character actress and being a leading lady,"Hunter told NPR last year. "It hasn't been a mainstream kind of thing that I've offered. And at the same time, I've been able to carve my own niche out of the culture."
And unlike many of her peers such as Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer, Hunter over the years assiduously stayed out of the tabloids. In interviews, she rarely talks about her kids or her personal life. "I shall neither confirm nor deny the existence of my children," Hunter joked to The New York Times last year.
Hunter began acting at Rockdale High School in the early 1970s, performing in "Oklahoma," "Man of La Mancha" and "Fiddler on the Roof."
"There were three or four of us who kinda dominated the productions," she told AJC's Eleanor Ringel in 1987. "I was certainly one of the regulars, but it was more than just me."
At a State Play Contest in Athens, Fred Chappell, artistic director of the Alliance Theater at the time, spotted her. She spent two summers with his stock company in Cortland, New York.
"Even at that age, she was so impressive," said Chappell, who now teaches at Florida State University, in an interview last week. "Very focused. Had a strong work ethic. She was very serious about her career even then."
After acting at Carnegie Mellon University, Hunter broke into Hollywood with a tiny part in a horror film, "The Burning." Then came the Coen brothers, who saw her on Broadway in "Crimes of the Heart" and asked her to read for their film "Blood Simple." The part went instead to future fellow Oscar winner Frances McDormand, but since the two actresses were best friends and roommates, there were no hard feelings The Coen brothers eventually wrote breakthrough film "Raising Arizona" specifically with Hunter in mind.
"So that film came about in a real family kind of way," Hunter said to the AJC in 1987. "The Coens had been friends for years, and as far as directing me, they'd mostly just say, 'Hey, Holly, go!' "
Early in her career, she worried her size might hold her back, but James L.Brooks -- seeking someone to play the hard-nosed yet vulnerable news producer Jane Craig on "Broadcast News" -- proved her wrong.
"With 'Broadcast News,' it became a non-issue, and with 'The Piano,' it became a non-issue," Hunter recalled in 2016 at the Hamptons International Film Festival. "Both parts were written for more statuesque women.It was nice to change people's minds about that because that's neither here nor there."
After her Emmy-nominated turn as the complex, morally blurry Grace in TNT's "Saving Grace" from 2007 to 2010,Hunter sought film roles as she entered her 50s and was sorely disappointed.
"I just thought that (Grace) was an incredible boundaryless character that I got to stretch out in over the course of 'Saving Grace,' " she said to NPR in 2018. "And when I got back to the feature film world, there was so little opportunity that I was really kind of stunned. I was looking to take a slight break but not exactly a hiatus."
Fortunately, she received accolades as a protective mom in 2017's "The Big Sick" and brought fire to Elastigirl in "Incredibles 2" last year.
"Now I'm 60, and I'm still acting," she said to the U.K. Daily Observer last year. "That's pretty good. So in a lot of ways, I defied my own expectations. I think acting has provided me with all these adventures that I never could have really anticipated. It's a great career and it continues to be a great career."

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange,” (Minotaur Books, 393 pp. , ★★ out of four stars) the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned rare bookseller.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing deal-making aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, “Who am I to judge?”
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo’s estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother’s ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You’ll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn’t.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.

U.S. Woman Gets Residency In Saudi Arabia

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- An American woman who was stuck illegally in Saudi Arabia with her young daughter after her Saudi husband divorced her said on Sunday that the Saudi authorities had granted her legal residency after The New York Times wrote about her ordeal last week.
The woman, Bethany Vierra of Washington State, moved to the kingdom in 2011, where she started a business, married a Saudi businessman and gave birth to a daughter, Zaina. Her troubles began after the divorce, when her former husband failed to renew her residency, meaning she was in the kingdom illegally but was also blocked from traveling through airports or accessing her bank account.
Ms. Vierra's case showed how even an American woman and her Saudi-American daughter could be ensnared by the kingdom's so-called guardianship laws, which grant Saudi men power over women in a number of ways.
Much has changed for women in Saudi Arabia in recent years, as the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the day-to-day ruler, has pushed to open up society, lifting the ban on driving by women, allowing women to enter sports stadiums and appointing the kingdom's first female ambassador, to the United States.
Ms. Vierra's case also showed how the kingdom's authorities could intervene, either out of sympathy or to avoid an international scandal. After her story appeared in The Times, it was picked by other media outlets, including Elle and Fox News.
Ms. Vierra, 31, said on Sunday in a statement that Saudi officials had intervened in her case and "within hours, my residency issue was solved."
"I was never trying to escape Saudi Arabia," Ms. Vierra wrote. "I have dedicated my life's work to this country and being a part of its growth, development and vision for its future."
Ms. Vierra was granted residency as the mother of a Saudi citizen, a relatively new status that she had not been able to obtain after her divorce because her husband refused to provide the required paperwork, according to Nicole Carroll, her cousin.
Ms. Vierra can now use her bank account and travel as she pleases. But her new status does not apply to Zaina, 4, whose legal guardian under Saudi law remains her father, Ms. Vierra's ex-husband. Zaina cannot leave the country without his permission, which he has not granted, Ms. Carroll said.
Ms. Carroll said it remained to be seen whether the Saudi authorities would grant Ms. Vierra the right to travel abroad with Zaina without the father's permission. He recently sued Ms. Vierra, Ms. Carroll said, so the couple have several cases pending in Saudi courts, generally related to issues like custody.
"If it is true and this is a possibility, I suppose it means the country is actually moving forward in the right direction on this," Ms. Carroll said of her cousin's new ability to travel to see relatives in the United States.
Ms. Carroll asked that the name of Ms. Vierra's former husband not be published to avoid provoking his family. He did not respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: RURAL AMERICA - There is a pork roast slowly cooking in the oven, the mail today was lousy, and the sledding on the long icy lane from the road to my house has been terrific. Nothing like a half-inch of ice to get an old man excited about belly flopping onto an old sled.
Deer tracks crisscross the yard. It's been a tough winter for them, as well as for many others out here who share the land with me.
While plowing a neighbor's drive recently, I stopped to watch a possum trying to work her way through the snow. The thin layer of ice on top of the snow kept giving way under her weight, so it was slow going.
Pheasants have shown up on the sides of the graveled road that runs by my house. They can't peck through the ice, so they attend to spots where the passing snowplow has scraped down to the grass. Rarely do they rely upon human activity to keep them alive, but this has been a long, strange winter, for all of us.
We all rely on others, and we humans in particular count on institutional America to be there when we need it.
Often those institutions fail. A recent New York Times article reported that all across rural America, nursing homes and care facilities are closing. Consequently residents are often transferred to other facilities, often hundreds of miles from their loved ones.
Many nursing facilities do not accept Medicaid, as it isn't nearly enough to cover the cost of care. For families without tremendous resources, this leaves few options, with one option being a cry for help to family members.
I know some of these people, classmates and friends who, after a lifetime away from here, have moved back to take care of a parent.
In small towns, it's difficult to find people willing to work for very low wages, and it's even worse in the health care field.
For reasons unknown to me, we don't put much value on the good folks who sit with our relatives, holding their hands, keeping them company, folks who accompany Mom or Dad to the bathroom, cleaning them up afterwards, telling them it's all OK.
But it's not OK. Our system of values is not only out of whack, it's downright cruel. I read recently that some baseball player or other has signed a contract that will pay him more than $20 million every year. Every year! If my poor math skills are accurate, his pay works out to be more than $100,000 per game,
While the person doing the important work
Of putting a fork and spoon to your great-
Uncle's lips makes less than a quarter of that in a year. It's not right, and you can't convince me otherwise.
OK, I'll shut up now.
Out here, every afternoon a barred owl hoots from her perch in the woods behind the house, waiting for an unsuspecting mouse to head out across the snow. She doesn't know that, thousands of years from now, mice will be the kings of the forest. I know this to be true.
These days, I find pieces of cat food in my knee-high boots in the basement, and I know mice are responsible. You want longevity? Give a mouse your family name because likely a thousand years from now, long after humans have destroyed themselves, mice will still be out there, scampering across through the snow, taking shelter in an old man's basement.

Texto completo: As part of this year’s One Book, One Batavia program, "The Space Race" will be presented at 7 p.m. Monday, March 11, at the Batavia Public Library, 10 S. Batavia Ave.
In the 1960s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were locked in a race to send men to the moon. How did it all begin? How did the Soviets try to beat the Americans? And, what happened to the Soviet effort after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon in July 1969?
Presenter Michelle Nichols is the director of public observing at the Adler Planetarium and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ambassador.
Registration is required at www.BataviaPublicLibrary.org or by calling the library reference desk, (630) 879-1393, ext. 200.
One Book, One Batavia is an annual communitywide reading program presented by the Batavia Public Library in cooperation with Batavia High School and co-sponsored by the Friends of the Batavia Public Library.
This year’s book is "Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Mankind’s First Journey to the Moon" by Robert Kurson.
* On Monday, March 18, New York Times best-selling author Robert Kurson will discuss his book on the Apollo 8 mission at 7 p.m. Monday, March 18, at the Batavia library.
The Chicago resident is the author of four New York Times best-selling books, including "Shadow Divers" and "Rocket Men." He began his career as an attorney, graduating from Harvard Law School and practicing real estate law. His stories have appeared in Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and other publications.
* On Monday, March 25, "NASA’s Mars Rovers, Old and New" will be presented at 7 p.m. Presenter William Higgins is an engineering physicist at Fermilab and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ambassador.
Mobile robots have succeeded on Mars four times: Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity. Working together with orbiting spacecraft, NASA’s rovers have brought scientific instruments to the Martian surface for meticulous examination of its geological, chemical, and meteorological nature.
Learn how they work, what they’ve learned about Mars, and what’s in store for the new rover NASA expects to launch in 2020.
The Mars Opportunity rover mission was recently in the news when NASA announced that the mission — one of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration — was at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars. Designed to run for 90 days, the exploration spanned more than 15 years.
Along the way, it discovered definitive proof of liquid water on ancient Mars and set the off-world driving record.

Texto completo: La hija del presidente Donald Trump y su esposo son investigados por el Comité de Supervisión de la Cámara de Representantes, que obtuvo documentos sobre el proceso de los permisos de seguridad otorgados a la pareja.
Ese Comité ya había solicitado a la Casa Blanca la información, pero se negó a proporcionarla, reveló el portal Axios sobre el caso Jared Kushner e Ivanka Trump .
La filtración de los documentos beneficiará al Congreso, lo que dificultará que la Casa Blanca retenga información para las indagatorias de los demócratas.
El New York Times reveló hace unas semanas que el presidente Trump habría presionado al exjefe de Gabinete, John Kelly, para que se otorgaran las autorizaciones.
Aunque el mandatario tiene ese derecho, el caso resulta relevante, debido a que se trata de miembros de su familia a quienes pudo haber otorgado permisos directamente.
Ahora el Comité tiene los documentos que detallan todo el proceso, desde la primavera de 2017 hasta la primavera de 2018, sobre cómo Kushner y su esposa finalmente obtuvieron los permisos de seguridad.
La Casa Blanca no ha dado una postura oficial sobre esta nueva pieza de información, pero un documento, obtenido por Axios, proporciona algunos detalles sobre por qué se cambió la autorización de seguridad de Kushner a “interina” en septiembre de 2017, tras informarse que la investigación sobre su pasado estaba “incompleta”.

Texto completo: The New York Times recently won a judgment in a defamation lawsuit filed by a University of Florida professor. The article at issue documented relationships cultivated by both biotechnology and organics companies with public university academics. It focused especially on the effects of these relationships in debates about the safety and regulation of genetically modified organism (GMO) food products.
Kevin Folta, Ph.D., a professor and former chairman of the Horticultural Sciences Department at the University of Florida, contended that the article made him look too friendly to the GMO industry, including a statement that he was part of an "inner circle of industry consultants, lobbyists and executives who devised strategy on how to block state efforts to mandate G.M.O. labeling."
The New York Times argued that the article was a fair report of records maintained by the University of Florida. Courts recognize a privilege for reporting on records maintained by an arm of the government. So long as the reporting accurately reports on the substance of the record, the reporter isn't liable even if the content of the records contains some falsity. Nor is the reporter liable for a negative implication created by the report.
The interesting question in Folta's case was whether the particular records – emails Folta sent and received – were the type of records subject to the privilege. The court had little trouble ruling that they were.
Folta argued that his emails are not public records because they are not "intended to perpetuate, communicate, or formalize knowledge of some type."
The court found this argument unpersuasive. It noted: "Plaintiff's assertion that his emails are not public records borders on the nonsensical; taken to the extreme, Plaintiff's theory of public records would exclude the vast majority of emails between public employees and outside individuals. In today's virtual world, where almost all business is conducted electronically, this conclusion is absurd."
Life was probably easier when official records came in ornate scrolls. They looked the part. But regardless of appearance, records are official not based on format, but on their content. The Florida court got this one right.

Texto completo: "The Natchez Burning Trilogy" cemented Greg Iles' place in the top tier of America's literary blockbusters. The novels met with commercial and critical success, spanning 2,000-plus pages of adrenaline-spiked prose, and the third, "Mississippi Blood," debuted at the No. 1 spot on the New York Times bestseller list.
From that pinnacle, what next? Where to turn after Penn Cage has dragged every skeleton out of Natchez' historical closet?
Apparently, Iles decided to get out of town.
His newest, "Cemetery Road," (William Morrow) is set in the fictional town of Bienville, seat of Tenisaw County on the Mississippi and a piece up the road from Natchez. Like many river towns, Bienville has seen its glory days come and go; the town is shrinking from "a slow exsanguination of people and talent that functions like a wasting disease." That is, until a group of local big shots lure a Chinese paper corporation to town. Their proposed mill will bring billions of dollars to the area and give Bienville a shot at a new life.
But — as happens in Iles' work — history complicates the present. The site designated for the prospective mill lies atop a trove of Native American artifacts dating back centuries. The moral imperative to preserve these relics butts up against civic progress and private greed. Soon the tension erupts into bitter — and murderous — conflict.
Watching it all come to a boil is Marshall McEwan, a native son who has achieved fame as a Washington journalist but returned home to reconcile with his dying father, owner of The Watchman, Bienville's newspaper. Soon Marshall is investigating the story of his career — a web of corruption more intricate than any he saw in D.C., right in the sleepy small town of his youth.
Turns out the old boys of Bienville are a good deal more organized and nefarious than Marshall or his newsman father ever thought. Though everything is kept "smooth on the surface, in the Southern tradition," the Bienville Poker Club has been calling the shots in town since Reconstruction. The Club fully intends for the paper mill to become a reality, no matter the collateral damage. And they have augmented their post-Confederate ranks with ties to the New Jersey mob, courtesy of the town's riverboat casino. The old boys now have connections to made guys.
Iles dials the tension up higher. Marshall is not long back in his hometown before he runs into his first love, Jet, and begins an affair with her. That Jet is now married to Paul Matheson, a classmate of them both and Marshall's childhood friend, only deepens the betrayal. And the cost of discovery is high: Paul is a Special Ops veteran of the Middle East conflict and heir apparent to his father's seat in the Poker Club.
It is impossible to tell more without revealing secrets of an intricate plot where the intrigue is as thick as kudzu and grows at twice the speed. Iles works tension into each page, a threat materializing from every quarter as Marshall digs deeper into the Club's dealings and his own past. Iles seems to have learned how to squeeze all the menace and suspense of his Natchez trilogy into a single, standalone novel.
But what is best to see in "Cemetery Road" is that while Iles may have moved on from Natchez, he has retained the melancholic tone and long view of history that made his trilogy an important meditation on Southern history.
"I think it's probably best to leave the past in the past," Marshall says in a rare moment of surrender. To which an older, wiser Mississippian replies, "If only we could."

Resumen: The writings offer insights into Moseley's twisted mind as he discusses the Genovese murder, issues with his wife and his parents, his 1968 prison escape and even his father's dog. In one of three letters shared with Daily News, Moseley writes that he suffered "a psychological disturbance" brought on the "serious problems" of his mother and father, among other issues. The case inspired a 1996 episode of TV crime show "Law & Order," and new books on the case still arrive - including three new biographies for the 50th anniversary.

Texto completo: The unsolicited letter arrived too late to save Winston Moseley's soul.
The writer was a pre-med student at Boston University, a good Christian woman, eager to spread the gospel of the Lord.
Melody McCloud was already part of a Massachusetts prison ministry program when she saw Moseley, poised and articulate, doing a New York television interview around Christmas 1975. The naive young woman was moved to write the inmate about God's love.
Inmate No. 64A0102 in the Attica Correctional Facility responded quickly. The name on the envelope with the 13-cent stamp rang no warning bells for McCloud, but a subsequent letter mentioned perhaps the most notorious killing in New York history.
"I was convicted of a murder that has been highly publicized off and on ever since it happened," Moseley explained in one of his neatly typed, double-spaced letters. "You were only eight in 1964, but I'm talking about the Kitty Genovese case."
McCloud, now 63, eventually received 15 Moseley letters comprising 43 pages, along with four cards and five poems, during an increasingly unsettling correspondence that she ended after six months.
The writings offer insights into Moseley's twisted mind as he discusses the Genovese murder, issues with his wife and his parents, his 1968 prison escape and even his father's dog.
For decades, McCloud kept the letters to herself. But with Moseley dead for two years and the 55th anniversary of the March 13, 1964 murder approaching, she made selected excerpts of his writings available to the Daily News.
"What's a nice girl like me doing in a story like this?" asked McCloud, reflecting on her homicidal pen pal. "I did not know Winston Moseley. I never met him. Had never spoke to him. I wasn't looking for a love match with a prisoner. I stumbled into this."
In one of three letters shared with Daily News, Moseley writes that he suffered "a psychological disturbance" brought on the "serious problems" of his mother and father, among other issues.
"As for Kitty - no I didn't know her," Moseley wrote. "That was just a robbery that went all wrong. She resisted and called me a few different kind of n-----s and I kind of lost my head ... I didn't mean to kill her.
"So for a few minutes I stopped being human."
The facts of the horrifying crime, as detailed in Moseley's confession, are far more chilling.
The killer was cruising in his car through Queens around 3:15 a.m. when he randomly targeted Genovese. He followed his prey back to Kew Gardens, chasing down the terrified 28-year-old before twice plunging a hunting knife into her back.
Genovese's cries for help awoke some neighbors, with one shouting down at her assailant.
Moseley left - but only to cover up his crime. The killer parked his car farther away, and donned a wide-brimmed hat to hide his face. He then returned to stab his pleading, bleeding victim another dozen times, raped her and left Kitty to die on Austin St.
The slaying became a sensation after a New York Times story claimed that 38 neighbors ignored Genovese's screams, and still remains undeniably hard-wired into the American psyche.
The case inspired a 1996 episode of TV crime show "Law & Order," and new books on the case still arrive - including three new biographies for the 50th anniversary. The 2016 documentary "The Witness" followed Kitty's brother Bill as he searched for the truth hidden in the Queens darkness that night.
This Wednesday, a Fordham University forum will discuss the killing's role in the creation of citizen anti-crime patrols like the Guardian Angels.
"The Genovese tragedy remains unique in many ways - a noncelebrity homicide victim who is better known than her killer," wrote Fordham Prof. Harold Takooshian. "Kitty is known only for the last 28 minutes of her life, not the first 28 years."
Even Moseley, in his letters, referenced the killing as if it was his calling card.
"I was convicted of that crime Melody and I'm not going to try to tell you that I didn't do it," he wrote. "There were extenuating circumstances, and those I may go into with you at some time later."
By mid-1975, Melody was uncomfortable with the changing tenor of their letters. She recalled how Moseley asked her to send him a photo, writing that "you can put yourself in the envelope" as a birthday present.
"I never in my life had a birthday party," he added.
McCloud enclosed the photo with her next letter - followed by a moment of divine intervention. The voice of God, she recalled, actually sounded in her head: "Don't mail that letter 'til you go to the library."
She ignored it, sent the letter and then discovered the details of Moseley's past from articles on an old library microfiche machine: two other murders, his 1968 escape from a Buffalo hospital, his rape of a woman while on the lam.
A shaken McCloud contacted a postal official near Attica and stopped the letter's delivery. The man told her sternly to to stop writing: "He escaped once. I wouldn't put it past him him to do it again - and kill you."
That was her last letter. Moseley, 81, died behind bars on March 28, 2016, his parole rejected 18 times. McCloud, certain the letters hold a deeper meaning, believes the time is now right to let others read them.
"The documents I have," she said, "can help criminologists and psychologists who study serial killers learn more."

Texto completo: Unborn human beings are again under assault in Illinois from pending House Bill 2495 and Senate Bill 1942. Our Democratic state senators and representatives are almost certain to adopt the most dangerous abortion legislation in U.S. history. Worse, even, than New Yorks, which didnt seem possible a few weeks ago.
They and our new governor, former unborn humans all, will make Illinois the most abortion-friendly state among the fifty. Will anyone be surprised when newly born but defective babies become vulnerable, even though their deaths will not technically be abortions?
What happened to safe, legal and rare, the phrase adopted by Bill Clinton and others to imply a measure of regret when a pregnant woman seeks to hire an abortionist to kill her unborn child? Hillary Clinton has joined the modern move to go well beyond sorrow at the loss of young lives. (See Chris Carolas article in The New York Times, Jan. 7, 2019.) Ive often wondered why rare was included in the no longer popular mantra. Was it a concession that abortion takes a human life? Do choice advocates no longer care about that?
It cant be true that all Democrats love abortion. Surely many voters who put them in position to widen the path to deliberately inflicted death are feeling queasy about what they have done. Its not a love of abortion, they will say, but rather the love of the right to choose, with which there is no practical difference.
Lord, have mercy.

There would be no better 'reparations' for blacks than to end policies promoting reckless behavior

Texto completo: David Brooks must have slept like a baby after sending in his column on reparations for black Americans. It checked all the right boxes required for a condescending, liberal, white person to continue feeling morally superior without lifting a finger.

Credit where it's due, though. For his piece in the New York Times, Brooks did at least talk to a southern black lady.

Brooks wrote Thursday that he's had a spiritual awakening and now supports reparations for blacks in order to compensate for slavery's "collective debt that will have to be paid."

He describes his conversion from reparations opponent after "traveling around the country for the past few years studying America’s divides" and finding, "The racial divide doesn’t feel like the other divides. There is a dimension of depth to it that the other divides don’t have. It is more central to the American experience."

He wrote that he "had so many experiences over the past year — sitting, for example, with an elderly black woman in South Carolina shaking in rage because the kids in her neighborhood face greater challenges than she did growing up in 1953 — that suggest we are at another moment of make-or-break racial reckoning."

Brooks doesn't name the woman who was blessed to meet a rich, white man who wants to give her money on behalf of America. Not directly out of his pocket right now, mind you, but perhaps she'll get some from everyone else some day.

He goes into no detail about why "kids in her neighborhood face greater challenges than she did growing up in 1953," but I have some guesses that have nothing to do with slavery, like the breakdown of the nuclear family and the sprawling welfare state that has only weakened black communities.

Policies that relieve the most vulnerable people of any sexual responsibility result in tangible consequences, including food stamp entitlements for children, prolific birth control, child support for single mothers, and on and on. All of these delights were ushered in after 1959. The birth control pill was introduced as a contraceptive in 1960, and President Nixon expanded federal subsidies for the pill in 1970. Food stamps were made permanent in 1964. The child support system came in 1975, and though it was intended for the children of divorced parents, nonmarital births increased to about 20 percent within a decade of its passage.

These are all programs sacred within the Democratic Party today, though they were ushered along with the help of Republicans, too. And they've done more to wreck the futures of blacks today than the aftermath of slavery did then. If we're trying to repair the lives of blacks Americans, look at the policies that put them where they are.

But if the main concern is monetary compensation, how much money, how it would be distributed, and who precisely should receive it, Brooks doesn't know. He concludes his column, however, declaring that at least "the very act of talking about and designing [reparations] heals a wound and opens a new story."

Blacks should presumably be thankful to Brooks for all of his help.

Texto completo: The beauty of being a columnist is that I can write whatever I damned well please.
That is, as long as every column is interesting, timely, unique, well-written, accurate, properly attributed, thoroughly researched, thought provoking, honest, inoffensive, witty, intelligent, and no more than 700 words.
Piece of cake, right?
Frankly, writing columns isn't easy. In fact, there are moments when I'd rather chew my own arm off than pen my weekly submission. But what makes column writing special is that, like editorial and commentary writers, columnists are called upon to give their opinions, while the rest of the media is unbiased.
Wait, did I just say "the media is unbiased?" That statement must be my attempt at wit, because it is impossible to take seriously.
In today's 24/7 media cycle, opinion has crept into every aspect of the news. Years ago, reporters and anchors didn't reveal their personal biases. We huddled around our console televisions, transistor radios, and coffee-stained newspapers, unaware of the personal opinions of David Brinkley, Helen Thomas, Peter Jennings, Connie Chung, Seymour Hersh, Walter Cronkite, and Ted Koppel who reported raw facts.
Allowing bias to creep into news reporting was once considered unethical. Opinion was reserved only for editorials, columns, and commentary.
But nowadays, we accept that news anchors double as commentators, reporters are activists, and everyone in the media Tweets. All day, every day, one can turn on MSNBC for the left wing spin, and Fox News for the right wing perspective. Web sites such as AdFontesMedia.com and MediaBiasFactCheck.com publish charts rating and categorizing media outlets by their ideological leanings. Arguably, no news organization offers neutral fact reporting anymore, and most lean left.
Award-winning journalist Lara Logan, who recently announced that she split with CBS where she had been a top "60 Minutes" correspondent since 2002, said in a February 15 interview, "The media everywhere is mostly liberal. But in this country, 85 percent of journalists are registered Democrats."
Logan acknowledged that her comments would amount to "career suicide," but published a piece last week stating that one-sided reporting has damaged the press' credibility. Others agree with Logan's claims, like New York Times columnist David Leonhardt who said, "Most mainstream journalists do lean left," and Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan who said, "Impartiality is still a value worth defending in mainstream news coverage."
According to a recent poll in Columbia Journalism Review, less than half (42 percent) of Democrats and only 10 percent of Republicans believe that the media is unbiased. The majority of all respondents reported having "hardly any confidence at all" in the press.
Why won't the news media stick to the facts? Do they no longer trust the public to think for themselves? Have ethical standards in journalism changed? Will opinion-saturated news make editorials, columns, and commentary obsolete?
One-sided commentary in the news and social media "is making opinion journalism and opinion writers less interesting," said James Bennet, editorial page editor of the New York Times, in a lecture at Harvard University that I attended on Feb. 26 titled "What's the Point of Publishing Opinion, Anyway?" Since Bennet took over the Times' editorial page in 2016, he has been criticized by his own newsroom for launching a "Diversification Project" and hiring conservative columnists Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss.
"Back in the day, there were rewards for being contrarian, but we have unfortunately moved toward radical conformity today," Bennet said about the news industry. "We need a sense of humility. To recommit to the fundamental tools of our trade."
The fact that the print news media industry has changed from an advertising-based business model to a subscription-based model "means the journalism needs to be good," Bennet said. He believes that readers want unbiased reporting of straight news and diversity of opinion because it encourages "the kind of debate we need in our society."
"Let people think for themselves," he said, and I agree. Readers, subscribe to publications that commit to objectivity. News media, stop stepping on opinion writers' turf. That way, columnists like me can get back to writing whatever we damned well please.
Oops, not quite 700 words. Need two more. There. Done.

'Green Book' pianist played and partied in Wausau

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Pianist Don Shirley, the subject of the Academy Award-nominated movie "Green Book," confronted racist Jim Crow laws when he performed in the South in the 1960s.
But when Shirley came to Wausau to perform in The Grand theater, he had to deal with another problem altogether: A guy dressed as a gorilla stepped on his birthday cake.
That's the way Barbara Lattimer of Wausau, a voice instructor at the Wausau Conservatory of Music, remembers it.
Barbara's husband of 50 years, businessman and music lover Tom Lattimer, arranged to have Shirley perform in central Wisconsin. She doesn't remember the exact year — she thinks it likely was in the early 1970s, after the era the movie portrays. But portions of that evening stuck with her for nearly 50 years, and the memories came flooding back when she went to see "Green Book."
Barbara enjoyed the movie, especially because it revived the time she met Shirley. It also brought back sweeping memories of Tom, who died in 2012 at age 75. It almost felt, Lattimer said, as if Tom were with her in the theater, or that he might show up as a character in the film.
"Seeing the film was so bittersweet for me," she said.
A 1954 graduate of Wausau High School, Tom Lattimer was a freshman at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia when he began to follow the career of Don Shirley. Shirley was a stand-out musician, not only because of his world-class skills as pianist, but also because of the color of his skin.
Born in Pensacola, Florida, Shirley was the son of Jamaican immigrants and was a musical prodigy, playing standard concert classical pieces at age 10 and performing with the Boston Pops at age 18, according to his 2013 obituary in The New York Times.
Shirley, who is played by Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in "Green Book," initially yearned for a career as a classical pianist. But when he was in his 20s, he was counseled that American audiences were not ready for a black classical pianist. So instead he made his name performing pop music and jazz.
Shirley started playing gigs at nightclubs and, according to the Times, "invented what amounted to his own musical genre," a blending of pop, jazz, R&B and classical styles. Tom Lattimer likely first saw Shirley perform in Philadelphia, and the pianist's style enthralled him, Barbara said: "He began to follow the career of Don Shirley and heard him play frequently in East Coast clubs."
Following the career of Shirley also meant getting to know him as a person. Tom was the type of person who could easily insert himself into conversation and widely varying situations. So he would talk with Shirley after performances and gradually become a casual acquaintance of the pianist, someone Shirley would recognize and chat with.
Tom Lattimer returned home to Wausau to become a successful agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and a community leader who is remembered for his support of the performing arts.
And he continued to follow Shirley's career. He collected all of his albums and whenever possible, went to see live performances. By this time he and Barbara had married, and she would sometimes go with him.
A costume party at The Wausau Club It was natural for Tom to help arrange for Shirley to perform in Wausau. And it was entirely in character for Tom to invite Shirley to a private party held at The Wausau Club later that evening.
Barbara remembers that it was a costume party, and Tom, after Shirley performed, went to change into a gorilla suit. "I remember Tom meeting Don, holding the head of the suit in his hand," Barbara said. "And Don was upset that he wasn't told it was a costume party. I don't know what he would have done for a costume."
Then Tom and Barbara were taken to the club via Shirley's limousine, and when he got in, Tom put his foot in a birthday cake Shirley had in the car.
But all was forgiven when Shirley got to the party. The pianist was the center of attention, with people buying him drinks and talking with him. He asked Barbara, at one point, how he ever got connected with Tom, and all Barbara could do was explain that was just how Tom was. She couldn't bring herself to tell the musician that her husband had been essentially stalking him for years.
The movie portrays Shirley as a serious, regal and sometimes difficult man who insisted on pushing racial boundaries, Barbara said. The Shirley she remembers was jovial, smiling and laid back.
But, she said, at one point in the evening Shirley did share with Tom that he had a higher purpose to his performing tours.
"He told Tom that 'what I do is not about the music. It's about civil rights,'" Barbara said. "And the movie shows that. He puts himself in danger, trying to cross these (racial) barriers."

A Boston doctor pleaded with CVS to change its on-hold music. Now his wish may be coming true.

Texto completo: Dr. Steven Schlozman had had enough with the melody. He just couldn't take hearing it anymore. Something had to change, or he was bound to lose his mind.
On the brink of a possible breakdown, he penned a tongue-in-cheek letter to WBUR's CommonHealth in May, begging — no, pleading — CVS to change the music that customers and doctors are forced to listen to when they're placed on hold by the pharmacy.
“Please change your hold music. Please. Do the right thing," Schlozman, a child psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, wrote at the time. “I hear it in my sleep. I hear it when I go running. Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night humming that melody. It haunts me, day and night. It's not healthy. I know. I'm a doctor."
Now, Schlozman's dreams could be coming true. The nightmare, he hopes, may soon be over.
CVS spokeswoman Amy Lanctot told the Globe in a statement Friday that the company is in the process of updating its interactive voice-response phone system, including the on-hold music that Schlozman — he estimates he's heard the music approximately three times per day for many years — and some others detest.
“We expect this work to be completed later in 2019," she said. “Plans had already been underway to enhance the phone system, and the music is only one element of it."
Lanctot did not clarify, when asked, whether the company was replacing the music, or merely keeping the same song but improving the sound quality. (The current version often comes in a bit crackly.)
“Nothing has been finalized yet," she said, “including which on-hold music we will use with the new system."
The announcement about the pending changes was first reported by WBUR on Friday, after the station decided to follow up on Schlozman's original letter.
When WBUR published Schlozman's cry for help last spring, it launched a nationwide debate, with people split on whether the piano tune that pours through phone receivers is soothing or flat-out irritating.
The Wall Street Journal jumped into the fray in July, calling the music “one of the most polarizing pieces of music in America."
The newspaper went as far as tracking down the origins of the song, claiming it was composed by Harvard University-educated musician James Romeo, who died in 2002.
Later, the divisive music became prime-time fodder for “Good Morning America" hosts, and Schlozman was forced to hum it on air, he said.
Of course, not everyone hates it.
“We've kept this song as our on-hold music for so long because of the numerous positive comments we've received from customers over the years," a CVS spokesman told the Journal in July.
Lanctot, the CVS spokeswoman, said the company purchased an interactive voice response system from Vertical Communications nearly two decades ago, and the song was included as part of the package.
Pharmacies have used it as the on-hold music ever since. It's currently played for customers and doctors who call any of the company's 9,800 locations.
Even though CVS officials say plans were already in the works to “enhance" the company's phone system — including the classical music — Schlozman is pleased about the announcement.
“CVS says it was not related to the letter I wrote, so I cannot, in good conscience, take credit," he told the Globe in a telephone interview. “But I feel great. It's awesome. I was tired of that music, as I'm sure a lot of other people were."
He said he hopes the words “updating" and “enhance" mean a new tune, or tunes, are on the way.
“If they asked what my opinion is, they should change the tune," he said.
The Massachusetts General Hospital Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds, where Schlozman is a codirector, also lauded the announcement.
“Some #FridayFun!," the center tweeted. “Last May, our co-director @zombieautopsies wrote a humorous post for @commonhealth that went viral — including to @GMA & @WSJ — begging #CVS to change its hold music. Guess who's changing their hold music?"

Podcasts Are Snatching Up Listeners in U.S.

Texto completo: The number of podcast listeners has increased sharply this year, according to a new report.
More than half the people in the United States have listened to one, and nearly one out of three people listen to at least one podcast every month. Last year, it was more like one in four.
"That's the biggest growth we've seen, and we've been covering podcasts since 2006," said Tom Webster, a senior vice president at Edison Research, a company that tracks business trends.
The latest facts and figures on the rise of podcasting come courtesy of the just-published 2019 edition of The Infinite Dial, an annual survey conducted this January and February put together by Edison Research and Triton Digital, an audio technology and advertising company.
In addition to identifying broader trends, the survey's researchers dug into different age groups and found that listeners over age 55, who were slower to adopt podcasts, are finally catching up. In 2018, 13 percent of people in that age group identified themselves as monthly podcast listeners; this year, 17 percent of those in that demographic have taken up the habit.
The number of young podcast listeners is also on the rise. Forty percent of people between the ages of 12 and 24 listened to a podcast last month -- a 10 percent jump from 2018.
"What moved the needle is Spotify adding podcasts," Mr. Webster said of the music streaming service, which increased its podcast offerings last year and recently acquired Gimlet Media, the studio behind the popular podcasts "Crimetown" and "Reply All," and Anchor, which makes tools for recording and distributing podcasts.
Past reports from The Infinite Dial showed a creeping increase in podcasts from year to year. That has changed in 2019, when there was a dramatic jump. Compared with 2018 figures, the number of people who have listened to at least one podcast in their lives increased by 20 million, and an additional 14 million people described themselves as weekly listeners.
"I think we hit a tipping point," Mr. Webster said.
He gave some credit to podcasts that have drawn interest from the entertainment industry.
"Shows like 'Homecoming' and 'Dr. Death' -- they've really become Hollywood properties, too," Mr. Webster said. "That's brought attention to it. There are also new forms happening. Companies like NPR and The New York Times are doing short, topical news podcasts. Those are really easy for people to add to their media diets."
Since The Times introduced "The Daily" in 2017, the number of daily podcasts has more than tripled. They include news-oriented programs like "Post Reports" from The Washington Post, "What Next" from Slate and "Start Here" from ABC News.
Hernan Lopez, the founder and chief executive of Wondery, the podcast network behind "Dirty John" and "Dr. Death," said he had also noticed a recent jump. "Casual listeners became monthly listeners, and the monthly listeners became weekly listeners," Mr. Lopez said.
He said Wondery estimated advertising revenue across the industry rose, exceeding $500 million in 2018.
"For many years, people from inside and outside the industry have talked about the 'slow and steady' growth," Mr. Lopez said. "They can't say 'slow and steady' anymore."

Texto completo: The T.M. Landry College Preparatory School has submitted plans to convert a former Lafayette skating rink into classroom space that will meet state fire code, but the plans show no intention of installing a sprinkler system and don't address ADA compliance.
"We have provided everything the State Fire Marshal has required. We are waiting to hear back from them to be able to occupy the building," said Greg Davis, former director of the Cajundome and Convention Center who assumed the role of chairman of the T.M. Landry board of directors in December.
The school originally was planning to move in Thursday to the location on Moss Street but decided to let kids remain on Mardi Gras break through this week.
"We've decided we are going to reopen Monday," Davis said. "We want more time to complete the move-in before students arrive."
A Monday opening isn't likely to happen, state fire officials said.
"The office is helpful, but not to the extent of overlooking safety," said Ashley Rodrigue, spokesperson for the Office of State Fire Marshal. "We don't usually say you can occupy this building until we say it's to code."
The school needs state approval before it can get a local building permit.
The private school has been in limbo ever since the state fire marshal said it had until March 8 to move out of its current Breaux Bridge location or come up with a plan of action for bringing the Breaux Bridge location into compliance.
The state first discovered the school was not in compliance in December 2017 and has let them remain in the building for more than a year. School officials said renovating the building in Breaux Bridge would be too expensive.
"We've been exceptionally lenient," Rodrigue said.
Angelle Architects submitted the plan with the Office of State Fire Marshal Monday.
"Our architects are reviewing it now," Rodrigue said Wednesday. "We are aware of their need for a quick turnaround, but it all depends on the plan they have turned in."
There is no cookie-cutter timeline for architectural review as each project is different, she added.
Usually, approval of the architectural drawing can be turned around in five days, if there are no issues, she said.
The plan must be clean, feasible and conform to the state fire code for it to be approved, she said. Only then can work be done to meet code requirements and issue a certificate of occupancy.
And only when the certificate of occupancy is issued can the school move into the building.
"The work has to be contracted, completed and inspected and approved for final occupancy," Rodrigue explained.
The building has no sprinkler system and is divided into two rooms separated by a fire-resistant wall. The building will be divided into three sections with the addition of a second fire partition, thus avoiding the need for a sprinkler system, according to the architectural drawing notes.
The partition will have fire sealant up to the roof deck.
Also, two 90-minute-rated hollow metal doors and frames will be installed in the new fire partition.
The architects also plan to install a new enhanced fire alarm system throughout the building.
The contractor — unnamed at this time — will submit shop drawings and paperwork to the fire marshal for review and approvals and pay all review fees.
T.M. Landry uses large, open classrooms. "As such, the large classrooms would normally require a sprinkler system on account of the code-calculated occupant load," the architects noted.
The enhanced fire system, the fire exits and a promise from the owner that occupancy wouldn't exceed 299 people will be equivalent to a sprinkler system, the plans said.
The owner will submit a "request for equivalency" to the fire marshal before the school takes occupancy, the architects said.
Also, the men's bathroom "shall be modified to allow for proper floor clearance for the adjacent toilet," the plans said.
The school, once touted for its record of placing graduates at Ivy League schools, has come under fire after a New York Times article about allegations of falsifying college applications and abuse of students by the school's leaders.
Enrollment at the school is at 75, down from 110 when the article published, Davis said.
The school has denied the allegations and hired a New Orleans law firm to conduct an investigation into the claims in the article. Former Louisiana education superintendent Paul Pastorek, now an education lawyer, was overseeing the investigation.
Davis, who became involved with the school in 2017 and has two grandchildren enrolled there, said he hopes the investigation will be complete this month and said results will be made public.
"I'm keeping myself at an arm's length from the investigation, so I can't give an exact timeline," he said.
"We are still open, still providing education for students," Davis said. "We have a strong core group of parents. The ones remaining, the parents, we still believe T.M. Landry is the best place for our children to be."
T.M. Landry hopes to move into this old skating rink in Lafayette.

Texto completo: A black man from Detroit is suing three white women for making up lies about him to police in order to keep him away from a community park.
Marc Peeples said the women falsely accused him of crimes from July 2017 to May 2018 as he built a garden in Hunt Park and worked to improve the surrounding neighborhood.
Peeples alleges that the women — Deborah Nash, Martha Callahan and Jennifer Morris — had their own plans for the park and wanted to see him "incarcerated or seriously injured by law enforcement."
The women told Detroit Police administrators in March 2018 that Peeples had stolen from houses near the park and threatened to burn down their homes and kill them, according to the lawsuit filed Feb. 25 in Wayne County Circuit Court.
Two months later, as Peeples was in Hunt Park teaching a group of homeschooled students about gardening, one of the women called 911 and falsely reported that Peeples was a convicted pedophile and wasn't legally allowed near kids, the complaint said. Police arrested Peeples in the park.
The allegations led to Peeples being charged with three counts of stalking. As a condition of his bond, he was barred from park. The women removed or covered some of the improvements Peeples had put in place, according to the lawsuit.
A Wayne County Circuit Court judge eventually tossed the case. The judge said the three women harassed Peeples, according to a report in the Detroit Metro Times.
NBC News reported that Peeples and his attorney, Robert Burton-Harris, describe what happened as a case of "gardening while black."
Nash, Callahan and Morris have unlisted phone numbers and could not be reached by the Free Press late Tuesday.
Nash told the New York Times in October that she called police because Peeples was damaging property.
"I am not a racist. I was all for the garden and even helped with supplies at first, but he threatened me several times, in person to my face, that I needed to leave my neighborhood or I would be put out one way or another," she told the Times. "I called the police because he was destroying property in the neighborhood and painting graffiti. No one had the right to paint park trees."
In the lawsuit, Peeples is seeking $300,000 in damages, plus costs and attorney fees.
A status conference has been scheduled for May 28.

Uber Faces No Charges in Self-Driving Car Fatality

Texto completo: Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge Uber with a crime in connection with an accident in which one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year ago.
On March 18, 2018, a Volvo sport utility vehicle, one of several self-driving vehicles that Uber was testing, was traveling about 40 miles per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg, 49, as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night, the authorities said.
While the car was in autonomous mode, a safety driver was sitting in the driver's seat.
The Yavapai County Attorney's Office, which reviewed the case, said in a letter dated Monday that there was "no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation."
But it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver "would or should have seen that night given the vehicle's speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors."
The Yavapai County Attorney's Office said an investigation into the case was continuing.
In June, the Tempe Police Department released a report that said the safety driver was streaming the television show "The Voice" on her phone in the minutes leading up to the crash, The Arizona Republic reported.
Uber declined to comment Tuesday, as did the Tempe police. The Yavapai County Attorney's Office did not answer further questions about how it reached its decision.
The March 2018 crash is believed to be the first pedestrian death resulting from self-driving technology, and many wondered how prosecutors would approach a criminal investigation.
The crash raised questions about the safety of the technology as well as the comprehensiveness of the rules governing it. Few such federal or state rules exist.
"It's not very well trod at all," said Frank Douma, a research scholar at the University of Minnesota's Center for Transportation Studies. "To my knowledge, there is not any sort of real bright-line statement about who's liable when."
Mr. Douma said prosecutors' announcement Tuesday tracked with how typically people, and not car manufacturers, are held responsible for crimes they commit behind the wheel. But, as autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated, he said, such cases raise questions about that way of thinking.
"Is this driver, or was this driver, behaving in any way different than what most drivers are going to be behaving like when the car is doing this much driving?" he said. "It's a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making."
The Yavapai County Attorney's Office did its review at the request of the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, which had a potential conflict of interest in the case because of an earlier partnership with Uber in a safety campaign. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The New York Times reported last March that Uber's autonomous cars in Arizona struggled to meet the company's expectations and required drivers to intervene more frequently than those of the company's competitors.
Uber suspended testing of self-driving vehicles after the crash. In December, the vehicles returned to public roads, though at reduced speeds and in less-challenging environments.
In a preliminary report about the crash released in May, the National Transportation Safety Board said the Uber car's computer system had spotted Ms. Herzberg six seconds before impact, but classified Ms. Herzberg, who was not in a crosswalk, first as an unrecognized object, then as another vehicle and finally as a bicycle.
The Uber car, equipped with Uber's sensing technology, comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer.
But Uber had disabled that function as well as other safety features to "reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior," according to the report, putting the onus on the safety driver to intervene.
The agency said Uber's safety driver grabbed the steering wheel to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact.
The Republic reported last March that family members of Ms. Herzberg had "resolved" a case against Uber. The Republic said that the family was represented by the law firm Bellah Perez, which said Tuesday that it could not comment on whether the firm had been involved in the case.

Texto completo: Beleaguered chef and former TV star Mario Batali is leaving the restaurant business.
Batali, who's been accused of harassing and sexually assaulting women, sold his shares in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group this week, the company said in an e-mail, adding that the deal terms are confidential. The Batali & Bastianich name is also going away.
Batali will soon end his affiliation with upscale Italian marketplace company Eataly, too, according to the New York Times.
Attempts to reach Eataly were unsuccessful.
The Bastianich family is well-known in the restaurant world. Matriarch Lidia Bastianich has six restaurants, is a best-selling cookbook author and an Emmy award-winning television host. Her son Joe is a noted restaurateur.
Lawsuit: Woman claims Mario Batali forcibly kissed, groped her
The industry responds: Suburban N. Y. chefs react to Mario Batali sexual harassment allegations
“I have reached an agreement with Joe and no longer have any stake in the restaurants we built together. I wish him the best of luck in the future," Batali said in a statement to the Times.
The Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group said it now has 16 restaurants. The two Bastianichs plus their daughter/sister Tanya Bastianich Manuali, who's worked for her mother's empire, and chef and former Batali business partner Nancy Silverton will be involved in the new business.
"Each restaurant is its own business, so the ownership of each varies somewhat from restaurant to restaurant," the company said in an e-mail. "Tanya and Joe have shares in all of the restaurants in which Mario had interests. Nancy, Lidia and others already have ownership interests in some of the restaurants. "
Joe Bastianich issued a statement in which he apologized and acknowledged that people were hurt by Batali's alleged behavior.
“While I never saw or heard of Mario groping an employee, I heard him say inappropriate things to our employees," he said. "Though I criticized him for it from time to time, I should have done more. I neglected my responsibilities as I turned my attention away from the restaurants. "
The Times cites anonymous ex-employees who said that they didn't believe Bastianich was unaware of Batali's alleged behavior.
A spokesman for Joe Bastianich declined to comment.
Welcome aboard: Businesses hire high-skill workers even if there's no job for them. Here's why
Starting a small business? Avoid these five mistakes
Batali's downfall began in December 2017 when the food website Eater New York posted a story featuring women's allegations that he'd touched them inappropriately.
“I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt," Eater quoted him as saying at the time. "Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. "
Reports of his alleged sexual misconduct prompted police investigations.
Batali was well-known even in nonfoodie circles, thanks to numerous cookbooks, a line of pasta sauces and TV appearances from the Food Network series "Molto Mario" to a co-host gig on the daytime show "The Chew. "
According to his website, he splits his time between New York and Northport, Michigan.
Late 2017 was the height of the #MeToo movement, which saw victims, most of whom were women, coming forward with allegations of sexual assault and harassment in a variety of industries from Hollywood to technology, media to music, advertising to academia.
The Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group said that last year, it made "a significant improvement" to its harassment policies and oversight by enabling employees who want to make claims against a corporate officer or owner to contact its "outside investigatory firm, which has discretion to independently investigate complaints and report to outside counsel. "
The company also said it's made significant changes to its human resources team and hired "an industry veteran in HR" to supplement the team, train employees and handle worker concerns.

‘No drama Obama’ in Utah: Former president talks about keeping cool during ‘polarized’ time

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says his wife is a “glass half empty” kind of person.
He’s not going to get in trouble for saying that, though, because former first lady Michelle Obama will admit it herself. He, on the other hand, identifies as more of an optimist.
“What’s happened to me successively over the last decade ... is a shedding of fear,” Obama said during the Qualtrics tech conference in Salt Lake City Wednesday. “‘No drama Obama,’ and all that. And what is true is that I have an even temper, and I don’t get too high, and I don’t get too low. But that doesn’t mean … there were not times where I wasn’t constrained by, ‘Man, I don’t want to screw this up.’”
In fact, Obama believes he was a better president in his second term than his first because he learned how to calm the fear of what people thought about him and learned how to take constructive criticism that was truly helpful.
“Ironically, by taking your ego out of what you do, it liberates you to do it and get more accomplished,” he said.
He worries about his two daughters and other young people in the world, he said, because they are growing up in a world where they are constantly thinking about what others think of them. On top of it all, the information everyone receives is fractured, and people form facts around their opinions rather than their opinions around facts.
“We live in such a polarized time. … If you watch Fox News, you’re in one reality, and if you read the New York Times you’re in a different reality, and if you’re at Buzzfeed you’re someplace else. It’s been challenging to have a common conversation,” he said.
“What I do hope people took away from our presidency … (is that) what we have in common matters more. And if we listen to the voices that help us rediscover our common hopes and dreams and values rather than constantly gravitating to those things that push us apart, that often times are designed to make us angry, … we can accomplish big things.”
Also joining Obama onstage were billionaire and Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson and actor and activist Ashton Kutcher.
This story will be updated.

Texto completo: In the window of calm between Michael Cohen's testimony and the allegedly almost-at-hand delivery of Robert Mueller's report, it's worth returning for a moment to the document that established the darkest interpretation of all the Russian weirdness swirling around President Donald Trump: the intelligence dossier created by Christopher Steele, late of MI6, on behalf of Trump's political opponents, which brought together the reports and rumors that Steele deemed credible about the then-candidate, now-president's Russia ties.
The Steele dossier made four big claims - or, since all those claims took the form of rumors and raw intelligence, let's say that it raised four big possibilities. One of them, soon well corroborated, was that Russian intelligence was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the release of stolen emails through WikiLeaks.
The next possibility was that a Russian project to cultivate Trump, supported and directed by Vladimir Putin, had been going on for many years, and included both offers of "sweetener real estate business deals" (which Trump supposedly declined) and "a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin" (which he supposedly accepted).
The third possibility was that this relationship dramatically influenced the 2016 campaign. According to Steele's sources, there was possibly "a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation" between Trump's campaign and Russian intelligence, managed by Paul Manafort with Michael Cohen playing go-between in Prague, which encompassed the DNC hacking - a crime carried out "with the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of his campaign team."
The final possibility, of course, was that Russia had so-called "kompromat" on Trump - above all, the pee tape.
Since its BuzzFeed publication in early 2017, the dossier's prominence has varied. It's probably cited more often in the defensive, pro-Trump press, where it's depicted as discredited gossip that tainted the Russia investigation's credibility from the start. But Russiagate enthusiasts and would-be honest brokers have also returned to it frequently - and for good reason, since it establishes a bar for Mueller's investigation that, if cleared, would absolutely deserve to end Trump's presidency.
If the DNC hack took place with Trump's cooperation as part of a long-standing exchange of favors, then he would be guiltier than Nixon, having participated in a Watergate with a foreign power as the burglar. If Mueller could prove that something like that happened, impeachment would be inevitable, and resignation or removal reasonably likely.
But will Mueller prove it? While retaining an official agnosticism, my sense after Cohen's testimony is that the odds are as low as they've been since this whole affair started, and the increasing likelihood is that the Steele dossier was, in fact, as Trump's defenders have long described it - a narrative primarily grounded in Russian disinformation.
That's because Cohen's testimony dovetailed with the always-more-plausible narrative in which Trump and his circle weren't collaborators but fools and wannabes, who might have been willing to play games with spies and hackers, but who mostly just bumbled around haplessly on the sidelines.
This is what you can see happening in the Trump Tower Moscow project, so far as I can tell - instead of Putin offering Trump a sweetheart deal, it seems to have involved his fixers trying to get the Russian government's attention, to no practical end. And it's also the sense left by Cohen's testimony that he witnessed Trump taking a call from Roger Stone in the summer of 2016, in which Stone claimed to have just heard from Julian Assange about "a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign."
This happened at a time when WikiLeaks had already been hinting at an email dump, so Stone was not exactly delivering privileged information. Trump, according to Cohen, responded "to the effect of stating wouldn't that be great.'" This doesn't seem like how a yearslong collaboration with Russian intelligence would unfold.
Meanwhile on every other Russia-related front, Cohen - with every reason to knife his former boss - offered dossier-discrediting denials. He never went to Prague to meet with Russian intelligence, as the dossier alleged, never heard anything about kompromat, and never had any direct evidence of Trumpian collusion with the Russians.
Is it possible that a real conspiracy was run without the knowledge of the president's trusted and then-proudly shady fixer? In theory, yes; it could have all happened through figures like Manafort, who we know shared campaign polling data, at least, with a Russian-intelligence-linked figure. But if the dossier's claim of a years-long Trump-Kremlin entanglement and its claim of Cohen's direct involvement are both looking implausible or false, then its claims about a sustained Manafort-managed collaboration should be treated extremely skeptically as well.
In which case the most likely l'affaire Russe endgame may be a special prosecutor's report that doesn't make Trump look good or decent or moral, but which implicitly exonerates him of conspiring with the Russians, and makes a lot of Mueller watchers extremely unhappy in the process.
On the eve of Muellerdamerung, that's what this agnostic very cautiously expects.

Texto completo: Bears-Packers.
Ali-Frazier.
Bud-Miller.
Like any great rivals, the nation's two dominant beer companies are never quite at ease with each other. But for the first time in years, their cold war has become a heated battle, sparked by Anheuser-Busch's now-infamous Super Bowl commercials spotlighting MillerCoors' use of corn syrup in its two leading brands, Miller Lite and Coors Light.
It's little wonder that the commercial led to sniping. What is perhaps surprising is that the sniping festers nearly a month later. The latest twist came this week, as MillerCoors pulled out of a potential brand-agnostic partnership, at least temporarily, with Anheuser-Busch and other large breweries to promote the American beer industry.
"This is an all-or-nothing proposition to us," MillerCoors spokesman Adam Collins said this week. "As long as the industry leader is attacking an ingredient widely used across the beer industry, we're not going to spend any time or money on an industry health campaign."
(And, yes, corn syrup -- or some kind of sugar additive -- is indeed commonly used to aid fermentation.)
Anheuser-Busch remains largely unrepentant. "Consumers are demanding more transparency around the food and drink they consume, and Bud Light is leading the transparency movement for beer," Cesar Vargas, Anheuser-Busch's vice president of legal and corporate affairs said in a statement.
"The use of corn syrup in Miller Lite and Coors Light is a key difference from Bud Light. ... We will continue to lead the effort toward increased transparency as it benefits the entire beer industry," he said in the statement.
Those outside the beer world may shake their heads as the industry titans continue to bicker, but both clearly see plenty at stake; nearly all of the major light beer brands have suffered in recent years at the hands of imports, craft, wine, spirits and cannabis. And for that reason, Harry Schuhmacher, editor and publisher of Beer Business Daily, isn't surprised that tensions have festered.
"In any other consumer packaged-good industry, you'd be surprised, but beer, even though it has become so much more corporatized, it's so very, very competitive on a personal level," Schuhmacher said. "It's more than just business."
Miller obviously considers itself as an aggrieved party and has spent ample time highlighting the feud. Anheuser-Busch, meanwhile, has lurched from stick-to-its guns righteousness -- after all, who doesn't want clarity about what's in their beer? -- to repairing self-inflicted damage.
How did we get here?

The groundwork
I. No, this doesn't simply begin with the Super Bowl ads.
The roots stretch at least to 2016 and a series of Miller Lite ads taking aim at Bud Light. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch notes it was "the first time in several years that Miller Lite has called out the top-selling beer in America, Bud Light, by name in its advertising."
The campaign, which is ongoing, is rooted in the idea that Miller Lite has "more taste than Bud Light." Miller even creeps into Anheuser-Busch's backyard -- St. Louis.
Anheuser-Busch is not amused, filing a complaint with the National Advertising Division. In December, NAD rules Miller is within its rights to make such a claim (even if it shouldn't have, despite being the better beer.)
II. In January, Bud Light surprises industry onlookers by declaring that "ingredients should be right on the packaging." It begins doing just that, listing water, barley, rice and hops as the components of the nation's top-selling beer (a list that curiously ignores yeast). It also lists nutritional information.
Anheuser-Busch has historically embraced obfuscation as much as or more than transparency, which makes industry onlookers wonder: What is the company's long-term play? They'll find out soon enough.
III. A day before the Super Bowl, Schuhmacher -- who is as plugged in as anyone on the industry -- hears rumblings: Anheuser-Busch plans to respond to Miller's "more taste" ads.
And it is being particularly secretive about those plans.

The big game
I. The match is lit: During a snooze fest of a Super Bowl, Anheuser-Busch airs the first of the three commercials. Miller Lite and Coors Light are made with corn syrup! Bud Light is not!
II. Within 15 minutes, Miller bites back.
We see your ingredients and raise you calories and carbs!
III. At the exact same time -- 6:13 p.m. -- the gloves start coming off. Pete Marino, MillerCoors' chief communication officer, nods at the elephant in the room.
Corn syrup isn't the same as high-fructose corn syrup ... which you use, Anheuser-Busch!
IV. Two hours later, it becomes clear Anheuser-Busch has a bigger problem than MillerCoors. Corn farmers are pissed.
"Bud Light, you're not standing with corn farmers, we're not standing with you," Iowa corn farmer Kevin Ross says in a moment of social media video fame -- 906,000 views and counting -- while pouring at least four Bud Lights down his bathroom sink.

Fallout
I. Two days after the game.
Anheuser-Busch: We're doubling down!
II. Two days after the game.
MillerCoors: We're taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times!
III. Three days after the game.
Anheuser-Busch: Dear God, what have we done?
IV. Five days after the game.
Anheuser-Busch: No, seriously, what have we done? Better get Busch Light involved. After all, it's made with corn! Wait -- why did we denigrate corn in the first place?
V. One week after the game.
MillerCoors: We love farmers! And we're going to prove it by toasting them!
VI. Three days later.
Anheuser-Busch: Wait! We also love farmers! Can we get in on your toast thingy?
VII. A day later.
Anheuser-Busch: Now that we've successfully horned in on your toast thingy, as part of the world's largest beer company, there's no problem we can't solve by throwing gobs of money at it.
VIII. MillerCoors: Did we mention we love corn farmers?
IX. MillerCoors: I mean, we really, really love corn farmers! A lot. So much more than Anheuser-Busch.
X. MillerCoors seems to sense an advantage in the conflict.
Its blog publishes at least four articles about what has become known as #corngate -- though #corntroversy is obviously the far superior hashtag -- including one that gleefully tracks Anheuser-Busch's changing story about the corn syrup ads. Then MillerCoors announces it wants no part of the industry initiative.
Anheuser-Busch, meanwhile, seems to sense an advantage of its own. Schuhmacher reported Thursday that Anheuser-Busch is adding an ingredients panel to a second brand: Bud Light Orange. Ingredients include barley, cane sugar, natural flavors, citric acid, orange peel, hop extract and, yes, corn. (But no corn syrup.)
"I think this is a long play for them," Schuhmacher said.

What's next
More of the same is most likely ahead.
Anheuser-Busch is still running the ads denigrating MillerCoors' use of corn -- while also promoting Busch Light's use of corn -- and pledging to do what it can to boost the health of the industry, regardless of MillerCoors' involvement.
"We, along with other members of our industry, remain fully committed to strengthening the beer category, and our joint efforts to highlight the very positive impact that beer has on our economy and in our communities will continue as planned," Vargas said in a statement.
But as Schuhmacher reported this week, the conflict seems to be serving no one: Sales of the key brands involved in the #corntroversy are all down since the Super Bowl.
Could light beer brands sniping at each other simply be turning drinkers off to all of them? Quite possibly, though, funny enough, the brand hurting the most during the four weeks ending Feb. 16 is -- yup, you guessed it -- Bud Light, down 7.7 percent. (Coors Light was down 5.8 in the period, and Miller Lite was down 1.2 percent.)
"My personal fear, as someone who covers the industry and cares about it, is that this could just drive people away from beer -- the back-and-forth and demonizing of ingredients," Schuhmacher said.
The worst outcome he said, would be beer drinkers washing their hands of the conflict by choosing to, instead, buy the swiftly growing Tito's Handmade Vodka -- which, he noted, is made with corn.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is continuing to go after President Donald Trump - by targeting his son-in-law Jared Kushner's security clearance.
The Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties plans to introduce legislation this week to create the White House Security Clearance Accountability Act.
The move is a response to New York Times reporting that Trump ordered granting of a top-secret security clearance to Kushner - overriding objections from intelligence agencies.
"The president continues to jeopardize our national security in service of his own personal interests," Wasserman Schultz said in a statement released by her office. Assuming the report is accurate, she said it is "yet another dangerous example of the president's flagrant disregard for our national security."
The legislation would revoke the security clearance of a White House employee who lies about contacts with foreign nationals on their security clearance forms and anyone under investigation by a federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government - provisions Wasserman Schultz believes would cover Kushner.
The president's son-in-law is a senior adviser to the president.
The legislation would also require the Government Accountability Office to report on "any instance" during Trump's presidency in which a White House official received a security clearance over the objection of career security staff.
With Republicans in control of the Senate, Wasserman Schultz's legislation has no real chance of becoming law.
But with Democrats now in control of the House, her proposal could advance farther than her last attempt to go after Kushner's security clearance.
In 2017, Wasserman Schultz offered amendments in the House Appropriations Committee that would have revoked Kushner's security clearance under the same criteria as her latest attempt: revoking the clearance of a White House staff member criminal investigation for aiding a foreign government or deliberately omitting meetings with foreign governments from their security clearance forms.
Republicans then controlled the House and stopped her effort, which U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, dismissed as "purely a political stunt." U.S. Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, said they were "utterly unnecessary."
Wasserman Schultz is a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She was a prominent 2016 supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and has repeatedly vowed to act as a check and balance on the Trump presidency. Andrew Pollack, a Republican who has gained political prominence in the year since his daughter was among the 17 people killed at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, said on Twitter Monday that Wasserman Schultz isn't credible.
Wasserman Schultz "rigged a presidential primary and was forced to resign as @DNC chair," Pollack wrote. "Now states that she wants to revoke security clearance of @jaredkushner because she thinks he's not trust worthy."
Pollack is a supporter of the president. He was referring to claims by supporters of Bernie Sanders, an unsuccessful candidate for the 2016 Democratic nomination that Wasserman Schultz skewed the nominating process to help Clinton. She said she never tipped the scales toward Clinton.
She resigned as chairwoman as the 2016 Democratic National Convention was starting after stolen party emails showed party staffers favored Clinton over Sanders during the nominating process.

Egyptian photojournalist free after 5 years; Mahmoud Abou Zeid became a symbol of the clampdown on press freedom.

Texto completo: Mahmoud Abou Zeid went to work one day in 2013 and came home 5 1/2 years later.
The Egyptian photojournalist, who became an international symbol of the government's clampdown on press freedom, was released Monday morning and reunited with his family after being imprisoned for photographing the security forces' violent dispersal of a protest camp.
Though Abou Zeid's release procedures started on Feb. 16, protocol required that he be transferred to a police station in his neighborhood before being freed. He was released from the Haram station in Giza, near his home.

A selfie of a beaming Abou Zeid, 31, along with his father and older brother on the street in his first moments of freedom, was shared on the Facebook page "Freedom for Shawkan" (as he is popularly known) and on Twitter.
Speaking to reporters outside his home, Abou Zeid said he felt "as if I was flying" in the first moments after his release, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported. He tried to put a positive spin on his imprisonment. "It's bitter, but it lets one look at life from a different perspective, a new perspective that one can't see except from this place."
Abou Zeid won't enjoy complete freedom. He will remain under police observation for five years and has to spend his nights -- from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. -- at the police station. He also faces further financial and property-related restrictions.
The freelance journalist's ordeal had made him one of Egypt's most high-profile prisoners and drew international protest against President Abdel Fattah Sisi, whose government has sharply reined in the Egyptian press. Only two countries, Turkey and China, imprison more journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Egypt has imprisoned the most for spreading "false news."
"We are relieved to hear that Shawkan is finally free after spending over five years in jail and call on authorities to end their shameful treatment of this photojournalist by removing any conditions to his release," said the committee's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, Sherif Mansour, in a statement published on the group's website. "The Egyptian government should take steps immediately to improve its image, which has been badly tarnished by this unjust imprisonment -- and it can start by releasing all journalists jailed in relation to their work."
Abou Zeid's release comes just two days after another Egyptian photojournalist, Ahmed Gamal Ziada, was granted release on bail. Ziada disappeared for two weeks after being detained on his return to Cairo International Airport from Tunisia on Jan. 29. He is accused of spreading false news on social media. It also comes two weeks after a New York Times correspondent and the paper's former Cairo bureau chief, David Kirkpatrick, was held incommunicado on his arrival at Cairo's airport for seven hours and then deported.
Abou Zeid was arrested on Aug. 14, 2013, while photographing the security forces' raid of a sit-in held in support of Egypt's first democratically elected president, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi, after he was toppled by the military. More than 800 people were killed in one of the bloodiest moments in the country's modern history.
Abou Zeid was one of 739 defendants, mainly supporters of the since-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, in a mass trial criticized by international rights groups. All the defendants were charged with murder and being a member of a terrorist organization, and faced the possibility of the death penalty; Abou Zeid was spared but 75 others, including senior Brotherhood members, were not.
The photographer was not sentenced until last September, when he was given a term of five years. That made him immediately eligible to be released for time served. He was among 215 people in similar circumstances, all sentenced to the same term that day, most stemming from the pro-Morsi demonstration.
Their release was delayed by an additional six months for unpaid judicial fees and alleged damage to property during the raid on the protest camp at Rabaa al Adawiya Square. Authorities, however, never gave them a chance to pay and the defendants were never told how much they owed.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS –
gaming conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A trip to Israel to talk about cybersecurity and mental health. A New Orleans conference for consumer credit advocates. Each year, several Southwest Ohio lawmakers spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on out-of-state travel. They meet legislators from other states, learn about how foreign countries tackle problems and make connections that could help them professionally and politically.
But figuring out how much each lawmaker travels and who pays for those trips is far from easy. Legislators must report some travel for official business on annual ethics forms but not all. Some lawmakers use campaign contributions to pay for travel and document trips there. But lawmakers can also receive free trips from national groups or pay for the trips themselves – it's impossible to tell.
Some lawmakers keep diligent records. Since 2013, Butler County Sen. Bill Coley has spent at least $80,000 on out-of-state travel to conferences in places like London, Brazil and Miami using his campaign contributions.
Coley reported spending more on out-of-state travel than other Southwest Ohio lawmakers, according to an Enquirer review of 23 legislators' financial disclosure forms and campaign expenditures. Former Rep. Alicia Reece, D-Roselawn, came in second, spending at least $21,000 in campaign money on out-of-state travel since 2013.
If other Cincinnati-area lawmakers traveled more than Coley, there's no way to tell. A loophole in Ohio's ethics forms allows legislators to travel to certain conferences without disclosing the cost of their trip.
Coley sees the travel as vital to his role as a lawmaker. At one conference, he discovered Ohio was one of nine states that don't tax promotional gaming. At another, he learned about transmitting patient data wirelessly.
"My staff hates it when I travel. The whole time I'm texting them ideas. I'm constantly bothering them," Coley told The Enquirer.
And he pays for the trips with campaign donations.
"My supporters are aware I utilize campaign funds to do that. I don't want to use taxpayer funds," Coley said.
Travel trips up ex-speaker Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April. Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, took trips to destinations such as England, Israel and France – paid for by outside groups or campaign accounts, both his and House Republicans'. The FBI is still looking into that spending, but Rosenberger's attorney says the former lawmaker did nothing wrong.
The full scope of Rosenberger's travel wasn't detailed on any single form. The Enquirer and other Ohio reporters requested the former speaker's emails, calendars and flight details to detail the scope ot it. The FBI subpoenaed hundreds of pages of documents.
Those records revealed Rosenberger took about 50 trips – some personal, but most professional – to locales, such as Normandy, France and Italy; Iceland before his London trip; Los Angeles; Bonita Springs, Florida for an annual GOP fundraiser and China over three years.
Rosenberger disclosed spending nearly $60,000 on travel (in addition to mileage to the Ohio Statehouse) between 2013 and 2017, according to ethics forms. In comparison, Ryan Smith, who became speaker after Rosenberger resigned, disclosed $5,400 in travel during that time. Ohio Senate President Larry Obhof reported nearly $2,400 and current House Speaker Larry Householder reported $0. In January 2017, Householder and his sons took a FirstEnergy corporate airplane to the presidential inauguration in Washington D.C., according to a Dayton Daily News report.
Rosenberger's travel went far beyond that of most other lawmakers – even those in leadership positions. Still, local legislators have booked expensive trips as well. Sen. Cecil Thomas, D-North Avondale, traveled to Israel to learn about cybersecurity in 2016. Rep. Bill Seitz, R-Green Township, reported a $1,200 trip from the conservative Heartland Institute in 2015. Hyde Park Rep. Brigid Kelly joined a bipartisan group to Israel's University of Haifa in 2017.
Despite outrage over Rosenberger's expensive and extensive travel, no changes have been made to curtail legislators' out-of-state travel or force them to disclose more details about who paid for it.
Ohio's travel disclosure loophole Ohio lawmakers report some of their travel to the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee, a bipartisan group that oversees legislators and lobbyists.
But there's a big loophole: lawmakers are not required to list travel to conferences of national or state organizations that receive dues from the Legislature. That list includes the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which recently held meetings in Grand Rapids, New Orleans and Nashville, and the National Conference of State Legislatures, which held its annual conference in Los Angeles last summer.
Several lawmakers attended these conferences, but none were required to detail who paid for their flights, hotels or food. Some used campaign money for the travel and reported the expenses there, but many did not.
Groups like ALEC draft model bills for lawmakers nationwide and have "tremendous influence," said Catherine Turcer, executive director of the good government group Common Cause Ohio. "We should be able to follow the money of lawmakers who travel to those conferences."
The risk: lawmakers are wined and dined by lobbyists without constituents in Ohio ever knowing, Turcer said.
"Anytime we make a decision not to require really good disclosure, wealthy interests or special interests are going to get in there," Turcer said.
But Coley said he sees no problem with the loophole on certain travel. It encourages lawmakers to attend conferences where they can learn from policymakers across the nation and beyond.
"You want to make sure you have people that are well informed and coming up with the best ideas to improve things in Ohio," Coley said. "It's hard to do that when you're not availing yourself of every opportunity to learn."
No push for change There's little pressure to change a rule that benefits both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. The last time legislators took a hard look at ethics rules, New Richmond Republican Tom Niehaus was leading the Ohio Senate, and he left in 2012, Turcer said.
Last year, Rep. Niraj Antani, R-Miamisburg, proposed banning lawmakers from accepting free international trips and documenting more information about the food and gifts they receive. The bill received no hearings. Antani hasn't yet decided if he will try again.
Ohioans aren't alone in struggling to document lawmakers' travel. While wildfires burned in California, some of its legislators were in Maui being lobbied by utility officials, according to a New York Times report. In response, a progressive advocacy group demanded that lawmakers report travel in real time.
Ohio lawmakers aren't required to file travel expenses in real time either. Ethics forms for the previous year aren't available until the spring, so constituents can't look up their lawmaker's 2018 travel for another several months. If lawmakers use their campaign contributions to pay for travel, those receipts are filed more regularly – but are still months behind.
"It's never too late for somebody to step forward," Turcer said. "This is really the time to think about good rules."

Texto completo: The journalist Silvana Paternostro was born in Barranquilla, Colombia, the place where Gabriel García Márquez congregated with friends and fellow writers, several of whom became characters in his novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude." Paternostro had moved to the United States as a teenager before she grasped García Márquez's towering importance for herself. Later, she would attend a three-day journalism workshop led by the author. In writing "Solitude & Company," her oral history of the Nobel Prize winner's life before and after he found fame, she learned that several people closest to the author (his friends called him Gabo) had essentially taken a vow of silence to protect his privacy, "as if you were in the mafia." Below, Paternostro talks about finding plenty of other people who would talk, García Márquez's superstitions and discipline, and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
I got the idea to do the book in 2010, and it came out in Spanish in 2014. But it had been gestating without me being aware of it in many ways. I was born and grew up in the exact geographical area where "One Hundred Years of Solitude" takes place. I would hear stories about him and his friends; they were a crazy bunch, like our own Beat poets. My uncle knew them. I went to school with some of their children.
When Tina Brown started Talk magazine, she did a section of oral history. I got a call from the magazine in 2000, saying "We want to do an oral history of García Márquez, would you be interested?" I was, of course.
It was a magazine piece, 2,000 words, but I just couldn't stop my tape recorder. I knew there was this pact among people who would not betray his friendship. But there were others -- everyone had an encounter with García Márquez.
Talk closed before the oral history appeared. I published it in The Paris Review.
In 2010, by chance, I saw García Márquez at the inauguration of a museum in Mexico City. He didn't look so well. There were thousands of people there: the president of Mexico; the richest man in Mexico. And I saw how thousands of people, instead of going up to them, all went to García Márquez. With love. My heart skipped a beat, and I was curious: Who was this who had turned into our Latin John Lennon? So I think the book was born that day. I realized that I needed to give it more of a structure, so I went out and did a second round of interviews.
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
I was really surprised that he was as superstitious as he was -- that he didn't attend funerals, even of his friends. Some people maybe begrudged the fact that he didn't go, but he was really superstitious and panicked by it. These are little things, but they're very telling.
The one big thing that really struck me was his discipline. Because I know where we come from, where pranksterism and Caribbean laissez-faire are the rule of the day. This young boy who grew up with really very little in his favor turned out to be the man who put Latin American literature on the map. And he wanted to; it wasn't a fluke. He told himself that he would write a book that would be as important as "Don Quixote," and he did.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
There are people that have spent most of their lives as Gabo experts. I don't think I'm a Gabo expert. I had a curiosity in understanding the man before and the man he became later. But along the way, I became the repository of all these incredible stories, and I felt it was almost my obligation to share them. Especially in this English version, I did something I didn't do in the Spanish: I included things that would make readers understand Colombia. It turned into a book that explains our music, the violence, the idiosyncrasies of the region. When I was growing up, it was red alert: Don't go. Now that Colombia has become a travel destination, the book, while it's not a travel guide, is a companion to travel to Colombia with.
It also became a perfect, fun thing to have if you want to go read his books again. It became many, many things more than the magazine story I set out to write.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
I am in awe of ballet dancers. I took many ballet classes in my youth. I spent a lot of time in Panama. Margot Fonteyn, who to me was the epitome of the elegance of ballet dancing, was there, and she brought a lot of incredible dancers to Panama. So I had the great privilege to see a lot of amazing ballet dancers live. When I was just a young intern at a Panama newspaper, Alexander Godunov was going to dance "Don Quixote," and I asked my editor if I could go interview him. And I did. I waited for him to come out, a summer intern with a tape recorder and a photographer. He was exhausted but agreed to sit with me. It was my first interview.
I admire so much the rigor and the discipline it takes to become a professional dancer, and the strength the body needs to create the beauty of those movements. After a long day at the writing desk, I will play around with my dance moves and stretch like a dancer.
Persuade someone to read "Solitude & Company" in 50 words or less.
You'll come to one of the best parties you've ever been to, privy to uncensored stories from those who knew García Márquez, including some naughty gossip. You'll hobnob with a former president and incredible writers. You'll learn about the process of writing and the nature of friendship.
This interview has been condensed and edited.

Democrats sometimes pole-vault over leaders

Texto completo: Two Colorado Democrats were spending some time in Iowa in recent days assessing support for possible presidential runs.
Former Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet were both campaigning in the state that will hold the nation’s first presidential nominating contest — the Iowa caucuses — while trying to make up their minds whether to jump into an increasingly packed pool of candidates hoping to deny President Donald Trump a second term.
It’s looking like there will be an outsized number of Democrats seeking the 2020 nomination — probably at least as many as the 17 Republicans who ran in 2016 and more than the 16 Democrats who ran in 1976.
Democrats with insight into both potential presidential candidates’ thinking say they’ll be considering a number of factors before deciding whether to throw their own hats in the ring — from fundraising potential to whether or not they’ve got the proverbial fire in the belly.
Hickenlooper said during a recent swing through early primary state New Hampshire that he was “determined” to decide whether to run within the next month, “or let’s say six weeks” — putting his self-imposed deadline as late as the last week of March.
Bennet hasn’t set a timetable for his decision, but in a recent appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he told moderator Chuck Todd, “We’ve got a million people that are going to run, which I think is great. I think having one more voice in that conversation that’s focused on America’s future, I don’t think would hurt.”
Even if one or both get in, odds are decent they might not make it to next February’s Iowa caucuses. With so congested a field, there are plenty of off-ramps and opportunities to run out of gas between now and then — from underwhelming fundraising to lackluster performances in the debates and other forums that kick off in June and continue through the winter.
Those close to both Coloradans say they are still very much exploring whether to run, though all signs point to a Hickenlooper candidacy.
The PredictIt odds-making site as of Feb. 20 put the former governor’s chances of running at 87 percent, down slightly from his peak but also the best chances of any potential candidate included in the betting market’s roundup.
That’s higher than former Vice President Joe Biden’s 76 percent chance or former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s 74 percent, and gives Hickenlooper better odds than Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose 85 percent ranks him as the second-most likely to get in the race.
Bennet’s name hasn’t been included in the PredictIt tallies, but a recent “guesstimate” compiled by the New York Times put his chances of running in the lowest tier of potential candidates, at 25 percent. The paper noted that Bennet doesn’t have the national profile of some of his fellow senators but is “weighing whether there is room in the field for a less fiery Democrat.”
If either of them gets in, history could be on their side when it comes to having a shot at the nomination.
Political data guru Nate Silver took a look before the crowded 2012 Republican presidential nominating contest at whether early primary polling — conducted during the first six months of the year before a presidential election — did a good job predicting the eventual nominee.
Silver examined elections since 1972, when something at least resembling the modern nominating process took shape.
The two parties, it turns out, operate differently.
Over a span of decades, in years when GOP incumbents weren’t seeking re-election, Republicans have nearly always wound up nominating their early front-runners.
The only exception was in 2008 when John McCain ran second in early polling behind Rudy Giuliani, who tanked once it came time to cast ballots. In every other race, early polling advantages translated to nominations for Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole and George W. Bush.
(Silver’s analysis pre-dated the tumultuous 2016 Republican primary, but eventual nominee Donald Trump led plenty of polls conducted during the first half of 2015 — before he entered the race — with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush offering the most competition. Once Trump made his campaign official, he led in nearly every survey.)
On the Democratic side, it’s been a different story.
Using the same metric — presidential primaries without an incumbent unopposed for another term — Silver found that Democrats were as likely to opt for someone who polled back in the pack as they were to pick the early favorite.
And in a few cases, candidates who bear a resemblance to Hickenlooper and Bennet wound up taking the prize — and even winning the presidency.
In 1972, South Dakota Sen. George McGovern was barely a blip in early polling — averaging 5 percent support, enough for fifth place among 13 candidates included in polls — but went on to win the nomination.
The next time around, an obscure moderate governor, Georgia’s Jimmy Carter, pulled in 1 percent support in early polls, good enough to tie for 12th place in a field that saw 20 Democrats included in early surveys.
In 1988, Mike Dukakis, another moderate governor, this time from Massachusetts, came in third place in early polling with 7.5 percent support and went on to win the Democrats’ nomination.
Four years later, Bill Clinton of Arkansas — yet another moderate governor — was only showing 1.7 percent support in the first six months of 1991, tied for 13th place in a field that included lots of Democrats who didn’t wind up running. He took the nomination and unseated an incumbent president.
In other elections over the years, Democrats have nominated their early front-runner — former Vice Presidents Walter Mondale in 1984 and Al Gore in 2000 — or tapped the candidate who was running a strong second a year ahead of balloting, including Sens. John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008. (The same pattern held true in 2016, when former senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the early favorite, won the nomination.)
It’s worth noting that the Democratic Party is constantly evolving and, in many ways, bears little resemblance to the party that nominated McGovern, Carter, Dukakis and Clinton, though there are also echoes of each of those elections in the current environment.
As well, if they run, Hickenlooper and Bennet will likely face a bevy of similarly situated rivals — centrist white guys trying their darnedest to stand out from the crowd.
But as the two Colorado Democrats approach their decisions, they can at least be confident that there’s precedent for candidates resembling them to go the distance and have a shot at the brass ring.

Texto completo: As Boston prepared for a second year of court-ordered busing in 1975, Doris Davis of Roslindale High School's biracial council praised headmaster Don Burgess and the steps he took to ensure student safety.
“The principal's working hard," Davis, whose two nephews attended the school, told the Globe.
He was “the kind of guy that if he sees a problem with your kids, he'll call you," she added. “He doesn't just send those students to the bus. He takes them out there."
Dr. Burgess, a former Massachusetts State Track Coaches Association president whose teaching and coaching career spanned two decades, died Jan. 21 in Naples, Fla., from complications of surgery. He was 86 and divided his time between Naples and Milton.
Known for accepting and overcoming challenges, Dr. Burgess was the last headmaster at Roslindale High, which closed in 1976 and merged with West Roxbury, and the first headmaster at the then-new West Roxbury High. In 1978, he became District 3 community superintendent in Boston.
“Don saw the big picture," said Don Pellegrini, a former assistant headmaster at West Roxbury High who succeeded Dr. Burgess as headmaster. “But he also realized if you didn't take care of the little things, the big picture would never occur."
Bob Glennon, a former head track coach at three area high schools who taught science at West Roxbury High, said Dr. Burgess was “able to listen to others while calmly working through a problem. But he always let you know he was in charge, and he always had his students and athletes in mind."
Dr. Burgess was assistant headmaster, math department chair, and assistant football coach at Boston English Highbefore becoming Roslindale High's headmaster. He previously taught math and coached at Whitman-Hanson Regional High, Scituate High, and Boston Technical High.
At Tech, he was head track coach of several powerhouse championship teams and had been assistant football coach.
In February 1968, after Tech concluded its third straight undefeated season against city schools with its third consecutive Boston Regimental Track & Field championship at Commonwealth Armory, Dr. Burgess noted that his team had practiced in school corridors.
And while the marble floors were “bad for the feet," the school was big, which meant “long corridors, and long corridors mean a long straightaway," he said.
As assistant football coach, he helped mastermind a 14-6 victory against previously unbeaten North Quincy High in 1968, plucking senior Chris Kerins from the cross-country team and suggesting that Tech run a ball-control offense to eat up the clock.
Kerins, who ran the second half kickoff back for an 85-yard touchdown, recalled that Dr. Burgess “was always thinking of ways to get better and he was extremely committed. He said if you believe in yourself, there's not much you can't do."
A son of Clifford Burgess, a Brookline police officer, and the former Teresa O'Leary, Donald Burgess graduated from Boston College High and Boston College. He received a master's from Boston State College and a doctorate at BC.
He married Irene Keenan in 1958 and the couple were living in Plymouth when he passed the exam to teach mathematics in Boston's school system. In 1964, they moved to Milton, where he was a chairman of the town's School Committee.
There was a time, however, when Dr. Burgess contemplated a different line of work. He had taken a leave of absence from Whitman-Hanson to work for the National Security Agency in Washington, D.C., where he learned code-breaking and how to speak Russian.
His family said that his love of teaching and coaching, and a nostalgic summertime stint playing semi-pro football, brought him back to Whitman-Hanson and his original career path.
In 1974, The New York Times reported that as Roslindale headmaster, Dr. Burgess had “created an orderly environment in which the students are treated with respect," and added that “discipline is swift and just."
Before his first year as headmaster at the new West Roxbury High, Dr. Burgess spent the summer with his staff working out logistics, including scheduling and moving materials from Roslindale High.
“My goals for students and myself haven't changed," he told the Globe in 1976. “But now I have a facility I can work with. It's all a question of deciding what you can do for the kids that are there."
His Boston experience led to stints observing schools in Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio, on behalf of the US Department of Justice. He was also interviewed by Walter Cronkite during the early, tumultuous days of busing in Boston.
In 1976, the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration honored him with a Paul Revere Bowl as Outstanding Public Administrator.
From 1982 to 1992, Dr. Burgess was superintendent of schools in Walpole.
“Don made a good school system even better," said Tom Cibotti, who succeeded him. “He was incredibly knowledgeable in curriculum and exceptional in dealing with various committees. His opinions were based on fact and he brought people together."
At a funeral Mass in late January, his son Phillip of Boston said in a eulogy that Dr. Burgess was “a fighter. He had endured numerous physical challenges since childhood. He never complained and plowed right through it."
Those challenges had included several leg surgeries, a pacemaker, and losing a kidney to cancer.
Phillip marveled at how his father once worked three jobs — as a schoolteacher, as a coach, and as a calculus instructor at Northeastern University — leaving the house at 6 a.m. and returning at 9 p.m.
Dr. Burgess, a director at the Walpole Co-operative Bank at the time of his death, was an inductee to the Massachusetts State Track Coaches Association Hall of Fame.
In addition to his wife, Irene, and his son Phillip, Dr. Burgess leaves a daughter, Martha Bennett of Boston; three other sons, John of New York City, Clifford of Greenville, S.C., and Peter of Miami; two brothers, Edward of Ludlow and Richard of Kingston; and 12 grandchildren.
“Don was a real gentleman, smart and fair with a dry sense of humor," recalled Freddy Ahern, a tailback on Boston Tech's 1968 football team who went on to a professional hockey career. “He'd rib you and encourage you, and you knew he really enjoyed what he did."
Irene Burgess admired her husband's honesty.
“What you saw was what you got, and he'd be the first to tell you what he thought," she said. “In the time he's been retired, all we did was laugh. That's how we were. We truly enjoyed one another."

Texto completo: Someday you may need to sue someone. It rarely works when done wrong. And it’s usually done wrong.
There are some basic guidelines for doing it better:
For small bucks, small claims court works. But for this route, prepare well. Much exists online and in books about navigating these courts. Several states like California, Michigan and Nebraska won’t let you use an attorney. Rules vary by state. If you’re alone and your opponent has a good attorney, you’re at a huge disadvantage.
Sadly, any lawyer can go to court. In decades overseeing dispute resolution at my firm, the worst litigation advice I’ve gotten came from lawyers who weren't actual trial lawyers. They think they know but don’t – like some text-book-only surgeon. Ignore them. It’s bloody.

Think 'first chair' attorney
When it comes to legal fights, envision a one-on-one sport. Your opponent does it often. You never have, or maybe twice. So, you'll likely lose – making beginners’ mistakes your opponent doesn’t. For that reason, businesses often win against individuals – having built trial law muscle over decades. And the biggest mistake individuals make is picking wrong lawyers. My best advice? Learn to pick a good trial lawyer. Trial law is a unique art form.
You want what is called a good “first chair” trial lawyer. In TV court dramas where three lawyers sit together, the first chair is the one speaking to the judge. The others, support and prep litigators, whisper in the first chair’s ear. Most of the best first chairs I’ve known were never, ever those other prep litigators. First chairs, in your case, likely appear in court alone. Great ones rarely work for large law firms.
Dispute resolution is supposed to be about facts and law. Rarely does it morph successfully into theatrics.
Good trial lawyers needn’t be subject matter experts to win. They learn what they need so they can do what is necessary. But they’re super experts in the art of trial combat.
Resources to find a lawyer
Still, prior subject expertise doesn’t hurt. If suing your broker, it’s handled via arbitration under the brokers’ self-regulatory organization, the misleadingly yet authoritatively sounding Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (also called FINRA). Your odds in FINRA arbitrations are good. They pay off often. Study FINRA’s website.
Your best bet here is a trial lawyer from the Public Arbitrators Bar Association (aka PIABA). You can find them online easily. All they do is sue investment firms. I've been watching them over decades, and they’re pretty good.
PIABA lawyers also sue mutual funds, hedge funds, and investment advisers. These may end up in court or arbitration, depending on the contracts you signed. I think arbitration favors you, usually, but opinions vary on that. Regardless, you want a first chair trial lawyer with a successful history.
How to find one? First, search online for, “How to find a good trial lawyer. ” There's super good information online – particularly at Badger Lawyer and Columbia Law School. Or you can contact the state bar in the major metropolis nearest you (easily found online). Ask for 10 names of attorneys who handle plaintiffs (aka … you). Always meet them. Ask each how they started, their first chair dispute history and examples of their experience.
Warning signs of bad lawyers
If your lawyer candidate doesn’t warn you on how suing can backfire, run. If they claim they are the best around, they aren't. If their goal is extorting a pre-trial settlement go elsewhere and find a lawyer who is willing, if needed, to go all the way to a final judgment. Good ones will.
Finally, never lie. Judges really hate combatant lies. Your opposition is skilled at exposing lies. Disputes are part arguing law, part arguing facts, and part chemistry. Lies poison the chemistry, crippling your lawyer.

Texto completo: The simple act of driving to Sanibel — Florida's secluded barrier island off Fort Myers — puts you in relaxation mode. The three-mile-long causeway bisects a startling blue Gulf of Mexico with a sun-dappled surface seeming to sparkle with thousands of stars. Pelicans glide playfully alongside your car, and fragrant scents ride the air.
Once on 12-mile-long Sanibel, the sky-high buildings that have trampled most of Florida are absent, replaced by seaside-hued structures “no taller than the tallest palm tree." Tropical foliage hugs streets with evocative names like Castaways Lane, while the absence of any stoplights and the presence of abundant wildlife make it difficult to remember that you're still in the United States.
Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who wrote a love song to Sanibel and Captiva in her 1955 volume “Gift from the Sea," captures the island's spirit: “People, too, become like islands in such an atmosphere, self-contained, whole and serene; respecting other people's solitude, not intruding on their shores, standing back in reverence before the miracle of another individual."
The fact that more than two-thirds of Sanibel is held as a nature conservancy engenders reverence for exotic birds and wildlife, as well. It's easy to encounter them on Sanibel's 25 miles of bicycle trails.
WHAT TO DO
1. As Sanibel is renowned for its shells, a fitting attraction is The Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum — the only such museum in the nation (adult admission $15). Shell displays from around the globe include the Japanese “spiral tudicla" that inspired the design of Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum, as well as Sailor Valentines — flowery mosaics crafted from shells in faraway ports for sailors to carry home. Holding pride of place is the museum's collection of local whelks, conches, and murexes that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico, having been swept ashore and held captive by Sanibel's horizontal positioning. Marine biologists offer workshops, beach walks, and touch tanks.
2. In the 1940s, political cartoonist and conservationist J.N. “Ding" Darling was instrumental in having President Truman declare 6,400 acres of Sanibel a national wildlife refuge. You can enjoy Darling's legacy on the four-mile-long Wildlife Drive at the Darling National Wildlife Refuge , accessible by tram tour ($13), automobile ($5), or bike ($1). Mud flats and estuaries hug both sides of the one-way drive, where migratory birds, native fish and mammals, and the occasional alligator thrive. Pull over often, and you may spot a white ibis, anhinga, snowy egret, or flock of roseate spoonbills. Equally compelling are the multirooted mangrove trees creeping throughout the estuary. The roots and leaves possess the remarkable ability to filter out salt from the water before it can do harm.
3. Periwinkle Way is shopping central — as well as the one road with perpetual traffic congestion. A few standouts that have survived for decades, and even a century: Bailey's General Store , originally providing seed and supplies by way of mail-boats, today offers fresh meats, seafood, groceries, beach and fishing gear, hardware, books, and a coffee/bakery bar (try the dough-ssaints); She Sells Sea Shells carries pristine examples of local shells and specimens from around the globe; The Islander Trading Post is eBay on steroids, where nooks overspill with perfume bottles, license plates, Brownie cameras, travel posters, buoy balls, and New York Times vintage editions (“Men Walk on the Moon" headline, 1969, $42); and Lily & Co. jewelers flourishes on nearby Tarpon Bay Road. Co-owner Dan Schuyler, a transplant from 30 years in the jewelry business in Maryland, travels the world seeking striking designs (Vergano diamond-accented amethyst pendant, Italian, $1150)
4. Happily, the most popular activity on the island is free: shell seeking . Before long you'll succumb and find yourself doing “the Sanibel stoop." Ideally, hit the shoreline at any south-facing beach an hour before low tide, where unblemished shells are revealed by the receding waters. At any time of day, though, you'll be able to gather an abundant collection of sunset-colored Calico Scallops, spiraled Fighting Conches, yellow-lined Buttercup Lucines, and fan-shaped Pen Shells. If you happen upon the elusive speckled Junonia, you'll be spotlighted in the local paper.
5. Perhaps skip Sanibel's Lighthouse , outshone by New England's.
WHERE TO EAT
1. A popular breakfast hangout, the Over Easy Café serves breakfast all day, with locally sourced items like crab and asparagus omelets or Sanibel shrimp “bennies" (both $10.99). Don't leave without trying the giant homemade sticky rolls (orange or cinnamon, $3.99). As the owners also run a nearby pet store, dogs are welcome — and omnipresent — at the café's patio tables.
2. Occupying several acres adjacent to city hall, the Sanibel Island Farmer's Market has become a Sunday morning fixture for a decade. You won't get a fresher breakfast on the island. Arrive at 8 a.m. for the best selections, and stroll your way through a moveable feast of fresh strawberries and blueberries by the crateful, sausages tucked into just-baked French baguettes, bagels to rival New York City's, and inventive offerings like cheese empanadas, or hippie loaf.
3. Join the locals for lunch or dinner at a Sanibel icon: Gramma Dot's Seaside Saloon . Cool off in breezy porches overlooking the yachts in Sanibel Marina while experiencing sea-to-table dining. Try the much-praised spinach-boursin grouper sandwich ($17.95). Dot's octogenarian son, Myton Ireland — a noted yacht racer — named his restaurant for her and still presides over the adjacent Ireland Yacht Sales.
4. Anne Morrow Lindbergh's present-day competition on Sanibel is resident mystery writer and former Sanibel fishing guide, Randy Wayne White. White's fictional protagonist — crime-solving marine biologist Doc Ford — brings his passion for tropical cuisine and drink to White's real-life establishment, Doc Ford's Rum Bar and Grille . While awaiting your table, you can also purchase one of White's 24 novels set in Sanibel. Libations here are all about the rum. Try a flight of three 3¾ oz. shots ($25) from Trinidad, Venezuela, Guyana, Barbados, Panama, or Puerto Rico; or go with the milder Old Havana Rum Punch ($7.95). For an entrée, savor the local snapper steamed in a banana leaf with masa harina, chili puree, and lime juice ($24.95), while you sneak a look around for White, who often writes onsite.
AT NIGHT
1. Sanibel's nightlife is on the mellow side and runs to sipping key-lime concoctions while guitarists and vocalists entertain in the balmy night. Try The Island Cow or Traditions on the Beach .
2. Big Arts offers a rotating menu of performers, singers, visual artists, and film selections in intimate theater spaces. This winter, enjoy pop or classical music (Judy Collins, Peter Serkin), while supporting arts on the island.
WHERE TO STAY
1. The Sundial Beach Resort is a seaside complex of 19 all-suite buildings with five pools stretching a mile on Middle Gulf Drive. Recent additions include 12 pickleball courts and Shima Japanese Steakhouse. Free bikes. (Condos, from $359)
2. Casa Ybel Resort on West Gulf Drive offers 114 beachside bungalow units, with complete kitchens, living areas, and lanais. Thistle Lodge provides dining on the lush grounds. (Price varies.)
HIT THE JACKPOT
While digging your toes in the beach sand, be vigilant: In the 1800s the pirate Gasparilla is said to have buried his eye-popping treasure, as yet undiscovered, on Sanibel.

Texto completo: THE TRIAL OF LIZZIE BORDEN:
A True Story
By Cara Robertson
Simon and Schuster,
384 pp., illustrated, $28
Lizzie Andrew Borden is the stuff of New England legend. Acquitted in the 1892 axe murders of her father and stepmother, the woman from Fall River has been memorialized in folk rhyme, film, opera, theater, literature, and even a feminist rock musical.
In “The Trial of Lizzie Borden," Cara Robertson delves deep into the record, recounting every twist in the legal proceedings, as well as Borden's life. Drawing on transcripts, contemporaneous newspaper accounts, and newly available letters and a defense lawyer's papers, Robertson, even-handed to a fault, details the inquest, the preliminary hearing and the trial step by step.
She offers insight into the prevailing weirdness of the Borden household, with its penchant for locked doors, and mounting familial resentments. She also provides thumbnail sketches of a variety of characters, including the lawyers and the reporters covering the trial. But her mostly chronological approach is plodding and repetitive, slowing her narrative to a crawl.
Robertson began researching the case in 1990 for her Harvard undergraduate thesis. She has since earned a doctorate in English (from Oxford University) and a law degree (from Stanford), clerked at the US Supreme Court, and served as a legal adviser to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her legal expertise serves her well. But she's a neophyte at crafting narrative nonfiction, which demands tighter control of the material.
Robertson draws her epigraph from a prescient 1893 New York Times story that seems to predict the longstanding controversy. “There is so little absolute evidence that everybody can interpret the probabilities and circumstantial indications to suit himself," the Times suggests. “There seems to be little prospect that the mystery will be cleared up by the trial." Nevertheless, the reader is bound to hope that Robertson will supply the puzzle's missing pieces.
“The Trial of Lizzie Borden" opens with a Fall River pharmacist's account of a failed attempt by a woman he identifies as Lizzie Borden to buy prussic acid, a poison. (This incident, like many, is revisited throughout the narrative.) Then Robertson sketches the Borden ménage: Andrew, a frugal, self-made businessman; his second wife, Abby; his two grown, unmarried daughters, Emma and Lizzie; and a servant, Bridget Sullivan.
As Robertson recounts, Abby's success at persuading Andrew to help her half-sister purchase a house galled her envious stepdaughters, transforming “chilly tolerance to open animosity." Andrew's general miserliness apparently was another source of household distress. But was any of this enough to motivate murder?
On Aug. 4, 1892, Lizzie raised the first alarm, to a neighbor, about her father's slaying. In the Borden house, that neighbor and the housemaid also spotted the corpse of Abby. It was unclear how the two murders, committed about an hour and a half apart, could have been the work of a stranger — especially without Lizzie or Bridget, both of them home, spotting the intruder.
Robertson occasionally steps back from her narrative to situate Lizzie in the context of her times. Like most 19th-century middle-class women, Robertson writes, she “was relegated to unproductive marginality," all the more so because she never married and still lived in her father's house.
More inculpating than Borden's unhappiness, however, were her inconsistent accounts of her whereabouts and other details of the day of the murders. “Her stories were contradictory," Robertson reports, and “the inquest presented a damning picture," leading to Borden's arrest.
During her subsequent ordeal, the defendant was fortunate in her legal representation and key judicial rulings. She never testified at trial, where she sat “unruffled, the still center of the spectacle unfolding around her."
Press coverage was voluminous, sometimes sympathetic and often sensationalistic. Its nadir was the claim that her father had threatened to evict a pregnant Borden from their home if she did not reveal her lover's name. An “elaborate hoax," it nevertheless made its way into The Boston Globe.
Direct evidence of Borden's guilt was lacking: There were no eyewitnesses; the murder weapon was never definitively identified; and no blood was discovered on Borden herself, despite the grisly nature of the slayings. (Her burning of a dress — spattered with either paint, as she claimed, or blood — is one of the case's many mysteries.) Still, opportunity (if not clear motive), the lack of other viable suspects, and Borden's own shifting accounts pointed to her as the killer.
For the New Bedford jury, the circumstantial evidence proved insufficient. But many of Borden's acquaintances would later shun her, including her own sister. Controversial then as now, the verdict, on June 20, 1893, hardly resolved the matter of her guilt. Despite Robertson's impressive research, “The Trial of Lizzie Borden" won't either.

Texto completo: Julia Roberts could be returning to Amazon.
Variety has confirmed that the "Homecoming" star is currently in talks to star in and executive produce a limited series based on the book "Charlotte Walsh Likes to Win" by Jo Piazza at the streaming service.
The book follows Walsh, a candidate in the most hotly-contested midterm Senate race in America. A former Silicon Valley executive, Walsh and her family return to her downtrodden Pennsylvania hometown to run for office, but she is unprepared for just how dirty her opponent, her peers, and the media are willing to get.
Jon Robin Baitz will write the series adaptation and executive produce. Roberts will executive produce under her Red Om banner along with Lisa Gillan and Marisa Gill.
News of the new potential TV starring vehicle for Roberts comes after she starred in Season 1 of Amazon's "Homecoming," based on the podcast of the same name.
The Oscar-winning actress will remain on the show as an executive producer, however. "Homecoming" was picked up for two seasons when it was initially ordered at Amazon, but Roberts only had a one-year deal to star. The role marked the first series regular role of Roberts' career.

Smith's clean water foundation: Jaden Smith's foundation and a church are working to bring cleaner water to Flint, Mich. The rapper's organization and First Trinity Missionary Baptist Church on Friday announced they'll deploy a mobile water filtration system that reduces lead and other potential contaminants. The 20-year-old's JUST goods company collaborated with the church to design and engineer the system.
Adams' tour canceled: Ryan Adams' scheduled tour of the U.K. and Ireland has been canceled, according to announcements from the tour's ticket agents and venues. The cancellation comes two weeks after multiple sexual-misconduct allegations were leveled at the singer in a New York Times article. In the wake of the article, his upcoming release through Capitol Records was canceled.
'Bond 25' gears up: With production expected to start this spring, MGM and Eon are getting closer to deciding who will be joining Daniel Craig in his next outing as Agent 007 in the 25th James Bond movie. Producers are continuing their search for two female roles, the main villain and an American CIA agent. Writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga is set to direct the film, the first time an American has directed.
March 2 birthdays: Singer Jon Bon Jovi is 57. Actor Daniel Craig is 51. Singer Chris Martin is 42. Actress Rebel Wilson is 39. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard is 38.

Hundreds of Aboriginal Australians jailed for not paying fines

Texto completo: JOONDALUP, Australia - When police arrived at Naomi Bropho's door in Western Australia in late 2017, she was relieved. Her brother, in an agitated rage, was on his way to her home, and her mother had called them to protect her.
Instead, police handcuffed Bropho.
Bropho, a 35-year-old Noongar woman, was stunned. She had five children at home, she pleaded, one of whom was still breast-feeding.
"You've got no choice," she recalls an officer telling her. A warrant was out for her arrest: Bropho had racked up 3,900 Australian dollars ($2,800) in fines, court costs and interest for her dog, which local rangers said had bitten someone several years earlier.
In the past decade, officials in Western Australia have sent thousands of people to jail because of unpaid fines stemming from minor offenses, including traffic violations, loitering or failure to register a dog. It's a practice that has been controversial and in decline across Australia for years, but here in a vast but sparsely populated state that has a reputation for tough policing, the tactic remains.
The connection to race and domestic violence, though, is raising new questions about whether that should change.
Government statistics show that Aboriginal people have made up a highly disproportionate share of those jailed, leading to claims of discrimination. And public outrage over the practice has been intensifying since 2014, when a 22-year-old Aboriginal woman jailed for unpaid fines died in custody.
The inquest into the death of the woman, Julieka Ivanna Dhu, called for the abolition of imprisonment for unpaid fines and the creation of community work orders as an alternative. The state's Labor government, elected in 2017, vowed changes as well.
For some, though, the promise of change has taken far too long to fulfill.
"This isn't a constitutional amendment; this isn't a massive infrastructure project," said Charandev Singh, a human rights advocate who helped lead the inquest into Dhu's death. "It's just rurally inexplicable why it's taken so long." The state's continuing use of the tactic, including the arrest of a prominent Aboriginal actor in January, prompted activists to start an online campaign :hat has already raised more than AU$360,000 ($257,700) to free those jailed for unpaid fines.
Organizers say five people have been freed and dozens of others have had their fines paid off.
Many more are still facing potential arrest. Left unpaid, fines for minor violations can mount, incurring interest and court fees, said Tomas Fitzgerald, a senior lecturer at the University of Notre Dame in Western Australia. Warrants can be issued not only by judges, but by civil servants who are given wide discretion. - (The New York Times)

Comedy podcaster Griffin McElroy going live on stage at Ruby Diamond

Texto completo: When comedy podcaster Griffin McElroy and his brothers started a podcast called "The McElroy Brothers Will Be In Trolls 2," they didn't expect to actually land bit parts in the movie. It was a joke. But it worked. They've already recorded their parts in Dreamworks feature film "Trolls World Tour," set to be released in April of 2020.
Things like that have led to McElroy, who is the next speaker in FSU's Golden Tribe Lecture Series, being included on Forbes' "30 under 30" media people list in 2017.
McElroy's talk Tuesday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall will be a rare solo appearance. His unique amalgam of work across the podcasting and internet communities is done almost exclusively in tandem.
Whether he's with his brothers Justin and Travis on their comedy advice podcast "My Brother, My Brother and Me" (abbreviated "MBMBaM," pronounced ma-bim-bam), or his father Clint and brothers on tabletop role-playing game podcast "The Adventure Zone," or his wife Rachel on enthusiast podcast "Wonderful," he doesn't often go it alone.
In fact, one of McElroy's only solo projects is a former video series called "Griffin's Amiibo Corner," in which he attempted to fit sizable video game figurines known as Amiibos into his mouth.
But being on stage is nothing new for McElroy. He grew up doing community theater and regularly does live shows of his podcasts in large venues across the country.
That being said, he's never done anything quite like the talk he'll give at FSU.
"Outside of, like, doing guest spots on other podcasts," he told the Democrat. "But even then, there are other people.
"The idea of getting up in front of a crowd and doing a tight five (minutes) has always seemed sort of impossible to me. Hopefully, doing a tight 45 of autobiography will come a bit easier."
McElroy's career trajectory hasn't been like anyone else's. He began working in video game journalism in college and stayed in the field for over a decade, until leaving last April to focus on other projects.
His projects have ranged from his podcast work on "MBMBaM" (where he and his brothers give advice to ridiculous Yahoo Answers questions) and "Adventure Zone" (where he serves the dungeon master for his family's Dungeons and Dragons adventures) to videos where he and his brother Justin create grotesque video game characters for a Polygon web series called "Monster Factory."
"I have charted a pretty bizarre path through my career life in general, even by internet content creator standards," McElroy said. "My career is like a quilt of just random stuff that I support myself and my family with."
He's going to talk about his experiences, and how he managed to "sort of piece together such a strange — but still successful — career out of all the different sort of patchwork components of it."
His lecture will also deal with deeper issues he learned from his time at Marshall University and wants to pass on to college students in need.
"There's a lot of stuff that I wish I had known then that I know now, vis-a-vis maintaining your mental health and not working yourself into oblivion," he said.
"Hopefully, I can shed some insight into that," McElroy said.
"As well as tying the fate of your career to your family irrevocably — I think it's probably a fascinating topic to hear somebody talk about."
The McElroys launched "MBMBaM" in April of 2010. Keyed by a chemistry that could only exist between brothers, they're still going 447 episodes later.
"The Adventure Zone" was the McElroys' next big venture in 2014. and cemented their status in the podcasting community.
The sizable cult following the brothers have developed — referred to as MBMBaMbinos — keeps "MBMBaM" and "The Adventure Zone" consistently in the Top 250 among all podcasts on iTunes.
At this point, though, their media reach extends far beyond the podcast realm.
They made a six-episode television series on SeeSo which reached No. 1 on iTunes when it was released.
They're also writing a limited Marvel comic book series entitled "War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery." The first of five issues is set to be released April 10.
But the graphic novel adaptation of the first arc of "The Adventure Zone" they all collaborated on stands out above all the other wild things McElroy couldn't have imagined doing when he started podcasting.
"Writing the graphic novel alongside my family and seeing it come to life with (illustrator Carey Piestch's) art, working very, very hard on that and then seeing it become a No. 1 New York Times Bestseller, that's probably the wildest thing that has happened," he said.
The McElroy family's collection of podcasts is available on iTunes, Stitcher, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. For comprehensive coverage of all things McElroy, visit their website www.mcelroy.family.

Hush little porn star, don't say a word

Texto completo: Illustration Ann Coulter Syndicated columnist

I gather I was supposed to gasp when Michael Cohen said during his testimony before Congress on Wednesday, "The president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws."
If that's the best he's got, Trump should demand we hold the election this coming Tuesday.
Cohen was referring to Trump's 2017 reimbursement of the $130,000 hush money he paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about her claim that she'd had sex with Trump, aka Cohen's client — meaning much of Cohen's testimony is barred by attorney-client privilege. But who cares about this sacred legal privilege? We're trying to get Trump!
Neither the media nor Cohen seem to realize that Cohen wasn't doing anything illegal when he paid the "hush money." (Just because Trump thinks every Jewish lawyer is Roy Cohn doesn't mean you have to, too, New York Times.)
Words like "hush money" and "porn star" make the payments sound unsavory — especially to The New York Times, known during the Clinton era as Defender of Inappropriate Presidential Sex — but there's nothing criminal about paying money to suppress embarrassing information, even in the middle of a political campaign.
If it wasn't illegal for Cohen to pay the hush money, it's certainly not illegal for Trump to reimburse him for it. Cohen was, after all, Trump's lawyer. He got reimbursed for a lot of things.
But we have to have days of hearings in hopes of establishing that Trump violated the campaign finance reporting requirements with these payments, in which case, OH MY GOSH, HE'D HAVE TO PAY A FINE.
I'd be more impressed if they got Trump on a jaywalking charge.
President Obama had to pay $375,000 in fines for actual campaign violations during his 2008 run, and I don't think we needed 16 prosecutors, half of Congress and the entire media on the case.
The theory of Trump's alleged campaign finance violation is that if you're running for office, all normal life expenses suddenly become campaign-related. According to these neurotics, ANY money Trump or his companies spent during the campaign is a potential campaign finance expenditure.
Paying your gardeners is a campaign expense — because who would vote for a man who can't even keep the hedges tidy at Mar-a-Lago? If Trump had gone to the hospital for an appendectomy — well, he got his appendix cut out because he feared that if he died of appendicitis, he wouldn't get the nomination.
Luckily our laws aren't as insane as our media. For the hush money payments to be campaign expenses, the government would have to prove:
1) Trump, with his fine legal mind, knew he was violating the law; and
2) He authorized the payments only because he was running for office.
So prosecutors have a fantastic case, provided they can get Trump to admit on the stand, Oh no, I wasn't worried that these allegations would hurt my brand at all. I didn't care about what my grandkids or Melania would think. I had Cohen pay off a porn star for the sole purpose of misleading the public into voting for me on the basis of my character.
Such an argument would be absurd with anyone, but we're talking about Donald Trump. He didn't exactly hold himself out to the voting public as a moral paragon.
As voters were well aware, Trump's been married three times, has appeared in Playboy videos, and was a fixture on the Howard Stern show for years, discussing breast sizes and ranking women's looks. In the very first GOP debate, Fox News reminded viewers that Trump had called women "fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals."
The reason the "Access Hollywood" tape failed so spectacularly was that Trump had never appealed to Americans based on his character.
Trump won the presidency not because he touted himself as a man of character, but because he said he was someone who could get things done. Like build the wall. If you're going to impeach him, impeach him for that.

Texto completo: Chiwetel Ejiofor's directorial debut hits Netflix. And a new action series, "The Widow," is streaming on Amazon.
What's Streaming
THE BOY WHO HARNESSED THE WIND (2018) Stream on Netflix. Here's one of the many lessons that can be gleaned from Chiwetel Ejiofor's directorial debut: A library can transform a person's life. This was the case for William Kamkwamba, the Malawian innovator at the center of this movie. As a teenager, Kamkwamba helped save his village from drought by building a power-generating windmill. When Kamkwamba (played by Maxwell Simba) isn't allowed to go to school anymore because his parents (Ejiofor and Aïssa Maïga) can't pay tuition, he sneaks in. When he can't do that anymore, he teaches himself from library books. One of them gives him the idea to build the windmill. Ejiofor, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in "12 Years a Slave," takes his time building the story out, turning the film into as much an exploration of life in this Malawi village in the early 2000s as a story of Kamkwamba's ultimate triumph.
THE WIDOW Stream on Amazon. The concept for this British series may sound something like an inverted "Lost": A woman's husband's plane goes down over the Democratic Republic of Congo, and she thinks that he's gone forever. When we meet Georgia (Kate Beckinsale) a few years later, she's still mourning. But then she catches wind that her husband (Matthew Le Nevez) may still be alive. So she sets off to find out what happened.
PADDLETON (2018) Stream on Netflix. Mark Duplass and Ray Romano play buddies confronting a terminal medical diagnosis in this dramedy. Michael (Duplass) is the one with the cancer, but the film is about both of them. After the diagnosis, Michael continues going through the same routine -- of playing sports with Andy (Romano), doing puzzles with Andy and watching TV with Andy -- until he decides to ask Andy for help ending his own life.
What's on TV
HUGO (2011) on 8 p.m. on TCM. If those Rolex commercials with Martin Scorsese that aired during the Oscars on Sunday night have you itching to revisit his work, consider this colorful Parisian oddity -- one of Scorsese's only movies that can safely be watched with children in the room. Set in the 1930s, the story follows a lonely young orphan (Asa Butterfield) who lives in the depths of a Paris train station. His job is to keep the station's clocks running; his passion is fixing up an old automaton left with him by his deceased father (Jude Law). It's a lonely existence, at least until he develops a friendship with a young girl (Chloë Grace Moretz). Their adventures together are bolstered by memorable performances from Ben Kingsley (the girl's father) and a comically callous Sacha Baron Cohen. Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times that the movie is "serious, beautiful, wise to the absurdity of life and in the embrace of a piercing longing."

Texto completo: Since moving to Brooklyn in 2012, the Nets have closely aligned their brand with that of Christopher Wallace, the rapper known as the Notorious B.I.G., who grew up a brisk walk from where Barclays Center was later built to host the N.B.A. But a special version of the team's jersey, with a design inspired by Wallace, is at the center of a copyright violation lawsuit against the Nets, the N.B.A. and Nike filed by the clothing brand Coogi in Manhattan federal court Wednesday.
Before the season, the Nets debuted their new Nike-manufactured "City Edition" jerseys, which feature a multicolored striped pattern down the sides that the team called "Brooklyn Camo." In marketing materials, the team said the jerseys were inspired by Wallace.
The "Brooklyn Camo" pattern bears a close resemblance to patterns Coogi has used in its clothing for years, and for which it claims to have over 300 design copyrights. Coogi, a New York-based brand, is also heavily associated with Wallace. The rapper was photographed in Coogi's clothing, and he referred to the brand in at least two of his songs, including the hit "Hypnotize."
Wallace never rapped about or wore "Brooklyn Camo," Coogi says in its lawsuit, and the company claims that the jerseys copy its designs, specifically the "Pea Soup" and "Ricotta" patterns. The lawsuit also says one of the defendants purchased advertisements on Google searches for "Coogi Brooklyn Nets" and "Brooklyn Coogi" in order to direct people looking for genuine Coogi products to instead buy Nets merchandise.
In a statement to The New York Times, Mike Bass, the N.B.A.'s spokesman, said, "There is no merit whatsoever to their claims."
The Nets and Nike declined to comment on the lawsuit.
None of the defendants have filed a response to Coogi's claim. But attached to Coogi's lawsuit are letters exchanged between Coogi's legal counsel and an N.B.A. lawyer, which detail possible legal defenses for the league, team and Nike.
In a letter from November, Michael Potenza, the N.B.A.'s intellectual property counsel, wrote to a lawyer for Coogi that the league was "unaware of any design owned by your client to which the Brooklyn Camo is substantially similar." Potenza explained why the case law on trademark infringement would make it difficult for Coogi to prove its claims, and said the Brooklyn Camo design did not confuse customers. He also said that the N.B.A. obtained consent from the estate of Wallace, who was killed in 1997, to use his name in association with the jersey.
In a later letter, Potenza wrote that the Brooklyn Camo design is not similar to Coogi's designs for a number of reasons: brighter colors, narrower stripes that are horizontal instead vertical, and positioning only on the piping of the jersey, not across the entire top as in Coogi's designs.
On Friday, the first 10,000 fans in attendance for the Nets game against the Charlotte Hornets will receive a Notorious B.I.G. bobblehead.

The Truth About Blackface: It Never Went Away

Texto completo: From former "Today" host Megyn Kelly's defense of blackface worn for Halloween costumes to the recent scandal in Virginia, blackface has reared its ugly and most demeaning head.
So much so that officials at museums such as the Reginald E Lewis Museum of African American History in Baltimore were forced to host conversations on the legacy of blackface.
Kaye Whitehead, talk show host and Loyola University Maryland associate professor of communication and African-American studies, moderated the discussion.
Whitehead, an award-winning author of "Notes from a Colored Girl: The Civil War Pocket Diaries of Emilie Frances Davis," also sat in on a screening of the documentary "Ethnic Notions," which took viewers on a disturbing voyage through American history tracing the deep-rooted stereotypes which have fueled anti-Black prejudice.
While Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and the states Attorney General Mark Herring both have come under firing and have heard calls for their resignation from office because of admitting donning blackface in the 1980s, the controversy has continued.
Following the Northam and Herring scandal, reporters at USA Today were assigned to review hundreds of college yearbooks from the 1970s and 1980s, presumably in search of other officials, celebrities and individuals who may have donned blackface or other offensive attire.
The newspaper reported mat it had identified at least 200 instances of racist and derogatory images and material in yearbooks across the country But one stood out.
The 1988-89 yearbook from Arizona State University which the New York Times reported was edited by a 21-year-old named Nicole Carroll, now the editor-in-chief of USA Today.
The page showed two white male students covered in black paint while smiling at the Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity's Halloween party
As described by the New York
Times: On the left, a shirdess man with boxing gloves over his shoulders was dressed as Mike Tyson, while the other student, wearing a wig and a bikini top, was Robin Givens.
Like others, Carroll was forced to issue an apology.
"I'm sorry for the hurt I caused back then and the hurt it will cause today," she wrote in USA Today last week about overseeing the publication of the blackface photograph.
USA Today released a statement saying that when the photograph was discovered, Carroll "immediately recused herself from involvement in this coverage."
Carroll said, "Clearly the 21-year-old me who oversaw the yearbook and that page didn't understand how offensive the photo was. I wish I had."
She added: "Today's 51-year-old me of course understands and is crushed by this mistake."
In a statement, a spokesman for Alpha Kappa Psi said the fraternity was sorry for the pain the photo caused.
The New York Times reported that Arizona State University officials also apologized for the photo.
Still, blackface remains problematic and, for some reason, has reared its racist head again from Prada and Gucci to Katy Perry's shoe design.
Filmmaker Spike Lee has led the call by other celebrities to boycott companies.
In a recent announcement, Lee said he would no longer wear Gucci or Prada "until they hire some Black designers to be in da room when [these things] happen."
NPR pointed out the previous use of blackface by two of the biggest stars of late night television.
Back in 2000, when comedian Jimmy Kimmel was the host of "The Man Show," he had a recurring skit in which he wore blackface to impersonate former Utah Jazz basketball player Karl Malone. In the skit, he mocked Malone's speech and intelligence while wearing a bald cap, full-body blackface and Malone's jersey.
In another segment, Kimmel wore dark makeup while impersonating Oprah Winfrey, NPR reported.
Jimmy Fallon once portrayed comedian Chris Rock while wearing dark makeup in an episode of "Saturday Night Live" in 2000, according to NPR Kimmel and Fallon have mostly stayed silent on the Northam scandal and blackface in their late-night shows, NPR said.
In his opening monologue following the State of the Union address earlier this month, Fallon noted how all the Democratic women in Congress wore white, joking that Northam was probably thinking, "Oh, sure, when they do it, it's OK," referencing the photo in Northam's yearbook in which someone is wearing a white KKK robe.
Blackface was historically used to ridicule and mock Black people and depict them as unintelligent and inferior. It created a lasting, distorted image of Black people, which further contributed to their mistreatment and segregation, according to NPR Lee, director of such hit films as "Do the Right Thing," "She's Gotta Have It" and "Malcolm X," simply called blackface hateful.
"It's obvious to people that they don't have a clue when it comes to racist, blackface hateful images. Wake up," he said.

How founding a YA writing conference convinced this Utah author it was time to publish her own work

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — As an emerging YA author and founder of a local teen writing conference, one might think that Jo Shaffer has always been into books for young people. But Schaffer isn't one to give into assumptions.
“My mom raised me on pretty hardcore literature, so I didn't read a lot of kids books until later in my life because I’d been reading classics,” Schaffer said in a recent interview.
In fact, although she has long had a love of books and storytelling — she was one of those kids who often made up stories and kept a notebook of her tales — she didn't start writing in earnest until she was an adult, but even then, she wasn't sure what to do with it.
"I started writing a little more seriously (as an adult), but I wasn't really ready to share it with anybody because I wasn't sure if it was good," she said.
After founding a nationwide writing conference, Teen Author Boot Camp, with her writing group, Schaffer’s thoughts about getting published turned around.
“I started mixing in the industry with people who were actually doing it and I saw that they weren't so much better than me or so different than me,” Schaffer said. “It became more and more attainable all the time.”
Schaffer’s first series, “Stanley & Hazel,” tells the story of two teens in separate social classes who meet in 1930s St. Louis. After stumbling across a dead body, the pair make the decision to solve the mystery together and, gradually, they uncover the truth about eugenics and classism in America. Schaffer released the second book in the series, "Stanley & Hazel: The Winnowing: Book 2," in February.
“The 'Stanley & Hazel' series came from my love of old movies, at first,” Schaffer said. “I was raised on a lot of old classic black-and-white films from the 1930s. And I love the snappy dialogue, I love the fashion, … but I realized it was a Hollywood representation. … As I got older, I started looking into that era and what a crazy time it was for America. Over in Germany, Hitler was rising to power and there were actually a lot of sympathizers here in America that were kind of sucked in by some of his ideologies — the elite especially.”
The sequel’s title — "The Winnowing” — describes the process of eliminating or preventing the reproduction of those in “inferior” gene pools, an actual phenomenon which Schaffer learned was alive in America in the 1930s and continued on in varying forms throughout the 20th century.
“I became really fascinated with eugenics because of the fact that it was happening in America,” Schaffer said. “You can still look up online pamphlets and handouts that just blatantly talked about unwanted gene pools — the kind of people that should not be breeding, or (that) somebody with a handicap … shouldn't be born because it ruins the gene pool."
For Schaffer, the problem of “better genes” is more than hypothetical. Her inspiration for the thematic tilt of the book, she said, came largely from her personal experience raising a son with Kabuki syndrome.
"I submit that those kinds of people do bring something to … society that wouldn't be there otherwise," Shaffer said. "They help us to understand; they help us be compassionate. … There's so many beautiful things about people who are different. And he's exactly the type of child that they would have just probably aborted or killed after birth because of his issues. But when you met him, you'd realize he's the coolest guy ever."
While Schaffer wrote her books for entertainment, she hopes that readers think about the issues they raise, perhaps leading them to ask: “How do I view other groups that I don't understand? Do I immediately find a reason to label them either good or bad?” she said.
And beyond writing these books to explore her own passions and interests, Schaffer is equally committed to helping others develop a literary voice.
“I think one of the big things … that helped me catch the vision of, ‘Oh I can actually really do this,’ is when me and my writing group started Teen Author Boot Camp, which is a nonprofit writers conference where we mentor young writers,” Schafer said.
The conference, held on March 23 at the Utah Valley Convention Center, will include discussion panels and workshops guided by best-selling and experienced authors.
According to teenauthorbootcamp.com, past keynote speakers include Brandon Sanderson, Shannon Hale, Brandon Mull, Jay Asher, Marie Lu, James Dashner, Margaret Peterson Haddix, Jessica Day George, Ally Condie, Kiersten White and Dan Wells.
This year’s keynote speakers, New York Times best-seller Ally Carter ("I’d Tell You I Love You, But Then I’d Have To Kill You") and local — and national — favorite Mull ("Fablehaven," "Dragonwatch") will be joined by “about 25 other amazing authors who are coming in and donating their time,” Schaffer said.
This years theme — “find your clan,” as Schaffer put it — suggests that the conference will also help young writers connect with like-minded people who can support them.
“We just have such a passion for the written word and the importance of it and how it empowers kids to have a voice,” she said. “(Then the kids) feel like, ‘Hey, I can write something down in an articulate way and communicate my thoughts and ideas.' That became an important part of my journey.”

Trump Inaugural Committee Receives Subpoena From D.C. Attorney General; Inaugural committee has also received subpoenas from Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, New Jersey attorney general

Texto completo: The District of Columbia attorney general's office has subpoenaed President Trump's inaugural committee for documents related to an investigation into whether the fund's spending was "wasteful, mismanaged" or "improperly provided private benefit."
The subpoena, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, is the third such request to the committee, which is also the subject of investigations by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the New Jersey attorney general .
"The Presidential Inauguration Committee is in receipt of the subpoena issued by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, and is in contact with staff regarding this inquiry," a spokesman for the committee said.
The subpoena was first reported by the New York Times.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine's subpoena appears more narrowly focused than the other two subpoenas the committee has received, signaling an interest by investigators into dealings between the inaugural committee and Mr. Trump's family business.
The subpoena requests records of all payments from or on behalf of the committee to the Trump Organization, including any relating to the Trump International Hotel in Washington. The committee paid the hotel $1.5 million, according to an inaugural official.
It also seeks documents "sufficient to identify the position, title and role" held by Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Mr. Trump's children have worked at the Trump Organization. Ms. Trump left the company to serve as a senior adviser in the White House and the president turned over management of the business to his two sons when he took office.
Mr. Racine's office also appears interested in whether there was any self-dealing within the inaugural committee. The subpoena asks for documents related to any payments the committee made to any "director, officer, chairman or deputy chairman" of the committee, or any business owned by any of those officials.
The inaugural committee was headed by Tom Barrack, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump. His deputy was Richard Gates, who pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and providing a false statement. Mr. Gates said in court last year that it is "possible" he submitted personal expenses to the inaugural committee. The committee also had more than a dozen finance co-chairmen and vice-chairmen, including some of Mr. Trump's top backers.
The attorney general also named Fairmont Hotels and AccorHotels, which owns Fairmont's management company. The committee paid $1.5 million to Fairmont Hotels, according to an inaugural official. The Republican National Committee booked about a dozen hotels before the election, including the Fairmont, and later transferred those contracts to the inaugural committee, the official said.
Colony Capital, the private-equity firm headed by Mr. Barrack, sold its stake in Accor in February 2017, a month after the inauguration, according to a spokesman. The spokesman said his stake was less than 5%.

Texto completo: MEXICO CITY - Steve Stricker didn't wait for the official announcement to make his first move as Ryder Cup captain.
He called Patrick Reed.
This was two days before a long Wednesday of news conferences, radio shows, everything short of a parade in his home state of Wisconsin, where in 2020 he will lead the American team at Whistling Straits in a bid to win back the Ryder Cup.
Still to be determined is whether Reed is part of the team.
That will depend largely on his performance over the next two years, not what happened five months ago in France.
Stricker was going through a media training session ahead of the Ryder Cup announcement when he realized Reed might be a popular topic, at least on the day he was introduced as captain. Instead of preparing the right message for the media, he picked up the phone.
"I figured I was going to get some questions about Patrick and all the stuff that transpired, Stricker said. "All I've seen is what was on social media, some of the golf outlets, things like that. I just wanted to hear from him, the truth from him. He explained himself, and how he thought he messed up at the Ryder Cup, and he wants to move forward. And that he's got everybody's back.
The "stuff to which Stricker referred made a bad week at Le Golf National seem even worse.
Reed and Jordan Spieth had gone 4-1-2 as partners in the two previous Ryder Cups - 8-1-3 when the Presidents Cup is included. Spieth played this Ryder Cup with Justin Thomas, whom he knows as well as anyone, and they were a rare bright spot for the Americans by winning three of their four matches. Reed played with his idol, Tiger Woods, and they lost both their matches before seeing the 18th hole.
In the now-famous New York Times interview a few hours after the matches were over, Reed blamed Spieth for them not playing together, said captain Jim Furyk was not smart to bench him for two matches and suggested Europe was better at putting team ahead of ego.
That was then.
Reed says he sent a text to "all the guys immediately after the Ryder Cup and that everyone except the media has moved on.
Maybe so, but there were sure to be moments when it would be thought of again.
One such time was at Torrey Pines, when Reed and Spieth were in the same group for the first time since the Ryder Cup. There was plenty of attention on the first tee for a group that was eight shots out of the lead. Spieth tried to diffuse the moment by playfully leaning in for a hug with Reed on the first tee. They both laughed. They chatted during the round about equipment or whatever players talk about to kill time between shots.
Friends? Probably not. But they're still teammates.
And it was sure to come up when the next Ryder Cup captain was appointed.
Stricker has a reputation as the nicest man in golf, quiet and respectful, steeped in Midwestern values. His father-in-law once described Stricker as treating an employee in the home improvement store with as much consideration as a corporate executive.
He met his wife, Nicki, when Stricker took a lesson from former Wisconsin coach Dennis Tiziani. Stricker asked if he knew anything about the beautiful lifeguard as they walked by the pool. "That's my daughter, Tiziani replied. They soon had their first date, but only after she called him.
Stricker fought back tears when he was introduced as Ryder Cup captain, and no one was surprised. He does that all the time.
Just don't get the idea he's a softie.
In three interviews last week, Stricker delivered a message of looking ahead instead of behind. That's important to him, and it's important to an American team that suffered a setback in its attempt to build a new model of success for the Ryder Cup.
He was savvy enough to know that any lingering feelings from France should be addressed by talking to a player whom Stricker considers more an asset than a liability.
"That was on my to-do list, to talk to him and see his side of things, Stricker said.
Reed didn't want to reveal all they talked about, although they appear to be on the same page. It's all about moving forward.
"The only thing I shouldn't have done is talked to the media, but I felt like at the time it was the right thing to do, Reed said. "When I talked to him, I just said: Hey, man, I want to let you know we've all moved past it. We're a team. I feel like all of us are moving in the right direction. Now we're trying to play as good as golf as we can and try to make the team.'

Texto completo: PARIS -- The authorities here said on Monday that the French film director Luc Besson would face no charges after a nine-month inquiry into an actress's accusations that he had raped her.
An official at the Paris prosecutor's office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official policy, said that "numerous investigations" by the Paris police couldn't show that Mr. Besson, 59, had coerced the Dutch-Belgian actress Sand Van Roy into unwanted sex.
Ms. Van Roy, a 31-year-old actress who filed a police complaint against Mr. Besson in May and a second one in July, accused him of raping her on at least four occasions, and said he once injured her "to the point of bleeding." In an interview with The New York Times in July, she described a two-year-long "abusive" relationship with Mr. Besson and said she was afraid to turn down his advances out of fear that it would hurt her career.
According to the first complaint, Ms. Van Roy told the police in May on the day after the sexual contact that she said made her bleed: "I'm afraid he might kill me, he is a psychopath."
Mr. Besson was the first prominent figure in the French film industry to face accusations of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo revelations. A total of nine women, including actresses, a former casting director and colleagues of Mr. Besson, have described inappropriate behavior by him to the investigative website Mediapart, but only Ms. Van Roy filed a complaint.
Ms. Van Roy started her career as a model and later became a stand-up comedian before turning to film acting. She said she first met Mr. Besson in 2015 as she auditioned for a part in his film "Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets," and after she obtained a small role in the movie, the two became acquainted over meetings for tea at a luxury hotel in Paris.
Ms. Van Roy told the police that Mr. Besson began approaching her sexually during the shooting of "Valerian," and that although she was reluctant, she didn't shun him.
But the sexual contact became rougher, she told the police in May. Ms. Van Roy told The Times that she had found Mr. Besson penetrating her on two occasions while she was asleep, and that he had once refused to use protection despite her requests.
Ms. Van Roy also shot scenes to appear in Mr. Besson's upcoming movie "Anna," but her role in the cast became unclear after she filed the complaints. The film's release in 2019 has been delayed after Mr. Besson's company, EuropaCorp, shut down its in-house distribution business.
Among the other women who have made allegations against Mr. Besson, an actress in her 40s who wanted to remain anonymous told the French police this month that the filmmaker had thrown himself on her and tried to kiss her by force in Paris in March 2002. The Paris prosecutor's office said an additional preliminary investigation had been opened into those accusations. The actress told Mediapart that she didn't file a complaint because the statute of limitations for sexual assault is six years in France.
Thierry Marembert, Mr. Besson's lawyer, said on Monday that his client had always denied Ms. Van Roy's accusations. "This decision comes after a very complete investigation, to which he has fully cooperated," Mr. Marembert wrote in a release sent to the news service Agence France-Presse.
Ms. Van Roy's lawyer, Francis Szpiner, wrote on Twitter that he would soon file a new complaint against Mr. Besson. Under French law, if a complaint filed with prosecutors is dropped -- as was the case on Monday -- the plaintiff, under certain conditions, can file a new complaint that automatically hands over the case to independent investigative judges. Such action also enables the plaintiff to seek both civil and criminal action.

U.S. Soccer Looks South for Tournament

Texto completo: U.S. Soccer has invited South America's 10 soccer federations to bring their national teams to the United States in 2020 for a new intercontinental championship that would run concurrently with that summer's European Championship.
The offer, a package that includes almost $200 million in guarantees to the invited teams and their governing bodies, was made Tuesday in a letter from U.S. Soccer's president, Carlos Cordeiro, to his counterparts at the 10 South American federations. For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents, but with no agreement in sight, U.S. Soccer, eager to fill a gap in the global soccer calendar and bearing an enticing nine-figure offer, is now proposing to establish its own.
In the letter, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation -- and both confederations -- millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Cordeiro has invited the South Americans to a meeting to discuss the proposal next week in Miami.
The proposed 16-team tournament would resemble, in structure though most likely not in name, the 2016 Copa América Centenario. That tournament, a relocated version of the South American championship -- expanded to celebrate the event's 100th anniversary -- brought the 10 members of the South American confederation, Conmebol, to the United States for a month to face off not only against one another, but also a half-dozen opponents from Concacaf, the regional confederation made up of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
That tournament was considered a sporting and -- perhaps more important -- a financial success, and was won by Chile, which beat Argentina in a penalty-kick shootout in the final in East Rutherford, N.J. The new event would take place in June and July next year.
The proposed 2020 tournament would again include all 10 South American teams, plus six from Concacaf, and would most likely feature a group stage and then a knockout round to determine a champion. U.S. Soccer's role in the offer, and Concacaf's consent, would be critical to making the event happen, since both would have to approve any plans to hold such an event in the United States.
Concacaf released a statement Tuesday night acknowledging receipt of Cordeiro's overture and expressing support for its broad strokes: "We view this opportunity positively as it is not intended to replace or substitute any future editions of the Concacaf Gold Cup and it complements our vision to continue providing opportunities for our Member Associations to play competitive football at the highest level."
In his letter, a draft of which was seen by The New York Times, Cordeiro took pains to emphasize that the new event would be a singular tournament, and not meant to replace existing events like the Copa América or the Gold Cup, which would continue separately. Conmebol, which will contest this year's Copa in June and July in Brazil, said last year that it was planning to shift the Copa América to a quadrennial schedule starting in 2020, to coincide with UEFA's European Championship. Concacaf holds its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, in odd-numbered years; this year's Gold Cup matches will be played in the United States, Costa Rica and at least one Caribbean nation.
For next summer, though, Cordeiro is proposing a larger, intercontinental event in the United States. The event could fill a gap in the global soccer calendar -- at the moment, the Euros are the only major championship scheduled for that summer -- but despite the millions being offered, it is unclear how South American and Conmebol officials will react to a tournament that would conflict with their Copa América plans.
The Copa América has included guest teams for years; Mexico and the United States have participated in it several times, and this year it will include Japan and Qatar.
For the United States, though, the event could have several positives. FIFA is expected to choose the dozen or so host cities for the 2026 World Cup in the next two years, so the tournament could be a chance for the 17 finalists to make their case for inclusion. It also would offer meaningful competition for the United States men's national team as it heads into qualifying for the 2022 World Cup; that process began later than hoped because the search for the team's head coach, Gregg Berhalter, was delayed, first by the World Cup bid and then by the search for a general manager to run the national team program. Hired in December, Berhalter has coached only two friendlies to date as he prepares for this summer's Gold Cup.
If the proposed tournament with Conmebol does not come to fruition, U.S. Soccer could still press ahead with a new event, possibly a scaled-down tournament involving teams from other continents.

U.S. News: House Looks Into Trump-Whitaker Contact

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee believes it has evidence that President Trump asked Matthew Whitaker, at the time the acting attorney general, whether Manhattan U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman could regain control of his office's investigation into Mr. Trump's former lawyer and his real-estate business, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Berman, a former law partner of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani who in 2016 donated to the Trump campaign and whom the president personally interviewed for the U.S. attorney job, last year had recused himself from involvement in the matter. He didn't give a reason, but legal experts said his interim status at the time the probe began would have made his involvement appear improper. The investigation began as a probe of the business dealings of Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, and has broadened to examine the Trump Organization.
Mr. Cohen on Wednesday is set to deliver public testimony for the first time before the House Oversight Committee, in which he is expected to talk about his decade of working for Mr. Trump and about the hush-money payments he arranged during the 2016 campaign to women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to charges including campaign-finance violations and lying to Congress, and last year he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Federal prosecutors have directly implicated the president in the payoff scheme, referring to him in court papers as "Individual-1," alleging publicly what The Wall Street Journal previously had detailed in its reporting on those payments.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.
There is no sign Mr. Whitaker acted on any request from Mr. Trump, which the New York Times reported last week. But the House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Mr. Whitaker may have perjured himself before the panel this month, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Whitaker told the panel: "At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation."
Any evidence that Mr. Trump sought to intervene in the federal prosecutors' probe could propel further lines of inquiry by lawmakers into whether he has tried to obstruct the investigation into his business dealings.
During his Feb. 8 hearing, Mr. Whitaker also denied news reports that Mr. Trump had lashed out at him after federal prosecutors in late November obtained a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen, and he refused to say whether he had ever spoken to the president about the case. The Judiciary Committee said in a letter to Mr. Whitaker this month that it had identified individuals with direct knowledge of phone calls from Mr. Trump in which he had expressed frustration over Mr. Cohen's guilty pleas.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), the House Judiciary chairman, tweeted last week that the panel wanted the former acting attorney general to return and "clarify his testimony."
Mr. Whitaker declined to comment. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec also wouldn't comment on Mr. Whitaker's private conversations with the president, saying Mr. Whitaker stood by his committee testimony. Mr. Trump last week called reports of the conversation about Mr. Berman "fake news."
Mr. Trump has had frequent private discussions with allies in which he has complained about federal prosecutors, who are examining dealings by some of the president's closest associates.

Iran's Foreign Minister Says He's Stepping Down

Texto completo: ISTANBUL -- Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran announced Monday that he was resigning, in what seemed a sudden end to the tenure of one of the Islamic Republic's best-known figures abroad.
Mr. Zarif, an American-educated diplomat who was an architect of the Iranian nuclear deal, announced that he was stepping down in a post on his Instagram account.
It was not immediately clear why he was quitting or whether his resignation would be accepted. In the post, Mr. Zarif said he apologized "for my inability to continue serving and for all the shortcomings during my service."
His resignation announcement also was reported by Iran's Fars News Agency.
Mr. Zarif's public resignation in a country where governance is usually conducted behind closed doors seemed to indicate escalating tensions between the country's hard-liners and President Hassan Rouhani.
Iran is in the midst of a dire economic crisis, exacerbated by American sanctions aimed at punishing it for what the United States considers destabilizing Iranian actions abroad. This has increased pressure on Mr. Rouhani.
The loss of Mr. Zarif could make Mr. Rouhani's job harder, because Mr. Zarif was the only top Iranian official with a deep understanding of Western diplomacy and the ability to interact directly with the West. He was a regular at international forums, where he offered spirited defenses of his country's policies in fluent English.
Addressing experts and policymakers from around the world at the Munich Security Conference this month, Mr. Zarif struck back at criticisms that Iran was destabilizing the Middle East. He said Washington had an "unhealthy fixation" with Iran and called the United States "the biggest source of destabilization in our neighborhood."
Mr. Zarif also was known for his collaboration with John Kerry, the secretary of state under President Barack Obama who negotiated the 2015 international pact limiting Iran's nuclear activities. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement last May, and later reimposed sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. The other parties to the agreement -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- have said they want to preserve it.
Mr. Zarif's role in dealing with the United States has left him vulnerable to attacks from hard-liners in Iran who contend the Americans should never be trusted.
In Iran, the resignation of the foreign minister must be accepted by the president before it goes into effect, which can sometimes lead to resignation announcements being made to send political messages. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Rouhani would accept the resignation.
Political analysts who have followed the course of the nuclear agreement said Mr. Zarif's resignation, if accepted, did not necessarily signal the agreement's demise.
"Iran is still very likely to wait out Trump's first term, hope he loses, and engage a Democratic successor on resuming U.S. participation," said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consultancy.
"But Iran without Zarif would face a rocky road on foreign policy," Mr. Kupchan said. "This foreign minister is a smiling face to the world, who has charmed many interlocutors. The Islamic Republic would be very hard pressed to find a successor so skilled."
Mr. Zarif was unusual for an Iranian diplomat -- a fluent, colloquial English speaker who knew American society, and so Western that during the negotiations over the nuclear deal, his hard-line adversaries in Tehran called him "Zarif the American." This was not necessarily a distortion: He attended college in San Francisco and the University of Denver for graduate school, and kept his ties.
A high point of his time in office came as he was negotiating with Mr. Kerry over the intricacies of the nuclear deal. They often argued -- one day the two could be heard shouting at each other through a closed door -- but there was a connection between them that helped lead to an agreement.
Mr. Zarif himself acknowledged as much in an interview with The New York Times as a draft of the deal was reaching its final stages. He said that "if not for Obama and Rouhani, if not for me and John, I am not sure this ever would have been possible."
But Mr. Zarif also was bitter about what he viewed as American double standards around the world, an assumption in Washington, he believed, that the United States only interfered in global affairs for good, not national interest, and that Iran did so out of perfidy.
At one point in 2014, he described to a reporter evidence that the United States had been shipping in damaged parts to an Iranian reactor, which he said could have led to an accident and loss of life. There was no evidence of his specific charge, but the United States has conducted similar operations against Iranian rockets and missiles and, famously, sabotaged an Iranian nuclear enrichment plant in the city of Natanz with a cyberweapon, part of a vast American covert operation code-named Olympic Games.
Mr. Zarif appeared to be at the center of the Iranian strategy to adhere to the nuclear deal he had negotiated, even after President Trump had abandoned it.
And as time went on, and American sanctions were reimposed, he appeared to have a dwindling constituency in Tehran and none in Washington.
Iranians are angry over never having received the promised economic rewards for their concession in the agreement to ship out 97 percent of their nuclear fuel and restrict the production of new fuel for 15 years. Mr. Zarif's many meetings with Europeans in recent months to develop a barter system, going around reimposed American sanctions, amounted to little.
"Many around the world, particularly on this continent, speak eloquently about multilateralism, but they also need to walk the walk," Mr. Zarif said in his last public address to the West, at the Munich Security Conference. The arrangement with Europe, he said, fell short of Europe's effort to save the nuclear deal, and "Europe needs to be willing to get wet if it wants to swim against a dangerous tide of U.S. unilateralism."
The Trump administration refused to communicate with Mr. Zarif. Senior officials declared he was powerless and asked reporters why they quoted him. He was in the same room once with Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, but the two never exchanged more than polite greetings. Mike Pompeo, Mr. Tillerson's successor, never dealt with Mr. Zarif, American officials say.
Mr. Zarif's resignation announcement came the same day as President Bashar al-Assad of Syria met with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other top officials during a surprise visit to Tehran.
Iran has played a critical role in supporting Mr. Assad and propping up his government since Syria's civil war started in 2011. Along with providing funds to keep Mr. Assad afloat, Iran has provided supplies and militia fighters to back up his troops in battles against rebels seeking his ouster.
The visit was Mr. Assad's first publicly disclosed trip to the Iranian capital since 2010, and photos released by Iranian and Syrian state news agencies showed him chatting not only with the ayatollah but other Iranian officials, including Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. He also met with Mr. Rouhani.
Mr. Khamenei praised Mr. Assad for strengthening the ties between Iran, Syria and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, the largest forces in a regional alliance that opposes the United States and Israel and refers to itself as "the axis of resistance."
"The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it," Mr. Khamenei said.

Texto completo: To watch Rep. Duncan Hunter on TV is to see a diligent, baritone-voiced congressman championing conservative causes and defending soldiers accused of war crimes. But on Capitol Hill, Hunter, R-Alpine, is hamstrung, stripped of committee assignments that are vital to a lawmaker’s influence and effectiveness.
Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan forced Hunter to resign from the Armed Services, Education and the Workforce, and Transportation and Infrastructure committees last August, following a 60-count federal indictment accusing Hunter and wife, Margaret, of illegally spending $250,000 in campaign funds on groceries, an Italian vacation and airfare for the family’s pet rabbit, among other personal expenses and filing false records.
The Hunters, who pleaded not guilty – Duncan Hunter denounced the charges as politically motivated – are scheduled for trial in September. Until then, Duncan Hunter, 42, whose district includes most of Temecula, is doing what he can to stay – or at least appear – relevant. “Politically, Hunter is radioactive,” said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. “The charges against him involve sleazy corruption, not some great matter of national policy. So his influence on other lawmakers is pretty limited.
“The staff can take care of constituent services, but they typically do not (need) much involvement by the member. Yes, members can sit on the floor and cast votes, but it would be extremely rare for a single vote to decide a major measure.”
Lacking committees is “a pretty big deal,” said Robert Boatright, a political science professor at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. “Legislators without committee assignments are limited in their ability to procure benefits for their districts, and they don’t really have that much to do during the days they spend in Washington.”
“With that said, Republicans are now in the minority, so all Republicans are facing a reduction in their ability to deliver benefits for their constituents. So this is less harmful than it would have been had Republicans remained in the majority.”
It’s unclear whether Hunter’s constituents will notice or care about his lack of committee assignments. “I have noticed no difference either way,” said Temecula Mayor Mike Naggar.
Hunter declined interview requests. His spokesman, Michael Harrison, said the 10-year congressman “will continue working hard on the issues he believes are most important to both his constituents and the country as a whole.”
While being committee-less “is not ideal, it by no means is keeping Congressman Hunter from doing the work he was elected to do,” Harrison added.
Hunter represents California’s 50th Congressional District, a ruby red enclave in a deep-blue state where registered Republican voters outnumber registered Democrats by 13 percentage points.
Hunter, whose father, Duncan Hunter Sr., represented the district for almost 30 years, traditionally cruises to re-election, winning with 63 percent of the vote in 2016 and 71 percent in 2014.
He got just 52 percent of the vote last November in beating Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who out-raised Hunter and plans to run for the seat in 2020. Hunter campaign ads tying Campa-Najjar, a Christian and native Southern Californian of Palestinian and Mexican heritage, to terrorism spurred accusations of racism and fear-mongering.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put Hunter on its 2020 target list. Besides Campa-Najjar, Democrat Alex Balkin and Republicans Matt Rahn, Bill Wells and Larry Wilske have filed to run for Hunter’s seat in 2020.
Hunter isn’t the only committee-less congressman. Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, who was charged with insider trading, has no assignments, and Iowa Republican Steve King, lost his committee seats after telling The New York Times “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?”
“I suppose they can form a ‘pariah caucus,’” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, told POLITICO.
Hunter stood out before his legal woes. Named Washington’s top “Party Animal” by Washingtonian magazine in 2014, Hunter made headlines for vaping during a congressional hearing, and he was one of the first congressmen to endorse then-candidate Donald Trump.
100-day plan
Hunter is still allowed to join legislative caucuses. A list of caucus memberships on his House website includes the Congressional Wine Caucus, Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus, Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and the House Border Security Caucus.
After being sworn in last month, Hunter announced a “First 100-Day Initiative,” which he described in a February constituent newsletter as a series of bills “to implement common-sense reforms that will benefit the lives of everyday Americans.”
They include the AMERICA Act to protect census respondents’ data, the BRAVE Act to raise the burial allowance for veteran families and the No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act, which would deny federal funds to colleges and universities that don’t cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration law.
The odds are against Hunter’s bills passing the Democrat-controlled House.
A Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, Hunter has come to the aid of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of murdering an Islamic State prisoner of war, as well as Army Maj. Matt Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with premeditated murder in the death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker.
Gallagher was charged “based on inconsistent testimony and without any physical evidence,” Hunter wrote in his February newsletter. The congressman has asked the president to review Gallagher’s case.
Regarding Golsteyn, “what I think we have here is a case of what the U.S. government would call compassionate combat,” Hunter told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday, Feb. 13.
Under George W. Bush and Barack Obama “(the government) wanted us to kill the bad guys, but in the right way, meaning they want us to kill guys compassionately and only under the rules of engagement that they say to you,” Hunter said.
Otherwise, “the U.S. government then is going to try you for murder and put you in jail, even if you’re a decorated Green Beret (or) if you’re a Navy SEAL.”
This year, Hunter has spoken to Fox News other conservative media about border security, his legislation, Gallagher and Golsteyn, the federal government shutdown and his reaction to Trump’s State of the Union Address.
He shares clips of those appearances on social media. None of the interviews posted to his Twitter account in February mention the indictment, although in a Fox News interview shortly after he was charged, Hunter said his wife handled his finances and “was also the campaign manager so whatever she did, that’ll be looked at too, I’m sure, but I didn’t do it.”
‘Can’t do it’
It’s unclear what would happen if Hunter pleads guilty or is convicted, although he likely would face pressure to resign.
Hunter could serve from behind bars, although he couldn’t vote and the House could move to expel him, said Thad Kousser, a UC San Diego political science professor. If Hunter left office before November 2020, a special election would be held to fill his seat.
Without committees, Boatright said Hunter could try to boost his influence in caucuses and informal working groups.
“Otherwise, start thinking through job options for what to do after Congress!” he said. “Or spend more time in the district (and) treat the lack of committee assignments like a sort of sabbatical.”
Hunter’s staff “will put out material making it seem as if he is doing a lot, even though he is not,” Pitney said.
“Trying to be an effective House member without serving on a committee is like trying to play in the Super Bowl without leaving the locker room. You can’t do it.”

Guest opinion: Blessed are the peacemakers

Texto completo: "Blessed" has become more of a trendy hashtag, less of a genuine appreciation for life’s boons.
Got new Twitter followers # blessed
Didn’t have to wait in line for my latte # blessed
Instagram post received 1,000 likes # blessed
It’s misuse, albeit annoying, isn’t nearly as maddening as the trending political polarization created by those demanding a more tolerant America.
“We’re going to impeach this (expletive ) ,” congressional leader Rashida Tlaib recently stated. This came only months after boasting to MSNBC that she is teaching her sons, "That we show love. That we lead with compassion and that we lead with a sense of understanding that all of us, that we are part of this humanity together.”
Equally infuriating are those who mandate acceptance of their ideology whilst refusing to show similar courtesies.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” Rep. Steve King lamented in a recent New York Times article. This came after King kicked out a political forum attendee for likening King's ideology to that of the Pittsburgh synagogue’s massacrist — a white nationalist.
Polemicists, naturally, flocked to social media.
”Steve King, like Trump, is (expletive) wrapped in skin.” — Twitter follower
“Rashida, you’re just another wicked devilish Muslim that needs to be deported. In fact, every time I see a picture of you, I am reminded of how demon possessed you are.” — Twitter follower
“…..the GOP disciplined Steve King but the Democrats reward their bigots.” — Twitter follower
“This Guy Says Impeach the MF. Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib had it exactly right!” — Twitter follower.
Acerbic snippets of America’s downward political spiral if ever there were some.
Why?
It’s trendy to be tolerant intolerant.
It’s trendy to be controversial.
It’s trendy to speak without listening.
It’s not, however, en vogue to be peacemakers.
Ironic, considering we cannot progress towards a more tolerant nation without them.
Peacemakers nearing extinction will inevitably be blamed on a myriad of things —President Trump, the Democrats, the Republicans, the media, constituents — yet all is inconsequential. America needs not more scapegoats but a rude awakening.
It begins by redefining peace itself.
We think of peace as absence of war but it’s also about achieving wholeness. The iconic Hebraic word for peace, shalom, in fact, translates to just this. For one to achieve totality, to achieve a higher good, one must not only wish for the absence of evil for their fellow man but for the abundance of good things as well.
Translation?
It is time to make America whole again. This grounded hypothetical bird act — a broken left wing, a broken right wing — is working for only a select few. Nothing is being accomplished nor will it be accomplished if we don’t abandon self-indulged agendas for the greater cause.
Peacemakers themselves also need to be redefined.
We think of peacemakers as formally trained diplomats, yet each of us holds this power if we choose to do so — emphasis on "if."
Example?
In 1983, the Soviet Union shot down a Korean 747, killing all passengers, including 61 Americans. America consequently cut diplomatic ties with the Soviets. Suzanne Massie, an American with expertise in Russian culture and history, saw the urgency of this crossroad. If a peacemaker didn’t step in soon, the two countries would be at war. She promptly began contacting people in Washington before landing a meeting with National Security Advisor Bud McFarlane.
MacFarlane ultimately asked Massie to go to Russia on America’s behalf under the condition of anonymity. Going through the proper channels would take months and no one had that luxury. Massie agreed but with a condition of her own — she needed to meet with President Ronald Reagan and get his blessing. A month later, Reagan approved her mission and the peace process began.
Before the Geneva Convention of ’85, a site where Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met for the first time, Massie gave the president a painted wooden egg that bore the Virgin Mary and an inscription that read, “Don’t Blow up the World.” She asked that he give it to Gorbachev. Its significance? In Russian culture, an egg denotes a new beginning.
One person, a fledgling peacemaker, stopped two superpowers from going to war.
Inspiring indeed.
Peacemakers, perhaps most importantly, must always believe in humanity regardless of the times.
In times of polarization we have a tendency to gauge humanity by the action of a few. This is a fatal mistake. Although there will always be troublemakers, always someone actively stirring the pot, Gandhi said it best, “You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”
Bottom line?
Blessed are those who desire to move toward a whole country.
Blessed are those who champion the greater cause.
Blessed are those who see value in humanity

Amy Klobuchar's bad-boss flaws are disturbing. Should Democrats write her off for 2020?

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar sounds like a strange and unpleasant boss. New reporting on her management style is especially striking given her outward persona as a “Minnesota nice” next-door neighbor.
The record shows Klobuchar has consistently high staff turnover. Accounts in HuffPost, BuzzFeed News and The New York Times, based on reviews of documents and internal emails as well as interviews with as many as 20 former staffers who insisted on anonymity, suggest Klobuchar can be volatile, abusive and paranoid — dressing down aides in public and in humiliating emails copied to many others, calling their work “slop,” suspecting them of sabotage, making it hard for them to find other jobs, making them pick up her clothes and wash her dishes (including a comb she used to eat a salad after berating an aide who didn't bring a fork).
Is it sexist to discuss this topic? Is it irrelevant? Is it unfair, given the deficiencies of the “manager” now in the White House? And is it so damaging that Democrats should write off Klobuchar as a presidential contender?
The answer in every case should be no.
Read more commentary:
Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.
How Bernie Sanders and Democrats can avoid the 2016 mistakes that gave us Trump
The Obamas showed Dems how to bridge the race gap between left and center voters
Klobuchar is relatively centrist in a party moving left. This makes her the type of Democrat many Republicans and independents are hoping will win the 2020 nomination — that is, one they can vote for because they can’t abide President Donald Trump. It also makes her the great hope of Democrats who believe that the overriding imperative in 2020 is to nominate the candidate who has the broadest appeal — particularly in the industrial Midwest's battleground states — and best odds of winning the White House.
In that respect 2020 is shaping up like 1992, when Democrats were determined to end 12 years of Republican presidencies. In focus groups and interviews I did for The Associated Press in New Hampshire, the overriding theme was electability. “I love (liberal populist Iowa Sen. ) Tom Harkin but we have to win so …” “I love (wildly unconventional Vietnam War veteran) Bob Kerrey but we have to win so …” “I love (even more wildly unconventional former and future California Gov. ) Jerry Brown but we have to win so …”
The electable choice was a moderate Southern governor. The end of the sentence was always “I’m voting for Bill Clinton. ”
Klobuchar could bridge Democratic divides
Of the major Democrats now running, Klobuchar most resembles that candidate in the abstract. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and others could eventually join her in the center lane.
Klobuchar has so far handled the party’s left-center split in ways that reflect preparation and, one hopes, authenticity. Medicare for All? “It could be a possibility in the future. I'm just looking at something that will work now,” like allowing the public to buy Medicare or Medicaid coverage, she said this month in her CNN town hall. Green New Deal? “An aspiration in that (it’s) something we need to move towards,” starting with immediately rejoining the Paris climate accord and restoring Obama-era clean power rules and gas mileage standards.
Nor did Klobuchar appear fazed when Bob Gigliotti, an assistant professor of business management at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, asked whether she is "a difficult person to work for. " She replied that she had managed “hundreds of prosecutors” as Hennepin County attorney in Minneapolis and that, on Capitol Hill, “My chief of staff has worked for me for six years, my state director for seven years, my campaign manager for 14 years. ”
But even in Klobuchar's Hennepin County attorney days, there were oddities and complaints, and she knows she still has a lot to prove. She suggested the presidential campaign will be her crucible: “That's a pretty good way to judge people and how they manage something. ”
Volatility yardstick is crucial, not sexist bias
She’s right about that. One reason for Barack Obama's 2008 successes is that he demonstrated solid, disciplined management of his campaign from February 2007 to November 2008. That aura of steady competence, through crises as personal as his controversial pastor and as terrifying as Wall Street's meltdown, helped him beat the best known woman in the country in the Democratic primaries and the experienced (but sometimes impetuous) Arizona Sen. John McCain in the general election.
And it was not a bait and switch. Obama’s presidency had its problems, but he ran an orderly, fact-based, minimal-drama administration that “the best people” did not flee or trash.
Are Klobuchar’s apparent management flaws disturbing? Yes. Are they disqualifying? Not yet. In the next 20 months, she has a sustained chance to show she has learned and changed — that she can run a drama-free Senate office and a stable, even-keeled presidential campaign.
It's not biased to apply this yardstick. It has nothing to do with Klobuchar’s gender or any double standard. Trump shows us every single day why competence, discipline and management skills are absolutely essential in the next president. It is a top consideration on my check list for all candidates, as it should be for every American desperate to end the Trump era.

Texto completo: The 2019 legislative session is approaching the halfway mark.
In this first half, many bills have been introduced that have generated much buzz, such as one that would have put restrictions on salons that lease out "booths" to hair stylists. The bill generated such resistance from the hair salon industry - a few thousand salon owners and hairstylists showed up during a public hearing to protest - that its primary sponsor, Sen. Karen Keiser, said the bill would not go forward.
Several bills also look to tackle major policy issues. It remains to be seen where the bills - and the conversations among legislators - will go, but it shows Washington state's continued push to act rather than wait for those in the other Washington.
Secure scheduling
House Bill 1491 and its companion, Senate Bill 5717, require restaurants, retailers and hospitality businesses with 100 or more employees (and 40 or more locations) worldwide to give employees 14 days' notice of their work schedule. The bill also proposes compensation if hours are changed. The bill has similarities to a scheduling ordinance passed by the Seattle City Council in 2017.
The push for secure scheduling took hold after supporters, namely workers and unions, called for relief from what they said were retail and restaurant employees' erratic and unpredictable work schedules. Supporters pointed to a 2014 New York Times story that talked about Starbucks employees who ended up working schedules that had them working back-to-back opening and closing shifts or not getting enough hours in a given week. Starbucks has since changed its policies.
Secure scheduling, however, has its fair share of detractors. Not surprisingly, those in the hospitality and restaurant industry say the concept only creates more paperwork and record-keeping hassles.
And while there are plenty of workers who say the policy helps them, there are others who are against the policy. A group of restaurant employees called the Full Service Workers Alliance of Seattle had been voicing concern that such policies limit flexibility for workers and limit the option to pick up extra shifts outside their scheduled time.
This bill, like the Seattle ordinance, however, focuses on large corporations rather than mom-and-pop businesses.
Universal health care
While there is uncertainty over the future of the Affordable Care Act, legislators here are looking to lead in this area by contemplating and perhaps implementing a universal health care plan for the state.
Senate Bill 5822 seeks to form a study group of stakeholders including consumers, health care providers and businesses with self-insurance models that would explore how to create and implement a universal health care plan in this state, with a plan to report findings in November 2020. The Senate Health and Long Term Care committee held a public hearing of the bill last week and voted to continue with a substitute version of the bill.
SB 5222 proposes a Washington Health Trust that would, as the bill states, "provide coverage for a set of essential health benefits to all Washington state residents." The bill awaits a hearing with the Senate Health & Long Term Care committee.
Affordable housing
More and more people in this state, especially in the more expensive Seattle metropolitan area, are struggling to afford a home as home prices and monthly rents rise. It's no surprise that there is renewed focus by Republican and Democrat legislators to tackle this issue.
House Democrats, for example, revealed a four-point approach to tackling a lack of affordable housing: pushing for sales tax credits, public works loans and other incentives to encourage more building; streamlining regulations on the construction and lending sides; increasing housing density around public transit centers; and reforming the current eviction system.
To that end, several bills have been introduced by Democrats, including House Bill 1453 (and its companion Senate Bill 5600), which seeks to make reforms in the eviction process, such as lengthening the time tenants have to pay rent before the landlord can start the eviction process.
Republicans have also introduced several bills to tackle the issue, including House Bill 2010, which would direct the Washington State Housing Finance Commission to look at options that would have for-profit developers participate in a tax incentive program to build affordable multifamily housing. A second bill, House Bill 2011, would identify potential cost savings by requiring the commission to submit a report of data of unit production, development and operation costs for housing financed by the commission.

Texto completo: This past week on a snow day, I escaped the slush outside and went onstage.
Surrounded by actors, I was the center of attention. Luckily, nobody noticed when I stumbled as I walked around the set.
I was the ghost of Hamlet’s father, and I never left home.
This was possible through virtual reality. Google, working with Commonwealth Shakespeare Co., created an hourlong VR version of “Hamlet.” “Hamlet 360: Thy Father’s Spirit” brings the tragedy written in early 1600s into the 21st century. It left me dizzy, literally and figuratively, and excited about the potential to bring more art alive.
This Boston-based Shakespeare group tried something new, complicated and pricey ($500,000) as a big way to grow.
“This allows us to scale that mission to the world and truly democratize Shakespeare and theater,” Steven Maler, the director of the film and the founding artistic company, told The New York Times.
WGBH, a PBS member station in Boston, shared the video for free on its YouTube page last month. With a cheap VR headset, you can be immersed in the world of “Hamlet.” It’s a world that VR pioneer Nonny de la Pena calls a visceral empathy generator.
“It can make people feel in a way that nothing, no other platform I’ve ever worked in, can successfully do in this way,” she said during an immersive journalism course.
It’s true for journalism and for the arts as well.
So how does it work?
I have a VR viewer on the low end, a Google Cardboard viewer bought online for $15. There are cheaper versions at places like Amazon and Best Buy. Headsets made from materials sturdier than cardboard can be found for $300 (PlayStation), $400 (Oculus) or more.
If you haven’t used a cardboard headset, it’s pretty simple. Just pop your smartphone in the front and cue up a VR video from Facebook, YouTube or an app.
For the VR “Hamlet,” you are the ghost of Hamlet’s father. The action takes place not on a stage in front of you, but surrounding you. The set is a giant room filled with flickering lamps and furniture. The scene morphs into a cemetery in a cloud of smoke at one point.
Through the scenes, the actors move around you, the ghost of murdered King Hamlet. It’s exciting and a little confusing. Logistically, I was stumped with where to place my body in the real world. When you’re in a theater or watching a film version of a Shakespeare play, you’re sitting in a chair looking straight ahead.
Watching 360 Shakespeare, I twisted around a couch to catch the next person entering. I jumped up to turn all the way around and often took a few steps to orient myself. This is definitely not something you want to watch next to a staircase. At one point, I sat in bed, thinking that would be the most comfortable place to twist around. But then I almost fell out. So with potential comes a learning curve.
Also, this might not be easy to watch with others. I was fumbling around in an audience of one. It would have been a bit more disorienting with a few people, each in their own worlds, bumping around.
Plus, VR can make some people physically ill. Changing scenes too often can be disorienting, and wobbly camerawork can make some people nauseous. This didn’t happen for me, thankfully, but I still needed to take a break every few minutes, sometimes even in the middle of long scenes.
However, the actors were so close, I reached out to tap them a few times. I took a step to the side to see if my reflection would somehow show up in a mirror (nope).
In one scene you’re there watching Hamlet plead with his mother. Turn to the left and Polonius is on the floor, stabbed to death and bleeding. In the final scenes, you’re surrounded by action. (Spoiler alert) Hamlet and Laertes have a swordfight in front of you as the queen stumbles behind you, stricken by her poisoned drink.
Whew!
One thing I’ll do next time: put my phone on do not disturb. Watching Shakespeare in a virtual reality setting is even more disorienting when you get Dairy Queen deals popping up and New York Times alerts throughout the performance.
Spending an hour watching this production made me think of dystopian films that show people addicted to virtual worlds, like “Ready Player One.”
But there is a place for virtual reality in the arts.
How cool would it be to walk through an art exhibit halfway around the world?
Or stand in the middle of a troupe of dancers onstage?
Or maybe see how the pros manage a quick costume change in a packed backstage?
Once I figure out the perfect place to watch, I’m excited to explore.

'Merchants' casts grim eye on news business

Texto completo: One of the facts bemoaned by traditional journalists in the current state of the news business is that, with a growing banquet of news to offer on any given day, in any given hour, consumers are opting for boiled down listicles and scannable reads.
It's the antithesis in style to what The New York Times used to embody, particularly by its former senior editorial leader, Jill Abramson, the first woman to serve as the paper's Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor – the top job in American print journalism.
But as everyone knows , Abramson didn't last long at the top; just three years. In May 2014, she was fired for allegedly poor management and being too "difficult" for even hard-boiled Times journalists to handle.
Her account of what happened as laid out in her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," is absorbing and fair – and it's likely the first section many journalists will turn to.
"There was no simple reason I was fired. I was a less than stellar manager, but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders. Most of all, I became the first woman editor at a very bad time in journalism," she writes.
Now comes "Merchants," published Tuesday (Simon & Schuster, ).
Reviews have been generally positive, mixed with sharp criticism. There already has been a contretemps over whether she accused the Times of being biased against President Donald Trump in its coverage. She batted that away as an exaggeration of something taken out of context. A fair reading backs her up.
Now she and her publisher are dealing with more serious charges of factual errors and plagiarism lodged late Wednesday in a series of tweets on Twitter by a reporter for one of the four news organizations she examines in the book, Vice – which under her gaze does not come off as a journalistic paragon.
Simon & Schuster issued a statement Thursday promising revisions if warranted in the 534-page book. Abramson also issued a statement to USA TODAY that the passages in question involve facts that were imperfectly cited in her 70 pages of footnotes. "I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," she said.
Meanwhile, the book as published documents the crisis: Journalism may have not yet been annihilated but the barbarians are at the gate and banging hard. More news than ever is out there and more people than ever are in need of reliable information in order for democracy to function, Abramson observes.
At the same time, she reports, the journalism business model is stuttering and a steadier replacement is not yet obvious. Every news company struggles to produce a product for the digital age amid sharp staff cuts, while more consumers, marinated in "the internet is free!" assumptions, are unwilling to pay for it, Abramson says.
The author explores this grim state through the experiences of two legacy media titans, her former employer, the Times, and the Washington Post, fighting to retain their "values" in a maelstrom, and two digital titans, BuzzFeed and Vice, "improbable players" in an arena where social media drives large numbers of consumers to news.
"I was determined to capture this moment of wrenching transition – and to do it as a reporter, my first calling," Abramson writes.
She has her pet peeves: The sometimes dishonest nature of clickbait headlines, designed to capture attention but promising more than they deliver. Tedious business meetings watching PowerPoint presentations of eye-glazing data charts. The "ridiculously" few women in senior editing jobs at the Times, a deficit she is most proud of improving during her tenure.
She is alarmed about the chipping away of the traditional wall between the news side and the business side. When the new CEO of the Times told her he expected new "revenue-producing products" to come from the newsroom, she snapped, "If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor ... The truth had flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or tone."
Abramson doesn't see an entirely trouble-free future for any of her examined news organizations, despite their various successes. "All four are endangered," she warns. That even goes for the Post, which was rescued in 2013 by its "white knight," Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the family-owned paper for $250 million with the idea that "restoring its glory would be a contribution to democracy."
For legacy media survivors, following the trials and tribulations of two newspapers may involve equal measures of envy, dread and schadenfreude. BuzzFeed and Vice may seem like alien entities.
Abramson traces how BuzzFeed began with a steady diet viral cat videos, but founder and "virality" genius Jonah Peretti and his team figured out how to connect with a mostly disaffected young audience through their emotions – at the "beating heart of the internet." They pioneered a new business model – native advertising – and by the end of 2011, BuzzFeed had "pivoted" to original news reporting, beefing up its reporting staff with a goal of being taken seriously.
Vice started out as a print lads mag constantly pushing the bounds of bad taste in the quest to be "edgy," which led to such outrages as "The Racist Issue." In 2017, Vice's 18 hours of footage of the deadly Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right rally garnered a total of 50 million views and became the "defining image" of the violence, Abramson says.
Non-journalists may find "Merchants" dense and complicated, with something surprising or infuriating on every page. Journalists working today already know in their guts most of what Abramson is reporting, if not in the depressing detail she presents.
Abramson earns three stars for her thoroughness and insights, but this is not a beach read, and certainly not a happy read. Unless, of course, you believe journalists are the enemy of the people.
Jill Abramson and "Merchants of Truth" are facing plagiarism charges.

Why the Priesthood Needs Women

Texto completo: No Christian should need to be reminded of the moral error of discrimination. We hold at the center of our faith the belief that every human life is of equal value. And yet the Roman Catholic Church, my church, excludes more than half its members from full participation by barring women, for reasons of gender alone, from the priesthood.
The moral consequences of this failing become abundantly clear each time another instance of clergy abuse, and cover-up, is revealed. It is the inevitable logic of discrimination: If one life, one person, is of more value than another, then "the other," the lesser, is dispensable. For the male leaders of the Catholic Church, the lives of women and children become secondary to the concerns of the more worthy, the more powerful, the more essential person -- the male person, themselves.
The Catholic Church needs to correct this moral error.
I was visiting a Catholic university in Boston in 2002 as the clergy abuse scandal involving Cardinal Bernard Law was breaking. I was there to discuss a novel I had written, but the questions from the audience at my talk -- and at the book signing after, and on the sidewalk as I walked to my car -- were mostly, if passionately, rhetorical: What do we do now? Where do we go from here? Do you think the church understands our pain? Do you think the church understands what we've lost? How much corruption should we tolerate?
At the time, I could offer only small commiseration -- as well as my regret that these Catholics had been so betrayed by their spiritual leaders that they were left to seek solace from the likes of me, a reluctant and often contrarian Catholic, a novelist, a woman. "Awful, yes," I said. "Outrageous, yes." "Hope," I said now and again. "Hope for change, perhaps."
In the intervening years, the institutional church has learned to expand its vocabulary to include such words as "transparency" and "victim" and even "prosecute." In the intervening years, wrists have been slapped, apologies made, some twisted souls have been sent to jail. But even as bishops and other Catholic leaders gather in Rome this weekend to address the abuse crisis, no Catholic I know feels assured that real change will come, that the worst is behind us, that some prince of the church, even a sainted pope, won't eventually be revealed as a predator, an enabler.
For those of us trying to hang on to our affiliation with the Catholic Church, Pope Francis's recent defrocking of Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington, though commendable, is no recompense for the blindness, the arrogance, the cruelty of a system that allowed that pathetic man to become the shepherd of one of the most visible dioceses in the world. We fear that boys' club secrecy and prancing misogyny, the profound moral error of discrimination, will prevail.
For myself, and for many of the Catholics I know (especially women), the question of how much corruption we can tolerate is now weighed against the tremendous loss we would feel, if we left this church. It's an institution that has shaped us, comforted us, guided and informed us, that is the center of our spiritual lives as well as our community lives and family lives, the source of our own moral strength, of our faith in the substance of things hoped for. And yet small commiserations can no longer placate our outrage. A sea change is required.
Forty years ago, when, as the evidence now shows, abusive priests and winking bishops were flourishing throughout the world, Sister Theresa Kane of the Sisters of Mercy stirred a bit of outrage in the Catholic rank and file when she implored Pope John Paul II, on his first trip to the United States, to "be open to, and respond to, the voices coming from the women of this country." She added later that "serious social injustices" were imposed on Catholic women by the "very system" of their church, and that until the church began reckoning with this uncomfortable fact, it could not "give witness to justice in the world."
Sister Theresa was not the first voice in the Catholic Church to suggest that discrimination against women was at odds with the church's core mission. More than a decade before, in 1965, the Second Vatican Council released a document called "Gaudium et Spes," or "Joy and Hope" -- two gifts now in short supply among the Catholics I know. It said, in part: "With respect to the fundamental rights of the person, every type of discrimination, whether social or cultural, whether based on sex, race, color, social condition, language or religion, is to be overcome and eradicated as contrary to God's intent."
In barring women from the priesthood, then, what Sister Theresa called the "very system" of the Catholic Church is adhering to a rule, a mere custom, that is contrary to God's intent. It is this grave moral error, far more than priestly celibacy or Catholic sexual repression, that provides the implicit rationale for abusive priests and, more insidious still, for the men who excuse and protect them.
Rape and abuse is not about sexual longing or loneliness. It is about power. It is about the cruel dehumanization of the other, the perceived lesser being, in order to gain, and retain, power. The institutionalized misogyny of the Catholic Church reinforces the notion of women, and their children, as the lesser. Catholic women, and their children, can have no assurance that the church can reform itself until that essential error is addressed and corrected. And that error cannot be corrected as long as women cannot be priests.
Lately, as I have listened to the conversations of my dismayed and discouraged fellow Catholics, I have thought of the Catholic women who have shaped my own faith -- nuns, teachers, mothers, friends. I've recalled the particular sound of these women's voices when they have come to the end of their patience; it's a calm, powerful, sober sound, a formidable voice that can bring children up short, silence excuses, restore order to chaos. It's the voice of a woman saying, simply: "All right. That's enough."
It's the voice the Catholic hierarchy needs to hear.

Texto completo: It’s soup weather for all, but especially for yours truly, who is trying to shake his “touch of pneumonia,” in the doctor’s phrase.
Soup has become a frequent meal, whether it’s out of a can or bag or served in a restaurant. In the past three weeks I’ve had chicken and wild rice, chicken and vegetables, tomato rice, Italian wedding, cioppino, spinach, consommé, ramen and, by the time you read this, birria.
Last weekend, I had home-cooked chicken noodle soup courtesy of reader Trudi Blair.
Blair, who figured into a 2017 column on St. George’s Church in Ontario, told me then: “Although I have nothing to prove it, I believe I am your No. 1 fan.”
She sent me a get-well card recently and included this note: “I’d love to make my chicken soup because it heals everyone and also it’s delicious.”
Chicken soup for the columnist’s soul? I’ll take it.
I phoned her that Friday. She had fresh soup for me. “I made it yesterday when it was raining and raining,” she said. It has, she said, “lots of vegetables,” chicken and baby pasta.
Describing her well-rounded concoction, Blair said: “This will give you vegetables, starch, protein and vegetables.” I guess it does have a lot of vegetables.
“Do you need crackers?” she asked.
She gave me directions to her Ontario residence and I stopped by on my way home.
Blair had made up a take-home bag for me with a plastic container of soup, a bag of low-salt crackers, a carton of Goldfish crackers, a bag of Pink Lady apples, a bag of cookies and a container of chocolates.
Worthy of note: She is 90.
As I write this, I’ve finished the soup, the crackers, the cookies and the apples, with about half the Goldfish and all the chocolates left. I can’t say I’m healed, but I’m full.
While it’s not for me to decide whether or not Trudi Blair is my No. 1 fan, especially when there’s a reader who delivered Vince’s Spaghetti to my doorstep, let me say this: I’m a fan of Trudi Blair.
Legends in Pomona
When they were in high school, future baseball greats Jackie Robinson (of Muir Tech in Pasadena) and Ted Williams (of Hoover High in San Diego) played in the 1935 and 1936 Pomona High School Baseball Tournament, sponsored by the 20-30 Club.
“At the time, this was one of the largest sporting events in the area, attracting thousands of spectators,” said Scott Schroeder, a baseball enthusiast who’s been researching the tournament.
“It’s pretty amazing that Jackie Robinson and Ted Williams were both in this high school tournament, with no idea what the future had in store for them,” Schroeder added. “They were just high school kids.”
He’s been trying to track down copies of the 1935 and 1936 programs and reputed panoramic photos of the teams. I don’t know that a mention here will help, but it can’t hurt. Schroeder can be contacted at scott.schroeder@iaml.com or at 949-278-2648.
Online only
It’s been a while since I’ve mentioned recent posts to my blog at insidesocal.com/davidallen.
Let’s see, I named my favorite films and records of 2018, shared my reading for the month of January (as did several readers), reminded you of the day in 1990 when Ronald Reagan and Bob Hope visited Chaffey College, and ate meals at Vita Italian Bar and Grill and Slummin’ Gourmet, both in Pomona, Old World Deli in Upland and Pola’s Mariscos in Montclair.
Old World is a great place for soup, by the way.
Valley Vignette
The New York Times ran an obituary for Tom Cade, leader of an effort that re-established the peregrine falcon on the East Coast after it had been wiped out by DDT. As reader Larry Wineinger brought to my attention, Cade, who died Feb. 6 at 91, saw his first falcon in the 1940s when hiking with a friend at the San Dimas Reservoir. “It whistled over our heads. It sounded like an artillery shell passing over us,” he said in 2008. “It caught our attention.”

Texto completo: Outcry over Oscar-nominated movies isn't unusual, especially in the competitive Hollywood arena where one movie's disaster is another movie's gain.
Just look at modern history: Last year's best picture contender "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" was castigated by critics for letting its racist cop (played by Sam Rockwell) off the hook by the time the credits rolled. "Selma" played with the facts around President Johnson's support of Martin Luther King Jr. "Zero Dark Thirty," about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was famously embroiled in scandal, with some claiming it glorified torture.
And "The Birth of a Nation" never made it into the 2017 Oscar race after being hobbled by filmmaker Nate Parker's personal history.
But in the social media-drenched climate of 2019, the fires have been particularly quick to burst out. Here's a guide to the best-picture nominees that are dealing with contentious debates leading up to the Academy Awards on Sunday (ABC, 8 p. m. ET/5 PT).
Oscars 2019: So . . . almost any movie could win best picture this year
Predicting the Oscars: Who will win — and who should
'Green Book' is called out for accuracy
For an ultimately uplifting story of the real-life relationship between black pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American chauffeur Tony "Lip" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), "Green Book" has been one of the most polarizing films of the year, with some critics chastising its portrayal of race relations, told predominately from the white character's point of view.
Shirley's family has called into question the veracity of key details, calling "Green Book" a “symphony of lies," and asserting they were never consulted for the project. The filmmakers have stood by the story and Shirley backs up many plot points in newly released interview tapes. "I think people need to go back and hear what Dr. Shirley has to say for himself," Ali said after winning a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.
The filmmakers have dealt with personal tumult as well. In January, reports from 1998 resurfaced, chronicling director Peter Farrelly's old habit of flashing his penis as a prank on movie sets. Farrelly said he was "deeply sorry" for his past behavior.
Screenwriter Nick Vallelonga, Tony's son, came under fire for a 2015 tweet in which he supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's discredited claim that Muslims in New Jersey were seen on TV cheering the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Vallelonga apologized and has vowed "to do better. "
Fire danger level: Moderate. Though getting hit from all directions, "Green Book" still has a lot of love in Hollywood, as evidenced by key wins at the Golden Globes and Producers Guild Awards.
'Bohemian Rhapsody' has a Bryan Singer problem
Although everyone agrees Rami Malek crushed it as Freddie Mercury, the fan-favorite Queen film arrives in the best-picture race laden with controversy. The biggest issue? Singer, the biopic's original (and still credited) director. He was fired toward the end of production, which is messy enough. But in January, The Atlantic published a lengthy report detailing allegations of Singer's sexual misconduct, in some instances with minors. The 53-year-old director has denied any wrongdoing, calling the report "a homophobic smear piece. " Queen guitarist Brian May has apologized for previously defending Singer.
Meanwhile, a chorus of LGBTQ voices have accused "Bohemian Rhapsody" of botching its portrayal of Freddie Mercury's sexuality and suggesting that being gay was the frontman's downfall. Producer Graham King has insisted that the intention wasn't to equate "being gay means being dark. "
Fire danger level: High. In the #MeToo era, Singer's sullied name remains an albatross around the neck of "Bohemian Rhapsody" in the Oscar race, especially given that the film centers on a gay icon.
'Vice' pits Hollywood against Republicans (again)
The gonzo biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney was always going to be a flash point for political controversy, depicting him with ruthless ambition and cunning. Time wrote that "Vice" turned Cheney (played by Christian Bale) into a "cartoon villain," while the National Review called it "conservative vitriol" and "bad history. "
"We really did our best to be accurate with the historic timeline," McKay told USA TODAY, calling "Vice" an incredible story, "regardless of your political leanings. "
Fact-checking 'Vice': Did Dick Cheney really do all of that?
Piling on: While accepting the Golden Globe for best actor, Bale said, "Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration. " Cheney's daughter, Wyoming U. S. Rep. Liz Cheney, fired back by tweeting a 2008 article from The Independent about Bale’s arrest for allegedly assaulting his mother and sister. “Satan probably inspired him to do this, too,” she wrote. (Bale was never charged for assault, with Crown Prosecution Service citing insufficient evidence. )
Fire danger level: Low. There's too much blowback directed at other movies to really knock "Vice" too hard.
Does 'A Star Is Born' have issues with agency?
Ally and Jackson's love story has been a favorite this Oscar season, despite an anemic showing at awards shows of late. While the re-imagining of the classic Hollywood tale has avoided major cultural missteps, some have found the film's change of focus from Ally to Jackson in the second hour problematic.
Vox took issue with Ally's lack of agency in the script, while also calling out "A Star Is Born" for failing to present an "alternative representation of women excelling in a career independent of a man’s actions, direction, success, or reaction to her success. "
The New York Times weighed the film's agenda around gender, noting that "for all its romanticism, the movie reads as a pessimistic take on heterosexual romantic relationships. Here, lasting equality between a man and a woman in love – artists in the same field – isn’t just difficult, it actually kills the guy. "
So is Bradley Cooper's version a modern enough retelling? Agree or disagree, it won't matter much come Oscar night, as such squabbling has been drowned out by the film's die-hard fans.
Fire danger level: Low. Love trumps nitpicking where this "Star" is concerned.
Could 'Roma' dethrone the theater experience?
Critics have lavished praise on Alfonso Cuaron's epic tale of life in 1970s Mexico, but theater geeks have taken issue with how Netflix rolled it out, putting the film in a handful of theaters before it arrived on the streaming service. Critics have called this a cosmetic release and maintain that Netflix's distribution plan, placing movies online at the same time as in theaters, threatens moviegoing at large.
A best picture win (the highest prize in the film industry) for Netflix could resurface the question: Are movie theaters still relevant?
Even after winning two Golden Globes, Cuaron was asked about Netflix backstage in a testy exchange. "A Mexican film in black and white, in Spanish and Mixtec, without stars – how big did you think it would be as a conventional theatrical release?” he replied.
Fire danger level: Moderate. Academy voters are still largely comprised of older film purists, and "Roma" remains a threat to their filmmaking status quo.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Who wants to be the next millionaire?

Texto completo: Sometime in 2012, Sarah Stanley Fallaw and her father, Thomas J. Stanley, started talking about writing a follow-up to "The Millionaire Next Door," the groundbreaking examination of wealth in America. They wanted to address any changes that might have taken place since the book was published, and possibly do an entirely new study looking at the life of millionaires.
Fallaw, by then, had earned a master's degree in psychology and a doctorate in industrial psychology. Part of her work included measuring life experiences to determine what people's future will look like.
"He was going to write the book, and I was going to gather the statistics," she remembered recently.
Just weeks before Fallaw was about to begin that work in 2015, Stanley was killed in a car crash near his home in Marietta. He was 71.
Stanley was a marketing professor at Georgia State University, where he taught until 1989. That year, he transitioned into a consultant for financial institutions and writing books. His first three books were all geared toward financial planners, accountants, and individuals who were in the business of finding affluent populations.
"The Millionaire Next Door," which he co-authored with University at Albany professor William D. Danko in 1996, was a compilation of his research studying the affluent for over 20 years. Stanley went on to write three more books, "The Millionaire Mind," "Millionaire Women Next Door" and "Stop Acting Rich."
"The Millionaire Next Door," which stayed for more than 160 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, shared with us the stories of ordinary people who had amassed extraordinary wealth.
According to Credit Suisse Research Institute's latest Global Wealth Report, the number of millionaires worldwide is estimated to increase over the next five years, reaching an all-time high of 55 million. There are currently 42.2 million millionaires in the world. Within the past 12 months, the U.S. added 878,000 new millionaires -- representing around 40 percent of the global increase.
You might not recognize most of them.
But what if they lived next door? What would they look like? What kind of car would they drive?
If "The Millionaire Next Door" taught us anything, it is this: The typical American millionaire doesn't look anything like the advertising-driven image of one. Most are self-made, work hard at "dull, normal" jobs, are "compulsive" savers and investors and more often than not live next door to people with a fraction of their wealth.
There were plenty of people grateful for his work, his daughter said, but Stanley also had his critics who believed there was no way for people to become a millionaire on their own.
"In the aftermath, I was adamant about continuing his work, but I think that grief took over," Fallaw said. "Even looking at the data would spawn memories of him."
With her father's help, Fallaw had already developed a list of questions they hoped the next book would tackle. Was it still the case that self-made millionaires are frugal? Did they still attribute their success to hard work and perseverance or something else? How did they make real estate decisions? How did they invest their money? And what mistakes did they make along the way?
Over the next four years following her father's death, Fallaw worked to complete what she and her father had started.
"It took a while for the data to come in," she said.
Meanwhile, Fallaw combed through her father's old notes, trying to make sense of them. It was a tedious process, but last summer, she was finally able to finish the manuscript and turn it over to her husband, Tim, and mother, Janet, to edit.
"The Next Millionaire Next Door" hit store bookshelves last October.
And the findings?
It turns out that the mindset for amassing a million in 2019 isn't all that different from doing it in 1996.
Whether talking about those in the mass market or those at the higher income levels, the wealthy ignore what other people are doing. In other words, they couldn't care less about, well, keeping up with the Joneses. They put in the time planning their financial future. They live well below their means.
"The original findings weren't just a fluke or the product of the boom time of the 1990s," Fallaw said. "Building wealth, whatever that means for you, requires a certain pattern of behavior. Even if you have a small goal, the same pattern is required."
In 1996, they might have been the small-business owner, a scrap metal dealer, or an auctioneer. Today, they might be the engineer who has several side businesses, or a sales professional who focuses on saving instead of spending. They drive 7-to 10-year-old cars. Some buy their kids neutral clothing so they can be passed down to siblings of either sex. They probably aren't posting pictures on Facebook about the vacations they just had or the new purchase they just made.
Too often, Fallaw said, people confuse accumulating wealth and what they want out of life.
"The challenge is to really understand who you want to be," she said. "Wealth may be a part of that
because you need it to fund those goals, but the biggest change between 1996 and today is the pace of information and the lack of time we set aside to contemplate what we want. Because we don't think about it, it's easy to focus on consumption rather than asking 'Am I becoming a better person or spouse or business owner?'"
So I asked her:
Should building wealth be our goal?
"I don't think so, at least not your primary or predominant goal," Fallaw said. "If you want to be secure in the future and want to have the flexibility to leave your job, start a business, or provide financial support for your children in the future, you do have to consider those things. But amassing piles of money as an all-encompassing goal would probably leave you pretty dull."

Texto completo: Three leading Democratic presidential candidates have recently signaled their support for some form of "reparations" for black Americans, broadly, if vaguely, backing the idea of compensating the descendants of enslaved people in the United States.
Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro, have all said in recent weeks that they support reparations for African Americans. But the extent of their support remains unclear, with the candidates declining to offer specifics on what the program would entail and one of the nation's foremost advocates on reparations questioning whether they should be considered in favor of the program.
Harris, asked by "The Breakfast Club" in a radio interview this month whether she supports reparations, cited her support for several programs to help black Americans, including investing in historically black colleges, improving maternal mortality rates for black women and reducing racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Asked again whether she was for "some type" of reparations, Harris said that she was.
"Centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, legal discrimination and segregation, and discrimination that exists today have led to a systemic wealth gap between black and white Americans that demands attention," Harris said in a statement first given to the New York Times. "We have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities, and I'm serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities."
Warren, meanwhile, also answered "yes" when asked by the New York Times whether she supports reparations, adding in a statement also given to The Washington Post that the United States must implement "systemic, structural changes" to help black families. She also pointed to her housing plan, which would offer special help for those affected by "redlining" - the decades-long, systematic practice of discrimination in mortgage practices that has limited the wealth of black Americans.
"We must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations," Warren said.
Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, first told the Root in an interview that he would favor reparations for black Americans. A spokeswoman confirmed his comments but declined to elaborate.
"I have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that," Castro said. "I don't find the notion challenging. What I do find challenging is the best way to do that."
That three presidential candidates are willing to say they support race-based reparations marks a shift in the Democratic Party, which has overall moved left on issues of racial and economic justice, although some supporters of reparations expressed concern about the depth of the candidates' support for it.
"I'm pleased to hear a willingness to explore the idea of reparations, but I'm not sure what they have in mind constitutes a reparations program," said William Darity, a Duke University professor who has long been an advocate of reparations. "The danger is the possibility that the label 'reparations' is applied to a modest or incremental policy that falls far short of what is required, and political leaders then say the nation's responsibility has been met."
Darity said there were three key components of reparations programs in the United States: official acknowledgment of wrongdoing; redress for the crime committed; and a form of closure. For instance, Darity has called for having the federal government write checks available only to the descendants of those who had been enslaved in the United States. Other forms of reparations could include transferring stocks, bonds or other assets to descendants of sharecroppers, slaves or both.
The campaigns for Warren, Castro and Harris did not respond to requests for comment on whether they support this form of reparations or to clarify what exactly they mean by supporting reparations. Darity said a reparations program does not simply mean advancing policies intended to also help black Americans.
"Certainly Harris's investments in black communities is not a reparations program; in fact, Nixonian black capitalism could be seen as a form of 'investment in black communities' - hardly reparations," Darity said. "And we still have no specifics from Warren."
Darrick Hamilton, an economist at Ohio State University who supports reparations, also said the term should be used carefully and that it does not apply to policies intended to simply help all Americans.
"There needs to be a specific act or acts," Hamilton said. "If I give everybody $100 for an act that took place against black people, and you say, 'Well, blacks are overrepresented in poverty and will disproportionately benefit' - that's not reparations. In fact, it's a bastardization of both reparations and the particular social policy that's aimed at addressing inequality."
Still, the fact that Warren, Castro and Harris were willing to signal support for reparations marks an important milestone for a policy from which even the Democratic Party's left-wing politicians have shied away. In 2016, President Barack Obama said reparations were an impractical idea. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was also dismissive of the program, telling reporters it would be "very divisive" and unlikely to pass Congress. Hillary Clinton, the party's 2016 nominee, also declined to support reparations.
Former congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who represented the Detroit area but resigned in 2017, had introduced legislation to advance reparations, but it garnered few Democratic supporters.
The presidential campaigns of Sanders and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have not responded to requests for comment.

Texto completo: Eileen Ivers and Universal Roots take the Diana Wortham stage, in partnership with The Swannanoa Gathering at Warren Wilson College, at 8 pm. Feb. 28.
What's the difference between a fiddle and a violin? Just a bit of colloquialism. In 1994, the Washington Post touted Ivers as "the future of the Celtic fiddle" — and the New York Times called her "the Jimi Hendrix of the violin." No matter what Ivers herself calls her instrument, the bottom line is this: She absolutely rocks it.
Hailed as "a sensation" by Billboard magazine and "a virtuoso" by The Irish Times, Ivers shreds her electric fiddle through loops, fuzz and wah effects — sawing her bow across the strings like an orchestral psychedelic rock star. A celebrated soloist who's played with more than 50 symphony orchestras, she's been both Grammy-awarded and Emmy-nominated, and she pushes the boundaries of the fiddling tradition to its most exciting extremes, taking the instrument from a folk and classical music staple to something that's fresh and fierce.
Ivers' new and energetic band, Universal Roots, connects music, cultures, stories and emotions, tying each together with a broad array of influences. Her most recent work showcases the intersection of Celtic tradition with North American roots music, taking audiences on a journey through time and genres, from the origins of folk to folk-fusions of the modern age.
With Ivers on the fiddle, mandolin, banjo and bodhran, Universal Roots comprises Matt Mancuso on lead vocals, guitar, trumpet and fiddle; Buddy Connolly on button accordion, whistles, piano and vocals; Lindsey Horner on upright and electric bass, baritone sax and vocals; and Dave Barckow on lead vocals, percussion and guitar. Together, they strive to prove that, no matter our similarities and differences, music truly is a universal language.
Ivers has performed with Sting, Fiddlers 3 with Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and Regina Carter, Patti Smith, Al Di Meola and The Cheiftains, and was the groundbreaking Musical Star of Riverdance, a founding member of Cherish the Ladies, a former member of the Hall & Oates band, a featured instrumentalist on soundtracks including "Gangs of New York" and "Back to Titanic," and she is one of the most awarded All-Ireland Fiddle and Banjo champions ever.
Diana Wortham Theatre is at 18 Biltmore Ave. Tickets are $35 with discounts available. For tickets or more information, call 828-257-4530 or visit dwtheatre.com.

IS AMAZON TOO BIG TO BOYCOTT?

Texto completo: Berkeley's efforts to distance itself from Immigration and Customs Enforcement may have run into a problem: Some tech giants may be too big to boycott.
The city council is set to vote Tuesday on an ordinance that would bar the city from doing business with companies that work as ICE data brokers or "provide extreme vetting services." In a recent memo, two Berkeley council members asked the city manager to include Amazon in the proposed boycott.
But in her own memo, Berkeley City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley wrote that boycotting the technology giant "would have a huge negative impact to the citywide operations," The New York Times reported.
A separate memo, about data brokers like LexisNexis that also would fall under the boycott, highlights the challenge Berkeley faces. The companies that provide those services to ICE "have often also amassed unavoidable market power and breadth into essential operations required of our civic government," Williams-Ridley wrote.
Boycotting Amazon and its AWS cloud-hosting services would affect the city's communications with residents on Nextdoor, as well as relationships with Airbnb, Tableau and Adobe. The city uses Airbnb for "short term rental management," according to the memo. Those companies all operate using at least some Amazon services, the memo said.
Boycotting LexisNexus would impact the city's ability to do legal research, as well as the program the city uses to record police reports and match them with the 911 dispatch system.
"I sort of despair about what we can do at this local level, frankly," Berkeley Councilmember Kate Harrison told The New York Times. "If we identify a company involved in data brokerage for ICE, and we have an alternative, we should take the alternative. It's a balancing act."
The proposed boycott is part of an effort by several Bay Area cities and counties to boycott tech companies that provide data sharing services to ICE. It's being led in part by the statewide Deport ICE coalition, which is pushing governments to adopt its Sanctuary City Contracting and Investing Ordinance, which prohibits them from investing or contracting with companies that provide data broker or "extreme vetting" services to ICE unless there is no alternative. The Richmond city council approved the ordinance in June 2018.
This isn't the first time Berkeley has weighed in on a national topic. In 2017, the city voted to divest from and not do business with any companies involved with the construction of a border wall along the U.S. southern border, a key goal of President Donald Trump.
And in 1986, Berkeley declared itself a nuclear-free city, in part banning it from doing business with any entities that work on nuclear technology. The Daily Californian pointed out that the law ended up requiring the city to approve a waiver for the library so that it could work on a self-checkout system with the company 3M, which besides making Post-Its, works on nuclear energy.

At a glance Roughly 300 people came downtown Saturday morning to take a silent stand against abortion and support efforts to restrict it here and across the country this year. By Austin Huguelet Wyoming Tribune Eagle CHEYENNE - Hundreds of people marched downtown Saturday morning to take a stand against abortion and hear the latest on efforts to restrict it here and across the country. Former state Rep. Marti Halverson, R-Etna, kicked off Right to Life of Laramie County's annual March for Life with an optimistic review of the fight. She touted a forthcoming proposal in the Wyoming Legislature that would allow prosecutors to charge someone who kills a pregnant woman with two murders rather than one.

And she mentioned reports of abortion restrictions holding up in places like Texas, which is trying to cut off all funding to Planned Parenthood, and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines , R-Mont., for the recent formation of the Senate's first "pro-life" caucus.

"There is good news on the life-front these days," Halverson said.

Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper, hopes to add that in this legislative session. He told marchers gathered around the Wyoming Supreme Court building one bill that would place a 48-hour waiting period on abortions and another that would require physicians to provide more detailed abortion reports to the state and make it a crime for them to intentionally withhold those reports. He warned that passing the bills wouldn't be easy, but he also urged supporters to "embrace" the difficulty of the work, "for nothing that is worthwhile in life is easy."

Attendees came from around the state and region. Hunter James, 14, came with the group Park County Teens for Life.

He said he marches because "people are always dying because of abortions," and "because abortion is wrong."

Karen Spiker of Cheyenne gave a similar answer to the same question: "I believe abortion is wrong and I want it to stop."

The event came three days prior to the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court's watershed Roe v. Wade decision, which established a constitutional right to abortion. It also follows a week of mostly symbolic gestures of support from Republicans in Congress. The Republican-led U.S. Senate pushed a failed effort to make permanent a ban on government funding for abortions. And President Donald Trump told anti-abortion marchers in Washington Friday that he would veto any bill that "weakens the protection of human life" via prerecorded message, according to The New York Times . The Democrat-led House, on the other hand, voted to repeal the Mexico City policy, which bans U.S. government funding for any foreign aid organization linked to abortion, on the first day of the new session.

Texto completo: Progressives are touting Amazon's decision to cancel its plan to build a headquarters in New York as a great victory over "corporate greed," "worker exploitation" and "the richest man in the world." This may well turn out to be a victory for workers, exploited or otherwise, but perhaps not in the way progressives intend. As Amazon disburses its 25,000 employees earning an average of $150,000 annually to other locations, let's take a look at what it could mean for those employees who end up living in regions more capitalist than socialist.
Amazon is proceeding with its previously announced expansion plans for a 25,000-employee headquarters in Arlington, Va., and a 5,000-employee operations center in Nashville, Tenn. As CEO of CKE Restaurants, I moved our company headquarters to the Nashville area from California in 2016, so it's a subject with which I am personally familiar.
For Amazon employees, the income-tax benefits can be significant. A single person living in New York City and making $150,000 a year would pay $9,252 in state income tax plus a municipal income tax of $5,379. In Arlington, that same employee would pay only $8,142 in state income tax -- $6,489 lower. Tennessee has no income tax, for a saving of $14,631 compared with New York.
And those dollars go further in Virginia or Tennessee. BestPlaces.net has a calculator that compares the cost of living between cities (including taxes). For a single, childless homeowner, the cost of living in Queens -- site of the scrapped Amazon New York headquarters -- is 4.4% higher than in Arlington and 80.4% higher than in Nashville. To have the same standard of living $150,000 would in Arlington would take $156,628 in Queens. The equivalent of $150,000 in Nashville is $270,580 in Queens.
Across the East River in Manhattan, the cost of living is 51.8% higher than in Arlington and 173.1% higher than in Nashville. Thus the equivalent of $150,000 in Arlington and Nashville, respectively, is $227,700 and $409,710.
Both Virginia and Tennessee pride themselves on being business-friendly. Amazon is familiar with governments that are less friendly from its headquarters in Seattle, one of the most progressive U.S. cities. Last May, Seattle's City Council unanimously passed a $275-an-employee tax on businesses making more than $20 million a year. Amazon vigorously opposed the tax, and the City Council repealed it, to the chagrin of progressives across the country. The New York Times called it "a warning to cities bidding for the retailer's second headquarters that the company would go to the limit to get its way." Apparently, New York didn't get that message. There's no danger of that in Arlington or Nashville.
Unions were also an issue for Amazon's New York site. Under the National Labor Relations Act, workers have a well-established federal right to unionize and, within limits, employers can oppose unionization. No matter where Amazon locates, the employees have the right to unionize if they so choose.
The problem for unions is that their popularity is waning. Private-sector union membership stood at 16.8% in 1983 when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the data. It has steadily declined to a record low of 6.4% in 2018.
With this decline, the unions have resorted to using their political power to hobble business resistance to unionization. The day before Amazon withdrew its plan for a corporate headquarters in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo held a meeting between Amazon executives and labor leaders to negotiate -- in effect, to limit -- how aggressively Amazon would urge its employees to resist unionizing. The next day, Amazon announced that it was abandoning it plans for New York.
Again, there is little chance of a union dust-up in business-friendly Virginia or Tennessee. Both are right-to-work states, meaning even if a majority of employees vote to unionize, every worker is free not to join the union. Not many private-sector employees choose to join unions in either state. In both Tennessee and Virginia, only 3.2% of private-sector workers belong to unions. In New York state, the figure is 13.2%.
Given the substantial tax and cost-of-living benefits that come from living in states with capitalist free-market policies like Virginia and Tennessee, it could well be that workers don't see the need for unions. They might even be afraid that progressives and their union allies could drive businesses like Amazon, and their good paying jobs, out of the state. I wonder where they got that idea?

Texto completo: Flogging Molly
St. Patrick's Day is still weeks away, but you can get an early dose of Celtic punk when Flogging Molly rolls into town for a Friday night set at the House of Blues. The seven-piece band has put out only two albums this decade, most recently 2017's “Life Is Good," but you can count on more than enough classics like “Drunken Lullabies" to fill a party-hearty evening. (Friday, Feb. 22, at 7 p.m.; House of Blues, Boston; $35-$55; all ages)

'American Girl Live'
Just in time for the end of school vacation week, the Boch Center Shubert Theatre is bringing the family-friendly musical “American Girl Live" to town. The 90-minute show based on the line of dolls follows six young girls at summer camp, where they overcome their fears and learn something about themselves thanks to their trusty dolls. (Friday, Feb. 22, through Sunday, Feb. 24, at various times; Boch Center Shubert Theatre, Boston; $35-$75; all ages)

'When Angels Fall'
For a really artsy weekend at the theater, check out “When Angels Fall," a wordless blend of circus arts, dance, and film from aerialist and contortionist Raphaëlle Boitel that debuted Wednesday at the Cutler Majestic Theatre. The show follows a story about the final seven inhabitants of a post-apocalyptic world run by machines that have outlawed speech, and was called “stark and stunning" in a recent New York Times review. (Through Sunday, Feb. 24, at various times; Cutler Majestic Theatre, Boston; $10-$110; ages 8 and up)

The Brattle Oscar Party
The Brattle Oscar Party isn't just a gathering of film aficionados watching the ceremony on the big screen; it's also a pre-party with complimentary cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and gift bags, as well as trivia, a silent auction, and the theater's Oscar prediction pool. Proceeds from the evening will benefit the Brattle Film Foundation. (Sunday, Feb. 24, at 5:30 p.m.; Brattle Theatre, Cambridge; minimum $50 donation; all ages)

Blackalicious
Over the last 20 years, many a dorm room blasted the tongue-twisting “Alphabet Aerobics" from Bay Area hip-hop duo Blackalicious, cementing rapper Gift of Gab's reputation as one of the most technically impressive emcees in the game. Blackalicious has flown under the radar a bit recently, which means you'll have a chance to see them in a smaller venue when they hit Sonia in Cambridge this Sunday, along with openers MC Kabir and Jarv. (Sunday, Feb. 24, at 7 p.m.; Sonia, Cambridge; $20; all ages)

Texto completo: It's hard to imagine a more Zen kitchen guide than Ina Garten,
On her Food Network show "Barefoot Contessa," the self-taught cook and entertaining guru is so calm and seemingly unflappable that those who consume a more steady diet of high-energy cooking shows like "Chopped" or Matty Matheson's "It's Suppertime!" might dismiss her out of hand as bo-ring.
Actually, the Emmy- and James Beard Award-winning author has just as much passion as anyone on TV. And her ability to teach novices and seasoned home cooks alike how to get a dependably delectable dinner on the table is unparalleled, say her legions of fans. She's just less in-your-face about it.
Or maybe, it's that the self-described anxious cook is too busy battling a bad case of the nerves whenever she's in front of the camera to be exuberant.
"I'm a wreck!" she confesses with a laugh on a recent phone call from her home in the New York beach town of East Hampton. "Under the surface I'm like a cat on a hot tin roof."
She's more at ease behind a computer screen, writing one of her many cookbooks. The latest is "Cook Like a Pro," which hit store shelves last October, quickly became a New York Times bestseller and in 2019 is the focus of a series of on-stage interviews. They include a talk moderated by writer Jennifer Wallace at Heinz Hall, Downtown, on Feb. 26.
An audience Q&A will directly follow the interview, during which Ms. Garten's devotees - which include nearly 2 million Instagram followers and 1.4 million Facebook fans - can ask not just cooking or entertaining questions but anything they want, including the all-time favorite: Where's (her husband) Jeffrey? Answer: back in New York.
"It's very free-ranging and hopefully really fun and interesting," Ms. Garten says, noting how at a recent talk in Marin County, Calif., one burning question was how to cut hydrangeas so they don't wilt.
"Cook Like a Pro: Recipes & Tips for Home Cooks" is her 11th cookbook. It follows the series of the same name that last year won her a 2018 JBA for best Television Program, in Studio or Fixed Location, and was filmed in her well-appointed kitchen in the Hamptons.
Like all its predecessors, it's a stunner: Simple but still subtly sophisticated. Each of its 85 never-before-published recipes is illustrated with an image so mouth-watering you'll instantly want to make it. Scattered throughout are some of the "pro" tips she's learned in professional kitchens over the years that have made her a more confident cook. She also dishes up advice on what to make ahead to streamline the process.
"I wanted people to feel that they know how to cook," she says, which for some people starts with learning, say, how to tell fresh basil from dried, cut cauliflower without getting it all over the counter (from the stem end, not the top) or carve corn off the cob (into a towel so the kernels don't bounce across the kitchen).
To that end, all her recipes are tested multiple times over the two years it takes to write a cookbook so that she's sure even a beginning chef will be able to make them.
"My goal is when you get dinner on the table, everyone says, 'You made this yourself?' " she says.
Cooks who aren't familiar with her brand might be surprised to learn that the Brooklyn, N.Y., native started her career in government, as a staff member of the White House Office of Management and Budget in the early '70s. It wasn't until she left Washington, D.C., in 1978 to purchase a specialty food store called Barefoot Contessa in New York's Westhampton Beach that her life became all about food.
"I was always searching for flavor and for delicious food, and I love to entertain," she says, "and cooking is a really important part of that."
She started writing her Barefoot Contessa series of cookbooks back in 1999, she says, because most people don't have the luxury of having a grandmother or mother with them in the kitchen to teach them. She didn't want cooking to become a lost art. She also didn't buy into the then-popular notion that cookbooks should teach you how to cook everything, or make you page through hundreds of recipes. Because really, how many recipes will you make in a lifetime?
"I thought people just needed 80 recipes that were really well tested," she says, using ingredients easily found in a grocery store. "I wanted people to be able to go home and make a perfectly delicious dinner based on familiar flavors, but have it taste even better than you think."
Too many cookbooks are restaurant cookbooks, she says, and that doesn't always translate to home cooking.
Whereas a meal out should be surprising, "You want something a little more comforting and delicious at home," she says.
While she takes her work seriously, she's not afraid to poke a little fun at herself, as evidenced by a video of her day drinking with comedian Seth Meyers that appeared on "Late Night With Seth Meyers" on Feb. 7. "He's such a doll," she says, even if he breaks every cooking rule by not measuring ingredients. Her relatability, lack of vanity and humor, in fact, play a big part in her popularity.
"In real life I'm exactly like I am on TV," she says.
She laughs when asked if she ever thought she'd find so much celebrity as a TV cook and author. Her show "Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics" is now in its 13th season on Food Network. "No!" she responds. That said, she loves that people love her work.
One of her favorite things, she says, is when people come stop her on the street and thank her for teaching them how to cook.
"When you cook, everybody shows up," she says.
A limited number of tickets are still available for Ms. Garten's talk on Feb. 26. For more info, call 412-392-4900 or visit heinzhall.org.

THERE'S A BETTER WAY THAN A BREXIT FOR UW-STEVENS POINT; COMMENTARY

Texto completo: ?What is a University Without a History Major?" The article accompanying this recent headline in The New York Times describes the self-imposed plight of UW-Stevens Point, and the withering of smaller public universities across the country. It was one of the five most-read stories of that day.
The background for the Times article was a UWSP plan to no longer offer majors in history, English, political science, philosophy and Spanish. There would be a "re-imagined curriculum." The stated purpose was to save money. Students aren't that interested anymore in the humanities, is the claim.
Like Brexit, the changes at UW-Stevens Point, I am sure, seemed a good idea at the time. Imaginations like this Orwellian bit were offered up: The study of philosophy would be replaced by "offerings in applied ethics."
The backlash from this plan prompted a revision, where the liberal arts would have a complementary role in a restructuring focused on interdisciplinary degrees. The history major would still go.
It doesn't have to be this way. The "System" in the UW System is a covenant. The UW Regents need to renew it. History offers a way forward.
In the first half of the 1980s the number of high school graduates dropped by 15 percent. Yet the enrollment in the UW System increased from 155,000 to 164,500 almost 16,000 more than budgeted.
I was the Democratic speaker of the Assembly and Republican Tommy Thompson the minority leader. With the support of Gov. Tony Earl, a Democrat, we negotiated a package, rounded up the votes, and struck a deal with UW leaders and the regents.
The policy adopted was enrollment management: Maximize use of existing campus capacity, sustaining academic quality and serving the entire state.
Regents would reduce System enrollment by 7,000 full-time students by raising academic standards and requiring more high school college prep credits; funding for 300 new faculty would be added to improve course access; enrollment would be increased at Green Bay, Parkside, Superior and the two-year campuses. An enrollment maximum was set for each campus there would be zero
money for any students enrolled exceeding the target.
The agreement worked, but not well enough. In 1990, enrollment management II was adopted, with a target of reducing enrollment by another 5,600 students. The freshman class of 1994 of 22,650 was the smallest since 1972.
Next came enrollment management III. Whitewater fewer students. UW-Milwaukee more students. Each campus was to have the student enrollment it needed. No riding high at one campus and sinking at another. The Madison chancellor, System president and regents provided great leadership.
Today, the UW campuses across the state need once again to be managed as a system, with a new enrollment management policy that fits the times.
A new enrollment management plan would act like its predecessors, capping enrollment at some campuses, reducing enrollment at Madison, and moving students where there is capacity not being used.
And let us re-imagine Stevens Point: Grow enrollment by offering a four-year degree for $20,000 total tuition it's currently $27,000. Any deficit would be made up through the EM formula.
Public universities just like Stevens Point are America's engines of democracy. It's where most kids go to college. People care. Communities care. Stevens Point is in Portage County. The County Board voted unanimously to voice support for the humanities at their campus.
The consensus that produced the first enrollment management plan was certainly bipartisan, but no one at the time thought it so it was politics, with legislators looking after the interests of their colleges and communities. A plan starts out as raw meat and ends up as bratwurst on a bun.

Texto completo: As the field of credible Democrats running for president reaches 20, it's disturbing to note how many feel compelled to start with apologies.
There's Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, regretting her DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, regretting past hard-line positions; Sen. Bernie Sanders, regretting sexual harassment within his 2016 presidential campaign organization; and former Vice President Joe Biden, regretting how he failed, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, to prevent the sexist inquisition of Anita Hill, the Clarence Thomas accuser.
This "spate of sorrys" reflects how Democrats "understand that the party's increasingly diverse base can be uncompromising on issues such as discrimination, criminal justice reform and immigration," suggested an analysis in the New York Times.
Yes, I know, taken together, these Democratic transgressions pale in comparison to the pridefully repellent Donald Trump, who claimed in his State of the Union speech that he should be immune from investigations.
But these Democratic apologies presumably will end soon, and at that point the presidential candidates could look to Wisconsin and its most prominent statewide victors last fall Tony Evers and Tammy Baldwin as modeling how to win in the heartland.
Let me explain.
In a recent national poll, 56 percent of registered Democrats said they prefer a strong candidate against Trump even if they disagree with many of that candidate's positions. Just 33 percent in this Monmouth University poll said they would prefer a candidate with whom they agree on most issues if that person would struggle against Trump.
This Trump revulsion is especially strong among Democratic women. Sixty-one percent of female respondents said they would forgo some policy preferences for a candidate who could beat him, compared to 45 percent of Democratic men.
If the goal, then, is the most electable Democrat, consider the models of Evers and Baldwin, who came across as personally likable as well as pro-middle class, a combination likely to work in 2020.
The Center for American Progress Action Fund, a progressive think tank, suggested in a memo obtained by the Washington Post that the most effective case against Trump is that he broke promises, not that he is a liar and a fraud.
The Post quoted the memo's synopsis: "The spotlight on these promises will synthesize what are already the American people's worst perceptions of him, namely that he is dishonest; that contrary to his 'populist' campaign rhetoric, he is primarily concerned with helping the wealthiest and big corporations rather than the middle- or working class; and that he is personally corrupt, running a corrupt government.
"Most notably on the economy, candidate Trump made grand unequivocal promises that he would raise taxes on the wealthy including himself; that no more factories would close in America; that every decision he made would be guided by raising wages; that every American would get health coverage; and that he would crack down on Wall Street. In every instance, he has pursued policies that would do exactly the opposite."
So, in sum, attack the performance, not the personality.
Which bring us to Evers and Baldwin. Each exuded authenticity and won substantial support outside Wisconsin's urban Democratic strongholds with upbeat, issues-focused campaigns. The sort of
vitriol and toxicity that has come to characterize modern politics was essentially absent.
Evers stuck to talking about how incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, his opponent, failed to deliver on education, health care and infrastructure and that Evers would make those his central mission. He did it often and with plainspoken sincerity.
Now he's a rock star, albeit a mild-mannered and bespectacled 66-year-old one. Last month, he got a spontaneous and raucous standing ovation at the Martin Luther King Day celebration in the Capitol Rotunda even before he stepped to the microphone.
It must really vex Wisconsin Republicans who won political arguments this decade by demonizing and caricaturing opponents that Evers wouldn't play their game. Others were apoplectic that Walker had effectively disenfranchised political opponents for two terms, but Evers just stuck to his knitting, so to speak.
Just as the GOP flailed and failed before the election to paint Evers as soft on a teacher who viewed pornography on a school computer, they claim now that troubles with the deeply flawed Foxconn deal are Evers' fault because he has somehow created a negative business climate a laughable contention.
Then they claim Evers' proposal to finance a middle-class income tax cut by capping a tax credit for manufacturers and agricultural producers which provided a giant windfall for Walker's donor class would somehow devastate the state's economy. Evers pointed out that a recent nonpartisan state report said 79 percent of that break goes to individuals with incomes topping $1 million and that 21 taxpayers with incomes topping $30 million are set to get an average break of $1.8 million in 2019. (That GOP tax credit pretty much exempted businesses from paying state income taxes, leaving ordinary taxpayers holding the bag.) Hey GOP, here is a thought versus Evers, those dogs just won't hunt.
Then there's Baldwin, who won re-election by 12 percentage points. If Evers prevailed by eschewing the politics of division and escalating the politics of issues, Baldwin won by fearlessly taking positions that resonated.
For example, she authored a bill that would require corporations to set aside one-third of board seats for members elected by employees. While the Koch brothers and other right-wing interests dropped millions on attack ads against the incumbent senator, they were silent on this proposal.
You'd expect them to call it a job-killing, socialist maneuver, but, well, crickets. That anecdote is featured in an article in the latest edition of The American Prospect, a liberal national magazine, that urges candidates to unite around a pro-worker agenda.
The GOP silence, asserted the article, was because "Baldwin's proposal resonated with a hell of a lot of Americans." A Democratic poll found it had majority support throughout the nation and, in Wisconsin, "commanded support not just in ultra-liberal Madison but also in rock-ribbed Republican small towns and farms."
What's the takeaway here?
While most of us are tempted to wail on and on about the despicable personal character of Trump, leaders like Evers and Baldwin forgo the politics of bellicosity and focus on ideas to help ordinary people.
Call it corny, call it Pollyannaish, but in Trump's America rife with cynicism and hatred you might also call it a winning strategy. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha sido cuestionado sobre sus intentos de intervenir o detener de algún modo la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Esta semana, el New York Times hizo algunas revelaciones al respecto, aunado a declaraciones del exdirector interino del FBI, Andrew McCabe , sobre lo que motivó el inicio de las indagatorias: el despido de James Comey , exdirector del FBI.
1. Sospechas de injerencia.- A finales de 2018, el presidente Trump le preguntó al entonces fiscal general en funciones, Matthew Whitaker , si un abogado que él nombró podría supervisar una investigación relacionada con él mismo, luego de que el fiscal ya se había retirado de la investigación, informó el Times, que citó a varios funcionarios estadounidenses con conocimiento directo de la llamada. Esto es considerado como una forma de injerencia en la investigación.
2. Ataque a investigaciones.- Un conteo de ese diario reveló que el presidente Trump ha atacado al menos 1,2000 veces la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016. El reporte, hecho en un sistema de visualización, incluyen declaraciones hechas en Twitter, en discursos oficiales, en mítines y durante entrevistas con medios de comunicación y otros eventos de prensa. Esto significa que el mandatario ha cuestionado las indagatorias al menos una vez durante 330 días.
3. ¿Un activo ruso?.- El exdirector interino del FBI, McCabe, dijo que es posible que el presidente Trump sea un activo ruso. “¿Todavía cree que el presidente podría ser un activo ruso?” , preguntó a Anderson Cooper de CNN. “Creo que es posible. Creo que es por eso que comenzamos nuestra investigación, y estoy realmente ansioso por ver dónde (el fiscal especial Robert) Mueller concluye eso”, dijo McCabe. Es otro comentario explosivo de McCabe, que se produce días después de que describió las razones por las que los principales funcionarios de Estados Unidos decidieron abrir una investigación de contrainteligencia y una investigación por obstrucción de la justicia en el presidente Trump.
El recién ratificado fiscal federal, William Barr , indicó que es posible que la siguiente semana Mueller entregue algún reporte de las indagatorias que inició en 2017 y que han derivado en acusaciones a excolaboradores cercanos del presidente Trump, como su exabogado personal, Michael Cohen .

Texto completo: It's hard to imagine a more Zen kitchen guide than Ina Garten,
On her Food Network show "Barefoot Contessa," the self-taught cook and entertaining guru is so calm and seemingly unflappable that those who consume a more steady diet of high-energy cooking shows like "Chopped" or Matty Matheson's "It's Suppertime!" might dismiss her out of hand as bo-ring.
Actually, the Emmy- and James Beard Award-winning author has just as much passion as anyone on TV. And her ability to teach novices and seasoned home cooks alike how to get a dependably delectable dinner on the table is unparalleled, say her legions of fans. She's just less in-your-face about it.
Or maybe, it's that the self-described anxious cook is too busy battling a bad case of the nerves whenever she's in front of the camera to be exuberant.
"I'm a wreck!" she confesses with a laugh on a recent phone call from her home in the New York beach town of East Hampton. "Under the surface I'm like a cat on a hot tin roof."
She's more at ease behind a computer screen, writing one of her many cookbooks. The latest is "Cook Like a Pro," which hit store shelves last October, quickly became a New York Times bestseller and in 2019 is the focus of a series of on-stage interviews. They include a talk moderated by writer Jennifer Wallace at Heinz Hall, Downtown, on Feb. 26.
An audience Q&A will directly follow the interview, during which Ms. Garten's devotees - which include nearly 2 million Instagram followers and 1.4 million Facebook fans - can ask not just cooking or entertaining questions but anything they want, including the all-time favorite: Where's (her husband) Jeffrey? Answer: back in New York.
"It's very free-ranging and hopefully really fun and interesting," Ms. Garten says, noting how at a recent talk in Marin County, Calif., one burning question was how to cut hydrangeas so they don't wilt.
"Cook Like a Pro: Recipes & Tips for Home Cooks" is her 11th cookbook. It follows the series of the same name that last year won her a 2018 JBA for best Television Program, in Studio or Fixed Location, and was filmed in her well-appointed kitchen in the Hamptons.
Like all its predecessors, it's a stunner: Simple but still subtly sophisticated. Each of its 85 never-before-published recipes is illustrated with an image so mouth-watering you'll instantly want to make it. Scattered throughout are some of the "pro" tips she's learned in professional kitchens over the years that have made her a more confident cook. She also dishes up advice on what to make ahead to streamline the process.
"I wanted people to feel that they know how to cook," she says, which for some people starts with learning, say, how to tell fresh basil from dried, cut cauliflower without getting it all over the counter (from the stem end, not the top) or carve corn off the cob (into a towel so the kernels don't bounce across the kitchen).
To that end, all her recipes are tested multiple times over the two years it takes to write a cookbook so that she's sure even a beginning chef will be able to make them.
"My goal is when you get dinner on the table, everyone says, 'You made this yourself?' " she says.
Cooks who aren't familiar with her brand might be surprised to learn that the Brooklyn, N.Y., native started her career in government, as a staff member of the White House Office of Management and Budget in the early '70s. It wasn't until she left Washington, D.C., in 1978 to purchase a specialty food store called Barefoot Contessa in New York's Westhampton Beach that her life became all about food.
"I was always searching for flavor and for delicious food, and I love to entertain," she says, "and cooking is a really important part of that."
She started writing her Barefoot Contessa series of cookbooks back in 1999, she says, because most people don't have the luxury of having a grandmother or mother with them in the kitchen to teach them. She didn't want cooking to become a lost art. She also didn't buy into the then-popular notion that cookbooks should teach you how to cook everything, or make you page through hundreds of recipes. Because really, how many recipes will you make in a lifetime?
"I thought people just needed 80 recipes that were really well tested," she says, using ingredients easily found in a grocery store. "I wanted people to be able to go home and make a perfectly delicious dinner based on familiar flavors, but have it taste even better than you think."
Too many cookbooks are restaurant cookbooks, she says, and that doesn't always translate to home cooking.
Whereas a meal out should be surprising, "You want something a little more comforting and delicious at home," she says.
While she takes her work seriously, she's not afraid to poke a little fun at herself, as evidenced by a video of her day drinking with comedian Seth Meyers that appeared on "Late Night With Seth Meyers" on Feb. 7. "He's such a doll," she says, even if he breaks every cooking rule by not measuring ingredients. Her relatability, lack of vanity and humor, in fact, play a big part in her popularity.
"In real life I'm exactly like I am on TV," she says.
She laughs when asked if she ever thought she'd find so much celebrity as a TV cook and author. Her show "Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics" is now in its 13th season on Food Network. "No!" she responds. That said, she loves that people love her work.
One of her favorite things, she says, is when people come stop her on the street and thank her for teaching them how to cook.
"When you cook, everybody shows up," she says.
A limited number of tickets are still available for Ms. Garten's talk on Feb. 26. For more info, call 412-392-4900 or visit heinzhall.org.

Thomas calls for re-examining libel as court rejects Cosby case

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday called for reconsideration of the Supreme Court's landmark decision making it more difficult for public officials to claim defamation as the court turned down a request from an accuser of Bill Cosby.
The court declined to take the case of Kathrine McKee, who accused Cosby of raping her more than 40 years ago. She sued after Cosby's attorney leaked a letter that she said distorted her background to "damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty" and to shame her.
Thomas said he agreed with his colleagues not to accept McKee's "factbound" appeal.
But he launched a detailed critique of the landmark libel ruling, which he said was a "policy-driven" decision "masquerading as constitutional law." No other justice joined his concurrence.
But President Donald Trump has also expressed support for making it easier to sue for defamation, and during the campaign - and afterward - he complained about "hit pieces" in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said during the campaign. Over the weekend, he complained about a "Saturday Night Live" skit and wondered about "retribution."
Some media law experts expressed concern over Thomas' declaration.
Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan "is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom."
Peters said the ruling "had the immediate impact of emboldening news organizations to cover the civil rights movement more forcefully - and later the Vietnam War and Watergate."
But Thomas and Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy driven approach to the Constitution," Thomas wrote. "Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we."
The media for decades has depended on New York Times v. Sullivan as a shield for reporting on public figures. But Thomas said Justice Byron White had also expressed concern after he was in the majority in the case.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied asking former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to appoint a Trump ally to oversee the federal probe into Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen.
Trump, speaking to reporters at an unrelated bill signing ceremony at the Oval Office, pushed back against a New York Times article published Tuesday that indicated the president had asked Whitaker whether U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, a Trump appointee, could lead the probe into Cohen's handling of hush money payments to two alleged Trump paramours during the 2016 presidential election.
Berman, who was tapped by Trump to lead the Manhattan-based Southern District of New York after Trump removed Preet Bharara from the role in March 2017, had recused himself from the Cohen investigation and remains detached from the probe.
Trump, when asked if he had inquired with Whitaker about placing Berman in charge of the investigation, said: "No, not at all. I don't know who gave you that ... more fake news."
Whitaker previously told the House Judiciary Committee that Trump never pressured him about the Justice Department's separate investigations into Cohen and the Trump campaign's purported ties to Russia.
The Justice Department, responding to the Times report, issued a statement reiterating Whitaker's remarks to the committee.
"Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that 'at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation,' " said Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec. "Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony."
Trump on Tuesday also denounced the 16 states who are suing to block his attempt to fund a southern border wall via a national emergency declaration.
On Twitter, Trump took aim specifically at California, whose Democratic attorney general, Xavier Becerra, led the effort to file the lawsuit in which all participating states - including New York - have a Democratic attorney general.
"As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, of course, the 9th Circuit!," Trump tweeted, referring to the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which has previously ruled against his travel ban and efforts to curb U.S. asylum petitions.
Last Friday, at a news conference to outline his emergency declaration, Trump predicted the declaration would face a legal challenge in the Ninth Circuit, a federal bench he has often derided as a "disgrace" and liberal-leaning on Twitter and in campaign rallies.
"We will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling and then we'll end up in the Supreme Court," Trump said last Friday, adding that he hoped he would get a "fair shake" in the conservative-leaning Supreme Court.
On Tuesday, Trump offered a more optimistic take on his prospects, telling reporters: "I actually think we might do very well, even in the Ninth Circuit, because it's an open-and-closed case."
The lawsuit filed on Monday argues that Trump's national emergency declaration is unconstitutional in part because Congress, through the appropriations process, repeatedly denied Trump's $5.7 billion request for a border wall.
"President Trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt," Becerra said in a statement on Monday. "He knows there is no border crisis, he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted, and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court."
The White House has argued the National Emergencies Act gives Trump broad powers to declare an emergency and divert funding from military construction projects and drug enforcement programs to build additional barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Congress, under a bipartisan border security deal signed by Trump last week, allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fencing in Texas. Trump is looking to use the emergency declaration to tap into $6 billion in military funding and drug forfeiture money to pay for the wall.
Trump on Twitter criticized California's recently announced plans to dramatically scale back a high-speed rail project that received federal funding, arguing the funding could be used to pay for the border wall.

Texto completo: Comedy is pain plus time. And good gracious did Richard Pryor show the world so much of both.
With a boxer-turned-father-turned-pimp-to-his-mother and the reported experience of walking in on his mother with the white mayor of Peoria, Illinois, Pryor could only have been funny and been funny about race. But he was so much more.
When Pryor died in 2005,comic star Lily Tomlin spoke in Entertainment Weekly about her friend: "The last time I saw Richard, I was in the audience at the Santa Barbara film festival honoring him for his work. For almost two hours, I watched the greatest pioneering comic artist of the last three generations at the top of his genius -- this gifted, raging, soaring, plummeting, deeply human man with the tender boy inside."
Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor III was a star of any arena he entered, all while being a black man--not one in a dress, one in a rage.
Sure, there are the films that Pryor and fellow comedyjuggernautGeneWilderdid together like "Silver Streak," "Stir Crazy" and "See No Evil, Hear No Evil." But then there are the straighter roles, which were often more black-focused roles.
Pryor portrayed NASCAR's first black champion, Wendell Scott, in "Greased Lightning." And he was The Wiz in "The Wiz," which had an all-black cast that included Diana Ross and Michael Jackson, retelling thestoryof "TheWizardofOz."
And then he reinvented the way people stand at a microphone and make audiences laugh.
Confessional and raw, Pry-or's routines knew no bounds. Lenny Bruce courageously used comedy to defy arcane obscenity laws, but he did it as a white guy.
Becausepeopleseemtohold only one archetype for a person of color in their head at a time, Pryor was compared to America's silly--and since disgraced -- dad Bill Cosby. And Pryorcould be goofy, like when musing about a wino interacting with Dracula, but he also drew opinions from his friend Huey P. Newton, head of the Black Panther party.
And so Pryor gave the world comedy reality as they had never seen before; ever self-reflective, he held a mirror to society on issues of race.
In his language, Pryor would refer to women with derogatory terms, and he would also freely use a racial slur in an effort to take the "sting" out of the term.
Butin1979,hewenttoKenya.
After touring Kenya's national museum, according to The New York Times, he was in a hotel lobby and he realized something.
"There are no (racial slur) here. The people here, they still have their self-respect, their pride."
He discussed the epiphany in a special later that year.
"To this day, I wish I'd never said the word. I felt its lameness. It was misunderstood by people. They didn't get what I was talking about. Neither did I," according to the book "Richard Pryor: The Life and Legacy of a'Crazy'Black Man."
He vowed not to use the word again.
For a man known for so much, Pryor is maybe best known for one day in 1980, when in a drug-induced haze he poured 151-proof rum all over his body and lit himself on fire while freebasing cocaine.
He then ran ablaze down the California neighborhood street and was hospitalized for weeks before crafting a routine about the incident, creating one of the most hysterically despairing comedy bits ever.
It was included on one of the best-regarded comedy recordings ever with "Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip" in 1982.
"I fell in love with this pipe. This pipe controlled my very being," he said.
The album represents one of his five Grammy wins, according to the Recording Academy. (Pryor also was posthumously awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy.)
He went on in 1983 to become the highest-paid African-American actor in Hollywood when he earned $4 million for his role in "Superman III," reported NPR.
As evidenced by his drug use, the success and money didn't help calm the demons, which could also be seen with Pryorbeingwretchedandphysically abusing women.
He later admitted on air to Barbara Walters, as retold in a GQ story, that he had beaten women, including some of his seven wives.
"They pissed me off. I'm sorry to say that. I know emotionally inside of me, because I was weak. That's really the reason. I was weak."
In 1986, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the central nervous system. He continued performing, making "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" with Wilder in 1989.
He died in December 2005 at a Los Angeles hospital.
Even with his flaws, it's a shame Pryor isn't here to join in on the continuing debate of issues with black America decades after he first broached them on stage.
"Iwent to Zimbabwe.I know how white people feel in America now: Relaxed! Cause when I heard the police car I knew they weren't coming after me!"

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Roger Stone to appear in court for a hearing to consider whether to revoke his bail after the longtime Donald Trump confidant posted a photo on Instagram of the judge with what appeared to be crosshairs of a gun.
US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone must show for a hearing Thursday afternoon and prove why she shouldn't modify or revoke his bail or implement a full gag order in his case.
On Monday, Stone posted a photo of Jackson with what appeared to be crosshairs near her head. Later in the day, Stone and his attorneys filed a notice with the court that they recognized the "photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted."
Stone later said that the picture had been "misinterpreted" and that any suggestion he intended to threaten Jackson was "categorically false."
Stone is charged with lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks. He has denied guilt.

Suit aiming to block Obama center in park can proceed
CHICAGO — A judge on Tuesday gave the green light to a lawsuit filed by a parks-advocacy group that aims to stop for good the delayed construction of former president Barack Obama's $500 million presidential center in a Chicago park beside Lake Michigan.
Some supporters of the project fear the lawsuit filed by Protect Our Parks could force Obama — who launched his political career in Chicago — to build the Obama Presidential Center elsewhere. A 2016 suit brought by another group helped to scuttle a $400 million plan by "Star Wars" creator George Lucas to build a museum on public land on Chicago's lakefront. That museum is now under construction in Los Angeles.
US District Judge John Robert Blakey heard arguments last week on the city's motion to dismiss the suit and was largely focused on the question of whether the group had standing to sue. His ruling doesn't mean the group will necessarily prevail, but confirms that the suit poses a formidable threat to the project.
Plans call for the center to be built in Jackson Park, which was named after President Andrew Jackson and was a site for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The site 7 miles south of downtown Chicago is near low-income neighborhoods where Obama once worked as a community organizer and is just blocks from the University of Chicago, where Obama was a law professor. It is also close to the home where the Obamas lived until he won the presidency in 2008.
In its 2018 suit, Protect Our Parks accused the city of illegally transferring park land to a private entity, The Obama Foundation. The group said city officials manipulated the approval process and tinkered with legislation to skirt longstanding laws designed to ensure residents had unobstructed access to lakeside parks.
"Defendants have chosen to deal with it in a classic Chicago political way . . . to deceive and seemingly legitimize an illegal land grab," the lawsuit says. It also described the city as "gifting" prized land to a Chicago favorite son.
To make the park available for the project, the Chicago Park District first sold the land to the city for $1. Illinois legislators amended the state's Illinois Aquarium and Museum Act to include presidential libraries as an exception to the no-development rules if there's a compelling public interest. The Chicago City Council approved the project by a 47-to-1 vote last May.
The Obama Foundation, a private nonprofit, would pay $10 to the city for use of the park land for 99 years, cover the costs of building the complex, and be responsible for covering operating costs for 99 years. Once built, the Obama Presidential Center's physical structures would be transferred to the city for free, meaning the city would own the center but not control what happens there.

Trump signs order to start establishing Space Force
President Trump moved forward with his planned Space Force on Tuesday, signing an order to begin the process for establishing a new branch of the military that would be dedicated to handling threats in space.
Trump's directive orders the Defense Department to “marshal its space resources to deter and counter threats in space" — which the Pentagon already does. The newly created Space Force would be overseen by the Air Force, a concession to congressional critics who say the Pentagon does not need to add to its sprawling bureaucracy.
The president needs congressional approval to create a Space Force; his initial proposal for it to be a separate branch of the military was met with resistance. Congress and the Pentagon recommended that the force be placed under the Air Force's purview.

Texto completo: BY ZEKE MILLER
The Associated Press
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -
Kamala Harris had the best campaign roll-out. Amy Klobuchar's snowy debut showed grit. Elizabeth Warren's opening campaign video was a bit odd. Take it from an unlikely armchair pundit sizing up the 2020 Democratic field: President Donald Trump.
In tweets, public remarks and private conversations, Trump is making clear he is closely following the campaign to challenge him on the ballot. Facing no serious primary opponent of his own - at least so far - Trump is establishing himself as an in-their-face observer of the Democratic
Party's nominating process - and no one will be surprised to find that he's not being coy about weighing in.
Presidents traditionally ignore their potential opponents as long as possible to maintain their status as an incumbent floating above the contenders who are auditioning for a job they already hold.
Not Trump. He's eager to shape the debate, sow discord and help position himself for the general election. It's just one more norm to shatter, and a risky bet that his acerbic politics will work to his advantage once again.
This is the president whose 240-character blasts and penchant for insults made mincemeat of his 2016 Republican rivals. And Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said the president aims to use Twitter again this time to "define his potential opponent and impact the Democrat primary debate."
But often Trump's commentary reflects a peculiar sense of disengagement from the events of the day, as though he were a panelist on the cable news shows he records and watches, rather than their prime subject of discussion. He puts the armchair in armchair punditry. In an interview with The New York Times, Trump assessed Harris' campaign like a talk show regular, declaring her opening moves as having a "better crowd, better enthusiasm" than the other Democrats.
Crowd size was also at play last week when he held a rally in El Paso, Texas, that was countered a few blocks away by one led by former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a potential 2020 candidate.
"So we have let's say 35,000 people tonight, and he has 200 people, 300 people," Trump observed, wildly exaggerating both numbers. "Not too good. In fact, what I would do is, I would say, that may be the end of his presidential bid."
When Sen. Klobuchar announced her candidacy on a frigid day in her home state of Minnesota, Trump anointed her with a nickname of sorts, and a benign one at that: "By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!"
Inside the West Wing and in conversations with outside allies, Trump has been workshopping other attempts to imprint his new adversaries with lasting labels, according to two people on whom the president has tested out the nicknames. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the president. He is also testing out lines of attack in public rallies, exploring vulnerabilities he could use against them should they advance to the general election.
No candidate has drawn more commentary and criticism from Trump than Sen. Warren, the liberal Massachusetts Democrat. Warren's past claims of Native American heritage prompted Trump to brand her "Pocahontas" and he has shown no qualms about deploying racially charged barbs harking back to some of the nation's darkest abuses.
Wading into a Twitter frenzy over an Instagram video Warren posted after she announced her exploratory committee while sharing a beer with her husband at their kitchen table, Trump jeered: "Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is, to her husband, 'Thank you for being here. I'm glad you're here' It's their house, he's supposed to be there!"
"If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!" Trump tweeted.
Even in the midst of the partial government shutdown, those tweets mocking Warren were widely joked about by White House staff weary from the protracted closure, according to one aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. The person said the president repeatedly ridiculed Warren's video in private conversations with aides and outside advisers.
Attention from Trump can drive up fundraising and elevate a candidate above a crowded field. But responding to attacks also distracts from a candidate's message.
Trump's rivals in the 2016 GOP primary learned that lesson as he bedeviled them with name-calling. Trump goaded Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, into making a thinly veiled insult of his manhood that quickly backfired, and weeks later he sucked Texas Sen. Ted Cruz into a brutal back-and-forth about an insult he had leveled at Cruz's wife.
"The president has an ability to use social media to define his opponents and influence the primary debate in a way no sitting president before him has," said former White House spokesman Raj Shah. "I expect him to take full advantage."

Texto completo: As the polar vortex swept through the Midwest last month, with temperatures plunging to dangerous lows, a good Samaritan from Chicago stood up to help those in need.

Candice Payne, a 34-year-old businesswoman, made a spur-of-the-moment decision to provide more than 100 homeless people with food, clothes, and a place to stay during the recent cold spell. A homeless camp near her home had been left without heat following a propane tank explosion. It was 50 below, and I knew they were going to be sleeping on ice and I had to do something, she told The New York Times.

Ms. Payne rented 30 rooms at $70 per room for one night at a nearby hotel, just as temperatures in Chicago reached as low as minus 26 degrees. She also put a plea on Instagram for others to help the homeless people with food, clothes, and transport. Soon, she had donations pouring in, providing the resources for more rooms and care packages. More than $10,000 was raised, offering housing to the homeless through this past Sunday.

This is just regular people trying to help, said Ms. Payne.

There is obviously no substitute for policies and programs that prevent crises before they begin. Both Chicago and Toledo, for instance, were forward-thinking enough to open warming shelters for homeless people affected by the polar vortex. But there are always going to be people who aren't served by those programs, and in those moments, people need to act. Candice Payne chose to act and made a significant impact in the process.

Her initiative and compassion should be an inspiration to people everywhere. More than 100 homeless people are warm, well-fed, and alive thanks in no small part to her efforts. More of us should follow her lead, remembering that we can all work to help others in need. Ms. Payne's work is an important reminder that sometimes average people can be make the largest difference.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests there's more madness than method to the president and his administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump wasn’t elected to just be conventional
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers. " Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons . . . hustled into jobs they were never suited for. "
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in "executive time" activities such as watching TV, tweeting and making calls.
The consistent and growing evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits. They're from people who have worked inside the administration and seen White House operations up close and personal:
►A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless. "
►Journalist Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown. "
►"Fire and Fury" by writer Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former television reality star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments of the president by some of his top-drawer executives. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader. " And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied multiple reports that he labeled Trump a "moron. "
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
People who've served inside the Trump administration keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Texto completo: MUNICH—European officials brushed off U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's calls during a diplomatic trip to the continent this week to ratchet up pressure on Iran, saying they will continue defending the 2015 nuclear deal and stay engaged with Iran's government.
At the annual Munich Security Conference over the weekend, where world leaders gather to debate issues from the Middle East to trade, senior European officials met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Mr. Zarif on Sunday blasted what he called Mr. Pence's arrogant demands on European soil for Europeans to pull out of the deal.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel set out a starkly different vision from the vice president, urging greater European and multilateral cooperation and raising questions about recent U.S. decisions like the planned drawdown of troops from Syria. She lamented the split between the U.S. and Europe on Iran and raised common European and U.S. worries about Iran's role in Syria and Yemen and its missile program.
Speaking after Ms. Merkel, Mr. Pence echoed comments he made earlier at a Polish-U.S. conference in Warsaw, saying "the time has come for our European partners to stop undermining U.S. sanctions" on Iran. "The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal."

Privately, some Western officials said Mr. Pence's remarks could weaken Washington's efforts to draw a line under differences over the 2015 deal and tighten coordination on shared U.S.-European concerns about Iran's behavior.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said, following his meeting with Mr. Zarif, that Europe needs "a constructive dialogue with Iran" on Syria and Yemen.
On Friday, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the Iranian nuclear deal, which saw Iran accept strict but temporary demands on its nuclear activities, was "fundamental and crucial for our security."
Earlier this month, France, Germany and the U.K. formally launched a new company, INSTEX, to maintain some economic ties between Iran and Europe by creating a payments channel for companies. The move came as European banks close their doors to Iranian business because of reimposed U.S. sanctions following President Trump's decision last May to exit from the nuclear agreement.
U.S. officials have publicly played down the significance of the new mechanism, saying they doubt it will be much used.
The fresh trans-Atlantic tensions over Iran came amid the first signs of a tougher European approach to Iran in recent weeks. In early January, the EU sanctioned two Iranians and a branch of Iran's security apparatus over alleged Iranian plots in Europe.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also said the bloc could follow Washington's lead in sanctioning Iran over the country's missile program and tests.
For now, there is no consensus in the EU in ratcheting up pressure on Iran. But U.S. officials are hopeful that could change in coming months if the two sides can coordinate more closely.
On Sunday, Mr. Zarif slammed the Warsaw conference, which included senior officials from the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East, like Israel and Saudi Arabia, but was boycotted by Russia and included only midlevel officials from many European countries. He said the U.S. was leading a coalition "of the unwilling and the openly coerced."
Mr. Zarif wouldn't say how long Iran would continue abiding by its commitments under the nuclear deal but said the country's patience was limited. He criticized Europe for pressuring Iran over its missile activities and not doing more to stand up to U.S. pressure and safeguard commerce with Iran.
"INSTEX falls short of the commitments by the E3 to save the nuclear deal," he said of France, Germany and Britain. "Europe needs to be willing to get wet if it wants to swim against the dangerous tide of U.S. unilateralism," he said.
Mr. Zarif also said Iran is investigating U.S. efforts to sabotage Iran's missile tests. The New York Times reported this week the Trump administration has revived a secret program to do this.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Those who chant “build the wall” and who favor highly restrictive immigration policy need a history lesson. America has had experience with imposing extremely restrictive immigration quotas. In the period before and during World War II, extreme immigration restrictionism held sway.
The results speak volumes: The restrictive quotas were an unmitigated disaster.
There are some clear parallels between the pre-World War II period and our own time. Because of violence and the threat of persecution, unprecedented numbers became refugees. Americans in the 1930s and early 1940s worried refugees would take their jobs. The fear was that new immigrants would compete with low-skilled workers and would drive down wages. High unemployment during the Depression reinforced that fear.
Also, some Americans saw immigrants as threatening the national culture because the immigrants were allegedly not assimilating. Proponents of the 1924 Immigration Act favored Northern Europeans over Jews, Catholics and Italians.
Even before World War II, laws from the 1920s imposed narrow and specific limits on the number who could immigrate to the United States in any given year. The Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, especially Jews. The law also effectively prohibited all Asians from immigrating to America.
Strong currents of nativism led many lawmakers to line up on the immigration restrictionist side. America Firsters of that time saw immigrants as representing a threat to the nation's well-being.
How this played out for Jews seeking relief from Hitler and the Nazis is an object lesson. While people can rightly point to Nazi anti-Semitism and the Nazis' accompanying violence, the sad reality is that it was the American unwillingness to offer refuge that was a central cause of the poor response to the Nazis' monstrous crimes.
Leading up to World War II and during the war, the American State Department (and the FDR administration) had no intention of resettling large numbers of European Jews in the United States. In fact, the State Department feared Hitler might release tens of thousands of Jews into Allied hands.
The U.S. government under FDR never developed any contingency plan for large scale Jewish immigration nor did they ever seriously get behind rescue options, even after 1942, when the Nazi extermination plan became widely known.
U.S. government officials also feared German refugees could be spies and they worried such immigrants could threaten national security.
A dark truth is that the United States could have saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis but the immigration restrictionists and their supporters prevented it. Anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic attitudes were widespread.
In February 1939, two members of Congress, Sen. Robert Wagner, a Democrat from New York, and Rep. Edith Rogers, a Republican from Massachusetts, introduced a bill to allow an additional 20,000 German Jewish children above the allowed quota to immigrate to the United States.
The bill's opponents took an America First approach to rejecting refugees. The argument made by opponents was that America should focus on helping its own needy citizens, rather than taking in anyone new. The bill never even made it to a vote in Congress. It did not get out of committee.
A Gallup poll from January 1939 asked if Americans would support bringing even 10,000 German refugee children into the United States. Public opinion ran 2-1 against. While polls were less rigorous in those days, there is little reason to doubt its accuracy.
For those who might think knowledge of the Nazi crimes against the Jews was not sufficiently publicized, I would point out that Kristallnacht happened in November 1938. Kristallnacht was a pogrom in which 267 synagogues throughout Germany and Austria were destroyed or damaged, along with vandalism of 7,000 Jewish businesses. The Nazis killed hundreds of Jews and arrested 30,000 Jewish men and put them in concentration camps. The Nazis also ransacked Jewish homes, hospitals and schools.
Many newspapers, including the New York Times, reported on Kristallnacht and condemned it. It is a hard argument to say Americans were unaware of the Nazi crimes although many never imagined Nazi persecution would lead to genocide. The sad reality is that, in spite of the extremely negative publicity for Germany, Americans remained largely indifferent to the plight of Germany's Jews.
After Kristallnacht, more Jews fled Germany for survival. Hannah Arendt has described the response to the pre-World War II refugee crisis: “The refugees were welcomed nowhere and could be assimilated nowhere. Once they had left their homeland, they remained homeless, once they left their state they remained stateless, once they had been deprived of their human rights, they were rightless, the scum of the earth.”
Arendt's quote speaks directly to our time as well. The view of immigrants she describes could be now. Those who favor the application of international law are demagogued as favoring open borders. Dehumanization of immigrants and a failure to understand the circumstances driving them is the new normal.
After World War II, the United States, in an effort of rectification, advanced asylum law to help people fleeing persecution. There was a desire not to repeat the experience that had befallen Jewish refugees.
Recent experience shows America is backsliding, unlearning the lessons about refugees from World War II. We used to think we had a moral obligation to help people fleeing persecution. Now, on our southern border, our government is repeating the same errors made 80 years ago.

Don't try to muzzle tabloids Sleazy journalism can serve the public good.

Texto completo: There are plenty of reasons to sympathize with Jeff Bezos in his battle with the National Enquirer. If true, the accusations of blackmail brought by the billionaire founder of Amazon would be just the latest outrage from the tabloid, which has made a specialty of scabrous reporting and ethically questionable tactics and techniques.
But that doesn't mean we should always applaud the campaigns of powerful moguls to silence sleazy newspapers. History shows that even the most odious publications and the worst practices of scandal sheets can inadvertently play an important role in maintaining the freedom of the press. There's no better illustration than the sordid story of the Saturday Press.
In the early 20th century, hundreds, if not thousands, of small, local newspapers began imitating the "yellow journalism" style pioneered by William Randolph Hearst. These papers, most of them small-time weeklies, wallowed in the gutter. They viciously attacked minorities; they also published lurid stories of sex and crime as well as what one historian has described as "grossly exaggerated accounts of malfeasance by public officials."
The editors displayed a brazen disregard for journalistic ethics, creating entirely bogus stories, or hyping more modest scandals with salacious details. Then, copy in hand, they would approach the person they implicated in funny business, threatening to go public unless the victim made it worth their while to stay silent. Most victims acceded to editorial demands: Extortion was difficult to prove in court.
Among the editors accused of this practice was a miscreant from Minnesota named Howard Guilford who had a hand in several scandal sheets. It's little surprise that the wealthy and powerful hated Guilford, and they may have been behind trumped-up accusations of counterfeiting and other crimes leveled against him. More credible, though, were multiple charges of libel and extortion, though he was found guilty only on a couple of occasions.
In 1915, Guilford published the Twin City Reporter, a paper that trafficked in sex, attacks on the wealthy and powerful, but also went after the Salvation Army, the Catholic Church and other institutions. In addition, it aimed a constant stream of epithets and invective against minority groups.
The Twin City Reporter eventually went under, but Guilford joined up with another lowlife named Jay Near a decade later to publish the Saturday Press in Minneapolis. In the first issue, the duo claimed: "No blackmail ever dirtied our hands although we are aware that the taint of blackmail sullies our reputations."
With that out of the way, they promised to clean up the city, which was, by almost universal assent, one of the most corrupt in the country, thanks to bootlegging and other forms of organized crime. Guilford and Near wasted no time, immediately accusing the police, the mayor and the county district attorney, Floyd Olson, of corruption.
These charges were accompanied by rank anti-Semitism.
"There have been too many men in this city who have been taking orders from JEW GANGSTERS ... Therefore we have Jew gangsters practically ruling Minneapolis. It is Jew thugs who have 'pulled' practically every robbery in this city ... Practically every vendor of vile hooch, every owner of a moonshine still, every snake-faced gangster and embryonic yegg (a safecracker) in the Twin Cities is a JEW."
Minnesota's legislature had passed a measure called the Public Nuisance Abatement Law a few years earlier. This statute, which took direct aim at scandal sheets, used the "prior restraint" doctrine to empower the state to suppress newspapers deemed "malicious, scandalous, and defamatory." This perfectly captured the editorial line of the Saturday Press.
After the paper called Olson a "Jew lover," the district attorney filed suit under the law, shutting it down for defaming the Jewish community, the police and just about everyone else of importance in the Twin Cities. After a jury found the paper guilty of the charge, Guilford abandoned the cause. But Near took the case to the state Supreme Court, arguing that the state law infringed on the freedom of the press.
Near's attorney made a novel, if honest, argument: "Every person does have a constitutional right to publish malicious, scandalous, and defamatory matter, though untrue, and with bad motives, and for unjustifiable ends." The state, he argued, could not quash such stupidity in advance; it could only prosecute the newspaper after the fact.
Chief Justice Samuel B. Wilson, writing in the majority opinion, didn't buy it: "No agency can hush the sincere and honest voice of the press; but our Constitution was never intended to protect malice, scandal, and defamation, when untrue or published without justifiable ends."
The court ruled against Near, and ordered the Saturday Press shuttered for the foreseeable future.
But by this time, other newspapers, most notably the Chicago Tribune, decided to lend their support to Near - not because they admired him, but because they believed a deeper issue was at stake. Col. Robert R. McCormick, the Tribune's publisher, had already been sued by the city of Chicago for libel. He had won that suit; now he hoped to help Near win his legal battle, too.
From late 1929 to 1931, the case rolled toward the U.S. Supreme Court, underwritten by McCormick and the American Newspaper Publishers Association. In June 1931, the Supreme Court handed down a narrow, 5-4 decision in favor of Near and declared the Minnesota statute unconstitutional.
The four conservative judges dissenting in the case focused on the fact that Guilford and Near had been disreputable, anti-Semitic rabble-rousers for many years. The judges lambasted the duo's earlier "criminal" partnership at the Twin City Reporter, and argued that the law that had closed their subsequent collaboration at the Saturday Press was an appropriate response to publishers who "contrive and put into effect a scheme or program for oppression, blackmail or extortion."
Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes, writing for the majority, ignored the indefensible character of Guilford and Near, as well as the assertion that Olson may have in fact enjoyed an "impeccable" reputation prior to the attacks on his character. A bigger question was at stake: "The fact that liberty of the press can be abused does not make less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint."
The case became a landmark decision that established new, expansive definitions of freedom of the press. It has since become the basis of important decisions that have nothing to do with the rants of a couple of Minnesota anti-Semites. When The New York Times fought an attempt to halt the publication of the Pentagon Papers, for example, Near v. Minnesota played a starring role, buttressing their case.
Which brings us back to the National Enquirer. At the moment, the issues in the Bezos imbroglio look pretty pedestrian. But should the billionaire pursue a legal case on the grounds of privacy or libel law, courts will rule in ways that could have profound implications for the freedom of the press down the line.

Texto completo: It is hard to think of a more interesting and encouraging moment in this nation’s recent environmental history than last week’s clumsy rollout of that still-evolving program of environmental/energy/economic policies called the Green New Deal.
Why encouraging? Consider:
* Despite considerable uncertainty, even disagreement, among its leading advocates about the GND’s current content and what its final shape ought to be, the initiative has strong support among progressive Democrats, including more than 40 members of Congress and a handful of presidential hopefuls. Also among voters, regardless of party.
* Despite intramural sniping among those Democrats, also among big environmental groups, over such hot-button issues as the acceptability of nuclear power and the necessity of large-scale carbon capture, the main focus seems to be on finding a pathway to consensus — not on the possible futility of going up against Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.
* Despite a relentless and virtually fact-free mortar barrage from Republicans and climate deniers, public opinion seems to strongly, even instinctively, favor the general notion of new government investment in clean energy and climate protection as a route to jobs growth, improved infrastructure and long-term cost savings.
Why interesting? Chiefly because so little about this Green New Deal is actually new; its clear antecedents stretch back for a few decades, at least.
By noting this I don’t seek to criticize or marginalize Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the Sunrise Movement or anyone else in the GND movement as lacking in originality. That their agenda seems fresh and unprecedented to a lot of people, whose responses tend to be supportive, strikes this onlooker as still another basis for encouragement:
Perhaps what we have in the newest Green New Deal is the restatement of valuable and venerable ideas whose political plausibility is emerging at last, because they now seem so inherently sensible.
Thomas L. Friedman is generally credited with coining the term “Green New Deal” in a pair of pieces he wrote for The New York Times in January and April of 2007; they later became part of his book “Hot, Flat and Crowded.”
Without disputing his coinage — memorable phrase-making is among Friedman’s greatest gifts — I’ll just note that similar ideas were already in wide circulation by the late 1990s, when I started writing about environmental policy as a Strib editorialist, and probably sooner.
With “Natural Capitalism” (1999), Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins argued for a new industrial revolution that would achieve sustainable economies based on respect for natural systems and stewardship of natural resources, with government support where necessary. Storm Cunningham’s “The Restoration Economy” (2002) outlined new opportunities for economic growth and business success in watershed restoration, brownfield remediation and other regenerative repairs of industrial mayhem.
Both of these, as I recall, placed considerable emphasis on transitional paths to clean and renewable energy, which has become only cheaper and easier — and far more urgent — in the interim.
If those books came out in less traumatized times, they also had the advantage of being heard in an era when political conversation was much more civil, and somewhat less rigidly partisan.
Though I can’t retrieve the name of this particular Republican, I cannot forget the moment early in the George W. Bush administration’s environmental rollbacks when a thoughtful lawmaker (possibly lobbyist) came to the Strib to talk to me about his vision of reshaping the GOP by recapturing environmentally minded progressives from the Democrats.
We need to lose the focus on defending greenhouse gases and dirty smokestack plumes, he said. Stop pitting jobs and economic growth against environmental protection. Instead, remind people that conservation is conservative, that markets deliver efficiency, that infrastructure is an investment rather than a purchase, and that private business — sometimes with prudently limited government help — can make clean energy and environmental stewardship into smart business propositions, while eliminating much of the current regulatory apparatus (and its overhead) as no longer necessary.
Fast forward now to 2008 and Van Jones’ “The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems.” This best-seller, which had the misfortune to emerge as the subprime mortgage collapse was driving economic meltdown, focused more directly on the specifics of job creation and this key advantage of “green-collar” employment:
A large share of workers in an expanding green sector are performing intrinsically local functions — unlike loggers, miners and assemblers — so they can go to sleep each night in confidence their employers won’t decide overnight to export their jobs insulating homes, retrofitting HVAC systems, installing solar panels, maintaining wind turbines, building out grids for distributed power generation….
Of the limited opinion polling that has been done on the current iteration of a Green New Deal, the most impressive by my lights comes from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. In December, registered voters were given this description of the proposal:
Some members of Congress are proposing a “Green New Deal” for the U.S. They say that a Green New Deal will produce jobs and strengthen America’s economy by accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. The Deal would generate 100% of the nation’s electricity from clean, renewable sources within the next 10 years; upgrade the nation’s energy grid, buildings, and transportation infrastructure; increase energy efficiency; invest in green technology research and development; and provide training for jobs in the new green economy.
Asked to state their support on a four-point scale — strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, strongly oppose — 81 percent of respondents favored the plan, with half strongly supportive.
Despite their party’s negative messaging about moving off fossil fuels and shifting to renewables, 64 percent of Republicans also favored the plan, and of these about three-fourths were strong supporters. Among independents, 88 percent said they were supporters.
The most interesting thing about these results, at least to me, is the striking degree to which the respondents were essentially uninformed about the Green New Deal: 14 percent had heard “a little,” 3 percent “a lot,” and 82 percent “ nothing at all .”
One way of looking at these results is to consider that support may fade as the GND becomes more specific, and as people hear more about its details, its sponsorship, its potential costs — not to mention opponents’ challenges to its vision. Another way is to consider that this level of support now appears to be essentially reflexive, sort of a no-brainer.
If that’s so, it suggests that while the Green New Deal’s predecessor proposals might not have registered sizable gains in the policy-making arena, they may have had a profound impact on the way Americans think about what’s worthy, what’s right and what’s possible in a world where job growth, decent living standards and environmental betterment are no longer in competition — indeed, may not even be separable anymore.

To reduce money in politics, slash the size of government

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Like a terrifying demon that returns during the final scene of a horror movie, campaign-finance reform is the “thing” that never goes away. The United States Supreme Court sometimes saves the day, as it did with the First Amendment-related Citizens United case in 2010. Yet reformers always have a new scheme to take “the money out of politics,” even though their last schemes always resulted in more cash influencing political campaigns.
The campaign-finance scaremongers are back with a symbolic bill that is a political poke-in-the-eye to the sleazy-seeming Trump administration. It could never pass the Senate or gain a presidential signature, but it makes a point. Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats are pushing HR1, which Vox describes as a “sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at stamping out the influence of money in politics and expanding voting rights.”
The voting-rights goal is doable because Congress has the power to loosen federal standards for voting. But only a delusional person would believe that lawmakers have the power to “stamp out” money in politics any more than they have the power to “stamp out” sexually transmitted diseases. Desire often outstrips good sense, which is why STDs and political spending are at record highs. People will work around any new hurdles placed in their way.
The problem — at least with political spending — is government, not rich people. Both political sides rail about the role of billionaires in our political system. The left fulminates about the Koch Brothers and right-wing “dark money” groups, whereas the right pounds the table about George Soros and left-leaning tech firms. However, a close look at lobbying spending in California offers some much-needed lessons on this hot-button topic.
The Sacramento Bee recently published an analysis of spending on government lobbying and found that it rose again last year. The total was $361 million, up 5 percent since 2017. It is far above the approximately $200 million spent on lobbying in 2002. One can easily conclude from these numbers — and from watching lobbyists swarm the Capitol — that something untoward is going on.
Nevertheless, those numbers need a little more perspective. The total 2017-2018 California state budget was $183.3 billion. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal would spend $209.1 billion. In 2002-2003, the total state budget was $97.9 billion. Lobbying spending has gone up, but only in tandem with growth in state government spending. Lobbying dollars are small potatoes when you consider the total, well, potato pie.
Sure, stories are legion about legislators who won’t consider any proposal until they run it by the requisite lobbyist. Union leaders strut around the Capitol as if they own the place, because they pretty much do own the place. Lobbyists and trade groups of all type — unions, industry and activist groups — routinely write the language that becomes state law. Welcome to the real world. No finance reform can ever take the politics out of the political system.
Again, the problem is the size of government. Writing in National Review, Bradley Smith notes that Democratic lawmakers have proposed a Green New Deal “that would essentially abolish the aviation, auto, energy and mining industries, among others. Why is it illegitimate for shareholders and employees in those industries to voice their opinions on regulatory schemes that would leave them bankrupt and unemployed?” Good question.
Take a closer look at that California lobbying report. The top spender was Pacific Gas & Electric, which is a regulated monopoly utility whose continued existence could be dependent on how the Legislature decides to handle wildfire-related liabilities. The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group that represents the highly regulated oil and gas businesses, is next on the list. Then there’s another regulated utility, Edison International, and the California State Council of Service Employees, which is a powerful labor union.
Reality check: Those groups whose existence is most dependent on the government are going to spend oodles on lobbying that government. Look at the lobbying categories, per the Bee. The biggest spender is government — mainly local governments influencing state government. Next is healthcare, which is a government-dependent industry. Then come utilities, which are government-granted monopolies. Also high on the list are insurance companies, where government has power to set rates, as well as manufacturers, education and labor unions.
Finance reformers are frustrated by the courts, but there’s that thing called the First Amendment. Spending is not speech per se. However, columnist George Will asked if The New York Times would be OK if it were free to write what it wanted, but if the government controlled “the amount it can spend on journalists, paper, ink, printing presses, delivery trucks, advertisements and so on.” You get the point.
Maybe we can all embrace a reform idea that would actually work: reducing the size and power of government. Sadly, that is the one idea that will frighten the kind of politicians and activists who support campaign-finance reform.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests that there's more madness than method to this administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers." Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons ... hustled into jobs they were never suited for."
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in vague "executive time" activities.
The consistent, mounting evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or to explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits:
A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless."
Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown."
"Fire and Fury" by Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former reality TV star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments by top aides. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader." And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied reports that he labeled Trump a "moron."
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
Trump administration insiders keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA -- While writing a sermon in September, Cheryl Pyrch, the pastor of Summit Presbyterian Church, needed an assist. On the topic of greatness and Jesus Christ, she wanted to open with recollections of greats in other spheres.
She didn't have to look very far for a source.
Having encountered Wilt Chamberlain in passing almost 40 years ago, she decided he was the great she wanted to highlight. And details of his career -- four Most Valuable Player Awards, seven N.B.A. scoring titles -- were close at hand, literally and figuratively through Sports Reference, a monolith of sports data websites that just happens to rent space from the church.
"I didn't know all this in 1980," Pyrch told the congregation as she described Chamberlain's awards during the Sunday service. "I got it yesterday from a Sports Reference website."
The ubiquitous Sports Reference family of websites -- Baseball-Reference.com, Basketball-Reference.com, Pro-Football-Reference.com, Hockey-Reference.com, and so on -- are some of the most popular sports almanacs on the internet.
They draw users of all kinds, from people casually searching for a trivia answer to owners of professional teams. Aided by an overhaul of its mobile website, Sports Reference's founder and president, Sean Forman, said the group of sites drew one billion page views last year, a record for the company.
Sports Reference, however, does not have the gleaming offices or huge staff of a digital titan. It has 11 full-time employees and is headquartered on the third floor of a building at Summit Presbyterian in Philadelphia, behind the 100-year-old main church and above the gymnasium, which is often used as a day care center.
"Walking through it to come in and out, sometimes you're going through 3-year-olds tossing balls," said Mike Kania, 38, who eight years ago became one of the company's first employees. "I worked for AOL for a long time where we had a badge to scan at the front door, people there and a front desk. It's a lot different from that."
It is, in fact, a point of pride among Sports Reference employees that the sites have grown from humble beginnings into oft-used resources. Until late last year, Forman, 47, was cleaning the office and taking out the trash. (He has since hired the church's janitor to take over those duties.)
They are among the most popular sports-related sites. Basketball-Reference trails only NBA.com, while Pro-Football-Reference is second to NFL.com, according to SimilarWeb. Nearly two decades after Forman created Baseball-Reference, it ranks third among baseball sites, behind MLB.com and MLBTradeRumors.com. (Baseball-Reference, however, is the top draw in Forman's stable.)
The sites are not just for casual fans. J.J. Redick, the Philadelphia 76ers guard, pays for an advertising-free Basketball-Reference subscription. John Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C., uses Baseball-Reference's Play Index to manage statistical searches. Scott Boras, the well-known baseball agent, donated $100 to the company during its infancy because he had relied on the site's data while negotiating a contract for Andruw Jones, Forman said.
"I use it daily," said Thad Levine, the Minnesota Twins general manager, although his team, like many others, generates its own advanced and proprietary data.
"We went so far as to hire one of their back-end programmers," added Levine, referring to Hans Van Slooten, who oversaw Baseball-Reference until June, when the Twins hired him for their front office.
The sites are still expanding and developing. Forman said he envisioned Basketball-Reference eventually surpassing Baseball-Reference in traffic as a result of the data revolution in the N.B.A. And over the summer, Sports Reference began another major undertaking: a soccer website, FBref.com, which the company hopes will be as comprehensive as its other sites. In a twist from its current offerings, the company is planning to make the soccer site bilingual, with English and Spanish versions.
The sites are painstakingly tweaked for updates and corrections. Some errors are reported through the dozens of emails the company receives daily. One came from the mother of Casey Fossum, a former major league pitcher. She wrote to say that her son's birth date was wrong. It was corrected.
Other requests reveal the reach of Sports Reference.
A pitching coach sent an email asking that his Italian league statistics be added to his page so that his players would stop teasing him about being a bad pitcher. A woman wrote in to say that she was dating a person who claimed to be a former N.F.L. player but that she could not find him on Pro-Football-Reference. She wanted to know if that was because of an oversight or a lie.
"I tried to let her down as gently as possible," said Mike Lynch, 37, whose official title with the company is managing stathead. "I said something like, 'If he was cut in training camp, we wouldn't necessarily have a record of him playing in a regular season game."'
Sports Reference started with Baseball-Reference in 2000, when Forman, looking to avoid work on his doctoral dissertation on applied mathematical and computational sciences at the University of Iowa, began building a website from the CD-ROM that accompanied the printed Total Baseball encyclopedias. He hoped to make historical data more accessible.
Forman, who has contributed to The New York Times's baseball coverage in the past, expanded his endeavor by creating Sports Reference in 2004. Three years later he formalized loose affiliations with Pro-Football-Reference (founded by Doug Drinen in 2000) and Basketball-Reference (founded by Justin Kubatko in 2004). Kubatko left Sports Reference in 2013 because of what he called "creative differences."
In 2007, Forman still fit the stats nerd stereotype, working out of the basement of his home and staying up until 1 a.m. updating or improving the website. The year before, he had left his full-time job of six years -- professor of mathematics and computer science at St. Joseph's University -- because it was too hard to juggle both. He also needed a better place to work.
So Forman turned to his church, which had space to rent.
Sports Reference's seven websites are usually updated automatically, mostly from official feeds of statistics that the company pays for. Some data, such as roster transactions or salary information, is input manually, and there are always bugs to fix.
Once you get beyond the basics, however, the information on the sites runs the gamut of sources.
They include a collection of old college media guides acquired from a single collector and a professor in Britain who supplies statistics of independent baseball leagues. The sites also add some things just for fun, such as Oddibe McDowell's page listing his utility bills from 2011 and part of 2012, in reference to a series of articles by Deadspin.
Sports Reference's goal is to become more comprehensive, even as sports leagues increasingly privatize their data. Eventually, the company hopes to charge for advanced features and to become less dependent on advertising, which currently generates 95 percent of the sites' revenue. As of now, the only advanced tool that requires a paid subscription is Baseball-Reference's Play Index. (Don't worry: The page for the former Met Keith Hernandez's mustache will live forever.)
That the little company in her church has become so important, with leading sports websites, earned a laugh from Pyrch. She had been to the sites once or twice, including the time she did sermon research.
"I think that both myself and most of the congregation would not realize what kind of a powerhouse Sports Reference is," she said. "I don't really know a lot about numbers or computers, but one billion is a lot."

Texto completo: Burning Man's chief executive has disinvited one camp for wealthy attendees and warned a dozen others as it outlines steps the organization has taken to return the event to its egalitarian roots, according to a blog post the organization posted over the weekend.
Burning Man disinvited Humano The Tribe, a turnkey or "plug and play" camp that catered to the moneyed class and was cited for not complying with the organization's requirement to not foul the environment. Twelve other camps received warnings. Burning Man, once a low-key gathering which now attracts celebrities and billionaires, is attended by 70,000 participants who gather to create music and art in the Nevada desert every August.
The announced changes also include adjustments to ticket pricing at the event, which will make it easier for an economically diverse crowd to attend. The executive, Marian Goodell, decried what she called "convenience culture." Critics have contended the recent influx of wealthy attendees who pay to stay in prepackaged camps upend the ethos of radical inclusion and community the event was founded upon.
"Our job is to shine a light on an issue and do our part," Ms. Goodell said in an interview Thursday. "Because you are building a community, you need to act like a community. You don't have transactions and businesses. You don't have velvet ropes."
Critics and attendees who have seen Burning Man's culture drift applauded the move. "It is a nice gesture to the Burner audience," said Brian Doherty, the author of "This Is Burning Man: The Rise of a New American Underground." "The question is what kind of experience do they want to provide? They listened to what the core audience wants."
"After negative reports from participants and nearly every Black Rock City operations team, we told Camp Humano that they are not invited back in 2019," Ms. Goodell wrote in her post. She cited the camp's strain on resources and "many complaints from neighboring camps." Representatives for Humano did not return emails seeking comment on Thursday.
Humano, according to a brochure obtained by Mashable, charged as much as $100,000 for a two-bedroom unit with a bathroom and air conditioning last year. A smaller 160-square-foot tent cost $25,000.
Ms. Goodell said the recent changes had been in the works for two months and were not related to events at the Fyre Festival, where high-paying attendees were left stranded in 2017 on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma. Two recent documentaries about Fyre Festival have highlighted its organizational dysfunction.
The first Burning Man festival was held in 1986 on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where the founder, Larry Harvey, gathered a group of friends and set an eight-foot-tall man on fire. The event moved to Black Rock Desert, about 140 miles north of Reno, four years later. Then, it was a relatively low-key gathering over Labor Day that embraced anticonsumerism. Nothing could be bought or sold except coffee and ice. (Mr. Harvey died last year.)
The New York Times Magazine described Burning Man in 1994 as "an excuse to party in the desert." Over time the festival grew in popularity, attended by Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires who arrived in private jets, hired laborers to pick up after them and built air-conditioned camps. They, too, hosted elaborate soirees attended by models and celebrities who posted photographs on Twitter and Instagram.
To attract a more diverse crowd, Ms. Goodell said, Burning Man is making changes to its ticket prices, which last year ranged from $190 to $1,200. In a survey of participants the organization released last year, the median household income for an attendee was tallied at $94,900.
Ms. Goodell said the organization would expand ticket applications for low-income attendees by 18 percent. She also said it would limit the number of high-priced tickets that could be bought by individuals. The idea is to make them readily available to a wider group of people.
Ms. Goodell warned, though, that the event's wealthy attendees were not to blame for the culture shift. She pointed out that Burning Man had become for some businesses a counterculture marketing opportunity. "I recently heard rumors of more than one product or business launch happening on playa in 2018," Ms. Goodell wrote in her post.
"Seriously, people," she wrote. "This really isn't Burning Man."

CLIPPERS REPORT; Krzyzewski addresses alleged rape

Texto completo: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski told the Associated Press that he has "no knowledge" of a woman's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by Corey Maggette, a former Blue Devils basketball player who is now a Clippers broadcaster, and the Hall of Fame coach believes the school should and will investigate.
Lawyer Nancy Erika Smith has said her client, Meredith Watson, was raped by a basketball player while she was a student at Duke. The New York Times and other publications have identified the player as Maggette, who has denied the allegation. The reports cited a friend of Watson, R.Stanton Jones, who said she told him about the alleged assault at the time.
Watson has also said Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her while they were students at Duke in 2000. Smith said Watson told a high-ranking administrator about the alleged assault by a basketball player but was dissuaded from filing a complaint or notifying police. Maggette played at Duke in the 1998-99 season and then left for the NBA, where he had a 14-year career.

Krzyzewski was asked about the allegation after Duke's 71-69 victory over Louisville on Tuesday night. He said he wasn't aware of the details.
"At that level for that serious an accusation, it's always university level. Our university, they'll handle everything and that's what should happen," Krzyzewski said.
Maggette, who has worked as a Clippers' analyst for Fox Sports West, has not done a game since he was accused. He had covered the Clippers this season as a pre- and-postgame analyst and color commentator.
He denied the accusation through a spokesman in a statement released to the New York Times.
"It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson's lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about those allegations," Maggette said in the statement. "I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge."
Injury update
Clippers coach Doc Rivers said that Wilson Chandler, who is out with a right quad strain, and Luc Mbah a Moute, who is out with a sore left knee, will most likely return to practice next week after the All-Star break.
Rivers said getting Chandler and Mbah a Moute back will give the Clippers two more forwards to play alongside Danilo Gallinari.
Rivers has been forced to start a three-guard lineup of Landry Shamet, PatrickBeverley and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander because he doesn't have enough forwards after trading Tobias Harris to the Philadelphia 76ers.

Texto completo: When Smith Galtney decided to act on his instincts and learn about photography from professionals, he kept hearing over and over, "Nobody wants happy."
Galtney's photos of his domestic life didn't have enough pathos, he was told. There wasn't enough tension, turmoil or conflict. But Galtney objected. "Hey, a lot of work went into this happiness," he said.
Had he taken up photography years before, he could have given them pathos, all right. He was an addict and had been to some pretty dark places.
Learning to become a better photographer was part of Galtney's recovery. The art form suited him well and spoke to his instincts as an observant, caring person. He also realized the things he learned about becoming a photographer were similar to the things that helped him become a sober person. "It was uncanny that everything we learned in 12-step was so weirdly in line with everything that good photography is about - staying in the moment, moving with the light, being patient and open and receptive to the world."
This winter and spring, the University of Southern Maine is showing some of Galtney's black-and-white photographs at the Area Gallery in the Woodbury Campus Center in Portland. His exhibition, "My Principal Ghost," is on view through March 29. Galtney, 47, will discuss his work at a reception from 5 to 7 p.m. Feb. 21.
Galtney graduated from the International Center of Photography and also studied photography at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Portland and at Maine Media Workshops in Rockport. He worked as a print journalist for 20 years, writing for The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Village Voice and other publications before moving to Maine from New York in 2009. He lives in Raymond with his husband, John.
The exhibition takes it name from a phrase in the Loudon Wainwright III song, "Older than My Old Man Now." Galtney thought it was a lovely phrase and kept it close to his heart.
The photographs in "My Principal Ghost" represent parts of the artist's recent past and journey, and include scenes from New York and Maine. He took the photos between 2014 and 2018, "a period when the chaos of my early adulthood somehow evolved into a calm, content midlife," he writes in his artist statement. "I'd just finished photography school. My partner and I got married. My transition from New Yorker to Mainer felt complete. I also said goodbye to a dear old friend, who died suddenly - and rather unsurprisingly - in early 2016. This work is an attempt to show the continuance of the past by photographing its imprint on the present."
The exhibition answers the riddle: How do you photograph the past when the past is no longer around? These images represent echoes from Galtney's life and show how ghosts from the past can sometimes sneak into the contented present. He considers these photos snapshots, linked mostly by their mood.
There are images of his now-deceased and much-beloved dog, Kate; a box of ashes of his friend; snow piled high along a fence. And there are photos of light sneaking under a closed door, of sun reflecting off the windows of a high-rise apartment building, and of two distant automobile headlamps, framed by the dark of night and shining their light forward.

Texto completo: As legend goes, when television host Johnny Carson asked comedian Redd Foxx to name the funniest comic around in 1965, Foxx immediately said "Flip Wilson."
Clerow "Flip" Wilson, a native of New Jersey, had already spent a decade honing his skills as a comedian at black clubs around the country, including New York's famed Apollo Theater.When Foxx mentioned Wilson's name on national television, the recognition led to high-profile bookings on television and in top nightclubs.
Within a few years, Wilson scored his own variety show, which ran from 1970-1974. He created some of the most memorable characters in comedy, including the Rev. Leroy from the Church of What's Happening Now and Geraldine, the sassy Southern black woman whose shrill voice told it like it was -- "What you see is what you get!" Wilson even had a special handshake for all of his guests -- four hand slaps and two elbow bumps followed by two hip bumps.
Wilson would become the first black entertainer to headline a successful variety show on network television. In 1971, he took the Emmy Awards for outstanding writing achievement for a variety show and outstanding variety program. He also appeared on the cover of Time magazine,
which called him "TV's First Black Superstar." His show, which employed George Carlin and Richard Pryor as writers, was the highest-rated variety show, and it was second in overall ratings only to "All in the Family."
It was a big achievement for Wilson, who had a rough start as one of 18 children.He was placed in foster care at age 7 when his mother abandoned the family, according to his obituary in The New York Times. By age 13, he was sent to live with his father, who was often unemployed. Three years later, Wilson quit school and joined the Air Force. During his service, Wilson began writing out his comedy material, and by the time he was discharged in 1954, he had decided to become a comedian.
While Wilson's humor was deeply rooted in black culture, he believed comedy was colorless. He avoided politics, relying mostly on humorous storytelling that included a funny turn of phrase or an unexpected viewpoint. His approach earned him both fans and detractors, but Wilson once said he mostly only cared about being funny.
He released seven comedy albums from 1964-1996, including 1970's "The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress," which won a Grammy. Wilson ended his variety show while he was still on top and went on to appear in several comedy specials and movies, most notably 1974's "Uptown Saturday Night," which starred Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte.
At the start of the new decade, Wilson, who by then had a net worth of $5 million, had some legal issues. In 1981, he was charged with drug possession when Los Angeles narcotics agents seized his briefcase and found small amounts of cocaine and hashish.The evidence was later suppressed as it was deemed to have been seized illegally, according to a 1983 news story in the AJC.
Wilson, who lived in Malibu, California, spent much of the '80s avoiding the spotlight and indulging his hobby of flying in hot air balloons. In 1984, he hosted the revival of "People Are Funny" -- a show that offered prizes to contestants who carried out stunts. The following year, he starred with singer Gladys Knight in "Charlie & Co.," a one-season sitcom with Wilson as the patriarch of a middle-class family on the South Side of Chicago.
Married and divorced twice, Wilson had five children who survived him when he died in 1998 from liver cancer at age 64. More than a decade earlier, he had passed the torch to another comedian just as Foxx had passed it to him. "Once every 10 or 15 years, a rare comedian comes along, and right now, that's him,"Wilson told writer Bob Wisehart in 1984. He was talking about Eddie Murphy.

Texto completo: Good Morning. In today's edition, China and the U.S. try to work out a trade agreement, President Trump is ambivalent about the border deal, drug lord "El Chapo" is found guilty, and more.
China and the U.S. are seeking to nail down the broad outline of a trade agreement this week
The goal is to narrow the substantial gap between the two sides, and for the presidents of both countries to be able to clinch a deal at a possible summit.
-- A high-level U.S. delegation led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will hold two days of talks, starting tomorrow, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and his entourage.
-- If the two sides don't agree by March 1, or don't agree to extend the deadline, tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will jump to 25% from 10%.
U.S. stocks surged yesterday as optimism that negotiators were making progress on a trade agreement eased investors' trepidation.
Meanwhile, the new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the U.S. hammered out with Canada and Mexico last year, is threatened by a sharp divide between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration.
-- Democrats want changes to ensure Mexico allows its workers to form unions freely and enforces environmental protections.
President Trump said he wasn't satisfied with a bipartisan border-security deal reached by lawmakers
He didn't rule out ultimately signing the resulting legislation, needed to prevent another government shutdown, but suggested that he might try to amend it. The tentative deal would allocate $1.38 billion for physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, far less than what Mr. Trump had sought.
-- The border deal doesn't resolve questions about immigrant detention, however. A dispute over funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds emerged as a late sticking point in the negotiations, but the arcane math surrounding their funding left lawmakers citing different numbers.
From reporter Louise Radnofsky:
Immigration detention's complicated funding mechanism left Republicans and Democrats claiming victory in the bipartisan border-security deal reached Monday night, with GOP lawmakers arguing they had increased the number of beds funded and Democrats arguing they had decreased them. Activists on both sides of the immigration debate agreed on one thing by Tuesday: They hated the deal.

Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera was convicted by a U.S. jury
Mr. Guzmán, the infamous cartel leader, was convicted of 10 criminal counts in connection with his narcotics empire, a victory for drug-enforcement authorities who had pursued him relentlessly for more than two decades.
-- The 61-year-old is expected to spend the rest of his life in a U.S. prison without the possibility of parole. The U.S. promised Mexico it wouldn't seek the death penalty.
The trial brought to an end the decadeslong career of El Chapo and revealed in remarkable detail the inner workings of the criminal empire he built, which rivaled governments and multinational companies in its power and sophistication.
The founders of Lyft are preparing to take near-majority voting control of the ride-hailing company when it goes public, despite together owning a stake of less than 10%
-- John Zimmer and Logan Green -- president and chief executive, respectively -- are working with underwriters and lawyers on a plan to create a class of shares with extra votes that they will hold.
-- Their move to consolidate control is the latest illustration of the nearly unchecked power held by the founders of many of the fastest-growing technology companies, including Facebook, Alphabet and Snap.
What We're Following:
-- China Hedges Its Bets: Beijing has been holding talks with Venezuela's political opposition to safeguard its investments in the country, as pressure builds on authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro
-- Brokerage Price War: Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments are making hundreds more exchange-traded funds free to trade on their platforms.
-- Scandal Over Scandal: A shareholder lawsuit accused several current and former CBS executives of engaging in insider trading before sexual-harassment allegations against former Chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves became public.
-- Shortline: Gov. Gavin Newsom is scaling back the state's decade-old plan to build a high-speed rail line connecting major cities in the north and south.
Apple has a plan for a subscription news service -- but publishers are concerned
The service is part of the company's efforts to offset slowing iPhone sales. In a pitch to some news organizations, Apple has said it would keep about half of the subscription revenue.
-- The "Netflix for news" would allow users to read an unlimited amount of content from participating publishers for a monthly fee. It is expected to launch later this year as a paid tier of the Apple News app.
-- The New York Times and the Washington Post are among the major outlets that so far haven't agreed to license their content to the service, in part because of concerns over the proposed terms.
From reporter Tripp Mickle:
Apple has always put a tax on reaching its 900 million iPhone users, but the levy could be especially steep for newspapers and publishers. The tech giant's proposal to take about half of the subscription money for a $10-a-month news service left some major news outlets bristling. But with iPhone sales slowing, the company is betting it can get enough publishers to come on board-drawn by its huge user base-and turn loyal buyers of its phones into loyal subscribers to its new service.

Is Los Angeles ready for its art-market close-up?
The new contemporary-art fair, Frieze Los Angeles, kicks off tomorrow, and its arrival is stirring up the city's ambitions to become a global art-market hub.
-- Los Angeles lacks elements that tend to define the world's blue-chip marketplaces, like a centralized gallery district and a clearly defined art season with high-profile, internationally followed auctions.
-- But Los Angeles's art scene continues to mushroom, and the addition of a well-known franchise like Frieze is the latest sign of the city's ascent.

Did Trump jump-start a Beto O'Rourke campaign for president?

Texto completo: Ostensibly, President Donald Trump came to the El Paso County Coliseum on Monday night to rally support for building a wall, or fence, like that what separates El Paso from Ciudad Juárez along a longer stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. But it was readily apparent throughout Trump’s stemwinder that he also came in hopes of burying former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s potential presidential campaign before it has a chance to get off the ground.
If so, that strategy appears to have backfired.
O’Rourke, who has been out of the national political spotlight since his close-call loss to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz,
R-Texas, suddenly was sharing a split screen in national coverage with the president. O’Rourke, speaking at an outdoor counterrally a few hundred yards away, was retesting his hopeful message that resonated with Texas voters three months ago, while Trump was belittling O’Rourke.
“I think that this was the debut on the national stage for Beto O’Rourke, and I would be very surprised if he is not running for president,” Jim Messina, who managed President Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, said Tuesday on MSNBC.
“My view is that I’m not sure that Beto O’Rourke needed any kind of jump-start, but it seems to have given him one,” said Matt Angle, a Washington, D.C.-based Democratic strategist who heads the Lone Star Project. “I’ve gotten calls all morning from people who again want to know how you get in touch with Beto O’Rourke.”
Trump’s attacks on O’Rourke were based on the notion that Trump drew a far larger crowd than O’Rourke.
The El Paso County Coliseum holds 6,500 people, and despite Trump’s claim that thousands more people were allowed in, the fire marshal told the El Paso Times that was not true. Crowd estimates outside the Trump rally ranged from 10,000 to 12,000. An O’Rourke aide gave the attendance at the counterrally at 7,000, citing law enforcement estimates. Bloomberg News said the counterrally crowd ranged from 10,000 to 15,000, citing El Paso police.
An El Paso Police Department public information officer did not return a telephone message Tuesday.
Even before he took the stage at the coliseum, Trump was asked by Laura Ingraham of Fox News about O’Rourke.
“There’s an opposing rally kind of going on at the same time as this rally tonight, Beto O’Rourke, a young up and comer they say in the Democrat Party. He and others say the wall is really about hate and racism,” Ingraham said to Trump. “To that you say what?”
“Well, to that I say that No. 1, very few people showed up to his rally and this place is packed with thousands and thousands outside, and I guess he challenged us to an event so maybe this means he’s going to have to drop out of the race, because this was not a good situation for him,” Trump said. “I don’t know why he did it.”
The chyron under Trump read, “Trump: Lack of people at Beto rally may mean he should drop out of the race.”
Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Trump’s most vociferous advocate and surrogate in Texas, drove the point home in an interview with Ingraham outside the coliseum right after the rally.
Of Trump, Patrick said, “Tonight, this was a bold move for him to come to Beto O’Rourke, to Robert Francis O’Rourke’s hometown, outdraw him.”
“Tonight, Laura, I think Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign came to an end,” Patrick said. “He may run, but it’s over. When you can’t carry your own town, when (Trump) comes out and draws out a crowd like this, it is over for Beto.
“And all the Democrats are going to seize on this tomorrow morning and say, ‘Look, what he did he was an embarrassment to our party, in his own city, and Trump knocked him out of the race tonight.’”
Reviving fortunes
But, by daylight, it appeared that if anything Trump had elevated O’Rourke and revived the fortunes of a potential presidential candidate who some had thought had let his moment pass as he played the role of what Wimberley writer Richard Parker, in a New York Times column about Monday night’s events in El Paso, described as “presidential Hamlet.” O’Rourke has said he will decide by the end of the month whether he’ll run for president.
University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus disputed Patrick’s assertion that O’Rourke was done for after Monday night’s pas de deux with Trump.
“To me this is quite the opposite,” Rottinghaus said. “This puts O’Rourke firmly in the kind of ideological and rhetorical lead for the Democratic Party and sets him up as a natural opponent for Trump and puts a lot of other people on unsure footing.”
“Looking at tweets from other contenders, the one who looked the most out of sorts was Julián Castro, who would be a natural opponent for Trump on this issue had O’Rourke never decided to get in his minivan and challenge Ted Cruz,” Rottinghaus said.
O’Rourke, who just completed three terms in Congress, built a national fan and fundraising base during his Senate run and immediately vaulted in polls to the top tier of potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
It appeared that in the months since, some of that popular ardor might have faded as O’Rourke hesitated and a succession of popular candidates jumped into the fray.
But, in a couple of hours Monday night, Trump managed to insert O’Rourke right in the middle of the presidential campaign in exactly the way any of the other Democratic candidates would have envied.
A virtual debate
For Democrats around the country sizing up prospective matchups with Trump, O’Rourke rose to the challenge Monday night in El Paso. He offered them a young candidate with the bona fides to answer Trump with some authority on the border issues that seem almost certain to be center stage in the 2020 campaign and on which O’Rourke laid out a 10-point agenda, by far his most comprehensive yet, Friday in a post on Medium.
“We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,” O’Rourke said at the rally organized by some 50 community groups and institutions in El Paso. “We have so much to give, so much to show the rest of the country.”
“We know that walls do not save lives,” he said. “Walls end lives.”
Trump told Ingraham that walls are about “safety for the Americans, safety for our people, safety for our country, and a wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. It’s a moral thing.”
But during the rally, Trump describing O’Rourke as a “young man who’s got very little going for himself except he has a great first name.”
“So we have, let’s say, 35,000 people tonight, and he has 200 people, 300 people,” Trump said.
“Not too good,” Trump said. “That may be the end of his presidential bid.”

Texto completo: Spoiler alert! This story contains details from "The Masked Singer" Season 1, Episode 7, including the identity of the eliminated celebrity.
These singers fighting to stay hidden.
Wednesday's episode of Fox hit "The Masked Singer" revealed another celebrity this week as the final six competitors – Peacock, Monster, Bee, Alien, Rabbit and Lion – put on their best performances.
Monster kicked off the show with a soulful rendition of Joan Jett & the Blackhearts' "I Love Rock 'n' Roll," after revealing he grew up "down South. " The judges were blown away by his performance. Robin Thicke called the furry creature his "favorite," throwing out a guess of "In Living Color" alum Tommy Davidson. Jenny McCarthy thinks it's Lil Jon, while guest judge J. B. Smoove thinks it’s boxer Mike Tyson after the monster said he’s "stepping back into the ring. "
The Monster's moment of truth: He was not on "In Living Color. " Sorry Robin.

Next up was the Lion, who brought the house down with Lady Gaga's "Diamond Heart. " "She always delivers every single week," McCarthy said. She guessed the fierce competitor is a member of a girl group because the lion previously said she's "separating herself from the pack. " McCarthy's final guess: Spice Girl Mel B or a member of Destiny's Child. Nicole Scherzinger thinks it may be "True Grit" actress Hailee Steinfeld.
Lion's moment of truth: "I have a subscription to a monthly murder-mystery game. " McCarthy replied, "Who doesn't?"
Alien gave an out-of-this-world performance of Elle King “Ex’s & Oh's. " "I feel like every week you're stepping up your game," Scherzinger said, while Thicke added that "this is the trickiest one for me. " McCarthy guessed it's either Nicole or Sofia Richie because the alien claims to be from a famous family. Ken Jeong guessed Paula Abdul because of an earlier snake reference. Scherzinger pointed out that La Toya Jackson had a pet snake.
Alien's hint: "I have been on The New York Times Best Seller list twice. "
Bee took us back in time with Tina Turner’s "What's Love Got to Do with It. " "You are obviously a living legend and we are honored to have you on the show," Thicke said, before guessing Gladys Knight. However, the Bee dropped several song titles that confused the judges before taking the stage. McCarthy and Scherzinger agreed it could be Patti LaBelle or Anita Baker, while Jeong thinks it's Turner herself.
Bee's moment of truth: "I have 10 Grammys. " Maybe the judges are on to something.
Rabbit kept things hopping along with a circus-themed performance of Stevie Wonder’s "Isn’t She Lovely. " He accompanied his vocals with choreography that convinced the judges he's a true performer. "He’s a boy-bander for sure," McCarthy said. Nicole agreed, guessing 'N Sync members J. C. Chasez or Joey Fatone. McCarthy even guessed it might be her husband, New Kids on the Block's Donnie Wahlberg: "He hasn’t answered the phone every time Bunny is on stage!"
Rabbit's moment of truth revealed he has "17 tattoos on my body. " When asked if that helps, McCarthy replied, "None of this does. "
Peacock was the last to take the stage, singing the Weeknd’s "Can’t Feel My Face. " "You always find a way to make us laugh and make us smile," Thicke said, pointing to his showbiz background. Smoove thinks it's Wayne Brady because of his Las Vegas residency, while McCarthy guessed Neil Patrick Harris or Donny Osmond.
Peacock's final clue was that he's had his face tattooed on someone's body. *scratches head*
In the end, it was Alien who was sent packing and ordered to unmask. The judges final guesses? McCarthy picked Sofia Richie, Scherzinger selected La Toya Jackson, Jeong thought Paula Abdul, Smoove guessed Carmen Electra and Thicke also picked Jackson.
When the mask comes off it's … drum roll please …La Toya Jackson. The singer revealed that she signed on for the show because "people have a tendency to prejudge you … and they compare you to other people in your family. So I wanted to do it and see how far I'd go. "
Jackson, the older sister of icon Michael Jackson, joins unmasked singers talk show-host Ricki Lake (Raven); actress Tori Spelling (Unicorn); comedian Margaret Cho (Poodle); former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports commentator Terry Bradshaw (Deer); comedian Tommy Chong (Pineapple); and Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown (Hippo).
"The Masked Singer" is now moving into the semifinals next week, where two singers will be unmasked for the first time ever.

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski on Tuesday addressed Corey Maggette being identified as the unnamed Duke men’s basketball player who allegedly sexually assaulted Meredith Watson.
A friend of Watson's, Washington, D. C. -based attorney R. Stanton Jones, confirmed in an email to USA TODAY Sports on Monday that Watson told him she was raped by Maggette when the two were at the university in 1999.
Krzyzewski first yielded to his earlier statement Saturday, before Maggette was named, but went on to explain that it was a matter that needed to be handled by the university.
“I had no knowledge,” Krzyzewski said following Duke’s thrilling comeback win against Louisville. “At that level, for that serious of an accusation, it’s always university-level. Always. Our university will handle everything, and that’s what should happen. Coach shouldn’t do anything with that.
“I have no knowledge of it, but I’m not the one — our university should do all that, and rightfully so. That’s the level where it needs to happen. ”
Maggette, who was first identified as the alleged perpetrator by The New York Times, denied the accusation.
"I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge," Maggette said in the statement issued through a spokesperson.
Duke is also investigating the allegation against Maggette.
"We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed," Duke said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports Monday. "We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time. "
Last week Watson became the second woman to come forward to accuse Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of a "premeditated and aggressive" sexual assault.

Texto completo: Bri has so much she wants to say.
"My apologies, see, I forgot my manners
I get on the mic ‘cause it’s my life. You show off for girls and cameras. …
You talk about your clothes, about your shopping sprees
You talk about your Glock, about your i-c-e
But in this here ring, they all talking ‘bout me"
Sixteen-year-old Brianna wants to be a rapper. Rhyming distracts her from the ACT prep classes her mother insists she take at her magnet arts school and her feelings for longtime friend Malik. It’s an escape from the money troubles that mean there’s no heat at home and dwindling groceries in the fridge. And it gives her a megaphone to broadcast her reality, like when her wrists are zip-tied by a school security officer after she resists handing over her backpack.
Bri’s world is at the center of “On the Come Up” (Balzer + Bray/HarperCollins, $18.99) by Angie Thomas.
“This is not just music, it’s our culture," Thomas says.
"On the Come Up" is Thomas' topical, fascinating follow-up to her 2017 blockbuster debut “The Hate U Give.” That book inspired a film of the same name, and though this second novel hit shelves Feb. 5, the production team behind “Hate” already is on board for a film based on the new book. Thomas will be in Austin on Feb. 15 to read from "On the Come Up."
“This was an idea I had even before I had ‘Hate U Give.’" she says. "I always knew I wanted to write a book that paid homage to hip-hop. I had not seen that with young adult literature."
Bri lives in Garden Heights, the same fictional neighborhood inhabited by “Hate's” heroine Starr. But “Come Up” has a new cast of characters. There are Bri’s lifelong best friends, potential love interest Malik and studious Sonny. There’s Aunt Pooh, who deals drugs but also nurtures Bri’s rap career. There’s Bri’s brother, Trey, who graduated from high school and college with honors, and her mother, Jay, who lost years to addiction but is clean and trying to make it.
“We see a lot of stories about drug-addicted black mothers … but nobody talks about the once drug-addicted black mother who is still being judged by society, who is struggling through what society assumes about her,” Thomas says.
Shining a light on less-discussed topics is a passion of Thomas’, who explored police shootings of black teens in “Hate.” The book was longlisted for the National Book Award and has been on the New York Times best-seller list for more than 100 weeks. It was also among the top 10 books banned in 2017, according to the American Library Association: Katy ISD, for example, temporarily pulled the book from shelves after parent complaints.
“Come Up” raises more questions — about the nature of school policing, the depiction of African-Americans in media, and the double standard for girls and women, particularly those of color.
“If we're too loud or too passionate, suddenly we're ‘aggressive’ and ‘intimidating,’” Thomas says. “We make ourselves smaller to make others more comfortable. For black women, you have to do that even more so because of stereotypes. …
“Why is our anger a problem?” she asks. “Let's also remind people too that we're not just angry. Bri has her anger and her frustration, but that's not the only thing that she is. There’s nothing wrong with her being frustrated, considering the cards that have been dealt to her.
“What does it say about us as a society when we make black girls feel like there’s something wrong with them being angry or being passionate? If nothing else, I really want my book to help change the way people perceive black girls. They are more likely to be suspended than their white counterparts. They are more likely to get hits on their permanent record. I hope my book can change the way the people think about this, if it can get into people’s minds and give them a little bit of equity, allow them to be children.”
Like Bri, Thomas was an aspiring rapper as a teen. And like Bri, Thomas also saw firsthand how quickly poverty can consume a family. When Thomas was a teenager, her mother lost her job, and it plunged them into crisis. She says it was the most traumatic thing that has happened to her.
“One thing that I came to quickly realize is that, unfortunately, America punishes people for being poor, judges people for being poor,” she says. “You can see it in the policies so many of our politicians try to pass … there’s the whole stereotype of the 'welfare queen.' The majority of people on welfare don’t want to be on it. I hated being on food stamps. … Even to this day, I think about it. I can honestly say I am nowhere near poor … but there are still these moments that I get afraid that if anything goes wrong, it can all go away.
“One day can change everything. One thing can change your entire life. … I want to say to those kids who are dealing with this that I understand it, I get it, and I hope that in some ways I can give them a glimmer of hope to know that things can change.”

RUST BELT CITIES SHOULD EMBRACE THE SUBURBS MERGING AGING URBAN CENTERS WITH SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES COULD BE A PATH TO REVIVAL

Texto completo: Some U.S. cities have seen their fortunes rise in the new economy. Technology hubs such as San Francisco and Seattle, as well as coastal metropolises like New York and Los Angeles, are thriving. But some less-glamorous cities -especially in the Midwest -have been struggling. St. Louis isn't the worst off, but it's definitely in the latter category.
The numbers aren't all bad. Unemployment in St. Louis is low -only about 3 percent. Poverty in the city has fallen slightly, though at 25 percent it's still very high. But people are still streaming out of the city (which may be one reason for the low unemployment rate).
Besides poverty, one of the reasons for the population loss might be social ills. St. Louis is a violent city, with a murder rate of more than 60 per 100,000, more than 18 times the rate of New York. In 2017 the city was shaken by riots and protests over police brutality -during the protests, police mercilessly beat a black undercover officer whom they mistook for a protester.
Businesses are leaving the city as well. In 1980, St. Louis was home to the headquarters of 23 Fortune 500 companies; as of 2018 the number was only 10.
The city has rallied gamely to the challenge of Rust Belt decline, attempting to lure skilled workers to town with a revitalized downtown and the prowess of Washington University of St. Louis, especially the latter's high-ranked medical school. But a local think tank has a big idea to speed the revival -a merger between the city of St. Louis and the neighboring St. Louis County. A unified city would be the 10th largest in the U.S by population.
Consolidation seems like an obvious move to anyone who has spent considerable time in the St. Louis area (as I have, because much of my extended family lives there). The city of St. Louis represents only about 11 percent of the population of the metropolitan area, an unusually low share:
Ever since the so-called Great Divorce that separated the city of St. Louis from St. Louis County in 1876, the metropolitan area has been a crazy patchwork -it now comprises almost 100 independent municipalities and unincorporated Census areas. Each of those little suburbs has to have its own police department, courts, taxation system and governing administration.
Each one also has to have its own development strategy. In their book "Our Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey into the Heart of America," James and Deborah Fallows illustrate how some struggling cities have been able to revive their economies with a combination of industrial policy, human capital development, cooperation with universities and nonprofits, downtown revivals and smart branding. With 100 tiny towns both duplicating efforts and working at cross purposes, the St. Louis metro area won't easily be able to coordinate on such a strategy.
The idea of consolidation isn't without precedent. Several other midsize cities have merged with their surrounding counties -Nashville, Tenn.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Indianapolis back in the 1960s and '70s, and Louisville, Ky., in 2003. All of those metropolitan areas seem to be doing better economically since the financial crisis, though Nashville is the only one whose growth has been spectacular. Notably, all have outpaced St. Louis.
Meanwhile, other cities that have annexed surrounding areas often seem to be doing well. The divergence in performance between thriving Columbus, Ohio, and struggling Cleveland might be related to the fact that Columbus has annexed much of its metropolitan area, while Cleveland remains a small city at the center of a suburban patchwork. Of course, there are probably other factors at work -Ohio State University in Columbus is much larger than Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. But the pattern is interesting nonetheless. Meanwhile, although it never completed a formal merger, Minneapolis and St. Paul -two of the Midwest's most successful cities -have a program for sharing tax revenue among the various municipalities in the metropolitan area.
The evidence on city-county consolidation is mixed, with some studies showing benefits, others finding negative impacts and still others finding little effect. Furthermore, it's hard to evaluate the direction of causality, because cities that successfully consolidate with their counties might do so because they're doing well economically in the first place. It also might be the case that consolidation wasn't very effective in the mid-20th century, but is more helpful now -the big shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based one, which has powered the urban revival, could have changed the calculus.
In any case, given St. Louis' uncommon and pathological level of fragmentation, and the successes of places like Columbus, Nashville and Minneapolis-St. Paul, consolidation seems like a good thing to try. And St. Louis' experiment could serve as a trial for other struggling, fragmented cities like Cleveland.

Texto completo: "Great nations do not fight endless wars," President Trump declared in his State of the Union address. It was a line that could have been delivered by President Barack Obama, who in 2015 memorably said, "I do not support the idea of endless war."

Just a few days before Trump's address, his own party delivered the president a stinging rebuke when Senate Republicans passed a resolution opposing his Syrian and Afghan withdrawals by an overwhelming bipartisan 68-to-23 vote. Trump's defenders say: That's just the foreign policy establishment advocating "forever war." When, they ask, will these wars end? When will we be able to declare victory and go home?

These are fair questions, and they deserve serious answers.

In traditional wars, defining victory is easy. Victory comes when the enemy surrenders and lays down its arms. But this is not traditional war. We are not fighting nation-states with defined borders and armies, navies and air forces. We are fighting radical Islamist terrorists who are engaged in what Osama bin Laden called "a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam." There will be no signing ceremony on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri. They will never lay down their arms. In this war, victory for the United States is every day that passes without a terrorist attack on American soil. And that daily victory is made possible because the men and women of the U.S. military are hunting the enemy in faraway lands.

America's enemies have a very clear definition of victory. For them, victory comes when we give up the fight before they do. We know this because they have told us so. The 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told his CIA interrogator "Americans don't realize we do not need to defeat you militarily; we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting." That is how the terrorists see Obama's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Trump's planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan: America defeating itself by quitting.

It is understandable that, after 18 years, Americans want the war to end. But what we want is irrelevant. We don't get to decide unilaterally that the war is over. The enemy gets a vote. Just because we have tired of fighting doesn't mean that they have.

Here is the hard truth: We don't get to choose when the war ends, but we do get to choose where it is fought. It can either be fought over there, in the deserts of Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, or it can be fought over here -- on American streets and in American cities, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001. It's up to us.

Trump deserves enormous credit for taking the gloves off in the fight against the terrorists. He was absolutely correct when he declared in the State of the Union address, "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters." But the Islamic State is not defeated. It still has tens of thousands of fighters under arms and, according to one estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, as much as $400 million it smuggled out of Iraq, money that can be used to sustain its movement and plan attacks across the world.

In Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence estimates there are about 20 terrorist groups -- including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K -- who would immediately gain an uncontested sanctuary from which to plan new attacks if America withdraws. On Jan. 28, the New York Times reported that a 2017 intelligence assessment, renewed last year, "says a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the United States within two years."

Right now, the U.S. military has its boot on the terrorists' necks. They are focused on survival, not on launching faraway attacks. Take that boot away, though, and the terrorists will get up, dust themselves off, regroup, rebuild and go back to trying to kill Americans in the United States.

In his address, Trump praised the heroism of the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. "They did not know if they would survive the hour," he said. "They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail."

The same is true today. Great nations do not quit before they prevail.

Google and Facebook Worsen Media Bias

Texto completo: After the news industry laid off some 2,100 workers from Vice, Gannett, McClatchy, BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed "tech monopolies" that have no "incentive to disseminate high-quality, true information." President Trump blames the press itself: "Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn."
While these diagnoses of journalism's ills appear contradictory, both stem from the same root. Allowing a few platforms to control financing and distribution exacerbates the groupthink Mr. Trump rails against.
More than two-thirds of Americans get news from social media. Google and Facebook control a large majority of the digital advertising market that used to be a major source of revenue for the news industry. Tech companies have leveraged their control of news distribution to entrench their advertising dominance. Facebook's Instant Articles publishes the full text of an article in the platform and shares ad revenue with the publisher. Google punishes publications that raise revenue through subscriptions rather than advertising by downgrading search results of paywalled sites that don't provide free clicks. Google loosened its restrictions after criticism from publishers and threats of European antitrust enforcement, but it also introduced a "Subscribe With Google" service.
Instant Articles and Subscribe With Google may be convenient, but they also give the duopoly more control over the media's revenue and data, further centralizing news distribution. Google and Facebook have gained editorial influence over the press. They enact content guidelines as a condition for participation in advertising services. Both companies consult with left-wing groups such as Media Matters to determine what sites to exclude.
Now Google and Facebook are offering journalism grants to try to make up for their impact on the news industry. Last March the Google News Initiative pledged $300 million to aid publishers, and Facebook promised a similar amount last month. Charity from Big Tech makes the news industry more dependent.
The flow of funds also reflects the companies' Democratic tilt. In 2016 Google sponsored the "Electionland" initiatives with ProPublica, the New York Times, USA Today and Univision, among others, for the stated purpose of "ensuring all Americans could freely exercise their right to vote by shining a light on problems that might get in their way." In practice Electionland's scores of articles universally criticized then-candidate Donald Trump or reinforced the liberal position on issues like voter ID and voter fraud.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. observed that power in America is control of the means of communication. Mr. Trump -- who has also accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of political bias -- should be more concerned about the concentrated power of Big Tech than any news outlet.
While antitrust law focuses on economic effects, the Supreme Court said in Red Lion Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (1969) that it also complements the First Amendment's "uninhibited marketplace of ideas," which does not "countenance monopolization of that market." The antidote to media bias isn't schadenfreude over a few publications' travails but antitrust policies to ensure news outlets across the political spectrum can be independent of Silicon Valley.

Texto completo: 3 Pennsylvania Democrats among top 2020 targets
WASHINGTON - Democrats picked up four U.S. House seats in Pennsylvania last year, and now the party is preparing to defend those gains, with three Pennsylvanians identified as top targets of Republican in 2020.
The campaign arm of the House Democrats released a list Thursday of 44 lawmakers who will be part of its "Frontline" program, which directs support to vulnerable incumbents.
The list includes Reps. Susan Wild, elected in November to represent the Lehigh Valley; Conor Lamb, who won a special election in suburban Pittsburgh last March; and Matt Cartwright, a four-term incumbent from the Scranton area.
"Our majority hinges on these members from tough seats winning reelection in 2020," said DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos, adding that the party committee "will stand shoulder to shoulder with them in the fight ahead."
The three Pennsylvanians tallied wins in November by margins of at least 9 points. But their districts could prove tighter in a presidential election year.
Cartwright and Lamb are among 31 House Democrats whose districts voted for Trump in 2016.
Trump won Cartwright's 8th District by 10 points, and Lamb's 17th District by 3 points, according to The New York Times. Wild's 7th District went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, but by a 1-point margin.
Wild already has one Republican saying he'll challenge her next year: former Lehigh County commissioner Dean Browning filed paperwork last month for a 2020 campaign.
Cartwright is one of only three lawmakers on the DCCC's list who are not freshmen, according to Roll Call. While he has won re-election three times, Cartwright ran in a newly re-drawn district in 2018 as a result of the state's political gerrymandering court case.
National Republicans are looking at the same Pennsylvania districts as they build their 2020 plan. An early target list the National Republican Congressional Committee shared with Roll Call includes the same three districts that the Democrats identified as vulnerable.

Rise of the Eastern hellbender
Pennsylvania already has plenty of official state mascots. The brook trout is the state fish. The Great Dane is the state dog. The ruffed grouse is state bird, etc.
Now, lawmakers are two votes away from naming the official amphibian: the Eastern hellbender (cryptobranchus alleganiensis), which can grow up to 29 inches, making it one of the largest salamanders in North America.
In a 48-1 vote last week, the Senate gave final approval, on Senate Bill 9, to adopt the Eastern hellbender as its own. No other state has it listed as one of its official mascots despite its range and a natural ability to detect water pollution in its habit, according to the bill.
The bill was pushed by Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming. His district includes Lycoming College, whose Clean Water Institute runs a campaign to study the Eastern hellbender and protect it from extinction.
Last year, Yaw tussled with then House Majority Leader Dave Reed, R-Indiana, who had a bill making the Wehrle's salamander the official state amphibian. Their bills stalled out. Reed did not seek re-election, and now Yaw's bill is moving through the House.
On Wednesday, the House State Government Committee voted unanimously to support Yaw's bill.
The full House has to vote two more times on the bill for it to advance to Gov. Tom Wolf's desk for his signature.

College scholarship applications open
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives has opened its annual competition to award college scholarships to two high school seniors, according to Rep. Justin Simmons, R-Lehigh.
The scholarships can only be used at one of the 14 universities that make up the State System of Higher Education. Kutztown University in Berks County and East Stroudsburg in Monroe County are part of the system. The scholarships can be used for tuition, fees and books.
To qualify, students need to have kept at least a 3.0 cumulative grade point average throughout their high school career. The winners also must show a "commitment to community, leadership qualities, extracurricular activities and financial need are also taken into consideration," according to the rules.
No tax dollars are used to fund the scholarships. They are provided by donors who make up the Foundation for Enhancing Communities. Applications are judged by a panel of 12.
The application deadline is March 1. For more details, call your local representative or log onto his or her website.

Fees? Online referrals? Here are some tips to find the right lawyer

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

The Hummingbird As Warrior: Evolution Of A Fierce And Furious Beak

Texto completo: If you want to know what makes hummingbirds tick, it’s best to avoid most poetry about them.
Bird-beam of the summer day,
- Whither on your sunny way?
Whither? Probably off to have a bloodcurdling fight, that’s whither.
John Vance Cheney wrote that verse, but let’s not point fingers. He has plenty of poetic company, all seduced by the color, beauty and teeny-tininess of the hummingbird but failing to notice the ferocity burning in its rapidly beating heart.
The Aztecs weren’t fooled. Their god of war, Huitzilopochtli, was a hummingbird. The Aztecs loved war, and they loved the beauty of the birds as well. It seems they didn’t find any contradiction in the marriage of beauty and bloodthirsty aggression.
Scientists understood that aggression was a deep and pervasive part of hummingbird life. But they, too, have had their blind spots. The seemingly perfect match of nectar-bearing flowers to slender nectar-sipping beaks clearly showed that hummingbirds were shaped by co-evolution.
It seemed clear that, evolutionarily, plants were in charge. Their need for reliable pollinators produced flowers with a shape that demanded a long, slender bill. Hummingbird evolution obliged.
But hummingbirds also heard the call of battle, which demanded a different evolutionary course. Some of those slender, delicate beaks have been reshaped into strong, sharp and dangerous weapons.
In a recent paper organizing and summing up 10 years of research, Alejandro Rico-Guevara and his colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, shared evidence gathered by high-speed video about how the deadly beaks are deployed in male-to-male conflict.
Like the horns of bighorn sheep or the giant mandibles of stag beetles, hummingbird beaks are used to fight off rivals for mates. This is sexual selection, a narrow part of natural selection, in which the improvement of mating chances is the dominant force.
The males use their bills to stab other males, and to fence - feinting and parrying, sometimes knocking the other bird off a perch. Some hummingbirds even have hooked beaks, with serrations that look like shark teeth. Rico-Guevara’s high-speed video shows males tearing out another bird’s feathers with those grippers.
This is only one of several findings by Rico-Guevara and others that have recently changed the way hummingbirds are understood, including the unusual way they process sugar, the way they use their tongues in nectar drinking, and the evolution of bill shape.
Douglas Altshuler, an ornithologist at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, said Rico-Guevara’s thoroughness and attention to detail have pushed research on hummingbirds to new levels of excellence. “I think the body of work is great,” he said.
Richard Prum, an ornithologist at Yale who studies the kind of evolution that produces extreme male characteristics, described the research as spectacular: “Love this guy, love his work.”
Rico-Guevara began his study of hummingbirds as an undergraduate at the National University of Colombia. His adviser was Gary Stiles, a leading expert on hummingbirds, under whose tutelage Rico-Guevara wrote an honors thesis on how hummingbirds hunt insects to supplement their diet of nectar, which is pure sugar.
At about the same time, Margaret A. Rubega, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut, published a paper in Nature on the way hummingbirds bend their bills to capture insects. One thing led to another, and Rico-Guevara ended up at UConn, doing his Ph.D. research with Rubega on hummingbird tongues.
The research on hummingbird tongues was groundbreaking. The dominant idea about how the birds suck up nectar was that the shape of the beak and the tongue produced capillary action, in which liquid rises against gravity because of mechanical forces.
This is what happens when a narrow tube is inserted into liquid, or when a brush soaks up paint even though only the tip is in the liquid.
Rico-Guevara and Rubega showed instead that the hummingbird’s feeding method was completely different: As the forked tip of its tongue is withdrawn up the narrow bill, it traps nectar.
All hummingbirds fight, including females, but only a few species have weaponized bills. Rico-Guevara found that males wage their battles to claim the best mating territories.
In some species, males assemble in areas called leks, away from the flowers that they feed on. In a lek, each male has a territory, and the females shop around.
The territories vary quite a lot in size, but about 270 square feet is typical - the size of a very small New York City apartment. Central territories are the most prized, and a swordlike bill helps a male capture and keep that prime real estate.
In other hummingbird species with weaponized beaks, males set up mating territories right on the richest patches of flowers, again fighting off rivals. For them, Rico-Guevara said, it doesn’t really matter if they aren’t the most efficient nectar-drinkers - “just don’t let anybody else get to the flower.”
Extremists with wings
Hummingbird research is a rich, growing field, delving into everything from aerodynamics to how the birds process sucrose.
“In things that you can measure in any animal, like metabolism, they’re extreme,” Altshuler said. “Another way they’re extreme is in terms of their specialization.”
Hummingbirds also offer “opportunities to explore the limits of physiology,” Rico-Guevara said. They have the highest metabolic rate among vertebrates, and they specialize in hovering, “the most expensive form of locomotion in nature.”
Hovering, coincidentally, is a form of flight that is of intense interest to the designers of flying robots. “Everybody wants to replicate hummingbird flight,” he said.
The birds are also great to use in experiments, said Chris Clark, a biologist at the University of California, Riverside, who has collaborated with Rico-Guevara in studies of hummingbird flight.
The birds will fly readily to feeders. The presence of humans does not put them off. And, “they fly really well in wind tunnels and cages.”
Hummingbird behavior is also of interest because they have been shown to be excellent learners. Clark said there is speculation that because they live on the edge in terms of their energy budget, they may require a great memory for where the food sources are.
In listing multiple areas of interest for studying hummingbirds, Rico-Guevara conceded that he’s attracted to them for another reason.
“What has kept me attached to them is their incredible personality,” he said. “They are very bold. They come to you to explore what you are doing. They are inquisitive.”
He can only hope that in his science, “My curiosity would match their curiosity.”
And he does have some poetic company. Not all poets got stuck on the beauty of the birds. D.H. Lawrence, in “Humming-Bird,” imagines an ancient one at the dawn of creation.
Probably he was big
As mosses, and little lizards, they say, were once big.
Probably he was a jabbing, terrifying monster.

Resumen: American Media Inc., owner of the National Enquirer, says in a statement that it "acted lawfully" after Jeff Bezos blasted the company Thursday.

Texto completo: In response to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' pointed allegations of "extortion and blackmail," the National Enquirer's parent company American Media Inc. has responded that it "believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story" on Bezos' relationship with a former Los Angeles television news anchor.
In the statement released Friday, AMI says that, at "the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. "
Bezos blasted the company Thursday night in a blog post on the Medium platform, sharing emails from AMI detailing an alleged extortion and blackmail attempt by the company if Bezos did not put out a statement "affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. " The emails also demanded Bezos and his investigator agree that they would stop "referring to such a possibility. "
AMI claims in the email that has a number of intimate images of Bezos and Sanchez, including a "below the belt selfie" of Bezos and a picture of Sanchez "smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene. "

The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and Sanchez's relationship, including romantic text messages the two had sent each other. The Enquirer posted the texts after Bezos' announced last month that he and his wife, MacKenzie, would be getting a divorce after 25 years of marriage.
The leak of these messages prompted Bezos to put Gavin de Becker from his security team on the case of investigating how the Enquirer got ahold of the messages.
In addition to alleging a blackmail attempt, Bezos also claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic” over an investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Bezos, on top of being the founder of Amazon and the world's richest person, owns The Washington Post.
In his blistering post, Bezos links to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. "
"A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer," Bezos wrote. "They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation. "

Pecker is a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Trump has often targeted Bezos, Amazon and The Washington Post on his Twitter feed, including tweeting about all three subjects days after the National Enquirer broke the news that Bezos was seeing Sanchez.
Trump called Bezos "Jeff Bozo" in the tweet, writing that he was "so sorry to hear the news" about Bezos being "taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. "
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused AMI of participating in a scheme to help Trump win the presidency by paying women to keep silent about extramarital affairs he allegedly had with them before the election.
While the company stands by its reporting, AMI does say that, "in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary. ”
AMI's board consists of four members: Pecker, Evan Ratner, Barry Schwartz and David R. Hughes.

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint. Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward," De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

Republicans accuse Muslim lawmakers of anti-Semitism

Texto completo: Republicans are focusing their ire at the two Muslim women in Congress, accusing them of anti-Semitism and pressuring Democratic leaders to rebuke the lawmakers as attitudes in the party toward Israel shift from unquestioned support.
The pressure on Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) is part of a larger GOP effort to drive a partisan wedge into the traditionally nonpartisan relationship between the United States and Israel. Republicans are casting themselves as the more resolute defender of Israel, heightening the party's appeal to traditionally Democratic Jewish voters.
The Democratic Party's renewed internal debate over Israel is certain to have repercussions in 2020 for congressional candidates as well as White House hopefuls challenging President Trump, whose unwavering support of Israel and recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital have won plaudits in the Jewish state.
Dozens of liberal Democrats have been critical of Israeli government policy, and some - including Omar and Tlaib - have endorsed what is known as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, meant to apply economic pressure on Israel to change its policies toward the Palestinian population.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday that Democratic leaders, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), should admonish Omar and Tlaib, and suggested the situation was worse than the firestorm over the racially charged comments of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).
King over the years has repeatedly targeted immigrants and minorities, and last year met with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties during a trip to Europe. Last month, Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments after he questioned whether white supremacy was offensive.
"We took action on our own side. I think when they stay silent, they are just as guilty," McCarthy said. "I think this will not be the end of this."
Pelosi and Democratic leaders have declined to directly address the conservative backlash to Omar and Tlaib. McCarthy said the GOP would try to force a response.
One GOP option is to seek a vote on a resolution by Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) rejecting "anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred in the United States and around the world." The resolution mentions Omar and Tlaib alongside the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, leaders of the liberal Women's March, as well as the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville and last year's mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.
The accusations of anti-Semitism are rooted in statements and associations that appear less clear-cut than the controversies created by King.
In 2012, Omar said in a tweet that "Israel has hypnotized the world" and referred to "the evil doings of Israel." Under pressure last month, Omar disavowed "the anti-Semitic trope I unknowingly used, which is unfortunate and offensive" but stood by her criticism of Israeli policy.
Tlaib came under fire last month after a Daily Caller report identified a campaign supporter, Maher Abdel-Qader, as having posted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on Facebook - including to a group that included Tlaib. Another campaign ally, Abbas Hamideh, also made comments critical of Israel in social media posts, referring to "Zionist terrorists" and asserting that Israel "does not have a right to exist."
Last month, Tlaib attacked the sponsors of a Senate bill that would undermine the BDS movement by tweeting, "They forgot what country they represent." That prompted criticism from Republicans and a few Democrats, who saw in that comment a frequent anti-Semitic insinuation.
This past week, the Senate approved the bill on a 77-to-23 vote. The legislation divided Democrats, with several presidential candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), opposing the measure.
Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and an ally of the Trump White House, said Republicans are working to "change the center of gravity in the American electorate on the issue of Israel."
"The leftward drift of the grass roots of the Democrat Party, away from wholehearted and robust support of Israel, means you have people in that party who see Israel through the prism of apartheid and occupation," he said. "That's an opportunity for Republicans to say, 'That's not how we see Israel.' "
Some Republicans have pointed to a recent phone call between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the high-profile young leader of her party's hard-left wing, to British lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn, the head of the Labour Party who has come under intense criticism for tolerating anti-Semitism in his ranks.
Both Omar and Tlaib have denounced their critics as attempting to conflate their policy views with hatred and say they themselves have been subject to harassment and physical threats.
"Republican attacks are nothing more than an attempt to discredit my position as a member of Congress and distract from the real hate within their own party - including from the president himself," Omar said in a statement provided before McCarthy spoke Friday.
Tlaib declined an interview Thursday, and a spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. She said in a recent statement to the New York Times that it was "disappointing that some of my colleagues are feeding into the hate and division and mislabeling me to ignite fear."
"I urge those fighting against racism and all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism, to not fall for the rhetoric from right-wing media and elected officials who relentlessly attack communities of color," she said.
One Democratic House aide, who was not authorized to comment publicly on internal strategy, said leaders are uninterested in responding to what they consider to be "trolling." Another aide said Republicans have "extensive exposure" in their ranks.
"Steve King is just the tip of the iceberg," that aide said. "If Mr. McCarthy would like to vote on his members' racist, homophobic and other deeply offensive remarks on a weekly basis, then we suggest he proceed with his plan to target Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib."
Multiple Democratic lawmakers and strategists interviewed over the past week argued that the apparent rift within the party over Israel is overstated, and several said that any changing attitudes had less to do with BDS or Palestinian sympathies and more to do with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's courting of Republican politicians - including Trump - and his clash with former president Barack Obama over his nuclear deal with Iran.
Steve Rabinowitz, a veteran Democratic consultant who worked in the Clinton White House, said Republicans are "having a field day because two Muslim women got elected to Congress, and all of sudden they want to say the sky is falling."
"It's not the end of the world or changing the party's traditional pro-Israel position," Rabinowitz said. "Respectfully, these freshman members aren't leading Democrats on Israel."
But some Democrats have spoken out about repairing the party's increasing skepticism about the U.S.-Israel relationship, such as House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), whose panel includes Omar. And some prominent Democrats last month formed a new political committee, Democratic Majority for Israel, aimed at solidifying the party's support of Israel.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman who pushed for strong pro-Israel planks in the party's recent platforms, said it was the Republican attacks, not the allegations against Omar and Tlaib, that were politicizing the countries' relationship.
"The fact that we have a few outlier members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, who are not supportive in the same way as the overwhelming majority of the Congress . . . does not mean that there has been any erosion of support," she said.

Texto completo: Nearly 40 years ago, when Theodore F. Mariani first saw Oakdale, what struck the architect was not the Colonial Revival details of the historic home, but the mature, majestic trees on the property. Besides native species of black walnut and oak, specimen trees - sweet gum, weeping beech, horse chestnut and great pine - had been planted by a former owner. The Maryland Big Tree Society has identified 10 champion trees on the property.
"I said to myself, 'I can design a great house, but I can't grow a tree,' " said Mariani, who was the lead architect for the Washington Convention Center and for the historic preservation of Pennsylvania Avenue and Federal Triangle. "I was so enthralled by the trees. It's a marvelous natural setting."
The house isn't bad, either. Built by Albert Warfield in 1838 as a large brick Federal-style house, it was enlarged in 1879 and 1891. Warfield's son Edwin, who was born in the house in 1848, added the Colonial Revival details in 1898.
The Warfields are one of the prominent old families of Maryland. Richard Warfield arrived from England in the mid-1600s and became a wealthy planter and an officer in the militia. His descendants included two Maryland governors, Charles Carnan Ridgely and Edwin Warfield, and an infamous duchess, Wallis Warfield Simpson, for whom King Edward VIII abdicated the throne of England.
Edwin Warfield was elected to the state Senate in 1881 and was made president of the Senate in 1886. He resigned to accept an appointment by President Grover Cleveland as surveyor of the port of Baltimore. Warfield was more than a politician. He also bought and edited the Ellicott City Times and the Maryland Law Record (later called the Daily Record). He founded the Patapsco National Bank of Ellicott City and the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland. He was president of the Sons of the American Revolution and of the Maryland Historical Society.
Edwin Warfield, a Democrat, served as Maryland governor from 1904 to 1908. He declined to run for a second term. The New York Times called him "the most versatile Executive who has presided at Annapolis" when he was elected.
Warfield used the house mainly as a summer residence and for entertaining. Wallis Warfield Simpson was said to have attended parties at the home, as was Mark Twain.
"I've heard this story," Mariani said. "The governor was entertaining Mark Twain, and Mark Twain made the comment, 'Who had this land before you acquired it?' And [Warfield] said, 'Before the Warfields, only God and the Indians.' "
Oakdale remained in the Warfield family until 1974. It had one other owner before Mariani bought it in 1981. Previous inhabitants had altered the interior, but Mariani restored the house to its original state as best he could.
"We've tried to maintain as much as possible," Mariani said.
Oakdale remains a working farm with 70 acres of crops. Mariani maintained an equestrian facility for a time, with about 17 horses. Within the past five years, he planted grapevines, with the intention of producing wine.
"The other thing nice about this setting, I put my farm in what is called ag preservation, which means it will never be developed for residential development," he said. "It will stay as a farm. A number of my neighbors have done the same."
Asked what he loves best about Oakdale, Mariani said the "serenity."
"We've enjoyed being out here," he said. "It's quiet. You can sit on the front porch and enjoy the views."
Oakdale, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is listed at $10.3 million. The property includes a 12-bedroom, six-bathroom, 9,500-square-foot main house, a 120-foot colonnade that connects to an 8,870-square-foot entertaining hall, a carriage house, a gardener's cottage, a brick smokehouse, a gazebo near a spring-fed pond, a three-level stable, a barn, a silo and an equipment shed.

Texto completo: Louis C.K. performed the first of six sold-out shows at Side Splitters Comedy Club on Wednesday and received a standing ovation after his hour long set.

There were no protesters, no phones allowed and no jokes involving the Parkland school shooting, though the comedian did allude to the outrage he stirred up with a previous joke on that topic, as well as his own admitted sexual misconduct.

If you want to make people forget that you masturbated in front of someone, tell a joke about some kids that got shot at a school, C.K. said, drawing big laughs. Thats worse. ... They tend to forget the first thing.

C.K.s first show in Tampa in nearly five years comes under wildly different circumstances than when he headlined the Oddball Comedy Festival at the MidFlorida Amphitheatre in 2014.

Then, he was the reigning king of stand-up with a critically beloved FX series. Now, hes attempting to rebuild a career derailed by actions outlined in a New York Times investigation in which five women accused him of sexual misconduct. He admitted their stories were true.

After nine months out of the spotlight, he returned and began playing smaller venues last year, drawing protesters in San Jose, Calif., and New York City.

I used to play arenas, he joked in Tampa to a capacity crowd of about 250, whod paid $30 each for tickets. Lucky for you, Ive had a bad year.

C.K.s comeback has been scrutinized every step of the way, but never so much as in January when audio from a comedy set on Long Island, N.Y., leaked online. That set included a joke complaining that not interesting students whod survived Parkland were testifying in front of Congress. In another joke, he complained about young nonbinary people wanting to be identified by they/them pronouns.

I want to be referred to as there, because I identify as a place, C.K. said in the 2018 recording  a joke and topic

that did not make it into Wednesdays set in Tampa.

To prevent recording at Side Splitters, the audience had to place phones inside locked Yondr pouches before entering the main room. A host repeatedly asked the crowd not to record anything, and off-duty, uniformed police officers stood outside and in the lobby providing security.

For many critics, the crux of the problem with C.K.s new material that surfaced in the leak was that he wasnt talking about what hed learned, or signaling growth, since pledging to now step back and take a long time to listen in the wake of the 2017 scandal.

His defenders have said he deserves a shot at redemption, and that the leaked set was an unfinished product never intended for an audience bigger than the confines of Governors comedy club.

On Wednesday, he talked about the many ways his life had been ruined by his actions, but little about the way he ruined it. He lamented losing a ton of money, then feeling foolish for owning a luxury watch. He complained about having to flee New York for small American backwaters, and later, Paris.

He also said he wanted to offer the crowd some advice from what hed learned.

If you ever ask somebody, Can I [masturbate] in front of you? and they say Yes, you may, just say Are you sure? ... And then if they say yes, just still dont do it.

Outside of that stuff, C.K.s set wouldnt seem out of character pre-scandal. He conjured outrageously vile and unrepeatable scenarios that were presented with seriousness to the point of absurdity. He told self-deprecating jokes about his own health and habits. He talked about his daughters and the blessings of divorce. He wore a rumpled, all-black shirt.

The crowd contained many couples, men and women, and was unremarkable except for how hard they laughed.

Purzycki won over DelState by winning

Texto completo: In January 1981, Delaware was the scene of a historic sports occurrence that rippled out over the next several years.
It was a fascinating episode that mixed athletics with touchy subjects such as fairness, prejudice and race relations.
Best of all, it had a happy ending.
Now the riveting details of that time have been captured in a recently published, hard-to-put-down book, "Mr. Townsend & The Polish Prince."
First State sports fans will be enthralled. This needs to be a movie.
The Polish Prince was Joe Purzycki, who was a 33-year-old University of Delaware defensive backs coach. Mr. Townsend, Delaware State then-College's athletic director Nelson Townsend, decided he should be the next DelState football coach.
DelState, of course, is among this country's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Most, including Delaware State, trace their roots to the 19th century, when African-Americans did not have the same access to education as whites in the United States. HBCU is a proud designation.
But Townsend felt that Purzycki, a white man, was the ideal coach to lead Delaware State from the abyss in which it found itself after a 2-9 1980 season.
This was unprecedented.
The book was written by Mike Gastineau, who was James Madison University's radio play-by-play man when Purzycki coached there from 1985-90. Purzycki had kept a journal detailing his experiences.
The story begins by describing the aftermath of the Hornets' 105-0 loss at Portland State on Nov. 8, 1980. The defeat garnered national, humiliating headlines and a coaching change was imminent.
Townsend decided he might want Purzycki, though an HBCU had never employed a white head football coach and doing so was certain to raise anger.
Purzycki had grown up on the edge of Newark, New Jersey, and followed older brother Mike, now mayor of Wilmington, to the University of Delaware to play football.
Joe was a star defensive back and captained the Blue Hens' 9-2 team as a senior in 1969. He went on to become a successful high school coach in Delaware at Woodbridge (1972-74) and Caesar Rodney (1975-77), where his teams went 33-2 and won the 1975 state title.
Purzycki returned to his alma mater to join coach Tubby Raymond's staff. In one of the book's many amazing details, it described how Purzycki was in his Delaware Field House office when he received a call in January 1981 from Jack Ireland, the longtime News Journal sportswriter who was then based in Dover.
In an odd reversal, Ireland asked Purzycki if their conversation could be off the record, and told him he was calling on behalf of Townsend. The DelState AD had asked Ireland to contact Purzycki to see if he had interest in being his football coach.
"Jack, I'd actually consider it, but they'll never hire a white coach," Purzycki told Ireland.
Purzycki had been a big winner as a high school coach. As a player and assistant coach in one of the nation's top programs at its level – Delaware had won its fifth national championship in NCAA Division II in 1979 – Purzycki could bring that model to Delaware State.
That would be easier said than done. During his first visit with Townsend on the Dover campus, Purzycki saw a weight room that was inferior to what most high schools had and a locker room with no lockers. But a trust and bond developed between the two that would be unbreakable and everlasting.
Purzycki was hired, though the process took longer than expected because of differences of opinions by decision makers.
Ex-NFL player Billy Joe, a former Cheyney coach who was then a Philadelphia Eagles assistant, was also a finalist and became the favorite among players and students.
As he arrived for his introductory press conference, Purzycki learned there had been unrest on campus the night before over the decision.
At a subsequent meeting with his new team, only five players showed up. Seventeen players quit the team immediately.
Those were among many moments in which Purzycki experienced exactly what Townsend had warned him about.
He would learn what it's like to be a minority, and to be judged by the color of his skin rather than his qualifications as a coach, mentor, motivator and role model for young men.
It's the central theme of the story. "The Polish Prince" nickname had actually been pegged to Purzycki by those at "The Hornet," the DelState student newspaper. It was not meant to be flattering.
But Purzycki, with a $300 initial recruiting budget, went to work and began building a football program. The Hornets were significantly more competitive in that first season but still went 2-9, then were 4-7 in 1982, which hardly inspired much on-campus confidence even though the coaches knew they were getting better.
Along the way, Sports Illustrated and The New York Times wrote stories on Delaware State's "courageous step," as Purzycki termed his hiring. The Hornets' daily struggles and minor achievements continued to be daily newspaper fodder in Delaware.
There were frequent injustices handed out by officiating crews, who seemed to have resentments of their own. Purzycki also had to move out of his original meager office after walking in one morning to find a brick on the floor and shattered glass from the window it had come through.
Late in the coach's second season, Townsend suggested to him that, with all the grief the AD was still getting, Purzycki really had to win a bit more to make this hiring appear smart, which he did.
Along the way came the ultimate indignity. On Nov. 6, 1982, the Hornets lost at home to Central State, coached by Billy Joe, 37-31, after blowing a 15-point fourth-quarter lead.
Afterward, Joe was carried off the field in triumph – by several Delaware State employees who'd favored his hiring over Purzycki's.
The Hornets turned the corner with their 7-3-1 1983 and 8-2 1984 seasons, both of which included appearances in the national rankings, which was unthinkable prior to Purzycki's arrival.
In doing so, they performed an even more important trick. By accomplishing so much together, those Hornets, which included some white players, steered the focus away from their racial differences.
"We won all these games in 1983 and after that I never had to address race again," Purzycki said.
In addition to Purzycki and Towsend, the personalities of many familiar sports figures from Delaware come through in the book's rich details, including Bill Collick, Purzycki's defensive coordinator who succeeded him as coach and guided DelState to even more success; offensive coordinator Herky Billings; former DelState president Luna Mishoe; and many players, such as wide receiver John Taylor, who went on to San Francisco 49ers fame that included a game-winning Super Bowl catch.
It was remarkable to read what Taylor, who was mistakenly called "Jake" early in his DelState days, became considering his unheralded background.
After leaving JMU, Purzycki, now 71, returned to Delaware and became a successful banking executive. Townsend was DelState athletic director until leaving for Florida A & M in 1986. He died in 2015.
The memories and insights from Diane Townsend, his widow, describe many moments throughout the book. In fact, a comment from her closes it, and sums up the story perfectly.
"It was sports history in a small little place," she said.
Many of us remember, and this book ensures no one forgets.

BACK STORY; Trump donor faces scrutiny; Prosecutors focus on Imaad Zuberi, who has given to both parties

Texto completo: When federal prosecutors subpoenaed President Trump's inaugural committee Monday, they reportedly showed particular interest in its dealings with one donor: Imaad Zuberi.
Zuberi donated $900,000 to the committee through a company named Avenue Ventures, according to data from Open Secrets. The subpoena requests all communications the committee had with him and the company, multiple news reports said, citing unnamed sources.
Zuberi has been described as a Los Angeles venture capitalist, but he seems much more prominent in politics than in the local tech scene. So who is he? Here's what we know.

--
Big fundraiser
Zuberi was a top fundraiser for President Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, according to data from Open Secrets.
From 1990 to 2017, he was credited with making more than $2 million in political contributions. His recipients have included a slew of Democratic candidates and groups, but they are not exclusively Democrats. Zuberi has also donated to the campaigns of Republican candidates -- including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky and then-Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa -- as well as the Republican National Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee.
In 2017, the New York Times reported that after the $900,000 donation from Avenue Ventures to Trump's inaugural committee, Zuberi was granted attendance to the Chairman's Global Dinner, "a pre-inauguration, black-tie gathering intended to introduce the incoming president to the foreign diplomatic corps."
--
Business ventures
Zuberi's LinkedIn page identifies him as vice chairman of private equity and venture capital firm Avenue Ventures. He has "closed over $15 billion in transactions" at the firm, whose clients include start-ups, major corporations and sovereign wealth funds, the page says.
Avenue Ventures does not appear to have a working website and could not be reached for comment.
Zuberi is also chief executive of South El Monte companies named Avenue Capital Group Inc. and Avenue Investment Services Inc., described on state documents as investment firms. Listed at the same South El Monte address are several other companies where he also serves as CEO: an auto sales firm named Avenue Automotive Group and a handful of real estate investment firms.
Zuberi is also vice president of strategic development for Manhattan Street Capital, a San Diego start-up that provides a platform through which companies can raise funding. Manhattan Street Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
--
Sri Lanka money
As Zuberi raised piles of cash for high-profile Democrats, Foreign Policy magazine reported, Sri Lanka paid $4.5 million to him directly and $2 million to a company he co-owned for consulting work that included influencing the U.S. government. And he didn't properly disclose to the United States the extent of his arrangement with Sri Lanka, the report said.
U.S. law requires paid representatives of foreign governments to disclose those relationships to the Justice Department within 10 days of acquiring such a client. The report said that New York-born Zuberi registered as a foreign agent months after receiving his first payment.
Zuberi did not admit wrongdoing in the report, and he told the magazine that the project wound down "when we realized we weren't going to make any major impact."
There is no evidence that Monday's subpoena is related to that episode.
"Imaad knows nothing about a subpoena, other than what's been written," Zuberi spokesman Steve Rabinowitz told The Times on Monday in a written statement. "It's well known that after supporting President Obama and Hillary Clinton, that Imaad gave generously and directly to the Trump inaugural. But many others gave substantially more. For what it's worth, Imaad, as always, gave only his own money from his own resources. If, in fact, he is named in this subpoena -- never mind somehow named alone -- he is bewildered why."
--
Michael Cohen
In a December article about the extent of attempts by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to monetize his access to Trump by advising major corporations after the 2016 election, the Daily Beast reported that Cohen spoke with Zuberi in 2016 and 2017. Among the topics the two men discussed, the report said, were business opportunities they could take part in together during the Trump presidency.
The Daily Beast also reported that Zuberi was in contact with Elliott Broidy, former Republican National Committee finance chairman, about potential business.
After the article was published, the Daily Beast added a statement from a Zuberi spokesperson who disputed some of the details and said, "Imaad had three brief conversations with Cohen, two of them very brief.... Zuberi also did not talk to Broidy about business until 2018 and nothing came of those conversations, either."
--
Other activities
American Abroad Media, a nonprofit that teams up with media outlets abroad to co-produce programming, has listed Zuberi as a member of its advisory board, although that page of its website was recently removed.
A bio of Zuberi on that page described him as an advisor to the Chinese government on economic affairs and said he also advised "multinational companies on international expansion and growth strategies" and gave counsel to "government entities and senior government officials on economic affairs, commerce and international trade."
The biography also listed extensive involvement in politics. Zuberi was co-chair of the National Finance Committee of Obama-Biden for America, a former member of the board of directors at Organizing for Action, and a former co-chair of Hillary for America National Finance Committee, it said.
It also said he was on the board of Latino Victory Project, a trustee of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and co-chair of super PAC Free & Fair Trade USA.
Zuberi was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army, according to the biography.
A donation from Zuberi made possible the launch of the UCLA Initiative on Security and Religious Freedom to research "solutions to security challenges while preserving civil rights and civil liberties" at UC research universities, the school announced in 2017.
Zuberi's LinkedIn profile says he has a bachelor's degree in finance and business economics and an MBA, both from USC.

Elizabeth Warren's 'American Indian' Claim; She presented herself as a minority except when applying to the Ivy League?

Texto completo: For what reason, other than to gain advantage, does a white lawyer without any recognized tribal affiliation describe her race as "American Indian" on a government document? The latest revelation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren's longtime effort to present herself as Native American highlights just one of several holes remaining in her story. Democrats choosing from an abundance of leftist candidates for their party's 2020 presidential nomination may wonder how many more such revelations they can stand.
In the eighth paragraph of a Tuesday story , the Washington Post reported that it had "obtained Warren's registration card for the State Bar of Texas, providing a previously undisclosed example of Warren identifying as an 'American Indian.'"
The Post's Annie Linskey and Amy Gardner elaborated:
Warren filled out the card by hand in neat blue ink and signed it. Dated April 1986, it is the first document to surface showing Warren making the claim in her own handwriting. Her office didn't dispute its authenticity.
In a follow-up story , the two Post reporters note:
By Wednesday, after the bar registration card was published by The Washington Post, Warren faced new doubts about her viability in the presidential race, as activists and strategists evaluated how much damage the issue might do — especially given Democrats' focus on finding a candidate who can defeat President Trump — and what she might do to move past it.
Liberal activists have long described cultural appropriation as hurtful, since someone is assuming the identity of a group without having faced the suffering or discrimination that group endured. The question is whether Democratic primary voters will punish Warren for actions for which she has apologized.
"This was about 30 years ago," said Warren, when asked Wednesday why she filled out the bar form. She explained that as a girl in Oklahoma she'd learned stories about her family history from her parents and siblings, leading her to believe the family was Native American.
Since releasing a DNA analysis suggesting that she may have no more Native American heritage than the average white person in the U.S.— and perhaps none at all —Ms. Warren has indeed apologized for her previous claims.
But she has continued to insist that she never benefited from these claims of minority status. Tuesday's report from the Post makes it a little harder for Ms. Warren to stick with this story. As for the story she tells about her family history, that was already difficult to sell.
The Post notes:
Warren listed herself as a "minority" in the Association of American Law Schools directory starting in 1986, and presented herself that way in the directory for nine years. That same year, she filled out the bar card, which The Post obtained via an open-records request to the State Bar of Texas.
There's no indication that Warren gained professionally by reporting herself as Native American on the card. Above the lines for race, national origin and handicap status, the card says, "The following information is for statistical purposes only and will not be disclosed to any person or organization without the express written consent of the attorney."
The Texas card—like the initial listing in the directory of law professors—was created just one year before she joined the University of Pennsylvania, which like all such elite schools at that time was under significant pressure to diversify its faculty. Later, she was hired by Harvard's law school just two years after it was sued in part for not having a single Native American on its faculty.
Many of her former Ivy League colleagues say that she received no special help of any kind from either school and was not considered a minority candidate during the hiring process. But if Ms. Warren told both the state bar of Texas and the Association of American Law Schools she was a minority, why wouldn't she initially tell anyone at Penn or Harvard? And why wouldn't they have considered her Native American, if they were on the hunt for minority candidates and she was publicly listed as one? (Some time after her hiring at each school, Penn and Harvard classified her as a minority faculty member.)
As for Warren family history, last year the senator told NBC:
My mother and daddy were born and raised in Oklahoma. My daddy first saw my mother when they were both teenagers. He fell in love with this tall, quiet girl who played the piano. Head over heels. But his family was bitterly opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American.They eventually eloped.
This highly implausible story has recently become even more so. If Native American ancestry was so distant on her mother's side that the senator has never been able to name any native relatives—and even now her own DNA expert cannot rule out the possibility that she has no such relatives at all—how would her father's family have known enough to object? And if they really had heard about the bride's family legend, were they really as bigoted as she says—Oklahomans who would "bitterly" oppose a wedding because it involved someone who may or may not have had an unnamed and unknown native ancestor eight generations earlier?

Texto completo: She came forward and sparked a national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace, more than 25 years before the Me Too movement.
Anita Hill, an attorney and professor of law, social policy and women's studies at Brandeis University, will speak at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 7 in Baker Hall at Lehigh University's Zoellner Arts Center. The free lecture is entitled "From Social Movement to Social Impact: Putting an End to Sexual Harassment in the Workplace."
In 1991, Hill testified at Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, accusing him of sexual harassment while she worked for him as his assistant. After extensive debate, Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court.
More recently Hill weighed in on the confirmation process of now U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who defended himself against accusations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford. Hill wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times.
Hill's talk is being co-sponsored by the Martin Luther King Committee and the Lehigh University Notations Series.
No tickets are required; however, a limited number of tickets for reserved seats are available at zoellnerartscenter.org or by calling the Zoellner box office at 610-758-2787.

Texto completo: Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson is facing accusations that she plagiarized passages of her new book about the media industry.
Vice News correspondent Michael Moynihan on Wednesday evening tweeted a series of passages from Ms. Abramson's new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," which appeared nearly verbatim in previous publications, including the New Yorker and Time Out.
In his tweets, Mr. Moynihan called attention to a passage from the book describing a column by Gavin McInnes, one of the co-founders of Vice, about young liberals. Ms. Abramson's description mirrors a passage from a student publication called the Ryerson Review of Journalism nearly word for word, with slight differences from the structure of the original sentences.
Another of Mr. Moynihan's tweets cited a passage from Ms. Abramson's book describing former Vice executive Jason Mojica that reads almost exactly the same as an article from Time Out.
The Wall Street Journal reviewed the passages in question and confirmed their similarity.
Ms. Abramson didn't credit either publication in the text of her book, though the manuscript contains extensive footnotes. Some of the pieces that Mr. Moynihan alluded to, including the New Yorker's, were mentioned at some point in the book footnotes but the footnotes didn't directly refer to the passages in question.
In an interview on Fox News Wednesday, Ms. Abramson stood by her work, telling "The Story" host Martha MacCallum that she "certainly didn't plagiarize."
"All I can tell you is, I certainly didn't plagiarize in my book," Ms. Abramson said. "There are 70 pages of footnotes showing where I got the information."
Asked whether she thought it was "a footnote issue," Ms. Abramson said she didn't think it was "an issue at all."
Fox News parent 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.
Later Wednesday, Ms. Abramson said on Twitter that she would "take seriously the issues raised," and "review the passages in question." She added that criticism from some at Vice reflects "their unhappiness with what I consider a balanced portrayal."
Ms. Abramson didn't respond to a request for comment for this article.
Ms. Abramson's book, which scrutinizes the business models of the New York Times, Washington Post, BuzzFeed and Vice Media, has landed in a media industry riven by turmoil.
Ms. Abramson was executive editor at the New York Times from 2011 to 2014. Her tenure ended when she was ousted from the newspaper by then-Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. Earlier in her career, Ms. Abramson was an editor at the Journal.

Maine proposal would change rules for lobster fishermen training A proposal in Maine would allow new lobster fishermen to complete their apprenticeships by demonstrating proficiency as opposed to by logging hours. The proposal from Representative Billy Bob Faulkingham, a Winter Harbor Republican, would allow an apprentice to complete the program by bringing at least 4,000 pounds of lobster to the shore over a period of not less than two years. Faulkingham is a lobsterman himself, and says he believes a productivity-based system would be a more accurate gauge of proficiency than a system based on logging time. The apprenticeships are necessary to eventually obtain a commercial fishing license for lobster. The proposal is set for a public hearing before the marine resources committee, on which Faulkingham sits, on Feb. 12. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIDE HAILING
Taxi drivers in Madrid abandon strike Taxi drivers in Madrid have ended a 16-day strike after failing to force authorities in the Spanish capital to impose tighter restrictions on ride-hailing companies like Uber and Cabify. Fifty-three percent of over 7,000 taxi drivers who voted Tuesday backed calling off the strike, according to the professional association of taxi drivers Elite Taxi. The taxi sector had wanted Madrid's regional government to take similar action to authorities in Spain's second-largest city, Barcelona, where a taxi strike resulted in new regulations requiring users of ride-hailing apps to contract services 15 minutes beforehand. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Volvo recalling more than 160,000 cars because of faulty latch on electric trunks Swedish automaker Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely holding company, says it is recalling 167,000 cars worldwide because the hatch lid lift system on electric trunks can loosen, stop working in cold weather, and possibly cause damage. Group spokeswoman Annika Bjerstaf says the recall is "a preventive safety measure," adding Volvo Cars "has not received any reports of serious incidents surrounding this." Bjerstaf said Wednesday the recall covers the Volvo XC 60 built in 2018 and 2019. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Lyft passengers will be able to request electric or hybrid vehicles Lyft passengers will soon be able to request a ride in an electric or hybrid vehicle when they're planning a trip. The ride-hailing company is launching the feature first in Seattle and then in other cities. The option will show up when passengers are choosing between available Lyft vehicles and it will not cost more for riders than traveling in a car with an internal combustion engine. Lyft is also rolling out electric vehicles in Seattle and Atlanta in the fleet of cars that it rents to Lyft drivers who don't own their own vehicles. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

New York Times wants 10 million subscribers by 2025 The New York Times Co. generated more than $709 million in digital revenue last year, growing at a pace that suggests it will meet its stated goal of $800 million in digital sales by the end of 2020. The results prompted the company to set another lofty target: to grow its subscription business to more than 10 million subscriptions by 2025, Mark Thompson, the chief executive, said in a statement announcing the company's fourth-quarter financial results. More than 3.3 million people pay for the company's digital products, including its news, crossword, and food apps, a 27 percent jump from 2017. The total number of paid subscriptions for digital and print reached 4.3 million, a high. The company added 265,000 digital subscribers in the fourth quarter, the biggest jump since the so-called Trump bump after the 2016 election. Its stock rose 10.3 percent Wednesday. — NEW YORK TIMES

CFPB to loosen rules governing payday lenders The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday proposed drastically weakening Obama-era rules governing payday lenders, boosting the fortunes of an industry accused of keeping low-income borrowers trapped in a cycle of debt. Under the existing rule, which is set to go into effect in August, payday lenders are required to verify borrowers can afford the loans they are being offered. The proposal would rescind that requirement and delay the rule's implementation until 2020. The proposal is a significant win for payday lenders. The industry worried the original rule would force most payday lenders to close their doors and sued to block its enforcement. Short-term, high-interest loans should be regulated but the Obama-era rules are too cumbersome and costly, they say. — WASHINGTON POST

Texto completo: Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.
As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as "regulators" of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.
The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.
But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.
We can start with the fact that "free" isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on "free." Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?
The tech giants are also run as "walled gardens" that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.
Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading "news" that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly.
A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.
David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: "Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption."
Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.
Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.
David Chavern is president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing news publishers in the United States and Canada. This is an edited version of a column that first appeared in The New York Times.

Don’t make ‘Medicare for all’ a litmus test

Texto completo: Hear that crunching sound? It’s the eggshells that 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are stomping through, backing up and stomping upon all over again, as they attempt to satisfy the base’s delicate demands for Medicare-for-all.
The left-wing die-hards sometimes argue that supporting Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for anyone seeking the 2020 nomination because it’s not only good policy but good politics, too. The entrenched establishment may claim it’s a "radical" idea, but surveys suggest it is mainstream.
"If I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, told The New York Times, "I think I’d be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want."
In a sense, Sanders is right: The phrase "Medicare-for-all" polls favorably (though not always at 70 percent), and has for several years.
Here’s the problem. The things Americans are apparently envisioning when they tell pollsters they support Medicare-for-all turn out to be a different, vaguer and more varied set of ideas than the specific thing that Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and others in the progressive base are proposing. Sanders, et al. want all Americans enrolled in a single, generous, government-run — or single-payer — plan with no private insurers offering their own similar, competing policies.
How does the public feel about this? If you simply ask, "Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all?," 56 percent of respondents favor it, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But mention that Medicare-for-all involves getting rid of private insurance companies, and support plummets to 37 percent.
Wary of provoking the single-payer-or-bust-ers, some Democratic 2020 candidates have given incoherent or noncommittal remarks on the subject. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachussetts, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York have both sidestepped the issue. Asked about private insurance, Warren said last week there were a lot of paths to get to "affordable health care for every American."
And you know what? That’s the right answer right now. The thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn’t leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids’ insulin. In that same Kaiser survey, support for "Medicare for All" was highest — 71 percent — when respondents were told it would "guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans." And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. Rather than insisting that "there’s no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care," as one progressive writer put it, Democrats should start with principles and objectives, and figure out the most effective and feasible route to them.
This is the richest country on Earth. Truly, we can figure this out. But not if we let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved a Middle East policy bill on Tuesday that included both a rebuke to President Trump over his withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan and a contested measure to allow state and municipal governments to punish companies that boycott, divest from or place sanctions on Israel.
The measure, which passed 77 to 23, started as the kind of routine policy bill that passes the Senate with little to no opposition. It reauthorizes at least $3.3 billion in military financing to Israel and extends security aid to Jordan, imposes new sanctions on individuals who provide support to the Syrian government and directs the Treasury Department to determine whether the Central Bank of Syria is engaged in money laundering.
"This represents the broad consensus of this body about our nation's responsibilities as an ally and a partner," Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Tuesday.
But the late inclusions of the anti-boycott, divest and sanction -- or anti-B.D.S. -- provision and an amendment by Mr. McConnell reproaching the president for a "precipitous withdrawal" of troops from Syria and Afghanistan raised some concerns in both parties.
The measure opposing the Israel boycott, drafted by Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, appeared to be calculated, in part, to drive a wedge between Israel supporters in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party and a younger, activist wing more willing to challenge unconditional American support of the Jewish state.
Senate Democrats mulling presidential runs recoiled at the McConnell amendment, making a rare alliance with Mr. Trump as they declared it was time for American troops to come home from Afghanistan, the longest war in the nation's history.
Both pieces of legislation face dim prospects in the House. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 Democrat, told reporters last month that leadership would not "allow the Senate Republicans to move legislation forward that really is a political stunt." House Democrats are expected to pass the components addressing Jordan and security assistance to Israel, as they did last Congress, and the House has already passed the Syria provisions.
Republicans overwhelmingly backed Mr. Rubio's bill, reigniting a fracas over political support for the B.D.S. movement, which seeks to pressure Israel into ending the occupation of the West Bank, among other things. A cluster of Democratic lawmakers, including Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Somali refugee; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the first Palestinian-American woman in the House; and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have emerged as vocal critics of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and Republicans have sought to tar the party with their beliefs.
"It is designed to see that the B.D.S. is tamped down and is not appropriate to use against our friend, Israel," said Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Some senators, including Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, refused to support the bill, citing concerns raised by activist groups that the provision was an unconstitutional stifling of their right to protest.
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone Republican opposing the bill, delivered an impassioned denunciation on Tuesday. "The founding fathers would roll over in their graves if they knew what we were doing today," he said, adding that the Boston Tea Party was political speech in the form of a boycott.
"Free speech, the First Amendment, is about allowing language you don't like," Mr. Paul said. "It's about allowing boycotts you may not like."
The American Civil Liberties Union also upbraided the legislation, saying in a statement that "the Senate chose politics over the Constitution and trampled on the First Amendment rights of all Americans."
Mr. Rubio swiftly pushed back.
"While the First Amendment protects the right of individuals to free speech, it does not protect the right of entities to engage in discriminatory conduct," he wrote in an Op-Ed in The New York Times. "Moreover, state governments have the right to set contracting and investment policies, including policies that exclude companies engaged in discriminatory commercial- or investment-related conduct targeting Israel."
Most senators considering a presidential run voted against the legislation, including Mr. Sanders and Mr. Brown as well as Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado voted for it.
Those senators also voted last week to shield the president from the rebuke sponsored by Mr. McConnell after his abrupt decision, announced on Twitter, to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Further stoking concerns about the administration's strategy in the Middle East, General Joseph L. Votel, the commander of the United States Central Command, testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that he was not consulted before Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal on Twitter and "was not aware of the specifics of the announcement."
But a number of Democratic senators have maintained that Mr. Trump made the correct decision to remove troops from seemingly intractable battles.
"The American people do not want endless war," Mr. Sanders said in a statement. "It is the job of Congress to responsibly end these military interventions and bring our troops home, not to come up with more reasons to continue them, as this amendment does."
Senate Republicans were more than happy to sign onto the rebuke, and advanced the amendment on Monday, 70 to 26, the second time in three months the Republican-led chamber sought to put Mr. Trump's foreign policy on notice. The Senate voted in December to end American military assistance for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, after the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

With economic boasts and a border battle cry, Trump frames 2020 argument

Texto completo: President Trump opened an argument for reelection on Tuesday, using the annual State of the Union address to embrace the same two-track message he believes won him the White House in 2016.
Trump simultaneously argued that the country is enjoying unrivaled success under his presidency and that American lives and livelihoods are under attack from an "onslaught" of illegal immigration.
Trump reprised a midterm stump speech staple - his economic statistics hit parade - with a special nod to working-class Americans who were a crucial part of his 2016 winning coalition and whose loyalty he needs again.
"In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom - a boom that has rarely been seen before," Trump said. "We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs - something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
"After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, and America is again winning each and every day. Members of Congress: The State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant, and our economy is thriving like never before."
Trump's argument for 2020 was obvious, as Trump listed accomplishments and some Republican members of Congress chanted "USA!" in campaign-rally style.
"That sounds so good," Trump said in one of his few ad-libs. Otherwise, Trump largely stuck to the script.
Trump's only reference to the special counsel investigation and expected wave of investigations launched by the new Democratic majority in the House - seen as a potential threat to his reelection - came almost as an aside.
"An economic miracle is taking place in the United States - and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations," Trump said to applause from Republicans.
Trump is expected to begin campaigning in earnest by midyear, but his campaign has not announced specifics.
He is expected to return to the same nativist themes of fear of "criminal illegal aliens" and economic usurpation in 2020.
"No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration," Trump said. "Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration - reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
Trump pledged anew to build a wall on the southern border - an unmet promise from 2016.
"I will get it built," Trump said.
The speech veered between calls for unity and bipartisan cooperation and Republican red meat on abortion, immigration, taxes, deregulation and anti-communism.
He took a sidelong slap at Democrats - whom he often accuses of encouraging socialism - as he cheered the challenge to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
"We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom," Trump said.
"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country," Trump said. "America was founded on liberty and independence - not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
That brought Republicans and some Democrats to their feet, though not the liberal Democrats Trump probably had in mind.
Earlier Tuesday, as his aides were previewing what they called a "unifying" State of the Union address focused on "comity," Trump trashed Democrats, including at least one potential 2020 competitor, at a lunch with television news anchors.
Trump ridiculed former vice president Joe Biden, considered a likely candidate, as "dumb" for his history of gaffes, according to an attendee and a person briefed on the discussion. Trump said he hoped to run against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) but mockingly said, "I hope I haven't wounded Pocahontas too badly," a reference to his attacks on the senator for her claims of Native American heritage.
But Trump praised freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a frequent target of conservative outrage. The president claimed that he was among the first to spot her political talent and said he had predicted she would defeat longtime Rep. Joseph Crowley in a primary upset last year. Trump said he knew Ocasio-Cortez had "it," meaning star power, according to the attendee and the person briefed on the discussion, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door session.
The New York Times was first to report some of Trump's comments at the lunch.
"Biden was never very smart," Trump said, according to the Times and confirmed by The Washington Post. "He was a terrible student. His gaffes are unbelievable. When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it's on purpose; it's not a gaffe. When Biden says something dumb, it's because he's dumb."
Tuesday's speech was delayed a week by a partial government shutdown that was a low point for Trump's two-year tenure.
Some of the president's political advisers have seen the beginning of the year as a political loser. Mired in conflict over a border wall and the 35-day shutdown, the president's ratings have plunged while Democrats and the president's potential legal problems seized headlines.
The speech could be something of a "restart," according to a senior administration official. "What his polls are now don't matter," said one outside adviser. They and others close to Trump spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Current and former White House officials say the speech is important because it attracts a different audience and is seen as a measure of a president's command of the office.
But many people close to Trump see the State of the Union as largely irrelevant. His campaign will not resemble the speech at all, these advisers said. He has no desire to strike a similar pacific tone on the road, preferring rambunctious, way-off-the-Teleprompter ad-libs that his most loyal supporters love.
Trump embraced a diplomatic tone in his speech, largely because it gets him positive news coverage, according to current and former aides. He has marveled at what he considered unusually positive coverage for his first State of the Union address last year, these people said.
He has discussed several of his foreign policy moves as helpful in 2020 - while Republicans in Washington see some of his Middle East moves as erratic, the president has argued that the American people don't like any of the "endless wars." He also has argued to advisers that his moves in Venezuela are likely to help his 2020 campaign.
But the president continues to tell advisers that he wants to make his 2020 campaign a strident referendum on immigration - seeing it as the issue that won him the presidency. And he is still considering a national emergency or other executive action to build the border wall.
The president has kept careful tabs on the 2020 field and has said he is most impressed by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.).
On Monday, the Republican National Committee promised donors their names would be "proudly displayed LIVE during the President's State of the Union Address." The email and text solicitations for small-dollar political contributions did not say where donor names would be displayed.
As Trump's political campaign did last year, names of supporters scrolled across the bottom of a live stream of the speech on the campaign website.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Veterans who have to travel long distances to reach a VA doctor may have more options later this year, when updated rules are expected to take effect changing when veterans can seek treatment at a private health care facility.
The new requirements are the result of legislation signed last year, and an ongoing effort to shore up an agency that has been overwhelmed by the number of veterans needing care.
Here's what's known so far about the upcoming changes, the history behind them, and where Lehigh Valley veterans can go within the VA system to access health care:
What will change from rules on accessing private care?
Under current law, veterans can use a private health care provider if they must travel at least 40 miles to a VA clinic or if they face a wait of 30 days or more for an appointment at their closest VA facility.
Under the new guidelines, veterans who can prove they must drive at least 30 minutes to a VA facility - or face a wait of 20 days for an appointment - will be allowed to seek care outside the system.
Morning Call columnist Paul Muschick has noted that the mileage requirement locks out most local veterans. While the veterans medical center in Wilkes-Barre is more than 40 miles away, there are clinics in Allentown and near Bangor.
The changes are expected to allow between 20 and 30 percent of the 7 million veterans treated annually to be eligible for private care, according to the New York Times. That's up from roughly 8 percent now.
What's behind the rule changes?
The Department of Veterans Affairs faced a scandal in 2014 when hidden waiting lists for doctor's appointments became public. Since then, federal officials have sought to improve the system, implementing among those changes the VA Choice program that set up the mileage and wait-time system for seeking private care.
In a 2017 visit to Allentown with then Congressman Charlie Dent, former VA Secretary David Shulkin said the agency was planning to loosen those mileage and time requirements.
"This is really an important direction the VA is moving in, which is recognizing that VA needs to be a strong system but it can't do it alone," Shulkin said.
What other changes have been made?
VA officials last year cleared the way for more veterans to receive treatment through telemedicine, allowing health professionals in one state to consult or treat veterans in another state online. VA physicians and staff can provide telehealth care to veterans in their homes, assuming the veteran has the necessary technology.
What's the response to the latest changes?
Some veterans groups have been lukewarm on the change, while others say they are waiting to assess the policy.
"Twenty days is just as arbitrary as 30 days," Bob Wallace, the executive director of Veterans of Foreign Wars, one of the largest veterans service organizations, said in a statement to Talking Points Memo.
Which VA facilities are closest to the Lehigh Valley?
There are full-scale medical centers in:
* Wilkes-Barre - 1111 East End Blvd., Wilkes-Barre, PA 18711
* Coatesville - 1400 Blackhorse Hill Rd., Coatesville, PA 19320
* Lebanon - 1700 South Lincoln Ave., Lebanon, PA 17042
* Philadelphia - 3900 Woodland Ave., Philadelphia , PA 19104
The VA also has outpatient clinics in:
* Allentown - 3110 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18103
* Bangor - 701 Slate Belt Blvd., Bangor, PA 18013
* Pottsville - 1410 Laurel Blvd., Suite 2, Pottsville, PA 17901
* Wyomissing - 2762 Century Blvd., Wyomissing, PA 19610
* Tobyhanna - Tobyhanna Army Depot, Building 220, Tobyhanna, PA 18466

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Leading congressional Republicans demanded Monday that an internal government watchdog who had issued a critical report related to President Donald Trump's luxury hotel in Washington produce reams of documents to support her conclusions.
The letter, to the General Services Administration's inspector general, was a clear signal that Trump's allies in Congress plan to aggressively defend his business dealings as his company comes under increasing scrutiny by House Democrats and others.
The letter was penned by Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee.
It centered on a Jan. 16 report by inspector general Carol Ochoa criticizing the government's decision-making that allowed Trump to keep the lease on the Trump International Hotel downtown, which is in a building owned by the GSA.
The report charged that the GSA "ignored" concerns that Trump's lease of a government-owned building might violate the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars presidents from taking payments from foreign governments or individual U.S. states.
Johnson and Jordan suggested that Ochoa's office may have overstepped its bounds by studying whether the government had ignored the Constitution in reviewing Trump's lease.
They also questioned why Ochoa's office failed to cite Justice Department arguments on the matter.
Iraqi president hits back at Trump over U.S. army presence
BAGHDAD - Iraq's president hit back at Donald Trump on Monday for saying U.S. troops should stay in Iraq to keep an eye on neighboring Iran, saying the U.S. leader did not ask for Iraq's permission to do so.
"We find these comments strange," said Barham Salih, speaking at a forum in Baghdad.
Trump has angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by arguing he would keep U.S. troops in Iraq and use it as a base to strike Islamic State group targets inside Syria as needed.
In an interview with CBS News' "Face the Nation," he said U.S. troops in Iraq were also needed to monitor Iran.
"He didn't ask Iraq about this," Salih said Monday. He said the Iraqi Constitution forbids the use of Iraq as a base to threaten the interests or security of neighboring countries.
Afghan government frozen out of peace talks with the Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - Taliban representatives and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's political rivals plan to discuss the future of Afghanistan on Tuesday in Moscow, a move seen by some as a further blow to the authority of the country's current administration.
The two-day meeting brings key Afghan power brokers together with the insurgents to discuss ending the war that began in late 2001.
The Moscow talks follow a series of direct negotiations between Taliban members and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad amid a renewed push by President Donald Trump to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.
Ghani's government was excluded from all of those meetings because of the Taliban's objection to an administration it regards as a U.S. puppet.
U.S. calls for repatriation of foreign fighters held in Syria
BEIRUT - The United States on Monday called on other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens who traveled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State group and who are now being held by Washington's partners in the region.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces say they have detained more than 900 foreign fighters during their U.S.-backed campaign against the Islamic State group in northeastern Syria, where they are currently battling the extremists.
The question of what to do with the detained foreigners has grown increasingly thorny since President Donald Trump's surprise announcement in December that he intends to withdraw all American forces from the country.
Very few countries have expressed readiness to repatriate their citizens.
Prosecutors subpoena Trump inaugural papers
NEW YORK - Federal prosecutors in New York have issued a subpoena seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee.
A spokeswoman says the committee intends to cooperate with the inquiry and was reviewing it.
The Wall Street Journal reported last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether inaugural committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors.
The newspaper said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent money it raised to stage inaugural events.
The New York Times reported recently that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee.
Judge: Victims of shooting at church can sue gun retailer
SAN ANTONIO - A judge has ruled that victims of a mass shooting at a Texas church can move forward with a lawsuit against a sporting goods chain where the gunman bought the weapon and ammunition used in the massacre.
The decision Monday by state District Judge Karen Pozza clears the way for families of the 2017 Sutherland Springs shooting to potentially bring their case against Academy Sport & Outdoors before a jury.
The retailer is where gunman Devin Kelley bought an assault-style rifle used in the church shooting that killed more than two dozen people.
Some families have also separately sued the U.S. Air Force over failing to report Kelley's past crimes to a federal database. Kelley was an Air Force veteran who was discharged in 2014 for bad conduct.
Nomination: President Donald Trump says he's nominating a Washington veteran with lobbying ties to U.S. energy companies to lead the Interior Department.
David Bernhardt, currently Interior's acting head, would replace Ryan Zinke - who resigned in December - if the Senate approves his nomination.
Manfort sentencing: Paul Manafort has a new sentencing date. A federal judge Monday set a March 13 sentencing for the former Trump campaign chairman on two felony charges stemming from witness tampering and crimes related to his Ukrainian work. Manafort faces up to five years in prison on each charge.
Caption: Investigators enter a home in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Monday, a day after a piece of airplane wreckage pierced the roof. A small plane broke apart Sunday, raining debris and igniting a fire in a separate house that killed four people inside. The pilot also died.

Tear Down That (Pay) Wall: Fee for Court Records Sparks Outcry

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The federal judiciary has built an imposing pay wall around its court filings, charging a preposterous 10 cents a page for electronic access to what are meant to be public records. A pending lawsuit could help tear that wall down.
The costs of storing and transmitting data have plunged, approaching zero. By one estimate, the actual cost of retrieving court documents, including secure storage, is about one half of one ten-thousandth of a penny per page. But the federal judiciary charges a dime a page to use its service, called Pacer (for Public Access to Court Electronic Records).
The National Veterans Legal Services Program and two other nonprofit groups filed a class action in 2016 seeking to recover what they said were systemic overcharges. "Excessive Pacer fees inhibit public understanding of the courts and thwart equal access to justice, erecting a financial barrier that many ordinary citizens are unable to clear," they wrote.
The suit accuses the judicial system of using the fees it charges as a kind of slush fund, spending the money to buy flat-screen televisions for jurors, to finance a study of the Mississippi court system and to send notices in bankruptcy proceedings.
A 2002 law allows -- but does not require -- the judicial system to charge for access to the records, but "only to the extent necessary" to pay for "services rendered." The judicial system says the law allows it to charge the current fees and to spend the proceeds on a variety of programs. People seeking free access, the judicial system's brief said, can visit the courthouse.
Last year, Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the Federal District Court in Washington accepted the challengers' basic theory and said the judicial system had misused some of the money.
The case is now on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the challengers have attracted an impressive array of supporting briefs from retired judges, news organizations, civil rights groups and a sponsor of the 2002 law.
Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, who served on the Federal District Court in Manhattan from 1994 to 2016 and signed a supporting brief, said the issue was straightforward.
"There should be full public access to court records," she said. "It's an infinitesimal amount of money when you look at the total budget for the court system."
The federal judiciary's budget is about $7 billion. Fees from Pacer generated about $145 million in recent years, or about 2 percent of the total.
Judge Scheindlin said Pacer fees were particularly harmful to litigants who represent themselves, to academic researchers who want to explore systemic issues like sentencing disparities and to journalists at smaller news outlets.
There is one shining exception to the federal judiciary's hostility to free electronic access to its records. In late 2017, the Supreme Court started its own electronic filing system, making virtually all documents filed with the court available online at no cost.
"The Supreme Court's system is terrific, and it's a model for how courts can do this," said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer for the groups challenging the Pacer fees. "It demonstrates that there isn't any practical obstacle to making filings available for free."
Pacer does make some exceptions to its 10-cents-a-page charges. Judicial opinions are free. For other documents, there is a $3 cap. People whose fees are less than $15 in a quarterly billing cycle are charged nothing.
Courts also have some discretion to waive the fees. Curiously, they are generally prohibited from exempting "members of the media."
That policy is bad for democracy, said a brief filed on behalf of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 27 news media groups, including The New York Times. "As news outlets across the country face leaner budgets," the brief said, "few can readily afford daunting fees for court records, especially independent journalists and community news media companies."
As a practical matter, Pacer has created a two-tier system, lawyers for former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who sponsored the 2002 law, wrote in a supporting brief. "Whether an individual is able to access these critical documents will often turn on their financial circumstances," the brief said. "That is at odds with the principle that all Americans should have equal access to the courts and to the documents that are essential to understanding the operation of our government."
The pending lawsuit makes a relatively modest argument, saying that the judicial system has charged more than the 2002 law allowed. But there is a larger point here, one grounded in the First Amendment.
"Public scrutiny of judicial proceedings enhances their quality, ensures their fairness and safeguards their integrity," a supporting brief from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups said.
The public has a right to know what goes on in its courthouses. Exercising that right should not require paying the government a dime a page or anything at all.
"Federal courts need to be providing this access without charge," said Stephen W. Smith, who was until recently a federal magistrate judge in Houston and who signed a supporting brief. "There are too many downsides to creating these barriers. If you don't give effective access to these records, it undermines courts' legitimacy."

Giant Strides Made in World Health, but Roadblocks Remain

Texto completo: In so many domains, life is improving across the world.
It doesn't always feel that way. In surveys, Americans overwhelmingly believe that world poverty is getting worse or staying the same (it's getting much better). And they tend to underestimate, by a wide margin, the percentages of children in the developing world who are receiving vaccines.
Public health campaigns have been a big reason for major improvements, but urgent priorities remain.
Big challenges, and successes
The biggest area of need is probably in infectious disease prevention and treatment.
Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said we need to focus on respiratory diseases.
"Childhood pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in under-5 children and kills more kids than malaria and diarrhea combined," she said. In 2016, the disease killed an estimated 880,000 children, most under age 2, deaths that could have been prevented with vaccination or antibiotics.
But there has been progress in the fight against some other major killers.
Ashish Jha, a physician with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said there have been major drops in the mortality of children under 5 (down more than 50 percent in the last three decades), and he pointed to other encouraging advancements:
■ the halving of deaths of women at childbirth
■ significant decreases in death from malaria
■ a turnaround in the H.I.V. epidemic
■ increased life expectancy in every country
Funding science research has led to new therapies, and global funding programs like Pepfar in the United States have made those medicines widely available, Dr. Jha said. Pepfar, begun under the administration of George W. Bush to combat the H.I.V. epidemic, says it has saved more than 16 million lives, primarily in Africa.
Establishing regional organizations to respond to outbreaks is also important, "as the 2014 to 2015 West African Ebola epidemic taught us," said Peter Piot, a physician and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
The introduction of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017 "marks an important step toward strengthening capacity and preparedness across the continent," he said.
Some investments may not even seem to focus on health. Dr. Jha singled out girls' education as the thing he'd invest in first. "Beyond its big effects on economic prosperity, it also leads to smaller family sizes, lower infant mortality, more stable families and communities, and likely lower levels of disease burdens like H.I.V."
Improving health care systems can be crucial. Shoddy ones can actually cause harm -- never mind failing to heal the sick. A 2012 study in Health Affairs showed that in rural areas of India, two-thirds of health professionals had no medical qualifications whatsoever. Incorrect diagnoses and treatments were more common than correct ones.
The downsides of Western ways
In some cases, the West may be hurting, not helping, the health of developing nations.
Dr. Piot said sustained action was needed "to tackle growing epidemics of obesity and diabetes."
The New York Times reported on a practice, with roots in the West, in which nutritionists in developing countries take money from food giants. These international food companies have formed some alliances with scientists and government officials. In some of these countries, obesity is now common as American-style eating habits gain popularity.
Nearly all the experts we talked to agreed that cigarette smoking was a major problem. Dr. Piot said, "We need an all-out effort against smoking."
In the United States, rates of cigarette smoking recently have fallen to a record low. But as smoking rates have declined in many Western nations, some companies have sought to maintain access to fast-growing markets in developing countries by working to limit antismoking laws, as The Times has reported.
As in the United States, antibiotic overuse and abuse cause problems in the developing world. Dr. Sridhar said, "Here public health investment does not necessarily mean health system investment -- it also means investment in regulating agricultural (and food production systems) and effluents from pharma factories."
How wealthy countries can help the most
Some months ago, we illustrated that while public health has phenomenal returns on investment in the United States, America puts relatively few dollars into it. We then asked experts about the biggest remaining U.S. priorities. (Readers chimed in, too).
Developing nations have differing needs. Poverty is obviously linked to the politics of those nations -- whether they have democratic and stable institutions. Beyond supporting those institutions, what else can the West do to help?
Dr. Jha said we could assist in funding the development of drugs and diagnostic tests for diseases threatening poorer countries to a greater extent than wealthier ones, such as tuberculosis. He said helping fund the expansion of health care workers was another worthy priority: "Most developing countries have few public health officials and no programs to train them."
Dr. Sridhar concurred. "First, fund and invest in research and development of neglected diseases and conditions in order to develop better diagnostics, vaccines and treatments." She went further: "We need to continue to support institutions like the World Health Organization and the Global Fund to fight H.I.V./AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
She added one more item: "To manage the threat of drug-resistant infections which is already a major problem in poor countries, lobby all governments to adopt a binding United Nations agreement to regulate the use of antibiotics in humans, agriculture and the environment, particularly middle-income countries." Such an action, of course, would help nations across the board.
A sense of hopelessness can sometimes weaken efforts to help the poor. The giant strides that have been made in recent years show things are far from hopeless, and point the way toward the possibility of more progress.

Texto completo: It is a futilely human failing to try to find some larger pattern in the groupings of deaths in the obituaries. But I could not help being struck by the juxtaposition of three men — all in their 90s — who died within three days of each other recently.
There is no obvious linkage among them (a former senator, a retired newspaper columnist and a leading sociologist) other than public lives of sufficient prominence to warrant major obits. But taken together, their careers serve as a reminder of some of the democratic values of the late 20th century that have badly eroded in this era of vitriol and venom.
Democrat Harris Wofford, who died at 92, electrified American politics by handily winning a 1991 special election to the Senate from Pennsylvania. Not only did his victorious campaign bring national health insurance to the center of the Democratic agenda, but it also brought Wofford’s two consultants, James Carville and Paul Begala, to the center of Bill Clinton’s agenda.
Wofford’s three years in the Senate (he was defeated in the 1994 Clinton rout) were only a small part of his remarkable career arc as a civil rights crusader, one of the last surviving JFK White House aides, university president and the first director of the AmeriCorps.
Russell Baker, 93, came of age on the police beat at The Baltimore Sun in late 1940s. He covered the Senate and the White House for The New York Times and then chucked these prestigious D.C. beats to gently mock the powerful with witty essays in a Pulitzer Prize-winning Times column for 36 years.
Nathan Glazer was, at 95, one of the last of the great midcentury sociologists. As James Traub memorably described Glazer during the 1990s, “He is the most modest (and the least tendentious) of the brilliant Jewish boys who attended City College 60 years ago and later came to be known collectively as the New York Intellectuals.”
These three men were never the loudest voices of their era. And their public careers seem at odds with the pay-attention-to-me ethos of our era. But when they wrote or spoke, their words had weight and significance.
To give the most dramatic example, Wofford came up with the idea for the most symbolically significant telephone call in modern American political history.
On the eve of the 1960 presidential election, Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested in Atlanta and then moved to a remote Georgia county jail, triggering fears for his life. Wofford, then a Kennedy campaign aide, had the inspiration that JFK should call Coretta Scott King to offer his support.
In the context of the era, with Republican nominee Richard Nixon petrified to do anything that might antagonize segregationist voters, such a phone call would qualify as a bold move.
As Wofford tells it in his 1980 memoir, “Of Kennedys and Kings,” he arranged for Kennedy’s brother-in-law Sargent Shriver to make the pitch to JFK when there were no nervous, naysaying campaign aides in the room. Choosing his moment just before the candidate was to board his campaign plane at O’Hare Airport, Shriver quickly convinced Kennedy.
The publicity from Kennedy’s phone call not only helped secure the release of the civil rights leader, but also triggered the national movement of black voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. As Kennedy said afterwards, “The finest strategies are usually the result of accidents.”
When I was growing up in the 1960s, Baker served as a journalistic role model for me. His Times column simultaneously offered humor and serious commentary.
A typical example of Baker’s stylish commentary came when he compared one of Henry Kissinger’s doorstop memoirs to Edward Gibbon’s classic, “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.” As Baker noted, “Checking my edition, I find that Gibbon covered more than 1,000 years of territory in 1,170 pages, or 113 fewer pages than it takes Kissinger to cover a year and a half.”
Along with Theodore White (“The Making of the President 1960”), Baker earlier helped launch the transformation of political journalism from uninflected stenography to well-written analysis. Covering the 1960 convention that anointed Kennedy for the sober Times, Baker wrote unconventional ledes like this one: “There is always a threat of Gotterdaemmerung in the air when the Democrats get down to the business of nominating a candidate. Today was no exception.”
Nathan Glazer never served in government, although his classic study of the enduring power of ethnicity, “Beyond the Melting Pot,” was written with Pat Moynihan, a future senator, as his junior co-author.
Even though Glazer was often linked to the vocal former liberals who embraced Reaganism as neoconservatives, he was not that kind of partisan warrior. As Barry Gewen, who wrote Glazer’s New York Times obit, put it, “He was modest about what the facts could show. A reader of his work was always coming upon phrases like ‘I am not sure’ and ‘We do not have the knowledge’ and ‘I do not know.’”
Needless to say, Glazer’s lack of preening certainty is rarely encountered these days on cable TV or even in academia.
The “silent generation” is the phrase used to describe the men and women who came to maturity right after World War II and whose early lives were shaped by the Depression. But as the lives of Harris Wofford, Russell Baker and Nathan Glazer illustrated, sometimes the quiet (not silent) voices can leave the most lasting imprint on American democracy.

Texto completo: Jussie Smollett appeared publicly Saturday night for the first time after being reportedly attacked in Chicago earlier in the week.Mr. Smollett performed songs from his debut record and the Fox show "Empire," on which he portrays an openly gay R&B singer, at West Hollywood's Troubadour club.
The actor said he was attacked in Chicago around 2 a.m. Tuesday by "two unknown offenders" who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown "chemical substance" on him and wrapped a thin, white rope around his neck. Chicago police said they are investigating the assault against the actor, who is black and openly gay, as a hate crime.
The actor appeared despite his family reportedly cautioning him against performing.But Mr. Smollett said he "had to be here tonight," adding that he couldn't let his attackers win. "I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. ... I hope that you all stand with me."
Protesters swarm jail
For several days, crowds have gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to protest reports of freezing and dark conditions inside the jail after it partially lost power nearly a week ago.
For almost a week, many of those inside the jail, which houses more than 1,600 inmates, had no heat, no hot meals, no hot water for showers and no light in their cells, according to The New York Times, which first reported on the conditions.
For security reasons, inmates were placed on lockdown Thursday - coinciding with a polar vortex that brought record low temperatures to several parts of the country.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which runs the jail near Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, has denied that conditions were so dire.However, several lawmakers who toured the jail Saturday said conditions remained unacceptable and accused jail officials of not understanding the urgency of the situation.
7 shot at Chicago bar
At least two people were killed and five wounded in a shooting early Sunday outside a bar in Chicago's Grand Crossing neighborhood, according to police.
A fight inside Reynold's Lounge spilled outside, where someone shot into the group from inside a silver four-door Ford car around 2 a.m., hitting at least seven people, police said.
A 39-year-old man shot in the back and chest and 36-year-old man shot in the neck and chest were taken to the University of Chicago Medical Center, where both were pronounced dead.
AG sues OxyContin maker
Members of the family that owns Purdue Pharma, the company that created the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin, directed sales representatives to push extremely high doses of the drug and later tried to get involved in opioid addiction treatment as a way to boost profits, according to a lawsuit.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleges the Sackler family, which controls Purdue, engaged in frequent acts of deception and misconduct to make as much money as possible, even as OxyContin sparked the nation's opioid crisis and its staggering toll of addiction and death.
Ms. Healey claims the Sacklers pushed for more patients to be on higher doses of opioids for long periods. The Sacklers, Ms. Healey claims, knew that higher doses put patients at greater risk.
Purdue spokesman Robert Josephson said Ms. Healey's lawsuit is "part of a continuing effort to single out Purdue" for the opioid crisis.

Stop hating on the weather forecast

Texto completo: People love to hate weather forecasts, though it's getting a lot harder to find fault. Forecasts gave plenty of advance warning that Chicago would see a bitter high of around minus 12 on Wednesday, and lows Wednesday night comparable to a bad day in Antarctica. Public officials closed schools and issued warnings, and police saved lives by combing the streets for homeless people before the worst hit.
Today, a five-day forecast is just as accurate as a one-day forecast was in 1980, giving us more time to prepare -- or overreact and panic. Weather watchers in the Northeast have seen this week's cold snap coming for days. Storms are now forecast within a range of 50-some miles and timed to within a couple of hours. An icy storm that hit the Northeast on Jan. 20 was in the forecast before it even existed anywhere, said Richard Alley, a geosciences professor at Penn State University and co-author of a new paper in Science on weather prediction.
There's even more room to improve, he said. Better forecasts save money -- on plows and road salt, on crops, and on making sun and wind energy more predictable. Sometimes forecasts can have even bigger consequences.
Historians say D-Day might have gone very differently if weather had followed the German forecast for storms rather than the Allies' more accurate forecast of fair skies and calm seas. Bad weather thwarted Napoleon and later Hitler in attempts to defeat Russia. Lost explorers over the ages might have planned differently. Ernest Shackleton might have avoided getting his ship locked into the Antarctic ice.
A century later, I take advantage of forecasts those early explorers couldn't have dreamed of. I plan many of my weekends around sailboat races, and here in Rhode Island, there are at least four venues where people race all winter. Even a week ahead of time I can get a reasonable estimate of temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction. We don't go out if the forecast shows anything life-threatening.
It makes sense that weather is inherently more predictable than, say, the economy. Ultimately, weather does reduce down to basic laws of physics -- Newton's laws, the Coriolis effect, and the like, said Alley. The limiting factor is the complexity of the system: To build a good model you have to take into consideration where there's ocean, where all the mountains are, and even where corn fields grow in the Midwest.
And even then, there's a problem, which was laid out in James Gleick's 1987 book "Chaos." Mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz discovered that while the physical world is in principle deterministic, in reality minuscule changes in initial conditions can lead to big differences in weather. Consider Lorenz's famously titled 1972 talk: "Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"
Alley said that indeed there's a limit on the accuracy and range of weather forecasting, but since the 1970s, it went from mediocre to amazing. He chalks up the improvements to additional satellites and other data collecting devices, more powerful computers to crunch the data, and improved models.
He uses the game show "Wheel of Fortune" to show how forecasts work in the face of the butterfly effect. The wheel is divided unevenly into segments, so right off you can calculate how often over many spins it will hit, say, the skinny million-dollar-jackpot segment. That's why long-term climate patterns are easier to forecast than the weather on any given day.
A single spin, or a single day, is hard to predict, but as the wheel starts to slow down, you can start to guesstimate where it will land -- just as the weather forecasts for a particular race day are more accurate as the day comes closer. The models are so good, he said, that once you figure in all the topography, the atmospheric density and earth's rotation, you don't have to add in the gulf stream. The laws of physics predict there will be a gulf stream. They also predict there will be a semi-periodic current pattern called El Niño, as well as long-term global warming. (Alley also sings about the concepts here in a music video.)
In his book "The Signal and the Noise," Nate Silver discusses the same idea using a coin toss, which is essentially a deterministic physical phenomenon. If a machine flips a coin exactly the same way it will can get a dependable outcome. But when we humans toss a coin it behaves randomly because the outcome depends on tiny variations in its trajectory. His weather chapter was excerpted in a New York Times Magazine story called "The Weatherman Is Not a Moron."
That was back in 2012, but already there were huge improvements. Silver attributed this to better computers and more data as well as better estimates of uncertainty. Sometimes the weather people are sure, sometimes not so sure. But saying so, he laments, has its cost:
In a time when forecasters of all types make overconfident proclamations about political, economic or natural events, uncertainty is a tough sell. It's much easier to hawk overconfidence, no matter if it's any good.
That's a longstanding problem for many kinds of scientists. People might wrongly equate honesty about uncertainty with being wishy-washy. But there are objective tests of predictions. So-called "superforecasters" (who win forecasting tournaments) say that understanding their own uncertainty is critical.
People probably won't stop complaining about the weather forecasts, said Alley, because even missing the mark by a degree or so can mean the difference between snow and rain. It's also improved so slowly that it's been hard to see. What's all this worth in dollars and cents? Alley cited several papers, listing the benefits of weather forecasting and estimating that spending on weather forecasting technology can deliver a much greater return on investment. But to get specific there, you've got to factor in humans and the economy, which are not nearly so predictable.

Texto completo: Because she was running behind one Sunday morning, Elizabeth Jennings turned out to be a century ahead of her time.
She was a teacher in her 20s, on her way to the First Colored American Congregational Church in Lower Manhattan, where she was the regular organist, when a conductor ordered her off a horse-drawn Third Avenue trolley and told her to wait for a car reserved for black passengers.
One immediately arrived, but it was full.
When Jennings flatly refused to leave the whites-only trolley that she had already boarded, she was bodily ejected.
She sued the company for damages and won in 1855 -- exactly 100 years before Rosa Parks rejected a Montgomery, Ala., bus driver's order to give up her seat in the colored section for a white passenger after the space reserved for whites was filled.
In the mid-1950s, Parks was elevated to a civil rights heroine. Jennings was finally immortalized -- in 2007, to a degree -- after third- and fourth-grade students at P.S. 361 on the Lower East Side successfully lobbied to name a street corner in her honor.
Even in his revealing portrait of "Black Manhattan" (1930), James Weldon Johnson did not identify by name the "courageous colored woman, a teacher," as he described Jennings, whose efforts led to the legal annulment of racially segregated mass transit in New York.
On July 16, 1854, Jennings and a friend, Sarah Adams, boarded the trolley at Pearl Street and today's Park Row. They were late and rushing to get to the church, on East Sixth Street near the Bowery.
The reluctant conductor only agreed to let them ride -- instead of waiting for a trolley that proclaimed "Colored People Allowed in This Car" -- if no white passengers objected.
Jennings wrote, "I was a respectable person, born and raised in New York, did not know where he was born and that he was a good-for-nothing impudent fellow for insulting decent persons while on their way to church."
Whether or not any rider voiced a complaint was unclear, but the conductor and Jennings scuffled. She resisted, clinging to a window frame, then to his coat. He enlisted the driver's help, to no avail.
"I screamed, 'Murder,' with all my voice and my companion screamed out, 'You will kill her. Don't kill her,' " Jennings wrote.
"'You shall sweat for this,"' she quoted the conductor as saying. Farther on, near what is today Canal Street, he spotted a police officer, who boarded the car and ousted Jennings. He shoved her onto the sidewalk, dirtying her dress and crushing her bonnet.
While Jennings's encounter with the conductor was serendipitous, she had been primed, by temperament and family ties, for a confrontation over racial equality and to seek retribution.
Elizabeth Jennings was born in Manhattan in March of 1827 (although some records say 1830).
Her mother was Elizabeth (Cartwright) Jennings, whose own father had fought with the Continental Army. Young Elizabeth's father, Thomas L. Jennings, was a prosperous tailor on Church Street and is said to have been the first black person to be awarded a patent in the United States, in 1821, for a method of dry cleaning clothes.
When Elizabeth was only 10 she delivered from memory a lecture titled "On the Improvement of the Mind," according to a biography, "Streetcar to Justice" (2018) by Amy Hill Hearth.
When she finished public school, she wasn't allowed to participate in commencement, so, in a separate ceremony, she received her diploma, which qualified her to teach in public school.
Her father, who had helped found the New York African Society for Mutual Relief, a charitable group for free blacks; enlisted his fellow abolitionists to publicize his daughter's mistreatment and recruit a newly minted 26-year-old lawyer and future president, Chester A. Arthur, and his partners to sue the Third Avenue Railroad System, based in Brooklyn, for discrimination.
(In 1852, Arthur's advocacy helped liberate slaves who were being transported from Virginia to Texas through New York.)
Frederick Douglass's Paper, published in Rochester, and The New York Daily Tribune were among those that printed sympathetic accounts, relying largely on Jennings's version of the altercation. (The New York Times apparently overlooked the case.)
On Feb. 22, 1855, Judge William Rockwell advised a jury in State Supreme Court that the company was required as a common carrier to convey all respectable passengers, including "colored persons, if sober, well-behaved, and free from disease" and that it was liable if they were excluded.
Jennings sought $500 in damages. The jury ruled in her favor, but apparently decided that amount was too much for a black person and instead awarded $225 (about equal to her annual salary teaching). The judge added 10 percent (for a total of about $7,000 in today's dollars) plus costs.
"Railroads, steamboats, omnibuses, and ferry-boats will be admonished from this, as to the rights of respectable colored people," The Tribune declared. "It is high time the rights of this class of citizens were ascertained, and that it should be known whether they are to be thrust from our public conveyances, while German or Irish women, with a quarter of mutton or a load of codfish, can be admitted."
Jennings taught for 35 years, mostlyin black schools.
In 1860, she married Charles Graham. They had a son, Thomas, who was sickly and died when he was 1. His burial would take place during the Draft Riots by whites opposed to conscription during the Civil War, and since it was unsafe for blacks to be seen outdoors, Jennings and her husband had to sneak to their son's graveside service at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, where the Rev. Morgan Dix of Trinity Church presided.
After the riots, in which dozens of blacks were killed, the couple fled the city. They settled in Eatonville, N.J., near Long Branch. Graham died in 1867. Jennings returned to Manhattan in 1871.
Jennings later taught at the Colored Grammar School, where theprincipal, Charles L. Reason, was a pioneering black educator who challenged school segregation.
In 1895, she founded what was described as the first kindergarten for black children, at her home, 237 West 41st Street, in Manhattan, where she died on June 5, 1901.
1827-1901

Texto completo: Jill Abramson owes two debts to David Halberstam and "The Powers That Be," the late writer's epic 1979 examination of four powerful news companies. The first is her career. Reading it inspired her to become a journalist, a path that led to the executive editorship of the New York Times. Three years into that post, Abramson was fired, and Halberstam's book inspired her anew. Surveying a battlefield on which she had become a casualty, she saw a contested future for quality news. What Halberstam had done for a Golden Age in media, Abramson wanted to do for journalism's Age of Anxiety.
Following the Halberstam template, Abramson studies the fortunes of four companies struggling, as she puts it, "to keep honest news alive." Her book, "Merchants of Truth," is a reported meditation on journalism's last decade, told through the experiences of BuzzFeed, the New York Times, Vice and The Washington Post. Like Halberstam's chosen four (Time, The Post, CBS and the Los Angeles Times), Abramson saw at each news organization good and important work. "And all four are endangered," she asserts.
Although journalism about journalism is abundant, Abramson's book represents a distinctly ambitious effort to synthesize a period of dramatic upheaval and help us understand how key industry actors - and a supporting cast ranging from President Trump to the man who wrote the code for Google News - have shaped our information diet. Picture a room where the Graham and Sulzberger families confer alongside the drugging, drinking, "feral" founders of the lad mag that would become Vice, all of them making their claims about the future of news, and you've got an idea of the assignment Abramson set for herself.
Establishment and insurgent media take off from opposite ends of the same runway, each faltering when they reach the other's altitude. Legacy newsrooms are tragically slow to understand the Internet and the turbulence coming their way, then clumsy and arrogant in integrating the innovations catapulting their young competitors. New-media organizations are portrayed as creative but opportunistic players, building newsrooms to burnish their reputations or fortify new advertising strategies, then tripping over fundamentals, some of them ethical.
On one level, Abramson's book is a love letter to journalism. Its most admired characters are the reporters whose heroics she weaves throughout engrossing, sometimes gossipy profiles of the four companies, women and men working at the top of their game. Meet Elle Reeve, the former computer factory worker who powers Vice's viral video report on the deadly Charlottesville protests, a story of "moral clarity." The Post's David Fahrenthold is the investigative reporter whose relentless digging ("like a bloodhound") into candidate Trump's charity wins a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting. Michael Barbaro is the "Platonic ideal of the new Timesman" - political reporter, podcaster and elegant writer recrafting a historic election night story when the "Madam President" headline is cratered by Trump's victory.
Craig Silverman's dogged reporting distinguishes BuzzFeed as "the media's foremost expert on the subject of fake news, consistently beating other outlets to the punch."
But these valentines appear alongside Abramson's unflinching assessments of executives' miscalculations. Her description of The Post in the period before its sale to Jeff Bezos is a bleak account of a management team struggling to reset in the new news economy. A long-awaited strategy memo, "The Road Forward," is rolled out at a staff meeting and bombs. "While the memo's title was meant to sound visionary and reassuring, an actual road map was entirely missing," Abramson writes.
While digital start-ups deepened their reporting and galloped ahead of their legacy competitors on audience development, Abramson also sees them stumble in establishing norms of journalistic conduct. When BuzzFeed, a brilliant virality machine, first adds news, it's "an experiment in the viability of an operation begun without regard for journalistic ethics (attribution, accountability, etc.) that had gotten a journalistic organ grafted onto it." Abramson cites BuzzFeed's secretive deletion of more than 4,000 posts, plagiarism included, "a redaction of unprecedented scale." Four months after ratifying a code of ethics that would prohibit such actions, Ben Smith, the website's talented young editor, erased three posts from the site that were critical of corporate brands. "The problem wasn't the veracity of the posts, it was that they offended advertisers," she writes. "When Smith realized he'd been caught he reinstated the posts and offered a sheepish apology over email. 'I reacted impulsively,' he admitted, 'and I was wrong.' "
Abramson was researching her book as stories broke in the Daily Beast and the Times about rampant sexual harassment at Vice, but her account is in many ways the richest. Her years writing and editing long-form investigative journalism are on display as she profiles Shane Smith and the "bro-hood" that built a $6 billion company that touched the holy grail - making money from streaming video to young audiences - while audaciously upending workplace conventions, including prohibitions against supervisors sleeping with their staffers. In one heartbreaking account, a young producer is told to stay away from a Columbia University award ceremony honoring one of her stories; her boss, with whom she had an affair, will be bringing his wife.
Although Abramson acknowledges the steep decline of local news, she does so as an afterthought. The book travels along the Acela corridor, with occasional trips to the West Coast, and no investigation of how the same forces roiling New York and Washington are shuttering local news shops. In her final chapter, she quotes a journalist from Minnesota who is "outraged that the bleeding of local news wasn't garnering more attention," an ironic note given that it receives no more attention here. That was not the book Abramson set out to write, fair enough. But it does expose a costly limit she imposed in mimicking Halberstam, whose book documented a less fractured, pre-Internet age. The nation's shriveling local news report is an industry crisis, and I missed Abramson's reporting applied to that story.
Several subjects of "Merchants of Truth" have alleged inaccuracies in the galleys, some of which have been corrected in the final printing. Abramson was asked about this in a New Yorker interview, and she said that the book was fact-checked but that there "wasn't time" to call back everyone she interviewed.
Other early reports on the book have focused narrowly on Abramson's criticisms of political journalism at her alma mater, and there are several. She describes the post-election news pages of the Times and The Post as "unmistakably anti-Trump," asserting that the Times benefitted from an "implicit financial reward" by catering to its liberal audience, an assessment at odds with her criticisms of the paper's aggressive reporting on Hillary Clinton's emails. She also frets about an emerging generational divide in the newsroom eroding the paper's guidelines for fairness. "The more 'woke' staff thought that urgent times called for urgent measures; the dangers of Trump's presidency obviated the old standards," she writes. But these cautions are offered alongside her view that renewed competition between the Times and The Post has made both papers stronger.
"The Post was back," she writes of journalism reinvigorated by new owner Bezos and editor Martin Baron. About the Times under her successor Dean Baquet, she concludes, "The news report as a whole had never been stronger."
Abramson's deeper concerns regard the accelerated collaboration between journalists and business staff and the lucrative blurring of news with advertising (concerns announced by the pairing of "merchants" and "truth" in her title). She rips "native ads" as the industry's "new digital Frankenstein" - corporate marketing so closely resembling news stories that it may deceive readers. Incubated at shops like BuzzFeed and Vice, the financially seductive campaigns are now part of the advertising menu at legacy publications, an export Abramson laments as "chinks carved in the wall" that has traditionally separated news from commerce.
These views inform Abramson's candid self-portrait, that of an editor who struggled to stitch one era to the next, eager to benefit from the innovations offered by the digital age but cynical about anything that resembled an incursion into historic news values. It was a complicated moment for editors trying to steer their newsrooms across the shallows. Longevity required new kinds of collaborations not common during most of her career, and Abramson had a hard time forming them. When the internal "Times Innovation Report" was leaked to BuzzFeed - new media breaking one of the biggest legacy media stories of the year - it described a gifted but ossified newsroom that often rejected digital initiatives as "un-Timesian."
Abramson reflects on this turbulent period with anguish. "I didn't think technological change should sweep in moral change. I fought back. Perhaps my principles were too rigid; perhaps to save the Times the old strictures needed to be relaxed."
Her account of losing her job reads as a small memoir within the book, a melancholic reconstruction of an event that drew widespread coverage in 2014. Writing in these pages at the time, journalist Amanda Bennett observed that Abramson's firing hit women "like a lightning strike to dry tinder." I suspect that this book, which provides Abramson's first full depiction of the period, will reignite that conversation. She openly describes feeling lonely and depressed at work and alienated from other senior executives. She is critical of her miscalculations, even as she's angered by evidence that her pay lagged that of her male predecessor, a claim the Times disputes.
In one agonizing scene, publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who had promoted her into the job, delivers a written evaluation to her office and remains while Abramson reads it. "In shockingly personal terms, the letter described my moodiness and statements from my closest colleagues that I was a difficult manager," recounts Abramson. "It said nothing about the substance or quality of my work. If I had to boil it down to one sentence it would be 'People think you're a bitch.' "
In four months, she was gone. "I was a less than stellar manager," she concedes four years later, "but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders."
She adds, "In the end, all the journalists who are my contemporaries were transitional figures playing blind man's bluff." The powers that were.

Texto completo: "For the mob to just go tear apart a 16-year-old boy is inexcusable. He'll never be able to get away from this."
Todd McMurtry
Lawyer for the Sandmann family
Lawyers representing Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann and his family said Friday they have sent letters to media outlets and Catholic organizations as the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.
The student at the Park Hills school found himself in the center of a media firestorm after a video showing Nick and his classmates after last month's March for Life in Washington went viral.
The videos show Nick in a "Make America Great Again" hat and a Native American elder, Nathan Phillips, surrounded by other students while Phillips plays a drum and sings. Phillips said he approached the students to defuse a tense exchange between the students and a group of Black Hebrew Israelites.
The first short clip that caught the attention of people on social media prompted calls of racism. That clip was countered by hours of additional footage that came to light in the days after the event.
Nick, as well as his school, faced threats from those angered by the video. His family's legal counsel, Todd McMurtry, and libel and defamation lawyer L. Lin Wood of Atlanta have said they will seek justice for the harm allegedly done to the teen.
McMurtry is with law firm Hemmer Defrank Wessels in Fort Mitchell and has practiced law in Greater Cincinnati since 1991. He said a team of seven lawyers has been working full time to review media accounts of what happened.
This week, they have prepared documentation preservation letters addressed to organizations they believe may have defamed or libeled Nick with false reporting, McMurtry said.
"They know they crossed the line," McMurtry said of the media outlets. "Do they want 12 people in Kentucky to decide their fate? I don't think so."
The letters tell the organizations not to destroy any documents in connection with the incident, the attorney said. For example, these documents could be drafts or early versions of articles or emails among staff discussing the story.
McMurtry said he expects his team to send dozens more letters to other organizations in coming days and weeks.
After the review, the lawyers "concluded we have a good faith basis to sue" certain organizations, McMurtry said. However, he said not all the organizations who were sent letters will necessarily be sued. He added that this process will not be over quickly.
"There are so many deep-pocket defendants who crossed the line, the process will just roll out," he said. "It's international."
McMurtry said his clients will be demanding retractions and apologies in addition to possible litigation.
"We want to change the conversation. We don't want this to happen again," McMurtry said. "We want to teach people a lesson."
He went on to say that lesson is the media cannot state as fact things that aren't true.
"There was a rush by the media to believe what it wanted to believe, versus what actually happened," McMurtry said.
An example he gave of false reports were ones that said Nick got into the face of Phillips, McMurtry said. McMurtry said this simply is not true.
McMurtry said the next steps for lawyers will likely involve conversations and negotiations with the legal teams for the organizations and then possibly filing lawsuits. More media outlets will likely be sent letters as well, he said.
He said what happened in the aftermath of the video "permanently stained the reputation" of Nick.
"For the mob to just go tear apart a 16-year-old boy is inexcusable," McMurtry said. "He'll never be able to get away from this."
The Diocese of Covington could not be reached for comment. Emails seeking comment from the named media organizations and the listed dioceses and archdiocese were not immediately returned.
Enquirer reporter Sarah Brookbank contributed.

Five questions to ask before marriage

Texto completo: Marriage is one of the biggest decisions you'll ever make, so the last thing you want to do is go in unprepared.
Money is the number-one issue couples fight about. In fact, Ramsey Solutions released a study that shows money fights are the second leading cause of divorce, behind infidelity. So, making sure you're on the same page about your finances with your future spouse is extremely important. When you sit down and talk with your partner about your finances, it builds a different level of trust in your relationship. You'll wind up growing closer to each other as a result.
Talking about money can be uncomfortable at first, but it's so worth it. Before you say "I do," here are a few questions you should ask yourself as you get ready to have the money talk with your future spouse.
Where are you currently with your finances? Both of you should answer this question and get it out on the table. How much debt do you have — including student loans, car loans, mortgages, credit cards and even personal loans? What's your annual income? How much do you have in savings?
Once you both have that information, you can make a plan to attack your debt. That leads us to a very important question — do you want debt to be a part of your marriage? I hope the answer is no, but you need to have this discussion. If you're determined to get out of debt and your spouse continues to pile up credit card debt, then you're headed toward a lot of marital stress.
Debt is a thief. It steals your money and your joy. The last thing you want to do is delay all of those dreams you have with your future spouse. Being debt-free will allow you to turn your dreams into a reality. So, make a plan to get out of debt together, and don't let it be an option ever again.
Am I a spender or a saver? You probably know the answer to this question immediately, right? Would you rather spend your time shopping at the mall or updating your budget in Excel?
The spender and the saver are total opposites, but it's true what they say — opposites attract. Often in marriage, one person is a spender and one is a saver. And that's OK. Just because one likes to spend and one the other likes to save doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. You balance each other out.
The problems start when you go through life without understanding each other's natural tendencies. You have to start by embracing one another's differences. There is no right or wrong here. The key is to communicate and make a plan for your money together. Spenders shouldn't let all of the budgeting fall to the saver and vice versa. You are one now.
Do I understand how a budget works? If you don't know how to make a budget, stop what you're doing and learn how to create one. I know what you may be thinking... "Budgets are the worst." or "You can't have fun when you're on a budget." Budgeting might seem restrictive but telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went actually gives you permission to spend. It's also a great way to deepen communication with your spouse because you're planning for your future together.
Your budget is your game plan. With a zero-based budget, you list your monthly income at the top of the page. Then list all your monthly expenses — gas, food, rent, debt payments and so on — below that. The income minus the outgo should equal zero. Every dollar should have a "name." Give yourself grace. It will take a few months to get used to budgeting, but you'll get there.
What are your fears? This might not be a fun question, but it's an important one. Fear can make us do crazy things, especially when it comes to your money. Fear is what leads to people hiding purchases from their spouse or getting a secret credit card. Both of which are bad ideas, by the way.
Maybe you're afraid because you don't have the security that comes with savings or maybe you're scared because you're living paycheck to paycheck, like most Americans. Whatever they are, share them with your fiancé. Getting your fears out on the table will help you to get on the same page when it comes to your values and money.
What are your dreams? Where do you picture yourself (and your spouse) years from now? Where do you picture yourself (and your spouse) years from now? What type of lifestyle are living? You probably already know the answer, and these are things you should be sharing with each other, too.
Talking about money with your partner binds you on an intimate level unlike anything else. You wind up sharing your hopes and dreams together, and who doesn't want that? The honeymoon doesn't have to end when your wedding is over. Dream together, and make a plan for your money together. I promise, you'll add a sense of peace in your marriage that could not exist with debt.

Texto completo: President Trump spoke with The New York Times on Thursday, sitting in the Oval Office for an interview with A. G. Sulzberger, the newspaper's publisher, and two White House correspondents, Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman.
[For more coverage and analysis of the discussion, read here.]
For the first part of the conversation, Mr. Baker and Ms. Haberman led the interview of the president. Later on, Mr. Sulzberger engaged Mr. Trump on journalism and so-called fake news.
The following are excerpts from that discussion, transcribed by The Times. They have been lightly edited for content and clarity, and omit off-the-record comments and asides.
________________________________________
A.G. SULZBERGER, publisher of The New York Times: Mr. President, before we wind down, I didn't want to miss the opportunity just to raise a concern that we discussed last time I was here.
______________
SULZBERGER: So the concern I raised then was about your anti-press rhetoric: fake news, enemy of the people. And at the time I said I was concerned that it wasn't just divisive, it was potentially dangerous --
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right.
SULZBERGER: -- and warned that I thought it could have consequences. I feel like in the time since we've started to see some of those consequences play out. We've seen around the world an unprecedented rise in attacks on journalists, threats to journalists, censorship of journalists, jailing of journalists and murders of journalists.
TRUMP: Where in particular?
SULZBERGER: Globally, on every continent. I'm happy to send you some of the literature.
TRUMP: Yeah.
SULZBERGER: It's very closely tracked. But one of the things that's been very striking to me is that as I've talked to my colleagues around the globe, you know, working in different countries, particularly working in countries where a free press is already a tenuous thing, they say that they are increasingly of the belief that your rhetoric is creating a climate in which dictators and tyrants are able to employ your words in suppressing a free press. And I wanted to circle back to this, you know, first, I guess to ask you, you know, if you are aware of these broad consequences that we're seeing.
TRUMP: So the person, honestly, that's been most suggestive of that would -- is you.
SULZBERGER: Yeah.
TRUMP: -- more so than others. I do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news, where they go "fake news." I even see it in other countries. I don't necessarily attribute that to me. I think I can attribute the term to me. I think I was the one that started using it, I would say. But I do see that.
[Crosstalk]
SULZBERGER: But can I just respond to that? Because the phrase fake news -- you're exactly right -- it has been embraced globally. And several countries have actually banned fake news, but it was a technique to actually ban an independent media. And so it's not, you know, about viral, you know, viral stuff on Facebook. It's about countries using that term to actually ban independent scrutiny of their actions.
TRUMP: Right, I've seen that.
SULZBERGER: Yeah.
TRUMP: I don't like that. I mean I don't like that. I don't like, though I do think it's very bad for a country when the news is not accurately portrayed. I really do. And I do believe I'm a victim of that, honestly. In all due respect, I know what a good writer these two people are. But Peter's been very tough on us the last couple of months. I don't know why, because I really think I'm doing a great job.
I'm doing something with China that nobody else could do. There's nobody else -- I know everybody. Nobody else could do. I wish you could have seen --
SULZBERGER: Can I say something on Peter?
TRUMP: Yeah.
SULZBERGER: I mean Peter has covered four administrations: four presidential administrations, starting with Clinton. And --
TRUMP: I know, I know.
SULZBERGER: But one of the things that we've learned over a century and a half of covering the men who've occupied this office is that every occupant feels that the press is too tough at times.
TRUMP: Yeah.
SULZBERGER: But our job and our constitutional structure and, you know, the centrality of a free press and the First Amendment, demands that a free press asks tough questions and hold the powerful to account. And I know that's not always comfortable, and I certainly would never ask you to, you know, bite your tongue if you have coverage you disagree with.
TRUMP: No, I understand that.
SULZBERGER: Or if you want to criticize The Times. I guess the concern I want to raise is the effects that this, the broad-based attacks on journalism and journalists continue to have seems to be growing. And it particularly seems to be growing abroad with folks who aren't covering your administration. They're trying to do --
SULZBERGER: -- hard, dangerous work of ferreting out the truth in -- in societies where leadership often tries to suppress it. And, and you know I'd urge you to reconsider these things.
TRUMP: I understand that.
SULZBERGER: But if -- you choose not to, I just, I want you to be aware of some of the consequences that I'm starting to see out there.
TRUMP: Would you say more so now than over the last five years?
SULZBERGER: Yes.
TRUMP: Right now? I mean, moreso now than even a year ago?
SULZBERGER: Yes. And I think --
TRUMP: I'm not happy to hear that.
SULZBERGER: [Inaudible] [Jamal] Khashoggi [the murdered Saudi journalist for the Washington Post] is you know is just the highest-profile example but we're seeing, we're seeing leaders --
TRUMP: [To aide] One second.
SULZBERGER: We're seeing leaders of journalistic organizations saying very directly that -- that governments feel like there is a climate of impunity that's been created. You know the United States and the occupants of your office historically have been the greatest defenders of the free press and --
TRUMP: And I think I am, too. I want to be. I want to be. I guess the one thing I do feel because you look at network coverage. It's so bad. I'll do something that's good. [Laughter]
TRUMP: You know I've done some very good things. Look -- North Korea -- you'd be in a war right now. O.K.? Venezuela we have to see how that works out, Maggie and Peter. We're going to have to see. I mean, I think a lot of people have actually liked what I've done in Venezuela, I mean from what I'm hearing. But Venezuela we're going to have to see. But we have a lot of things going. China. China was killing our country. They were taking out $500 billion dollars a year. Just ripping it out of our country. We wouldn't have survived, I mean we were going to go down the tubes. And now they're, I mean they want to make a deal so badly and it's, it's big stuff. It's tremendous. And, and I don't even know if that's the most important. We've done a good job. And I'd love to be treated fairly. I'll tell you what I find it so incredible that I'm sitting here with the bad publicity I get. I'm not blaming you two. I mean, I'm blaming like -- now Fox treats me very well. I must say and even there, you know, I could be happier, but Fox treats me very well. And others treat me well. You know what's very interesting -- local television is so great to me. Right? I said I can't believe it. I get some clips. The local, the local station. Even if you go to ABC or NBC -- NBC's terrible -- you go to NBC local, it's like, I'd say it's like a different planet. CBS. It's hard to believe actually. But, but what amazes me, because I have great respect for the press, it amazes me that I can be treated so badly and I won. And we're doing well. You know, it is pretty hard to believe actually. But I don't want that to happen.
SULZBERGER: I would say, you know, speaking broadly for the press, and then speaking specifically for at The New York Times, every occupant of your office has felt like the coverage was tougher than it should have been.
TRUMP: That's true. I think that's true. I mean, I'm surprised because some I think got -- [to Baker] now you did a book about Barack Obama so you got to know him. He didn't think he got good press either. But I think I get it really bad. I mean, let's face it, this is at a level that nobody's ever had before.
SULZBERGER: But it's part, it's -- tough coverage is part of occupying the most powerful seat on earth. You know that chair right there that you're sitting in is the most powerful seat on earth and it comes with it, you know, scrutiny and questions. You have my, speaking for The Times, you know my enduring commitment that we will treat you fairly and accurately.
TRUMP: I appreciate it.
SULZBERGER: As we have for, for presidential administrations for 150 years now. Starting with I think that guy [gestures to Abraham Lincoln painting].
TRUMP: Yeah. He was a good one.
SULZBERGER: But I do, you know, I hope you'll think on the language point because the effects are not just being felt with the outlets who you feel are treating you unfairly -- they're being felt all over the world including folks who are literally putting their lives on the line to report the truth.
TRUMP: I understand that and I do. I would say this. If -- I have never -- I don't mind a bad story if it's true. I really don't. You know, we're all like big people. We understand what's happening. I've had bad stories, very bad stories where I thought it was true and I would never complain. But when you get really bad stories where it's not true, then you sort of say that's unfair and you know you have a tremendous power, you have the power of the pen, the power of the ink. You have a tremendous power. I guess I have the power of a very big, uh, I think Dan [Scavino, a White House aide] said it's like 162 million if you add up the different sites, the five sites, or whatever it is but it's a lot. I think on the one it's --
[Crosstalk]
TRUMP: People. On Twitter. If you add up Facebook and add up Instagram and add up three of four things. But I guess what do I have? 58, 59 million people on the, on the one. So it gives you at least a voice. That's not -- you know, The New York Times is The New York Times. It gives you a voice. If I were treated fairly -- and I have great respect for the press -- but when I won the election and I know, and I'm not gonna say that you apologized, but they did a whole big thing, you know, like what happened and there were those who say that it was an apology. I was treated really badly during the election. That's the good news. The bad news is that I'm treated even worse. I'm treated bad. And I'm working hard. This job is from an economic -- you know, I get a kick out of these people saying "Oh, a rich Arab stayed at his hotel," you know, I'll bet you between opportunity cost and actual cost, you know but I lost massive amounts of money doing this job. This is not the money. This is, this is one of the great losers of all time. You know fortunately I don't need money. This is one of the great losers of all time. But they'll say that somebody from some country stayed at a hotel. And I'll say "Yeah." But I lose, I mean, the numbers are incredible.
______________
TRUMP: It doesn't matter to me from the standpoint that this is such an important job. You know I assumed that could happen. I assumed. I think I have a great support. But what does amaze me is the level of inaccurate reporting. It's really inaccurate reporting.
______________
SULZBERGER: But if you, just because accuracy is so important to me, if you feel like there are specific things that are inaccurate I hope they're finding their way --
TRUMP: Can I call you from now on?
[Crosstalk]
TRUMP: Can I call -- Peter, can I call the boss? Eh?
[Crosstalk]
SULZBERGER: I prefer you start with them.
TRUMP: [To Baker] Give me a card. Give me a card. [Inaudible.] If you don't mind. The book was good by the way. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. Very good book. Not my favorite person but that's okay.
[Crosstalk]
TRUMP: It was a very well-written book. I should be so lucky. You understand?
[Crosstalk from aides]
SULZBERGER: I can't speak for every news organization, but I can say that that's something that we pay a lot of attention to and we, there is nothing that this institution has prized more for the last 100 years.
[Crosstalk]
______________
TRUMP: Your father was great. Do you know I negotiated with your father over the Times site on 66, you know, the West Side?
SULZBERGER: I didn't know that.
TRUMP: Because I had the yards. And the job was a very successful job. He had the back and he was, just a high quality person. And I told you about Abe Rosenthal, right?
SULZBERGER: Yeah, he and my grandfather, I mean, it's honestly why I take defending the press so seriously is that you know their legacy as being a voice for free press in this country. Which is -- I think our ended our last conversation saying that it's one of, because you're a businessman, it's one of America's greatest exports is free speech and a free press. And it's --
TRUMP: You're right.
SULZBERGER: It's worth defending.
MAGGIE HABERMAN, White House correspondent: Mr. President, can I ask you a question I was wondering as you were all talking about this.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: I think we can make this the last one.
HABERMAN: Can I ask you five more questions?
[Laughter]
TRUMP: We'll do it again.
HABERMAN: What do you --
TRUMP: All I ask is one thing. And we'll do it again. Just treat me fairly. We'll do it again. We'll do it a hundred times.
HABERMAN: Well what do you -- I guess what I wonder is -- and you've been with the press for a very long time. You've been dealing with the press longer than I've been in it, longer than he's been in it. Longer than Peter's been in it.
TRUMP: I hate to hear that.
HABERMAN: That's a long time.
TRUMP: Let me look at a mirror.
HABERMAN: But what do you see the role of a free press as? What do you think the free press does?
TRUMP: It describes and should describe accurately what's going on in anywhere it's covering whether it's a nation or a state or a game or whatever. And if it describes it accurately and fairly it's a very very important and beautiful thing.
HABERMAN: But I don't want to be difficult and I have a very respectful relationship with the folks who work here. I think Sarah works incredibly hard.
TRUMP: That's true, that's true. That's what I've heard.
HABERMAN: But I have also had stories that were accurate called inaccurate by this White House and I don't know -- what are we supposed to do when this happens?
TRUMP: Well, little things. For instance, you cover me and you know, I get up early in the morning and I turn on television. And I do. But I don't turn it on very much because I really read the papers much more than I watch the television, O.K.? Especially your columns lately. But it's O.K. It's a little off. I wish, I wish you'd call me. I would tell you exactly what the routine is. The routine is a little bit off. But it makes it -- you know I went to.
PETER BAKER, chief White House correspondent: [Handing the president a notepad] Put your number right there, and I'll be happy to call.
[Laughter]
HABERMAN: We'll just -- we'll call you.
BAKER: We'll be happy to call.
HABERMAN: Can we go through the switchboard? We'll call you. [Laughter]
TRUMP: Do you have a hard time -- when you call me, let me ask you this, when you call me you go through -- do you ever call for me and --
SANDERS: Two Sundays ago you called -- [inaudible]
TRUMP: -- and I don't get back?
HABERMAN: Ish.
SANDERS: You told me about a story.
HABERMAN: I told Sarah specifically what we were writing and she --
TRUMP: Maggie, I would call people -- not only yourselves.
HABERMAN: And she reached out to you and she actually was very helpful.
TRUMP: If I were a reporter, O.K., and I worked for The New York Times and I called Donald Trump or President Trump, whichever life I'm leading and in the old days, you know I used to get great publicity. When I became a politician all of a sudden, not so good, in my opinion not so good but in the meantime I'm here, so you know, I mean many not so bad, maybe it's different than we think.
But, if I were a reporter and I called somebody and they didn't call me back, I'd probably be psychologically, maybe not even on purpose, I would probably be inclined to do bad stories. And I told these two [gesturing to aides], I said you know if somebody calls me -- somebody, now you know we have a limited amount of time. How many calls do I get -- hundreds of calls a day so in all fairness it's tough. But if you guys call, I would love to be able to call you back. I think if I were in your position and, Peter, I called me, and I'm in your position, and I don't return your phone call or if I'm at least not treated fairly by the people representing me, I think that's a very bad thing. And I think that's my fault, not your fault. Now, I am really busy and even this -- I'm taking a lot more time because, No. 1, I'm finding it very interesting.
HABERMAN: We appreciate your time. Thank you.
TRUMP: And No. 2, I think it's very important because I am a voice. Even without this, I'm a voice, without this position. I've always sort of been a voice in the press. Someday, you'll have to explain why. That's why I won, I guess. You know, it's very interesting, when I was running they spent nothing but money on me and one of the reasons Hillary [Clinton] lost is all she did was spend money on negative ads. And I had, I don't know what the number is, but a record -- hundreds of millions of dollars. Every ad was negative and when they got into the voting booth, they had no idea what the hell she stood for and I guess the public knows me so well that they didn't care.
______________
TRUMP: You look at the Florida primaries, it was Jeb [Bush] and Marco [Rubio]. You have the sitting senator, you have a governor who was popular for eight years who was not out that long running against me.
HABERMAN: You're a Florida resident though.
TRUMP: I got a massive vote and they got like peanuts. And all they did -- and then I got Hillary and it was the same thing. The whole thing was negative and it's sort of amazing, you know. It's actually amazing. But I've seen what negative ads do, they're destructive. And yet for me it was a different kind of a thing.
Let me finish by saying this, what you do is a very important thing. And I will tell you, I would love if I was just covered fairly. If I were covered fairly -- like this should be a fair story. I don't know what the story is, this should be a fair story. I actually think your readers would respect it. Because I know what you're all saying, but everybody thinks The New York Times treats me terribly. Washington Post also, but The New York Times even more so treats me unbelievably terribly. And I think, I honestly believe you lose credibility by that. I don't think I've had a good story in The New York Times and let me tell you --
SULZBERGER: Can I just say one thing on that?
TRUMP: -- but I became president and I didn't have a good story. Go ahead.
SULZBERGER: You may enjoy knowing that Hillary Clinton says the exact same thing about us.
HABERMAN: To this day.
SULZBERGER: To this day. She wrote it in her book. You know our job is to cover people and institutions of power toughly and aggressively. And it's never fun to be on the other side of that. You have my commitment that as we do that --
TRUMP: Good.
SULZBERGER: -- toughly and aggressively, we will also do it fairly. You do have my commitment.
TRUMP: I appreciate that. But I say this, look, I started off, real estate guy. Did really nicely. I really built well and I did a lot of good things. I went into show business, I hit a huge home run with "The Apprentice," I mean it was a very successful deal. I then went into politics.
I had a senator in my office, he said, "You know, Mr. President, I've run six times and I'll tell you, out of six times and I've won four." And I was just kidding, I said, well, you know what -- and he was a senator and he was a congressman -- I said, "I won -- I ran one time for the president of the United States and out of one time I won one. I'm one for one." And he sort of laughed and it's never happened before, nobody's ever done that.
I ran one time and you know I had to go through 15 debates between the two of them. Between the primaries and the other -- or whatever the number is, like 15. And I was never off center stage, never once off center stage and I'm going against -- I'll never forget I said, "Tell me about debating." I've never debated. My whole life is a debate but I've never stood at a podium and debated.
I said, "Tell me about my competition. Who are these people?" You know for the first -- and then I got the crazy Megyn Kelly question with the Rosie O'Donnell answer. I said, "Tell me about this. I want to see, let me see --" And I get the list: Ted Cruz, No. 1 at Princeton, national debate champion, No. 1 at Harvard, national -- then I get and a lot of the others, too, you know their politicians they always had their -- I never did.
But, I ran, I won, and I'm really doing a good job. I mean, I guess I'm controversial, but I'm doing a great job. The man from China, the vice -- the second man in China, essentially, they call him the vice premier, like the vice president, but he's the second man, strong second man. He made the nicest statements today. He said, "You're doing things that nobody could ever do." And he actually said it in front of the press, it was nice. I mean I'd love you, just look at it, you don't have to put it down if you don't want but I'm sort of entitled to one good story in The New York Times. I started off, I ran against very smart people and a lot of them.
I'll never forget, Charles Krauthammer's on television, he said, "Why would Trump run? This is the greatest field of candidates ever assembled in the history of the Republican Party." You know, you had governors and senators, you know they were all good until I beat the shit out of them, O.K.?
He said, "You have the greatest people, why he run? Why would be do that?" And then after that I was like, you know I never left center stage, right? And you know when you leave center stage things aren't going good. I'd look at Jeb Bush, I'd say, "Jeb, you're going to fall off that stage next week, you're going further left or further right." So anyway, I just sort of think I'm entitled to a great story from The New York Times.
I mean I've done something that nobody has ever done, they've never done it. They said, that guy [gestures to painting] had the greatest election of all time -- Andrew Jackson. You know when you read it it was a wild time.
HABERMAN: More than this?
TRUMP: And they said -- Well now? No, no. Now they say, "We topped him." O.K., Peter, they say, "Now we've topped him." But they said, they were saying the other day, somebody was saying, "It was the greatest of all time." I just think, honestly, I'm enti-- I came from New York, I love New York, I'll be back there someday, and I do, I love the place. And I sort am of entitled to a good story -- [to aide] Yeah? Come.
AIDE: I just want to show you who's calling [hands list of calls].
TRUMP: O.K., well, maybe I'll show it to them if it's important. Let me just see -- a lot. Oh, that's good. That's O.K., I don't care. Who's more important than -- but, I just think, honestly, I started from Queens, my father was -- I loved my father, [gesturing toward a photograph] picture. I loved my father, had a great relationship with my mother and father, had a nice family, you know nothing -- there was no trauma.
______________
TRUMP: I came from Jamaica, Queens, Jamaica Estates and I became president of the United States. I'm sort of entitled to a great story from my -- just one -- from my newspaper. I mean, you know, anyway I agree with you 100 percent and I'm honored to have spent the time with you and I'd like you to call me and I'm going to work on that so hard you have no idea. Cause I think you're right.
HABERMAN: Can I ask you one -- literally last question?
TRUMP: Yeah?
HABERMAN: You were criticizing the Cliff Sims book. What do you think of the Chris Christie book? Since you, I know, pay attention to that.
TRUMP: Well, honestly he was very nice to me.
HABERMAN: O.K.
TRUMP: He was not nice to my people. Some of them. Some of them he was.
HABERMAN: Well your family, he was not totally nice to your family.
TRUMP: No, but he was unbelievably nice to me, actually.
HABERMAN: So, you're fine with it?
TRUMP: You know, I didn't have time to read it, but I get all, I have somebody boom boom. They give me the quotes, it's like five pages. That, you can read, right? And he was very respectful of me.
HABERMAN: Thank you, sir.
TRUMP: Thank you. Peter, thank you.
BAKER: Thank you. Good to see you.
TRUMP: Appreciate it. When they call, let me speak to them.

Texto completo: BOOKS All the Truth' That's Fit To Print
MERCHANTS OF TRUTH: THE BUSINESS OF NEWS AND THE FIGHT FOR FACTS By Jill Abramson Simon & Schuster, 544 pages, $30
Jill Abramson brings a uniquely informed perspective to the question still obsessing the media world: What's required for a news organization to survive in the face of a broken business model and the disruptive force of the internet?
In 2011, Abramson was the first woman ever tapped to serve as executive editor of The New York Times. Less than three years later, she achieved a more dubious distinction, becoming the first woman in that post to be fired. Abramson has implicated sexism in her departure, but she also cops to having a "gruff," unpolished management style.
Since then, the scrappy, Harvard-educated Abramson has continued to write and to teach. Now, in "Merchants of Truth," she has produced an important, if not entirely satisfying, work of explanatory journalism, modeled on David Halberstam's 1979 classic, "The Powers That Be."
Celebrating a high-water mark for American journalism, Halberstam's book interwove the stories of four media behemoths: the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, CBS News and Time Inc. "Merchants of Truth" is that volume's dark mirror, chronicling what Abramson calls the profession's "Age of Anxiety." It juxtaposes the struggles of two legacy organizations, The Washington Post and The New York Times, with those of the start-ups BuzzFeed and Vice Media.
Abramson's focus reflects her obvious desire to draw contrasts between the old and the new and use them to illuminate the way forward. But the players at first seem too disparate to reward such analysis. What lessons, after all, could two ambitious national newspapers draw from a website purpose-built for social media (BuzzFeed) and from a hipster magazine (Vice) that expanded into sensationalistic videos? (Disclosure: I'm a digital subscriber to both the Post and the Times, but before this assignment, I had never read either BuzzFeed or Vice. In other words, I'm a baby boomer, not a millennial.)
Abramson's choice obliges her to neglect the most dramatic story of media decline: the fate of dozens of major metro dailies, as well as smaller papers, that have shrunk their staffs, slashed news holes, killed print editions and in some cases expired entirely. The survivors, including such former heavyweights as the Chicago Tribune and The Boston Globe, remain under threat, with rich private owners and foundations offering the only respite from the accelerating death spiral.
What Abramson does find is surprising: a (limited) convergence of tactics and even sensibilities among the companies she profiles, as all of them try to define just how baldly to allow commercial imperatives to dictate editorial strategy.
As The Washington Post and The New York Times have beefed up their digital presence, invested in video production and sought to attract, and measure, new audiences, BuzzFeed and Vice have tried, with mixed success, to be taken seriously as news organizations. BuzzFeed garnered attention with its controversial decision to publish Christopher Steele's unverified dossier on alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russian electoral interference. And Vice managed to capture damning (and much replayed) video footage of the white-supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Abramson traces not just the manifold business blunders, but also more hopeful omens for the two floundering newspaper companies. For years, as they failed to grasp the enormity of the digital challenge, both had been cutting stuff, though the Times's editorial trims had been more restrained. When The Washington Post Co.'s longtime cash cow, the education company Kaplan Test Prep, took a hit, the Graham family, which owned the Post, was forced to look farther afield for salvation.
Then, fortune took a turn. The Post's sale to billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the renewed dedication of both papers to investigative reporting in the age of Trump, and (not least) the successful institution of digital paywalls have helped boost circulation revenues, staving off disaster. Meanwhile, as BuzzFeed and Vice missed their revenue targets, their Wall Street valuations have tumbled.
Abramson is, as one would expect, a fine reporter with an eye for detail, and she has enjoyed significant access to her subjects, including "bad boy" Vice founder Shane Smith and BuzzFeed's co-founder and CEO, Jonah Peretti. (Of the major players, only the notoriously private Bezos seems to have eluded her.) Her writing is precise but prone to cliches, chief among them what she repeatedly calls "the wall between church and state." That jargon refers to the traditional (now increasingly breached) separation between editorial and business, one of the beachheads on which she herself fought.
Apart from some score-settling, Abramson has tried to be fair to each institution. But - let's be frank - the score-settling, coupled with Abramson's insider perspective, is one of the book's enticements. "I cannot pretend to be objective about all of my experiences at the Times," she admits.
Though Abramson and the Times's current executive editor, Dean Baquet, were once friends and allies, she clearly hasn't forgotten his role, as managing editor, in undercutting her. It was Baquet's ultimatum to then publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., she suggests, that made her dismissal inevitable. (Baquet was angered when Abramson misled him about a key personnel decision, an action she says she took on the advice of the company's CEO, Mark Thompson.) Smarting from criticism of her own leadership style, Abramson happily registers Baquet's subsequent management stumbles, notably his intemperate email to a reporter after a critical column by the Times's then public editor, Liz Spayd.
"Merchants of Truth" is hardly the last word on the still unfolding media crisis. But it belongs on the bookshelf of everyone who cares about the crisis's causes and consequences.

Texto completo: Conjure up an image of a writer in the popular imagination, and you might get an expat struggling in a grubby garret in Paris or a certain movie character weeping as she types "The End."
The reality is that writers have always worked to find buyers for their books, but how that happens has changed with dizzying speed. A more accurate image might be that of a CEO who's a creator in the morning, a marketer in the afternoon and a social media butterfly at night as writers become experts in branding, advertising and the business of publishing.
"Technology has made it possible to put a book anywhere. Anyone in the world can be reading your words, and that's very powerful," says Damon Suede, author of "Verbalize: Bring Stories to Life and Life to Stories" and co-author of "Your A Game: Winning Promo for Genre Fiction." The New York writer is one of the speakers at an all-day conference Saturday, Feb. 9, at the Space Coast Convention Center in Cocoa, a master class for writers of all genres called "Smart Marketing To Sell More Books."
"The problem is," Suede says, "there's a lot of crap."
There are still great books, but they can get lost in a sea of stories. What the flood of titles means for indie or traditional authors — Suede says that line has blurred to the point of near invisibility — is that it's a lot harder for a book to find readers.
"It is far easier to make a living as a writer if you know how to market than it is to make a living as a writer if you know how to write, which is a sad truth," says Jamie Farrell. She writes under her own name and recently adopted a pen name that's a consistent bestseller on Amazon.
"The biggest struggle is finding visibility," says Farrell, who recently taught a two-part workshop on writing and newsletters for Spacecoast Authors of Romance, which is sponsoring the conference. "It's almost more important to know how to market than it is to know how to write a good book these days."
Farrell, who lives in Ohio with her family, shopped her books to traditional publishers for four or five years. "Then I realized you can't sell quirky rom-coms in a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' world."
So, like many writers, she embarked on a self-publishing journey. Her indie romantic comedies were well-reviewed before she started also writing under the pen name, which she keeps a secret. A starred review in Publishers Weekly was "one of the highlights of my career," she says. But having great books wasn't enough. She wanted to stand out and sell more, so she created a highly branded identity, mastered Facebook ads and launched a newsletter fans love.
"Now it's even more important that you know how to market, how to brand yourself, how to be a businessperson. It's not just about the writing anymore," Farrell says. "Writers struggle with that, because we're creatives first."
You don't have to be a businessperson when you write that first book, but you have to be willing to learn, says Maria Connor, whose My Author Concierge business helps authors publish and market their books. Her clients include New York Times and USA Today bestsellers, and on Feb. 9, she'll explain how to "Put Your Money Where Your Readers Are."
"You can learn the industry," says Connor, who's based in Jacksonville and also writes fiction under the name EmKay Connor. "I think you need to know it simply so you can make educated decisions. Do you know what a good cover looks like? Because a bad cover can really damage your sales and your credibility. Do you know how to screen an editor? And those are all things that you can learn."
Fortunately, there are a lot of resources available to help writers keep up with trends and tech, including podcasts, books and workshops.
Less glamour, more grit Is there anything left of the fantasy of champagne and book tours if a writer gets an agent and publisher?
Maybe for the bestsellers who are at the top of the pyramid and getting the biggest advances. Those are the authors whom traditional publishers support the most, says Maria Geraci, a Melbourne author and two-time finalist for the RITA, the top award in romance fiction. She'll appear on a panel Feb. 9 that will discuss paths to publishing.
"Traditional publishing didn't really work for me," says Geraci, who was a labor and delivery nurse when she got her publishing deal. "I had four books published with Penguin-Berkley. They were all published a little differently. None of them really took off."
Then she saw the success her friends were having as indie publishers.
"They could write the kind of stories they wanted to write," Geraci says. "They were on their own timelines. They could market them the way that they wanted. They could respond very quickly to the way the industry was changing, and that was a really exciting thing to see, and I felt like I could make more money eventually and I could write the kind of stories that I wanted to."
She took her Whispering Bay romance series indie, and now she's also writing and publishing funny "chick-lit mysteries," as she calls them.
"I think it's important for writers to have options," says USA Today bestseller Eliza Knight.
Knight writes historical romances, as well as historical women's fiction under the name E. Knight. She's a hybrid author: She built her fan base with indie publishing, but she's writing romances for Sourcebooks and has a French revolution novel pending from William Morrow. On Feb. 9, she'll talk about "How To Use Market Analysis To Sell More Books."
"You have to know your audience, and you have to know the kind of market you're dealing with," says Knight, who lives in Maryland.
She doesn't encourage authors to copycat others' work. Instead, she suggests they analyze successful books and dig deep into what readers are looking for — what excites them and what they want to learn, feel and connect with in a book.
Changing indie landscape While some authors make crazy money as indies, the gold rush of the early days is over, Connor says, and the market is changing all the time.
Authors "have to work a little bit harder," she says. "And people who have invested several years in writing now have an extensive backlist. They've got a great inventory, but the challenge from that side is how do you get in front of new readers? The other challenge is that a lot of the tried and true strategies no longer work."
Among the challenges, Knight says, are scammers exploiting Amazon's Kindle Unlimited subscription program. (Books must be exclusive to Amazon to participate, and authors are paid from a pool of money according to how many pages of their books are read.) Amazon owns 72 percent of the retail book market, according to a Codex survey, so whatever Amazon does affects most authors' income.
A quarter of the authors who responded to a recent Authors Guild survey earned zero book-related income in 2017, and median income for all respondents — traditional, indie, hybrid, part-time and full-time authors — was $6,080, down 3 percent from four years ago.
Full-time U.S. authors' median income rose slightly to $20,300, according to the survey, which had just over 5,000 respondents. The modest sample size and the fact that many people did not finish the survey, partly due to privacy concerns over its invasive financial questions, prompted some in the indie community to question the results. But it's hard to question the notion that there's a lot of competition out there.
More than a million books were published in the United States in 2017, more than triple the number in 2009 — and those are only the books tracked by Bowker, which sells ISBNs, unique identifier numbers for books. Not all book retailers require ISBNs, so the number is likely much higher.
Preparing for luck "There are as many ways to get published as there are books to be written, and it's terrifying," Suede says.
Still, he focuses on positivity. "My idea with marketing is, we are not all the same, but we can all help each other."
The indie world offers opportunities for niche genres like gay romance, which he writes. But the indie explosion means visibility might be even more challenging. He calls it the "eyeball problem."
"We deserve to have our voices heard. Books deserve to find their audiences," says Suede, who also has written for stage and screen and is on the national board of Romance Writers of America. "The trouble now is, it's not hard to write a book. It's not hard to publish a book. It's hard to have an audience for a book."
As his mom used to tell him, luck is opportunity plus preparation, and he always asks authors what they've done today to be ready for exposure. "Most authors don't even have the basics in place, like the most basic branding things," he says, and the idea of being "discovered" and elevated from nothing is just a myth.
"If you want it, you'll do the work. And if you don't, you won't. And most people don't want to earn success. They want to be given success without any effort."

Texto completo: What's with the New York Times and its Ken Griffin fetish?
Inside of a week, the Chicago hedge-fund manager who recently dropped $238 million on a 24,000-square-foot New York City penthouse has been featured in no fewer than three news articles. The purchase set the record for most expensive home sale in the U.S., so it's certainly newsworthy. But does it warrant a 1,700-word front-page article? And a second thousand-word story the following day? That depends on if you share the editors' progressive agenda.
The Gray Lady informs us that Mr. Griffin is worth around $10 billion, collects expensive art, and owns other pricey properties in the U.S. and abroad. A generous philanthropist, he's given away nearly three times as much money as he spent on his new residence. But the paper also wants us to know that he "has declined to join other billionaires in a pact to donate a majority of their wealth to charity" and that "critics" consider him "especially tone deaf" for "spending so freely at a moment when populist movements are gaining momentum around the globe." For good measure, we're told that the penthouse has been constructed on the site of a former rent-stabilized building. Apparently, the reader is expected to blame New York's affordable-housing troubles on Mr. Griffin and his ilk, not idiotic rent-control regulations that discourage developers from building middle-income apartments.
Suddenly, we're not reading real-estate porn anymore. The Times has shoehorned Mr. Griffin into yet another rant about stingy billionaires, income inequality and the supposed need for tax increases to expand the welfare state. A separate article even compares him unfavorably with a previous generation's ultrarich, "who had a prevailing sense that too much was distasteful." Examples include Brooke Astor, who "lived, until her death, in an apartment on Park Avenue that was not in excess of 5,000 square feet," and David and Peggy Rockefeller, who raised six kids in an Upper East Side townhouse that measured a mere 10,000 square feet. Actually, Astor died at 105 in one of her other residences, an 11,000-square-foot manor set on almost 65 acres in suburban Westchester County. And the Rockefeller estate, which is located nearby and occupies 3,500 acres of land, makes the Astor home look modest by comparison. Locals joke that "it's what God would have built, if he had the money."
How Ken Griffin and other wealthy people spend money is their business. But the left's determination to confiscate more of those dollars to redistribute to people they deem worthier concerns everyone. In a free-market system, society's most productive members tend to facilitate upward mobility for all of us, not just for themselves. And not only through their philanthropy.
Oil refining made the Rockefellers rich, but in the process, they made oil products much cheaper and thus more widely available to the poor. Prior to Standard Oil, whale oil and candles were a luxury that only the wealthy could afford. The rest had to go to bed early to save money, explains Burton Folsom, a professor of history at Hillsdale College. "By the 1870s, with the drop in the price of kerosene, middle- and working-class people all over the nation could afford the one cent an hour that it cost to light their homes at night. Working and reading became after-dark activities new to most Americans."
Rockefeller got rich and America got more productive. Henry Ford did something similar in auto manufacturing, as did Sam Walton of Walmart fame with respect to big-box discount stores. Bill Gates has done more for humanity creating his computer-software fortune than he will ever do giving it away through his foundation. Wealth creation plays a far bigger role than philanthropy or government transfer programs in improving our standard of living, something that those forever trying to "stick it to the rich" either don't understand or choose to ignore out of political expedience.
Convinced that more affluent members of our society have succeeded at the expense of the poor, progressives are insisting that Democrats make income inequality a campaign theme in 2020. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says "there's plenty of money in the world" but "it's just in the wrong hands." New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports a 70% top-marginal tax income tax rate and says "a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don't have access to public health is wrong." Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wants a 2% "wealth tax" on people with assets above $50 million.
History provides no evidence that Ken Griffin's wealth is somehow responsible for poverty in the Deep South, or that wealth-transfer schemes help the poor. We'll find out soon enough whether the Democrats' class-warfare rhetoric can convince voters otherwise.

Texto completo: Extreme weather has wreaked havoc worldwide this month: As the upper Midwest shivered with record-breaking cold temperatures thanks to the polar vortex, wild extremes in weather were reported in other parts of the world.
In Australia, blistering heat this month has scorched the country, causing disastrous wildfires and setting temperature records. “Australia is currently experiencing all-time record temperatures – exceeding 115 degrees – and extended heat waves," said John Allen, a meteorologist and climate scientist at Central Michigan University.
In fact, all of Australia – again – is in the midst of one of its hottest summers on record, according to the New York Times. Dozens of wildfires raged on Tasmania, an island off the south coast of Australia.
It's so hot there that snakes are seeking refuge in people’s toilets, the Capital Weather Gang reported.
And in Alaska, it's too warm for sled dog races. "Rain and poor trail conditions have led to the cancellation of this year’s Willow 300 Sled Dog Race," the Anchorage Daily News reported. A stretch of above-freezing temperatures had led to open water on sections of the trail.
In fact, temperatures this week were significantly warmer in parts of Alaska than in the north-central part of the continental U. S. In McGrath, Alaska, a record-breaking temperature of 42 degrees was reported this week, the National Weather Service reported, which was 50 to 60 degrees warmer than portions of Minnesota.
Weird extremes like this may become more commonplace in the future: scientists say a warming world will likely be a more extreme world.
Although "human-caused climate change is not the sole cause of any single extreme event," the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, "changes in the intensity or frequency of extremes may be influenced by human-caused climate change. "
Last June, a report from the World Meteorological Organization warned that the floods, heatwaves and other extreme weather conditions gripping many parts of the world "are likely to continue as a consequence of accelerating climate change. "
“What we are seeing is consistent with climate change scenarios," said WMO spokeswoman Claire Nullis.

More: Arctic cold doesn't refute global warming
Man-made climate change, aka global warming, is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as gas, coal and oil, which release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This extra CO2 causes temperatures of the atmosphere and oceans to rise, allows the atmosphere to hold more water vapor (which can add extra fuel to storms), and causes global sea levels to rise.
Other research has backed up a connection between extreme weather and global warming: A 2014 study in Nature found that bouts of extreme weather are linked to large fluctuations of wind patterns high above the Earth's surface, which could be related to climate change.
"The implication of our study is that if climate change was to make these wave patterns more frequent, this could lead to more heat waves in the western U. S. , droughts in the central U. S. and cold outbreaks in the eastern U. S. ," said James Screen of the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.
That study showed "how large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns are affected by climate change," said climatologist Michael Mann of Penn State University.
Some new research suggests that climate change may make these frigid dips of arctic air down into the U. S. more possible, as a warming Arctic shoves the air from up there down here.

Documentary upsets family of Michael Jackson

LOS ANGELES - Michael Jackson's family members said Monday that they are furious that two men who accuse him of sexually abusing them as boys have received renewed attention because of a new documentary about them.

In a statement, the family denouncedLeaving Neverland, a documentary film featuring Jackson accusers Wade Robson and James Safechuck that premiered last week at the Sundance Film Festival and is set to air in the spring on HBO and the U.K.'s Channel 4.

Michael always turned the other cheek, and we have always turned the other cheek when people have gone after members of our family, the statement said. But we can't just stand by while this public lynching goes on. ....

The family says that he was acquitted at his criminal trial in 2005, in a case involving another young man after an inquiry that included a raid on his Neverland home. Jackson died in 2009.

At that trial, Robson testified that he had slept in Jackson's room many times but that Jackson had never molested him. Safechuck made similar statements as a boy. Both filed lawsuits in 2013 saying trauma had forced them to face the abuse. The suits have been thrown out on technical grounds but are under appeal. The film's director Dan Reed has said he has no doubts about the men's validity.

Howard Schultz meets the 'ratio' mob

Texto completo: Potential 2020 candidate and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz made his debut Saturday on Twitter. He was immediately met by the mind-numbingly stupid “RATIO!” crowd.

For the uninitiated, the “ratio” here is the relationship between the number of replies and the number of shares. A message or sentiment in a specific tweet is measured for its value or the offense it causes by how low or high the ratio of (mostly negative) replies is to the number of (mostly positive) likes or retweets.

Schultz, as of this writing, has posted just seven tweets, and each one got the ratio effect. In other words, there is a concerted effort to assure the person who composed the original tweet that they’ve been shamed and ostracized for their opinion or comment.

At a public event Monday in New York, where Schultz continued his maybe-run for president, a heckler called out to Schultz, “Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter!”

CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski tweeted Tuesday that Schultz “could become the first person to run for office to have every [Twitter] post ratioed.”

Liberal activist Matt Ortega observed that all of Schultz’s tweets were “getting ratio’d.”

Brendan Nyhan, a New York Times contributor and professor at the University of Michigan, tweeted Tuesday, “Has any verified account ever had every single tweet get ratio'd before?”

There’s even a Twitter account called @RatioReport, which purports to track such incidents and then do the actual math on the ratio. It calculated on Sunday that one of Schultz’s tweets had a “like-to-comment ratio of .2791” and a “[re-tweet]-to-comment ratio of .0615.”

If you look through the replies to any one of Schultz’s tweets, there are thousands of replies, and easily a quarter of them are nothing more than remarks like, “i'm responding just because the ratio isn't high enough,” from @willchop and, “Just here for the ratio,” by @colin_ball13.

This is the equivalent of yelling in someone’s face, “EVERYBODY HATES YOU, OKAY?!” It offers no criticism, carries no weight, and only leaves the “ratio” recipient mildly annoyed that he didn’t lead a life so small as to find joy in tweeting, “RATIO!”

Texto completo: Hedgehog owners should refrain from kissing their small, spiky friends, health officials said.
Since Oct. 11, people across eight states have been infected with a particular strain of salmonella, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported, and all but one of those infected said they had contact with a hedgehog.
“Don’t kiss or snuggle hedgehogs because this can spread salmonella germs to your face and mouth and make you sick,” the agency warned.
No deaths have been reported and one person has been hospitalized, the CDC said. Three cases have been reported in Missouri and two in Minnesota. Infections have also been reported in Colorado, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Texas and Wyoming.
Animals can pick up salmonella from contaminated food, or the bacteria can live naturally in their intestines. Some can even pick up the bacteria from their mothers before they are born, according to the CDC’s website.
Although pet hedgehogs may not show signs of sickness, they can carry the bacteria and spread them through their droppings. Once the hedgehog passes the germs to their surroundings - like their toys and beddings - humans are vulnerable to infection when they handle those objects.
This is not the first time pet hedgehogs have been linked to a salmonella outbreak. From December 2011 to April 2013, 26 people were infected with the same bacterial strain, Salmonella typhimurium; a majority of them reported contact with hedgehogs. One person died and eight people were hospitalized in that outbreak, the CDC reported.
“The fact that hedgehogs are a risk is not new,” said Jane Sykes, a professor of small animal internal medicine at the University of California, Davis. “But we don’t know how common the shedding of salmonella is among hedgehogs specifically.”
Scientists also are not sure exactly why hedgehogs seem to be more prone to transmitting salmonella than other animals are, Sykes said. For people with compromised immune systems, she recommends choosing a pet that poses a lower risk.
Salmonella infections can lead to diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. The illness typically resolves itself in four to seven days, although some patients may require hospitalization.
The CDC recommended that owners take precautions, such as washing their hands after touching a hedgehog and not letting their pets loose around the kitchen. Owners should also practice good cage hygiene and avoid bathing a hedgehog in the kitchen sink or allowing it into bed, Sykes said.
Kim Tipton, a hedgehog breeder in Niagara Falls, New York, said a common mistake among owners is leaving leftover food in the hedgehog’s cage for too long. Any foods left uneaten after a couple of hours could spoil and should be taken away, Tipton said. Leaving food out can cause bacteria like salmonella to multiply.
Regardless of the risk of salmonella, Tipton recommends that owners never cuddle or kiss their hedgehogs. They tend to be solitary animals and their quills can be sharp. “It’s not a puppy. It’s not a kitten. It’s not a hamster,” he said.

Texto completo: HARRISBURG - State Sen. Daylin Leach on Monday sued a woman who has accused him of luring her into performing oral sex when she was a teenager and he was an attorney representing her mother in a criminal case nearly 30 years ago.
Mr. Leach, a Democrat from Montgomery County, contends that Cara Taylor, along with two Philadelphia-area women, have defamed him by peddling what he calls a "fictional 1991 encounter" of sexual assault, including in online forums. He is seeking at least $50,000 in damages, according to a copy of the suit filed Monday in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia.
"The three defendants have sought to achieve their goals by seeking to exploit for their own malicious purposes an important political movement in order to broaden the audience of their false claim among a trusting, unknowing, and unsuspecting public, to wrongfully mobilize and incite unwitting accomplices against plaintiff, and to inflict maximum harm on plaintiff and his family based on accusations they know to be false," Mr. Leach contends in the suit.
Mr. Leach, who has repeatedly denied Ms. Taylor's accusation, said he would not discuss the case until Tuesday. His lawyer, Joseph R. Podraza Jr. of Sprague & Sprague, did not return a call seeking comment.
Marni Jo Snyder, a Philadelphia lawyer acting as spokeswoman for the three women, called Mr. Leach's lawsuit "an unsuccessful attempt to silence these women and an attack on free speech."
"They have strong voices that they are entitled to use, and I know that there are many people out there who value those voices. I will only say at this time that truth is an absolute defense to the claim and that Mr. Leach's condemnation of the #MeToo movement as a method for defamation makes me sick."
In filing the suit, Mr. Leach has taken a legal route not often used by public officials who have been accused of misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. Last year in Alabama, former U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was accused of pursuing relationships with teenagers, sued four of his accusers. Those lawsuits are ongoing.
Mr. Leach's lawsuit targets Ms. Taylor and two other women - Colleen Kennedy of Havertown and Gwen Snyder of Philadelphia, both activists in the #MeToo movement. He contends Ms. Kennedy and Ms. Snyder have "shown a reckless disregard for the truth in gleefully republishing and embellishing upon the serial liar's fabrication."
Ms. Kennedy is among several women who spoke out against Mr. Leach after a December 2017 story in the Inquirer and Daily News that detailed allegations from eight women and three men who claimed the senator behaved inappropriately toward young female campaign staffers and volunteers between 2008 and 2016.
In response, Mr. Leach on Facebook called Ms. Kennedy "a truly horrific monster" and a "human wrecking ball of hate." He later deleted the comment, of which several people took screenshots.
Ms. Snyder, a delegate during the 2016 Democratic National Convention, accused a fellow delegate, Walter Weeks, of indecent assault in a case that generated national headlines. A Philadelphia Municipal Court judge acquitted Mr. Weeks, ruling that the testimony of two character witnesses provided on Mr. Weeks' behalf was enough to raise reasonable doubt.
Senate Democrats announced last week that they had hired an outside law firm to investigate Ms. Taylor's allegations. The move came after Ms. Taylor distributed to the offices of nearly every senator copies of a private criminal complaint that described the alleged assault.
She said that decades ago, Mr. Leach had asked her to perform oral sex when she was 17, while he was representing her mother, Kathleen Speth, in an attempted homicide case. Ms. Taylor was convicted of perjury after she falsely took the blame for the crime, for which her mother was ultimately convicted.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Leach said Ms. Taylor "conveniently declined" to sign the private criminal complaint and distribute it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said last week that Ms. Taylor had met with a prosecutor and investigator from his office, but that his office had not received a formal copy of her complaint. Mr. Martin said Ms. Taylor was told that her case fell outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges
On Monday, Temple University law professor and civil rights lawyer David Kairys said it is unusual to see public officials file defamation suits. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, New York Times v. Sullivan, established that a public official must show the remarks were made with actual malice - "that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth."
Mr. Kairys also said the court case differentiated between statements of fact and statements of opinion. The latter, he said, leaves ample room for people to express controversial and even incendiary points of view.
"You don't see this much, and in my view, you shouldn't," Mr. Kairys said of such lawsuits, "because when you go into public life, you really should have thicker skin than that."
Mr. Kairys also said such suits by public officials run the danger of being viewed as silencing critics.
Such actions, nicknamed SLAPP lawsuits - or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation - have been the subject of legislation in recent years.
Last session, the state Senate passed a bill aimed at curbing and quickly resolving such suits. Mr. Leach was a co-sponsor and voted for it. The measure died in the House.

'Jagged Little Pill' Bound for Broadway

Texto completo: Here's some news you oughta know: "Jagged Little Pill" is coming to Broadway.
Producers said on Monday that the musical, which uses the song catalog of Alanis Morissette to confront such contemporary issues as rape culture and addiction, will open next fall. They did not specify a theater or a date.
"Jagged Little Pill" has had one previous production, a sold-out 10-week run last year at the nonprofit American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.
Reviewing the show for The New York Times, the critic Jesse Green said it "takes on the good work we are always asking new musicals to do: the work of singing about real things," but added, "if only it didn't sing about all of them all at once." In the Boston Globe, Christopher Muther expressed similar misgivings about the catalog of social issues crammed into the plot, but called it "wildly entertaining" and "wickedly funny in just the right places."
The musical features songs written by Ms. Morissette and Glen Ballard, many of them from the 1995 album that gives the show its title, and a book by Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter for "Juno." Diane Paulus, who is the artistic director of the A.R.T. and a Tony winner for "Pippin," is the director.
The cast in Cambridge was led by Elizabeth Stanley and featured a showstopping Lauren Patten in a supporting role; the cast for Broadway has not yet been named.
The musical, with Vivek J. Tiwary, Arvind Ethan David and Eva Price as lead producers, is expected to be capitalized for up to $14 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The producers said that they expect the final cost to be slightly lower.
In an interview, the producers said the show is being revised somewhat after its last production. "We were quite happy with the work we did on our original musical, but you can always keep improving, and the changes we have made are many, many little ones that add up to a more streamlined, layered, and deeper show," Ms. Price said. "The world has continued to change, and that has affected the writing and the direction."
The producers have been working on the show for nearly nine years, largely because of the complexity of hammering out rights agreements for the songs. "We wanted to produce something that was not just another Broadway musical, but was true to the legacy of the record," Mr. Tiwary said. "We want to be an entertaining musical with messages."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Immigrant workers at Trump golf club fired
A dozen immigrant workers at one of President Donald Trump's golf clubs in New York who are in the U.S. illegally were fired this month even though managers had known about their legal status for years, an attorney for the workers said Saturday. As the president railed during the partial government shutdown against immigrants coming into the country illegally, a manager at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County called a dozen immigrant workers into a room one by one Jan. 18 and fired them, lawyer Anibal Romero said. The firings come after workers at another Trump club in New Jersey came forward last month to say managers there had hired them knowing they were in the country illegally and had even helped one obtain phony documents. The crackdown at the New York club was first reported by The Washington Post. The Associated Press left messages with the Trump Organization seeking comment. Eric Trump depicted the firings to the Post as a normal course of business.
Koch donors meet for 2020 strategy - Hundreds of wealthy donors gathered by the conservative billionaire industrialist Charles Koch are meeting in Indian Wells, Calif., this weekend for the first time since his powerful political network said it wouldn't support President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. It remains to be seen how much the Koch network's biannual meeting will address Trump directly, but some donors have already publicly expressed disappointment about the divide in Republican circles. The Koch network is planning to back races for the U.S. Senate and House and state legislative seats to make the greatest impact, spokesman James Davis said.
Agents target cyber watchdogs - Researchers who reported that Israeli software was used to spy on Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi's inner circle before his gruesome death are being targeted in turn by international undercover operatives, The Associated Press has found. Twice in the past two months, men masquerading as socially conscious investors have lured members of the Citizen Lab internet watchdog group to meetings at luxury hotels to quiz them for hours about their work exposing Israeli surveillance and the details of their personal lives. In both cases, the researchers believe they were secretly recorded. Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert described the stunts as "a new low."
Ohio city is target of ransomware - A financially motivated cyberattack on computer servers forced the city of Akron, Ohio, to shut down its 311 call center line as it prepared to dig out from a snowstorm. A city spokeswoman said the attack included ransomware that demanded thousands of dollars. Mayor Dan Horrigan said the attack also targeted "critical" hardware and software systems. The FBI and Ohio State Highway Patrol have joined Akron's investigation into the attack. Gov. Mike DeWine approved Horrigan's request for state help and activated eight cybersecurity experts from the Ohio National Guard Cyber Team.
Backers applaud Rep. King despite rebuke - Constituents applauded Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, on Saturday at his first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he made this month. King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology, and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist. The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"

Texto completo: Roger Stone, a longtime associate of President Donald Trump who was arrested by the FBI in Fort Lauderdale on Friday in a dramatic, predawn raid, is one of South Florida's most politically notorious residents.
Stone had long predicted that he might be indicted as the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign moved closer and closer to him during 2018.
After his first court appearance on Friday, Stone defiantly maintained his innocence, denounced Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and pledged his unwavering loyalty to Trump.
Stone operates on the national political stage, but Fort Lauderdale is his home base. He lives in a rented, $1.6 million home on one of the finger islands off Las Olas Boulevard - a prestigious address.
Stone lives with his wife, the Cuban-born Nydia Bertran Stone, and their dogs. His stepson, Scott Stone, is a detective at the Broward Sheriff's Office.
He hasn't shied from the negative spotlight. Instead, he has reminded readers of his troubles, in mass emails from his Stone Zone blog.
In July, for example, one email told readers that "Stone has been a subject of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations and said he may be facing indictment for unspecified crimes arising from the 2016 presidential campaign."
Ground zero Broward
Stone said he first publicly mentioned that he'd had contact with Julian Assange of Wikileaks in an August 2016 speech to the Southwest Broward Republicans in Pembroke Pines.
He later said he didn't directly communicate with Wikileaks or Assange but used an intermediary "confirming source," whom he identified as comedian Randy Credico.
Stone returned to the club in June 2018, calling it the "scene of no crime." He told the Southwest Broward Republicans that he received nothing from Assange or from the Russian state, and thus passed nothing on to the Trump campaign or to Trump himself.
"Now, it is not inconceivable," he said, "that the special counsel could still go out and conjure up some offense against me in an attempt to get me to testify against the president. But my independent political activities on behalf of the president are perfectly legal and meticulous. There is no evidence of Russian collusion."
He said he'd already spilled his guts to the Senate Intelligence Committee, an experience he likened to "a proctological examination."
Bush lite
Broward voters have had a taste of Stone's electioneering tactics, a menu of shenanigans that earned him the lasting moniker "dirty trickster."
Stone typically doesn't bother with local races. But the Broward sheriff's post is an exception.
First, in 2008, Stone worked to get then-Broward Sheriff Al Lamberti re-elected. Lamberti, a Republican, defeated challenger Scott Israel, a Democrat.
Four years later, Stone, a Libertarian, switched sides and helped Israel defeat Lamberti.
Stone's calling card is the misleading robocall, using Caller ID spoofing.
Democratic voters in the 2008 race, for example, received a Stone-created robocall from a George W. Bush sound-a-like, endorsing Israel as a like-minded Republican. Israel was a registered Democrat, and the call was designed to fool Democratic voters. The Caller ID made it appear the call came from an official Republican organization.
'Ain't beanbag'
The 2012 race also featured spoofing robocalls, as well as a Stone-affiliated Twitter account - Andrew Miller's Broward Bugle - that unleashed attacks on Israel's foes.
"We have zero control over the Bugle and Roger," said Stone's longtime friend Ron Gunzburger, who ran Israel's successful 2012 campaign and was hired as Broward Sheriff's Office general counsel. "No one can get Roger to do anything he doesn't want to do."
"Politics in South Florida ain't beanbag," Stone told the Sun Sentinel at the time. "My activities are legal and protected by the First Amendment. When I do it, I just do it better."
Stone had help.
Credico, a comedian and impersonator now ensnared in the Mueller investigation, has admitted working with Stone on the 2008 and 2012 Broward sheriff's campaigns.
Among the characters on the robocalls: Al Sharpton, former President George W. Bush, Rudy Giuliani and Richard Nixon.
"He had me doing some dirty tricks I don't want to get into," Credico told the New York Times, before explaining the impressionistic robocalls. "Both times. Had me doing things that were untoward."
On Sept. 7, Credico told CNN he testified before the Mueller grand jury.
"Most of it was about Roger Stone," he told MSNBC in a televised interview on Sept. 10.
Bomb thrower
In 2016, Stone said he had "bigger fish to fry" than the local races.
He was helping his friend of nearly 40 years, Donald Trump, get elected.
To that end, Stone started a false rumor that Broward Elections Supervisor Dr. Brenda Snipes met with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The allegation fed Trump's conspiracy theories that the election would be rigged. The insinuation was that Snipes, a Democrat, was in league with the Democratic nominee.
Snipes called the allegation a "big, fat lie." Stone claimed he would provide proof on Infowars.com, the domain of far-right commentator Alex Jones. But, he didn't.
Lawyering up
For legal representation in the Mueller matter, Stone is using two Fort Lauderdale-based attorneys.
Robert Buschel and Grant Smith are representing Stone. The three worked together at the now-defunct Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler law firm in Fort Lauderdale.
Media hardball
Stone has tangled with the media for years, hurling vulgarities on social media at his perceived enemies.
His pro-Sheriff-Israel Twitter account, the Broward Bugle, tweeted "C U Next Tuesday" to the Sun Sentinel's editorial board editor several years ago, for the crude acronym.
After he was banned from Twitter in 2017 for his frequent inflammatory and expletive-laden attacks on the media, he directed the same "C U Next Tuesday" slur on Instagram to a Vanity Fair reporter.
Did I mention I have a book for sale?
Stone capitalizes on his notoriety, hawking his books around South Florida, as he complains about a "witch hunt" against him.
A prolific author who tries to influence others, his books certainly are not about winning friends.
His titles include "Jeb! and the Bush Crime Family," "The Clintons' War on Women," and "The Man Who Killed Kennedy, the Case Against LBJ."
He parlays his place in the headlines into sales pitches for his books.
In a May email from his Stone Zone website, for example, he offers insight into how he has survived "the endless smears, personal attacks and innuendo" regarding Russian collusion.
Those insights, he said, are contained in his latest book, "Stone's Rules."
"Now you can read and employ these vital and current rules for yourself," it read.
Howard Appell, president of the Gold Coast Tiger Bay Club, said he has not heard from Stone about Stone's scheduled Feb. 13 appearance, but he's working on potential backups.
"We have a message into his manager," he said Friday. "We are waiting to see what happens in court."
He said he'd welcome Stone if he's still willing to speak. Stone has spoken several times at the club.
"If he is able to do it, absolutely," Appell said.
Back to square one
Though he's been in politics for decades, Stone earned his political chops working on the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon.
That explains the ink on Stone's back - a permanent, tattooed image of Nixon.
Stone once said in email to the Sun Sentinel that the tattoo is a reminder that no matter the setbacks, "when you get knocked down, you have to get up, dust yourself off and get back in the game - and never, ever quit."

Texto completo: Aid to countries won't solve immigration issues
At his Jan. 19 emergency town hall meeting in Lafayette, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier put forth his solution to the immigration problem that the U.S. should provide more foreign aid to the countries asylum-seekers are coming from in order to help strengthen their economies so that they would be incentivized to stay home an old idea that has not worked so far.
My wife is from Venezuela. It is extremely naive to think that we could provide enough aid to repair its economy and those of the other countries in Latin America (and the rest of the world) where illegal immigrants are coming from. Many of these countries have corrupt government leaders and criminals who siphon off aid for their personal accounts.
And even if the aid did make its way to its intended purpose, it would take decades for it to improve living conditions enough to stem the flow of migrants.
William Lau, Lafayette
Working without pay is bad, but not like slavery
Re: "Is it slavery to force federal workers to work with no pay?" (Letter to the editor, Jan. 22):
No! While it is disgraceful that federal workers are being held hostage to an egomaniac's demands, likening the workers' situation to slavery is totally inappropriate.
The majority of those working without pay still have a warm home to retreat to and, increasingly, help in a variety of ways from multiple sources to ameliorate their undeserved circumstances.
Not so for slaves who were forced to work from "day clean to first dark" under the evil scrutiny of overseers and to endure lashes from their whips.
Slaves subsisted on meager provisions, lived in fear in an inhumane environment and had no one to advocate for their welfare.
I could go on.
Given these realities, I don't think equating the condition of unpaid federal workers with brutalized slaves is reasonable or just.
Barbara McClain, Rodeo
Let U.S. budget rise when there is an impasse
One service that President Trump is performing is a thorough probing of our governing system for weaknesses, particularly with respect to the administrative, legislative and judicial balance of power.
Currently, he has highlighted a flaw in the budgeting process, wherein the door is open for the president or either body of Congress to use the welfare of citizens as an extortive bargaining tool, in the current case causing the withholding of many government workers' pay while handicapping important governmental functions in an effort to get funding for an unrelated particular object.
When calm again prevails, Congress should, with bipartisan legislation, ensure that during such impasses, the budget automatically rises sufficiently to ensure the functioning and meeting of commitments.
Such legislation would be bipartisan, because over time, without the legislation, all parties could/would find it expedient to again legally extort.
Wallace Clark, Concord
Trump's climate-change denials raise awareness
A Jan. 23 article in the East Bay Times pointed out the American public's rapid awakening to the dangers of global warming ("Global warming concerns rise among Americans" (Page A4).
Anthony Leiserowitz of Yale University, a veteran pollster and lead author of the survey that developed the data, was quoted in a New York Times publication a day earlier, saying "I've never seen jumps in some of the key indicators like this."
He attributed recent increases in awareness to extreme weather events with plausible connections to a warming planet and to publicity that surrounded two major scientific reports on climate change last year. He said they were also tied to politics and to the efforts of President Trump to deny the scientific evidence of climate change.
Dr. Leiserowitz said, "Every time he talks about climate change he drives more media attention to the exact issue and a majority of the country in the opposite direction."
Douglas Merrill, Lafayette

How the Dems came to love ‘co-equal’

Texto completo: The divided government of 2019 is a mirror image of the divided government of 2011. Back then, Democrats controlled the White House and Senate, while Republicans had recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, Republicans control the White House and Senate, while Democrats have recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2018 midterms.
It’s the same situation, essentially. But today there is a vastly different public conversation about the balance of power in government. These days, we are often reminded that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and therefore Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands on an even level with President Trump. Back in 2011, when the two players were Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama, there wasn’t as much of that kind of talk.
Now, Democrats have been saying it every day. There was even talk to the effect that Pelosi is now equal to the president. The chief advocate: Pelosi herself. "Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, ‘The Constitution does,’" The New York Times reported in an article about the speaker.
A Jan. 17 discussion on CNN focused on the speaker’s battle with the president over the government shutdown and State of the Union address. Republican Rep. Michael Turner said of Pelosi, "She needs to come to some recognition that she’s not equal to the president of the United States."
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar, CNN analyst, and editor of the blog Lawfare, blanched. "Pretty wild to hear a member of Congress forcefully argue that congressional leaders are constitutionally inferior to the president," Hennessey tweeted. "James Madison weeps."
But the speaker of the House is not, in fact, equal to the president of the United States. Congress, not the House, is a co-equal branch of government. Actually, more than equal — it is, as Pelosi noted, the first branch of government. But to exert its will, Congress must be united. To overrule the president — and, of course, Congress can even remove the president — Congress must be united.
Pelosi controls just half of Congress. And she only controls the House when she gets 218 members to agree with her. To overrule a presidential veto, she needs 287 members to agree with her. And then the Senate, controlled by Republicans under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has to go along.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person. That gives that one person, in this case President Trump, the power of the executive branch. No single person in the other two branches has that power.
The bottom line is the House is one-half of a co-equal branch of government. The system simply was not designed for a head-to-head equal competition — the president versus the speaker. It doesn’t work that way. It’s entirely understandable that Democrats and their allies in the press would want to see Pelosi as equal to the president.
But that doesn’t make it true.

From Covington Catholic to an Uneasy Davos; Media bias was on full display in the U.S. as global elites gathered to reassure each other that it'll all be OK

Texto completo: There's a delicious irony in the headline that the New York Times gave its first story about the Covington Catholic affair this week: "Boys in 'Make America Great Again' Hats Mob Native Elder at Indigenous Peoples March."
We now know that this was not only false but a fabrication manufactured from the richly embroidered skeins of bias that uncoil each day from the minds of predisposed journalists. It also misidentified the mob. The only hate-spewing gang that gathered last weekend was the media crowd that beat unrecognizable and left for dead the reputations of a group of teenage schoolboys whose sole offense was that they were white, apparently Trump supporters and, best of all, Catholic--a group toward whom hatred is routinely legitimized and sanctioned by leading politicians.
The whole sorry event should be a seminal moment in the evolution of news. It neatly underscores how far many "reporters" have strayed from a core--perhaps the central--objective of journalism: to challenge what is supposedly clearly visible. The only interesting news to report is the story that's not obvious, the picture that not everyone can see. When a received version of events bursts into public view, the response of the thoughtful journalist isn't to pile on with the outrage. It's to stop and look skeptically and ask if there's another angle.
You think it's likely? Me neither.
The Covington story didn't penetrate much into the consciousness of the people gathered this week in Davos, Switzerland, where I've spent the last few days at the annual World Economic Forum meeting.
The gathering was defined more by notable absences: President Trump, fighting a rear-guard action to salvage some political capital from the wreckage of the government shutdown; Theresa May, desperately trying to construct some kind of habitable Brexit from the charred timbers of her ill-fated deal; Emmanuel Macron, figuratively penned up in the Élysée Palace as the yellow vests swarm around him. Carlos Ghosn, the deposed chairman of Renault-Nissan, was another familiar face not here, for a different reason. One of the few world leaders who did come was the newly triumphant populist Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and he rather oddly stayed and spoke for about seven minutes.
All of these absences are a useful reminder that there are strengthening political forces in many countries that are steadily overwhelming the globalist dreams of the folk who come here.
The Davos gathering has for a while now had a slight feeling of a besieged fortress, where the world's business, political and cultural establishment comes to reassure each other that, despite the rising hum of the angry crowds beyond the walls, everything will be OK. Throw them a few crumbs of rhetorical concern about inequality and economic insecurity, chant a few mantras about the need for a more inclusive global economy, and we can go back to what really gets our juices flowing: competitive virtue-signalling on the planet's climatological peril or the urgent need to widen cultural diversity. They go away, girded to face the unruly world, comforted in the knowledge that their historically unmatched material and cultural privilege will be secure for another year at least.
The mood among those who came this year was uneasy. Gone was the optimism about global "synchronized growth" from last year. Gone was a glimmer of belief that escalating prosperity might be enough to see off the barbarians at the gate.
Above all, China looms on everyone's horizon. And not mainly because of fears of trade war. Most of the CEOs, Wall Street crowd and others I spoke to seemed to think a trade deal between President Trump and President Xi Jinping was likely. The real fear is manifest in a mounting sense that this is a mere skirmish in a more consequential struggle for the world over the next decade.
For many people here, the passing of the years is marked in Davosian time. One participant captured the sense of foreboding well: "Last year's Davos felt like 2006. This year's feels like 2007." Those years, of course, marked respectively the peak of the frenzied optimism of the last business cycle and the first chilling presentiments of what was to come. We all know what 2008 brought.

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate.
The truth is, Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and ... the very first primary,' " according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
Trump was expressing praise and admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
A plank in the GOP platform regarding U.S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
How does the president explain the appearance of a quid pro quo? By claiming that he was just keeping his options open. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won," Trump said in November, "in which case I would have gotten back into the (real estate development) business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won." By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a major business deal with a major U.S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters.

Texto completo: For years, Kristen Ulmer was aware of most everything that swirled around her in the zany world of extreme skiing.

She knew she was the top woman in the world, she knew she was better than a lot of the men and she knew a lot of those men were drawn to her bigger-than-life personality and pioneering ability. She knew she had a chip on her shoulder, had something to prove, was a rebel with a cause and was fast evolving into a film star, helping to promote the sport that seems to defy gravity.
One thing that she failed to realize, however, was her view on fear. Ulmer, who grew up in Henniker and trained exclusively at Pats Peak as a junior skier, tried to fight the feeling, conquer it, beat it out of her system while preparing to ski down snow and rock at near-90 degree angles.
As Ulmer told me by phone, the “extreme” in extreme skiing translates into “risking your life.” Surely there was no room for this sort of emotion while trying to focus on the task at hand: dropping off a cliff.
Now Ulmer sees things differently. Invite fear in for a cup of coffee, maybe even a full dinner, she says. Introduce yourself, get to know each other. Do more than merely accept it. Use it. Your body and mind will thank you later.
She'll bring that philosophy with her into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in April. Superstar Alpine skier Bode Miller of Easton is going in as well. She'll also bring her words of wisdom to Pats Peak on Wednesday, when she'll participate in the Pats WOW group, or Women's Only Wednesday program, a seven-week class that began this month.
Topics include proper boot fitting and equipment in general. This Wednesday, with Ulmer leading the program, it will have to do with Zen philosophy, the mind and coping. It will have to do with nurturing your relationship with fear.
“I was good at ignoring fear,” Ulmer said. “Repressing fear will cause problems. The part of fear I merged with made me great, the best in the world, but the part I repressed caused burnout and injuries.”
She spoke from Florida, where she was visiting her parents. She grew up in Henniker and attended Henniker High School, which is now John Stark Regional.
She's 52 and married, spending half her time in Salt Lake City, Utah, half her time in Mexico, and full-time trying to teach athletes and regular people that acknowledging fear is more than okay; it's a must. She uses camps, one-on-one discussions and seminars to spread her message.
“Emotional intelligence is taught by everyone as the ability to understand and control your emotions,” Ulmer told me. “That's what causes emotional issues in our culture. The treatment is the cause.”
While listening to Ulmer and digesting her philosophy, it's easy to forget that she is one of the state's hidden gems, a towering figure, of course, within the skiing community, but relatively unknown elsewhere.
In 1997, she became the first woman ever to ski the Grand Teton, at a time when a lot of men were shying away from trying. She was considered the best big-mountain extreme women's skier in the world, a title she held for 12 years.
She was a member of the 1991 U.S. Ski team, bouncing down mountains in mogul competition with a staccato flow that hurts your knees just to watch.
Later, she began her film career, often featured in famed ski filmmaker Warren Miller's movies. She's been featured in the New York Times and NPR, and she appeared on Megyn Kelly's morning show last August.
The freestyle skiers on the World Cup circuit sought to improve so they could join the best of the best in Ulmer's world, the one of independence and exhibitions and movie-making.
Fellow extreme skier Danny Egan of Campton nominated his friend to the Hall of Fame. His background traveling the world with Ulmer gives him the best platform with which to provide context on who this woman is and what she has meant to the sport.
We spoke by phone from Montana, where he was powder skiing and talking over the wind that snapped like a flag in the background. Ulmer was an early pioneer on the North Face Extreme Team, making six videos in seven years.
“She is featured and she often out-jumped most of the guys,” Egan said. “She punched it as hard as she could on any cliff. She wanted to be and was one of the guys. Her New Hampshire background is key. She's not afraid to put her chin to the wind. She made her name by skiing with all of us.”
Then, Egan dropped the bottom-line message here, the reason Ulmer is so important: “She broke the ground for other women today,” he said. “Women pro-skiers today are standing on Kristen's back.”
Ulmer was one of about 20 female extreme skiers worldwide back in her peak years. She went into each exhibition with a mountain-sized chip on her shoulder, telling me, “Not in a hostile way, but playful. There would be five guys and me filming a movie and I would secretly say, ‘I'm going to kick your asses,' and ‘Okay guys, let's see what you got.' ”
Egan said Ulmer's intentions were never much of a secret. He recognized what she was doing, which was to put men in their place, calm their egos, bring them back down to earth.
“In skiing there is a combination of the physical, confidence and ability, and she had all three,” Egan said. “That created her personality. When you watched the old movies, she is skiing with attitude. You can see that part of her. This was a guy's world, and to make it you needed to have that attitude.”
Ulmer spoke out against the FIS – the governing body of the World Cup circuit – saying in an old interview that the members should “keep their noses out of our business. They've killed the spirit of skiing in the past by making too many rules.”
She skied where many men had not gone before, and she looked good doing it. Attractive, outspoken and edgy, magazine articles from 20 and 25 years ago mentioned Ulmer's sex appeal, adding that the male extreme skiers wanted to do more than merely get to know her.
“All the men skiers wanted to sleep with me,” she told me.” People who are extreme skiers are outrageous people, over-the-top personalities, and over-the-top men want to date over-the-top women. I was the poster child for that.”
Her videos and movies say a lot. In one clip, Ulmer drops vertically on a landscape of snow interspersed with big patches of rock. She does a backflip, lands, disappears in a cloud of snow, then re-emerges on her skis, back in control, continuing her descent, doing what she once did better than any woman in the world.
By the end of the 1990s, though, Ulmer says she  began to change. Sure, she was older, but that's not what was hampering her performances.
Instead, all those years of skiing in the world of make-believe, of convincing herself that fear and extreme skiing could never form an alliance, had taken its toll.
“I had to be stoic and rigid and masculine to be fearless,” she told me. “You can get away with it for 10 years, and then your life unravels. I started to break. Repression of my fears was causing more injuries, and I was burnt out by not dealing with fear. I had PTSD, saw friends die in the mountains and had 15 near-death experiences.”
She went to a Zen master, learning to coexist with fear and studying for 16 years. When I mentioned that accepting fear seemed to be important, she quickly corrected me, saying, “It's not mere acceptance. That is passive.”
Ulmer told me she agreed with Franklin Delano Roosevelt when, during his 1933 inauguration, he said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”
“You don't want a war with fear, because it's unwinnable,” Ulmer said. “It's killing us.”
She's written a book, The Art of Fear, published in 2017. She's the focal point of a film, Voices of Fear, and is on tour conducting question-and-answer segments after screenings, including an appearance Thursday in Boston and next Friday in Reading, Mass.
She'll be at Pats Peak for the WOW program on Wednesday, coming home to where she once ignored her true feelings in the name of toughness.
She was tested on Megyn Kelly's show last summer, telling me, “You don't meet her or see the bright lights until 20 seconds before you are on. You go from a windowless, dark back room to going on live, so, yes, of course I was nervous.”
And that was just fine.

Kellyanne Conway painted as 'cartoon villian' and serial leaker in ex-White House official's tell-all book

Texto completo: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway is a real-life Cruella de Vil from "101 Dalmatians," according to a former Trump administration colleague's new book.

Cliff Sims, an ex-special assistant to the president and assistant communications director for White House message strategy, excoriates Conway in his memoir "Team of Vipers," describing how "it became hard to look long at her without getting the sense that she was a cartoon villain brought to life" over the course of his 500 days in the West Wing.

"Her agenda — which was her survival over all others, including the president — became more and more transparent. Once you figured that out, everything about her seemed so calculated; every statement, even a seemingly innocuous one, seemed poll-tested by a focus group that existed inside her mind," Sims writes in an excerpt published by Vanity Fair on Wednesday. "She seemed to be perennially cloaked in an invisible fur coat, casting an all-knowing smile, as if she’d collected 98 Dalmatians with only 3 more to go."

Sims, an Alabama conservative media company founder who was once touted as a possible replacement for fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Senate, also recalls in the book being summoned to Conway's office in May 2017 to help draft a statement refuting claims from MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough that she trashed Trump behind his back, despite defending him on TV. Once there, she asked him to type a response on her personal MacBook laptop, which was synced to her iPhone's iMessage account.

"Kellyanne was sitting at her desk texting away," he writes. "Over the course of 20 minutes or so, she was having simultaneous conversations with no fewer than a half-dozen reporters, most of them from outlets the White House frequently trashed for publishing 'fake news.' Journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Politico, and Bloomberg were all popping up on the screen. And these weren’t policy conversations, or attempts to fend off attacks on the president. As I sat there trying to type, she bashed Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, and Sean Spicer, all by name."

Conway on Wednesday hit back at Sim's account.

“The real leakers, past and present, get much more positive press than I do. While it’s rare, I prefer to knife people from the front, so they see it coming,” Conway said in a statement to Vanity Fair after it published the excerpt. Sims' "Team of Vipers" is set for release on Jan. 29.

On health care and beyond, Thomas Edsall considers the Dems’ leftward shift

Texto completo: In my middle-class family (of origin), we were raised to acknowledge and appreciate our good fortune, like good health and the freedom middle-class Americans had to pursue their dreams, but also to knock wood when acknowledging it, which was insurance against jinxing said good fortune. (The wood-knocking tradition apparently had pagan roots.) In my family, if no wood was handy, you could knock yourself on the noggin.
In that spirit, I gratefully acknowledge my good fortune that since birth I have had mostly good health, and have also always been covered by health insurance, first provided by my parents, then via various jobs. And now I qualify for the program that we call Medicare (so we don’t have to call it socialized medicine for seniors).
Lucky me. I’ve had many advantages in life: brave grandparents who emigrated here from a much worse place, parents who worked hard and sacrificed so their kids could have a shot at the good life in America, a healthy body, and now a wonderful wife and kids who were born with healthy bodies and access to health care. I know a lot of people have been less fortunate.
I don’t know how central any of the above is to my basically liberal leanings (probably a lot). But, personally, perhaps based on what is sometimes mockingly called liberal guilt, I have long been ready to support social democratic programs, like, for example, single-payer health care. (I know, I’m supposed to say “Medicare for All” now. Fine. Either way, I’m for it. Having never had to worry about access to health care, I want that peace of mind for everyone.)
Despite the self-mockery above, I don’t know how to morally justify the status quo in U.S. health policy in which our nation, one of the most affluent in the world, has one of the highest (or is it the highest, among the wealthy nations?) share of its population who are uninsured. Health care policy and economics – especially in the USA – can be maddeningly complex, and the policy discussion is fraught with political peril.
The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was ridiculously complicated, made too many concessions to the medical/pharmaceutical/health insurance megaplex, and didn’t do enough to reduce the uninsured portion of the U.S. population. But, considering how difficult it was to get it passed, it was probably the biggest step toward reducing the ranks of the uninsured that could have passed. And it has – significantly – helped formerly uninsured people get covered.
The ACA’s enemies are determined to repeal it, or at least continue to weaken it. This graph from the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrates two things at a glance.
From 2011 – the year the ACA began to be implemented, to 2016, the uninsured portion of the non-elderly U.S. population was reduced from 17.8 percent,to 10.0 percent. Not quite cut in half, but almost. It dropped every year, although the decline certainly was stalling. The closest the United States has ever been to having universal coverage was 2016.
Also in 2016, Hillary Clinton ran for president promising some smallish improvements in the program. Bernie Sanders ran advocating movement toward “Medicare for All,” which was another, presumably less politically scary name for single-payer government subsidized health care. And Donald Trump ran on repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with something that he couldn’t describe intelligibly, perhaps because the replacement program didn’t exist.
In case you’re just waking up from a long nap, Trump won the election. But, despite Republican control of all branches, the dream of “repeal and replace” failed.
The Trump administration continues to try to hamper the ACA in small ways. In 2017, for the first time in seven years, according to Kaiser, the portion of non-elderly Americans who are covered by health insurance declined, but only slightly. Efforts on many fronts across all three branches of the federal government continue to starve or poison the ACA program continue. Nothing very big has happened.
And now that Democrats have retaken control of the U.S. House, talk of ACA repeal is mostly over. Democrats oppose repeal, but are divided between those (like Sanders and many of the fiery lefties who were just elected) continue to push for something much closer to single payer/Medicare for all.
Which brings me to this week’s New York Times column by the great Thomas Edsall, which is what set me off in this small diatribe, or ode to my late parents. As usual, Edsall corresponded with scholars and other smarties seeking their insights into political and policy questions, in this case about the future of health care policy.
Edsall wasn’t fundamentally exploring ACA repeal. He was asking his correspondents more about the coming clash within the Democratic Party between its left and its centrist (or center-left) branches.
Before 2016, even the leftmost tended not to use the word “socialism” (as in “socialized medicine”). They were pretty shy about what might be called far-left liberalism.
Sanders, who has called himself a “democratic socialist” for decades (and still doesn’t call himself a member of the Democratic Party, even though he sought its presidential nomination in 2016 and may do so again in 2020), took many positions that were outside the boundaries of conventional Democratic Party liberalism, made a strong run for the Democratic nomination and may try again in 2020. Meanwhile, a substantial cadre of new young Democrats emerged who don’t shy away from the S-word and advocate for policies that used to be considered nut-left positions, like single-payer health care.
That has changed. Many young Democrats call for unambiguously single-payer health care (although some prefer “Medicare for All”).
Freshman Democratic superstar U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York calls herself a Democratic Socialist and says health care is a basic human right. And she’s not the only one among young Democrats.
This is precisely the phenomenon Edsall is exploring in his column, but he notes an obvious tension. Ocasio-Cortez represents a powerful new left in the party, but the same party includes moderate liberals who certainly are not comfortable with the S-word.
Some Democrats, though a shrinking share, call themselves moderates and a few even call themselves conservatives. But the furthest left group are the most active Democrats and the most likely to, for example, vote in primaries, which raises the possibility that the moderate Democrats may find themselves uncomfortable with some of the party’s nominees.
Edsall quotes David Graham of The Atlantic, who wrote:
There’s clear leftward movement among Democratic voters on a range of issues, and there are more progressive candidates running than ever. But this doesn’t amount, at least yet, to the socialist groundswell that advocates pine for and critics fear. The actual policy positions, and number of leftist officeholders, will remain limited — at least for now. What happens in 2020 could be more telling.
Graham’s conclusion:
The Democratic Party is moving left, but it might not be clear quite how far left for two or even six years. The revolution is coming more slowly than its champions hope and its critics fear.
It’s clear the Dems will have a huge primary field for the 2020 presidential nomination, ranging from socialists to moderates. To read the full Edsall column, follow this link.

Texto completo: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. We'll have to make do with 600 or so.
The picture in question - the video, actually- electrified social media over the weekend. In it, a white high school boy wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap confronts an older Native American man who is beating a ceremonial drum and singing a Native song. The encounter took place Friday on the National Mall. The man was there as part of the Indigenous Peoples March. The boy was with a group from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky that was participating in the "March For Life" anti-abortion rally.
The man sings. The boy smirks. Some of his classmates mock the Native man. Someone yells, "Build the wall!" And there was, for many of us, something starkly symbolic in all of it, something that spoke of American fracture.
Yes, the story grew more complicated as details emerged over the weekend. It turns out the students had been drawn to the spot by a small group of black protesters - so-called Black Hebrew Israelites - using their First Amendment rights to curse and insult essentially everyone who was not them, including Catholics, whites, Native Americans and, at one point, a black person who disdained their toxic beliefs.
The students began what they described as a school spirit chant to drown out the black men. Tensions were high. And into this cauldron of ideology and identity stepped Nathan Phillips, a 64-year-old elder of the Omaha people and a Vietnam veteran. His aim in walking through the crowd, he said, was to settle things down. As he told The New York Times, "I stepped in between to pray."
The crowd, he said, parted to let him through. All except for the boy, since identified as Nick Sandmann, a junior. Phillips said the boy blocked him when he moved left. When he moved right, Sandmann did the same.
In a written statement, the boy denied blocking Phillips. "To be honest," he wrote, "I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me."
But the boy in that video, smirking, trying not to laugh, is not startled or confused. He looks, rather, entitled and smug.
Indeed, what gave the image its initial, visceral power was the sense that his expression was one we have seen before. It was on the face of an SS man as he cut off a rabbi's beard on a Warsaw street, on the face of an Alabama state trooper waiting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Heck, it was on the face of a hulking high school boy as he prepared to dunk a smaller kid's head into the toilet. It was the eternal expression of the bully at the head of a mob.
Now here it was on this boy, using his First Amendment right to wear a hat many of us consider the functional equivalent of a pointy white hood, as he faced down a child of the people who named the Mississippi River and left the first footprints in the virgin soil of the Blue Ridge Mountains. All while someone yelled about building a wall. And if the story has grown more complicated, what hasn't changed is the sense that those images capture a nation at the breaking point.
As it happens, this story unfolded over the weekend we set aside to honor Martin Luther King, the confrontation itself occurring near the spot where he said, "I have a dream." That, of course, was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president who led this country through a war in which 2 percent of the population - the modern equivalent would be over 66 million people - died fighting over the meaning of freedom.
And Nathan Phillips' prayer? It was for unity, he said.

Texto completo: Westbrook’s world famous ice disk has been frozen in place since Tuesday, when air temperatures sank to single digits.
But the huge circle is still clearly visible on the surface of the Presumpscot River even as it is encased in the surrounding ice sheet. And it could spin again if the milder temperatures arriving Wednesday night and Thursday break it free.
Or it could just melt away.
The forecast calls for temperatures to rise to 40 degrees by Thursday morning, and as high as 50 degrees during the day Thursday. In addition, rain is expected Wednesday evening into Thursday.
The disk first appeared Jan. 14 and it slowly rotated in place for the following week, although it required a little human intervention at one point last week when a man on a paddleboard used an ice pick to break it free from the frozen riverbank.
Similar spinning circles of ice have been documented across North America and Europe, always on rivers when water temperatures and other conditions are just right.
The phenomenon is believed to result from a combination of current and a vortex beneath the ice, the result of a column of cold water sinking to the bottom of the river at the center of the circle. As the ice sheets spin, they are shaped by the surrounding ice into perfectly symmetrical circles.
However, such disks usually aren’t spinning in high-profile locations like downtown Westbrook, and they usually aren’t so large.
The Presumpscot River ice disk was about 100 yards across for most of the past week, but it grew even larger over the weekend and early this week until it eventually got iced in.
The disk has attracted crowds of curious locals as well as worldwide media attention with reports by the BBC, U.S. television networks, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post and The New York Times, among others.
A webcam mounted on a nearby building at the request of Brown University and other researchers continues to document the ice disk in its dormant state. Among other things, the researchers want to record what happens when it warms up.
The action on the live stream has been a little slow since the sun went down Monday. But the saga is sure to take a twist soon, one way or the other.

She's back: Jean Schmidt returns to politics

Texto completo: Reinvigorated and seemingly fiery as ever, former Congresswoman Jean Schmidt is ending her six-year stint on the political sideline.
The suburban Cincinnati Republican has filed to run for the Ohio House in 2020, hoping to return to Columbus for a second go-around in her political career.
Schmidt, 67, started getting the itch to return to politics about 11/2 years ago, when the woman once called a "tough street fighter" by The New York Times started advocating for women and men who say they've been wrongfully convicted of a crime.
"I had to get my family to buy into it," Schmidt told Politics Extra on Tuesday, referring to her return to politics. "Last summer, I received a call from a prominent Columbus Republican asking me to come back. That's when my husband, Peter, said, 'Why don't you do it?' I'm excited about it."
Jean Schmidt was in Columbus from 2001 until 2004, representing House District 65, which spans northwestern Clermont County. Union Township Republican John Becker currently holds the seat, and he will be term-limited at the end of next year.
Schmidt has long-standing relationships with new Gov. Mike DeWine and House Speaker Larry Householder. Their support would be critical, especially if Schmidt ends up having a primary opponent.
Many figured Schmidt's political career was over after she served three full terms in Washington. Amid the cloud of an ethical issue stemming from her relationship with a Turkish-American interest group, Schmidt was unceremoniously ousted in the 2012 GOP primary by tea party-backed political newbie Brad Wenstrup.
"No regrets," Schmidt said. "Moving forward."
It took more than a year for Schmidt's family to warm up to the idea of her making a comeback, she said.
Some things that happened in Schmidt's final term had taken a toll on the family, including the intense backlash and media scrutiny Schmidt had faced amid the monthslong ethics investigation in 2011. The House Ethics Committee determined she had improperly accepted around $500,000 worth of free legal services from the Turkish group.
Then in early 2012, Schmidt's conservatism and loyalty to the GOP was called into question by some members of her own party after she gave then-President Barack Obama a seemingly innocuous kiss on the cheek during his State of the Union address.
There were other controversies during Schmidt's time in Washington, including soon after she arrived in 2005. She caused a firestorm after saying on the floor that "cowards cut and run, Marines never do" in response to Pennsylvania Democrat John Murtha's push back on the GOP's efforts to withdrawal troops from Iraq. Murtha, who died in 2010, was a Marine veteran.
Schmidt now calls the divisive rhetoric that has poisoned today's politics "shameful" and "very sad."
"It breaks my heart for the country," Schmidt said.
Both sides are at fault, she added, believing social media has contributed to the incivility. She is not on Facebook or Twitter, but acknowledged she'll likely have to have a social media presence in the upcoming campaign.
Schmidt has been busy since leaving politics. She remains an avid runner, having completed more than 140 marathons. She regularly teaches political science courses at Chatfield College's campuses in Over-the-Rhine and Brown County.
Schmidt spends a lot of time with her two elementary-aged grandsons. She was taking one of them to basketball practice when I called her.
For nearly a decade, Schmidt has volunteered with City Gospel Mission's Flying Pig Marathon training program. She works with women in the mission's long-term recovery program for drug and alcohol addiction.
Schmidt took an interest to helping women and men in the prison system after a friend recommended she read former Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro's book, "False Justice: Eight Myths That Convict the Innocent."
She's gotten to know Cincinnati attorney David Singleton of the Ohio Justice and Policy Center. Singleton and Indian Hill resident Michele Young have helped the former Miami Township trustee connect with Tyra Patterson, who was recently featured in The Enquirer for her successful re-entry after serving a long prison sentence.
Patterson maintained that she was wrongfully convicted for the 1994 shooting death of a 15-year-old girl in Dayton, Ohio. She received a sentence of 43 years to life in prison, but was released in December 2017.
Schmidt has helped mentor Patterson. They trained together for the Flying Pig 5K last spring.
"I went to the parole board hearing in Dayton, and I said, 'Oh, my God, this woman is innocent,' " Schmidt said.
"This is what made me start to think about getting back into politics," Schmidt added. "Something has to be done."
Some call her "Mean Jean." These days, though, she seems more like "Meaningful Jean."

Jean Schmidt, former U.S. Representative, and attorney Michele Young run with Tyra Patterson at Washington Park in February to train for the Flying Pig Marathon. Schmidt and Young are reentry mentors to Patterson, who served 23 years in prison for crimes she says she did not commit.

Damon arrives at economic summit in Davos wearing another man's clothes

Texto completo: Matt Damon was wearing another man's clothes when he arrived at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday.
Damon fell victim to the perils of air travel, telling a panel hosted by Bloomberg that he was forced to don the duds of his Water.org cofounder, Gary White , after Swiss Air misplaced his luggage.
“The relationship has developed to the point where I'm wearing Gary's clothes right now, because Swiss Air lost my bags," Damon said, when asked about his relationship with White, with whom he cofounded Water.org in 2009. “So we've come a long way."
Baggage mishaps aside, Damon talked about why he has made worldwide access to safe drinking water his primary philanthropic focus.
“It underlines everything," Damon said. “All these issues of extreme poverty are affected by it. It really touches everything. You can't solve any of these problems we're talking about today — gender equality, climate change, all of these things — water touches all of them."
In addition to Damon, a who's who of the Boston area's biggest names in business and education planned to attend the summit. Celtics co-owner and Bain Capital co-chairman Stephen Pagliuca was scheduled to make the trek along with six Bain & Co. leaders, and at least five higher-ups at Boston Consulting Group were on the guest list, including chairman Hans-Paul Bürkner . In the education realm, the forum was expected to welcome at least 10 Harvard-affiliated guests, including Harvard University president Lawrence Bacow . And MIT and Yale had at least seven university-affiliated attendees each on the RSVP list, including Yale president Peter Salovey and MIT president L. Rafael Raif .
Other notables with local ties scheduled to make the trip to Switzerland included chairman, president, and CEO of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company Roger Crandall , Bank of America vice chairman Anne Finucane , and Iron Mountain president and CEO William Meaney .
Several weighty topics were on the agenda at the WEF on Tuesday, but in one case a soundbite got the attention. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, taking part in a CNBC panel, was asked by a moderator if he had a message for President Trump , who canceled his trip to Davos because of the government shutdown. After a couple of false starts, the former senator from Massachusetts boiled his message down to one word: “Resign."
Several other events were scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. Former Harvard assistant professor and New York Times best-selling author Amy Cuddy was on a panel about violence against women that also included Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege , and Microsoft founder Bill Gates joined a panel examining how to build improved financial architecture to support global health initiatives.
One Boston-based businessman making waves at Davos wasn't even at the summit.
Seth Klarman , a billionaire investor who runs the Boston-based Baupost Group and has been called the “Oracle of Boston," sent a letter to investors — including overseers of Harvard's and Yale's endowments — that raises “a huge red flag about global social tensions, rising debt levels and receding American leadership," according to a Tuesday article from The New York Times.
The Times story predicted that Klarman's letter would be the talk of the town, writing that it was “likely to add to the hand-wringing that typically takes place in Davos during a week of panels and conversation over Champagne and canapés."

Texto completo: In this documentary about siblings in a classical music ensemble, one of the girls, then in her early teens, describes herself as "optimistic and happy." The all-Americanness of the three sisters and two brothers who came to be known as the 5 Browns manifested itself in a variety of ways. Born in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and raised in Utah, they were avatars of well-scrubbed cheer and hard work. Home-schooled, each one practiced piano at all hours.
Their professional performances were both novel and impractical, playing five-piano arrangements of canonical classical music. Doing the sort of thing you don't expect to see done at all, let alone done well, is also, arguably, very all-American.
[Video: The 5 Browns: Digging Through the Darkness -- Official Trailer | Official Selection --2018 RRFF Watch on YouTube.]
"The 5 Browns," directed by Ben Niles and expanding on a short he made two years ago, is subtitled "Digging Through The Darkness." The Brown sisters -- Desirae, Deondra and Melody -- were sexually abused by their father, Keith, from girlhood into their teens.
The idea of the siblings performing together as a unit really came about only after a 2000 New York Times article about how all the children were attending Juilliard simultaneously. After the act got underway, Keith Brown became the business manager and put his children on a punishing schedule, keeping up the abuse for much of the time. Once the sisters revealed what was going on to one another, and to their brothers, Gregory and Ryan, there had to be a reckoning.
And so there was, one that led to further trouble, and one inarguably just resolution: Keith Brown is serving a prison sentence. This story is in a sense confounding. I can't imagine the bitterness of having to deal with one's vocation and artistic calling being inextricably linked to a monstrous, criminal upbringing. And yet the movie is framed by scenes of the now adult Browns making a new record. For as much as they suffered, music was able to keep them sane, and united.
The director and his editor, Amanda Larson, construct the movie in a fairly conventional way, but leave a single string dangling, which they pull tight to devastating emotional effect near the end. The five Browns are likable, admirable individuals; two of the sisters started the Foundation for Surviving Abuse, an advocacy group, and we see them at work with eloquence and compassion. Their trauma and their subsequent resolve, as depicted here, are also, finally, all-American.

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

Kamala Harris will do what Cory Booker can't: Say no to super PACs

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., just made her presidential announcement and made life that much harder for Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Because if he wants the nomination, he will have to distinguish himself from her, and fast.

Both appeal to minority voters. Both captivate audiences with similarly inspiring stories about their upbringing. Both rose to progressive stardom with their grilling of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Unlike Booker though, Harris will say no to dark money. Multiple outlets report that she plans on rejecting assistance from super PACs as well as corporate dollars.

The clearest difference between the two so far, it could become a flash point in the coming primary fight where rejecting PAC money has become a badge of honor. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., built his 2016 campaign on small-dollar donations, rejecting most super PAC dollars and regularly whacking Hillary Clinton over her failure to do so. Harris is the latest in the 2020 crowd to follow in Sanders' footsteps.

Meanwhile, Booker has been cultivating his relationships with the deep-pocketed donors of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. He hasn’t even entered the race himself but he was the first big beneficiary of big money. The New York Times reported in December that Steve Phillips, a wealthy San Francisco-based Democratic donor, had formed a pro-Booker super PAC called Dream United.

[ Also read: Jimmy Carter to Cory Booker: 'I hope you run for president']

Booker claimed ignorance at the time with a spokesman telling the New York Times that “any effort to draft him into the race is outside of his control.”

Earlier in the year and like so many presidential hopefuls, Booker also swore off contributions from PAC money. There were some caveats though. While Booker promised to send back corporate contributions, as the Washington Examiner reported, he is more than happy to cash checks from lobbying PACs.

This money will be especially important in a bruising primary that will be as much a slugfest as it is a marathon. With as many as two or three dozen candidates waiting to join the race, contenders will need a deep enough bucket of cash to see them to the finish line.

To stay competitive, super PAC money will be especially important for Booker. As Kevin Robillard of HuffPost points out, he lagged far behind the rest of his Senate colleagues in small-dollar donations at the end of 2018. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had raised $13.1 million in donations under $200 and Harris, $4.9 million. Meanwhile, Booker had managed just $1.4 million.

When Harris trades barbs with Booker, expect his fondness for corporate funding to be front and center.

Rudy Giuliani: My Trump Tower Moscow comments were 'hypothetical'

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani sought to clarify comments he made this weekend about discussions about a planned Trump Tower in Russia between President Trump and his former lawyer Michael Cohen — now calling them “hypothetical.”

“My recent statements about discussions during the 2016 campaign between Michael Cohen and then-candidate Donald Trump about a potential Trump Moscow ‘project’ were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the President,” said Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who now represents Trump, in a Monday afternoon statement.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, Giuliani said conversations between Trump and Cohen went on “throughout 2016,” and he later added they could have been “up to as far as October, November" 2016.

“The conversations lasted throughout parts of 2016. The president is not sure exactly when they ended. I would say Michael Cohen would have a much better recollection of it than the president,” he said on the NBC show.

On Monday, Giuliani backpedaled: “My comments did not represent the actual timing or circumstances of any such discussions. The point is that the proposal was in the earliest stage and did not advance beyond a free non-binding letter of intent.”

Giuliani did another interview which further obfuscated the story about Trump Tower Moscow when he told CNN's Jake Tapper that Trump might have talked to Cohen about his testimony to Congress.

“As far as I know, President Trump did not have discussions with [Cohen], certainly had no discussions with him in which he told him or counseled him to lie,” Giuliani said on CNN early Sunday. “If — if he had any discussions with him, they'd be about the version of the events that Michael Cohen gave them, which they all believed was true. I believed it was true. I still believe it may be true, because, unlike these people who want to just believe him, I believe Michael Cohen is a serial liar.”

When asked by Tapper if he had just acknowledged Trump had talked with Cohen about the testimony, Giuliani replied: “Which would be perfectly normal, which the president believed was true.”

The Trump Tower Moscow discussions were “going on from the day I announced to the day I won,” Giuliani quoted Trump as saying during an interview with the New York Times published later Sunday.

Cohen testified to Congress that talks had ended by January 2016 — before the Republican primary began. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the project, which never came to fruition.

That charge was brought against Cohen by special counsel Robert Mueller, and in December he was sentenced to three years in prison for that plea, as well as eight other felony counts.

Giuliani’s statement Monday comes amid fallout from an explosive report last week by BuzzFeed News that said Mueller’s team had evidence showing Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress.

Mueller’s team directly refuted the story in a rare public statement.

“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony are not accurate,” said Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, Friday night.

BuzzFeed News has stood by the report.

This is not a real edition of The Washington Post

Texto completo: The banner headline, "Unpresidented," was splashed across the front page of a fake newspaper made to look like The Washington Post, according to the real Washington Post.
The print paper, handed out Wednesday in Washington, D.C., but carrying the date May 1, 2019, had a lead story claiming President Donald Trump had written a resignation letter on a napkin, left it in the Oval Office and had taken off for Yalta, a resort city on the Crimean Peninsula. His departure was prompted by massive women-led protests across the country. The fake newspaper and accompanying website were produced by a group called the Yes Men, described as a "trickster activist collective," the Post said.
A statement released by The Washington Post said, "There are fake print editions of The Washington Post being distributed around downtown D.C., and we are aware of a website attempting to mimic The Post’s. They are not Post products, and we are looking into this."
Jacques Servin, one of the founders of Yes Men, told the Post the newspaper was meant to provide ideas for the "grass-roots movement" to support the impeachment of Trump. "The idea was a newspaper from the future and how we got there — like a road map for activists," he said.
Servin said the fake digital site and 25,000 copies of the print paper cost the group nearly $40,000, offset by $36,000 raised from the organization’s mailing list, the Post said. Yes Men, which Servin said practices "clowny activism," created a fake copy of The New York Times in 2008, following the election of President Barack Obama, according to the Post.
Former first mom-in-law not getting a pension A story making the internet rounds claims Barack Obama’s mother-in-law will receive a $160,000 lifetime government pension for the time she spent taking care of granddaughters Malia and Sasha. The story is false, according to The Associated Press. Michelle’s mother, Marian Robinson, would not qualify for benefits because she was never employed by the federal government.
The article was originally published by satirical website The Boston Tribune, AP reported on Jan. 14, 2017.
The story said "First Grandma" Robinson would collect the pension for being a "full-time/in-home caregiver" to the Obama children.
According to the story, Robinson qualified under the Civil Service Retirement Act, but that plan was replaced in 1987 by the Federal Employees Retirement System, AP said.
And both plans require employment by the federal government. Robinson moved into the White House with her daughter and son-in-law in 2009 and often cared for the children, AP said. She previously worked as a bank secretary and stay-at-home mother in Chicago.
The story was picked up by other websites and portrayed as credible, AP said.
Mislabeled photo has been around for years An image posted on Facebook shows a large barricade and claims it is a border fence built by Mexico on the country’s border with Guatemala in order "to keep out freeloaders."
"Shouldn’t the United States have the same right as Mexico to protect its border?" the post asks. The photo is actually a fence along Israel’s border with Egypt, according to global news agency AFP. The picture was taken on Feb. 15, 2012, by AFP photographer Ahmad Gharabli, showing Egyptian border guards watching as Israeli guards supervised construction of the barrier.
The recent post has been shared more than 1,900 times since December, AFP said.
However, the same meme has been making the rounds on social media sites dating back to 2016. Images of border fences are often used out of context on social media, according to the News Literacy Project, which featured the meme in the latest edition of its newsletter, The Sift.
Steering wheel bumps not for blind drivers A meme circulating this month on social media appears to be posted by users who just discovered small dots on a car’s steering wheel are to aid visually impaired drivers.
The post shows an image of a steering wheel with raised dots, accompanied by the caption, "Just realised (sic) that these little bumps on the steering wheel are in Braille so that blind drivers have no trouble finding the horn to alert other drivers when necessary."
The fake meme is an old joke that has been online for years, Snopes.com says.
The raised dots in the photo do not resemble any letters or words in the Braille alphabet, Snopes said, let alone spell out the word "horn."

Marie Kondo is not telling you to get rid of books

Texto completo: Four years ago, I was working on a project with a Japanese woman in Japan. We Skyped frequently at odd hours of the day because of the time difference. I generally love working with international folks and usually able to figure out their message through language gaps.
One day, she mentioned something I didn't understand. She went on for a while and I was giving it everything I had to figure out what she was talking about. Ultimately, I had to admit defeat. I was at a loss this time around. I had to break down and say, as tactfully as I knew how, "What exactly are you talking about?"
She said, "The KonMari method? You know Marie Kondo, right?"
I did not know Marie Kondo.
My Japanese business associate went on to explain the idea of holding each item in your home in your hands and asking if that item brings joy. If it does, keep it. If it does not, get rid of it.
I was fascinated by the possibilities but did not jump on the KonMari bandwagon right away.
About a year later, in the Flood of 2016, we lost a lot of the items we had in storage — items I had been hauling from state to state to state for decades, items that had one time definitely brought me joy.
The problem was that I thought a lot of things brought me joy. Truth be told, I am easily entertained. Joy comes easy. Those things had brought me joy once upon a time. But it turned out that letting go of them was so much easier than I had ever believed possible.
After the flood, the KonMari method made a lot more sense to me. I suppose that I have to learn the hard way about some things.
The first of the year is a great time to shed the heavy stuff that isn't serving us well or anymore. Some may choose to use the KonMari method or another philosophy that works better for them.
The best approach is not to get too caught up in the details that don't work for you. Yes, Marie Kondo caused a stir for many when they thought she suggested keeping only 30 books. However, in a video interview online last week, Kondo explained her stance on books to The New York Times' Katie Rosman.
"The point of the KonMari method is to figure out your sense of value," she said. "What do you hold most important? So, if you're angered, if your reaction is anger that you have to let go of books, then that's great, that means for you, books are invaluable."
My advice is not to get hung up on any particular thing.
Once upon a time, I could not have imagined getting rid of books. However, getting a Little Free Library changed that. Moving books along from my life became much easier. I realized that I would never re-read most books and was happy to share them with others who could enjoy them. On the other hand, there are many (more than 30) that I have chosen to keep. For now.
Kondo's methodical approach to gathering the excess of a household and then asking what to keep and what to cast off is not complex or even a new idea. Her approach is common sense and should be basic maintenance in a home. However, even with the help of the flood, I have junk drawers that were begging from some KonMari.
Last weekend, my family and I revisited the KonMari method. We spent one day cleaning out specific areas of our home. We've got a long way to go, but the result of organizing and beautifying even on just that one day was a near-spiritual lift. Even when all I had organized was a single drawer that was full to the gills of who-knows-what-where-nothing-could-be-found, I was near euphoric — like I said, joy comes pretty easy for me.
Even designating 30 minutes toward the goal of focusing on one small space can make a difference. The act of going through the stuff and picking up the pieces one-by-one, deciding what to keep and what to let go, is powerful.

Texto completo: Welcome to the last in my series of columns on the year ahead. In my four earlier ones, I covered why December was lousy and why stocks are on the right side of a swift V-shaped recovery. U. S. stocks have climbed more than 10 percent since the market close on Christmas Eve. Accompanied by wild wiggles, the rest of 2019 should be similarly happy.
On December 17, I explained how stocks’ have averaged 34 percent before dividends in the 12 months after all of history’s correction bottoms (meaning a drop of 10 to 19. 99 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 index).
Assuming December 24 remains the bottom, this correction ended later in a calendar year than any correction or bear market ever. An average aftermath now would make 2019 simply stellar, and surprise almost everyone. That’s bullish.
Maybe December 24 wasn’t the bottom. We can’t know for sure. But there were abundant bottomish signals. Mutual fund outflows reached levels only associated with major market bottoms. December outflows matched March, 2009, when the last bear market ended. U. S. stock market liquidity sank like a brick, also echoing prior lows.
Price-to-earnings ratios contracted last year – earnings soared while stocks fell. A simple secret: Basically every year valuations shrink, the next year they expand. So unless earnings fall, stocks rise. Analysts expect 6. 9 percent earnings growth in 2019. Earnings almost always exceed analysts’ estimates. Expanding valuations on top of earnings growth would cause big positive stock returns
Good years follow bad years unless you have global recession or world war. We’ve never had two straight negative stock market years – except with the Great Depression, the two World Wars, the early 1970s debacle and the tech bubble. Otherwise, stocks were spring-loaded the next year.
And recession is unlikely. I showed you exactly why last week via the Leading Economic Index series – a great predictor for this.
Many misguided people still think the interest rate “yield curve” inverted, signaling that a downturn lurks. I explained on July 22nd why that is wrong and how to view it correctly to see reality.
But, suppose it were inverted. So what?
History holds four examples of the yield curve inverting without a recession the next year. Stocks rose every time, averaging 16. 6 percent that next year. Since inversion fears are now in the marketplace – that’s big potential upside surprise, and bullish!
The government shutdown flooded folks with fear. Yet it shouldn’t. The aftermath of shutdowns is also great, with U. S. stocks averaging 12. 8 percent in the next 12 months.
Sure, shutdowns must end to have an aftermath. But shutdowns themselves aren’t bearish. The prior 19 shutdowns occurred while markets were open. Stocks rose during 11, including 1995-1996 – the longest shutdown before the current one. Now people worry this one’s length will cause problems. But U. S. stocks, a leading indicator, have risen over 8 percent since it began. They’re telling you not to worry.
Everywhere I look, sentiment seeks negatives, ignoring positives. Did you know global lending and money supply are growing around 6 percent year-over-year? That the global purchasing managers’ index is higher now than during most of 2016, a fine year for stocks? That world trade is growing nearly 4 percent year-over-year despite this supposed trade war? That global profit margins are too?
If you didn’t know any of this, you aren’t alone. Most good news goes unreported or gets couched as bad – a phenomenon I call the pessimism of disbelief. When it strikes, better times are ahead.
Next week, I’ll share some timeless investment process wisdom to help you put all this into practice.

Texto completo: Twenty years into her career, Anne Hathaway is used to being cast a certain way.
"I'm not usually sent roles that are defined by the male gaze," she said. "Normally I get sent women who live and think for themselves -- to the extent that we do in this very sick world."
But at first glance in "Serenity," Steven Knight's noirish thriller, opening Jan. 25, Hathaway's character appears to have spent her lifetime catering to the pleasures of men. As Karen, Hathaway makes a jaw-dropping entrance -- long blond tresses and soul-crushed eyes, a femme fatale in white -- in the only bar on Plymouth Island. And she has a proposition for her ex (Matthew McConaughey), a struggling boat captain: Take her violent new husband (Jason Clarke) out fishing then drop him in the ocean for the sharks, in exchange for $10 million.
It's the first entry in a big year for Hathaway, who stole the show from Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett in last spring's "Ocean's 8." Come May, she'll appear in "The Hustle," a female-centric remake of "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with Rebel Wilson, followed by "The Last Thing He Wanted," Dee Rees's adaptation of the Joan Didion novel about a reporter turned arms dealer, and "Modern Love," an Amazon series spun from the New York Times column.
When she's not on set, Hathaway, 36, lives in New York with her husband, the producer, actor and jewelry designer Adam Shulman, and their son, Jonathan, 2 ¾. ("He's like butter," she said, sighing deeply. "Those moments they cuddle up into you just because they want to.") Calling from a family vacation spot somewhere north of Los Angeles, Hathaway spoke about the actresses who still floor her and Hollywood's echo chamber of men.
Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Karen is a dramatic pivot from the roles we're used to seeing you in. Were you immediately game?
I was very surprised when I got the script for "Serenity" and found out that Steven wanted me. I was just very honored and couldn't wait to roll up my sleeves and dye my hair.
We know that secrets lurk on Plymouth Island, and there will be no spoilers here. But what was your reaction to the script when you first read it?
It knocks you. I was on the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait to turn the page and see what was coming next, as it became more surreal and thrilling. I really love being a part of provocative movies that require a certain muscularity from the audience, a certain level of mature film viewership. One of my favorite things about "Serenity" was how provoked I felt by it both in my mind and in the pit of my stomach.
Later this spring, you're playing a high-class con artist in the comedy "The Hustle." Did you need a lift after the darkness of "Serenity?"
You know, I never thought I'd be able to say what I'm about to say: I did it for the fun of it. It just seemed like it was going to be a blast, and it mostly was.
Mostly?
I was a little bit too assured in my confidence that I'd be able to convince the powers that be that my character shouldn't be British, she should be American. I thought I was going to win that one up until the day before filming. So then I was tasked with doing the thing that is the hardest in the world for me, which is pulling off a British accent. All of a sudden it went from feeling like you had a rocket strapped to your back to feeling like you're on a tightrope and there was no net.
You seem to enjoy a comic thrill ride, like Daphne Kluger, the narcissistic actress in "Ocean's 8." From what demented place did you conjure her up?
Well, it was fun to apply a lot of observation that I've made over the past 20 years or so about the incredibly ridiculous world of celebrity -- to send that up with my tongue firmly in my cheek. She was just such a trip. I loved playing someone who was so transparent and yet so blind to herself.
You went into "Ocean's 8" saying , "Do not embarrass yourself in front of your heroes." What on earth were you worried about?
Oh, I think I was worried that everyone would like each other and secretly not like me and I'd just be kind of outside of it. In the past I've let my excitement get the best of me, and I just wanted to sit back and enjoy the experience and not try to fill it with my own enthusiasm but to take in how truly glorious it was to be in the presence of so many queens.
You've often told the story of how nervous you were around Meryl Streep in "The Devil Wears Prada" -- and here I am, suddenly feeling rather tongue-tied around you.
Oh gosh no, aim higher. [Laughs]
But seriously, is there anyone now who could possibly intimidate you?
Yes. I burst into tears when I met Julia Roberts, and it wasn't like 20 years ago. It was recent history. It's a strange thing to find yourself right smack dab in the middle of a place where you are not born, where you have no reason to imagine yourself and yet somehow there you are. It sometimes produces -- how do I say this? -- weirdness and awkwardness. And I'm learning to just say thank you and not make such a fuss about it and have a good time.
You're one of the more than 300 women in film, television and theater involved in the Time's Up initiative . What's your take on the movement's accomplishments this past year?
All I can represent is my own experience, which is I was ignorant of all the effort that has gone into keeping women separated. And now that I've found my sisters and my arms are linked with them, I'm never letting go.
On Instagram , you cited a recent study that found that female-led films earn more than ones starring men -- and yet pay inequity is still a huge issue.
The reason I think that there's resistance is that Hollywood has been full of men who would describe themselves as good, but who have been in echo chambers full of other men who look and think like them. This doesn't make these men bad, but it does mean that the conversations being had at the highest levels of power are, by default, limited.
Looking back at your 2012 Oscar-winning turn as Fantine in "Les Misérables," I was reminded that you have an impressive set of pipes. Are you singing much these days?
My son hates my voice. [Peals of laughter] He doesn't like it when I sing. So no, I'm really not. There's a couple "Peppa Pig" songs he lets me sing and man, I lean into those so hard.

A conspiracy of dunces

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: For Bloomberg News
Several months before Donald Trump rolled down an escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to announce his presidential bid, a contractor showed up at the building to collect a payment from the Trump Organization. Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney at the time, gave the guy $12,000 to $13,000 — in cash — stuffed inside a Walmart bag.
Because this was the Trump Organization and Michael Cohen was Michael Cohen, the payment was well short of the $50,000 the contractor, John Gauger, claimed he was owed. Because this was Team Trump gearing up for a White House run, Gauger’s work involved trying to rig a pair of online polls to make it appear that respondents believed Trump was a leading business figure and a top Republican presidential contender. And because all of this took place in Trumplandia, Gauger also runs the information technology department at a prominent Christian educational institution, Liberty University — and he met Cohen because the university’s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., is an avid Trump supporter who has described the president as “a good, moral person.”
Cohen and the contractor’s dealings came to light Thursday courtesy of bravura reporting in The Wall Street Journal, and it spawned some priceless reactions.
“As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS,” Cohen tweeted. “I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn’t deserve it.”
That tweet got Rudy Giuliani, a ubiquitous Trump spokesman, all worked up. “My response will be a cleaned-up version of ‘Bull---,’” he told the Journal. “This is not true. The president did not know about this if it happened.”
Whatever Giuliani may or may not know about something he says may or may not have happened, the rest of us can weigh the Journal’s reporting against what we already know about Trump (who always kept a close eye on every dime traveling through his boutique marketing and licensing operation) and Cohen (who was recently sentenced to three years in prison for violating campaign-finance laws, evading taxes and lying to Congress).
For starters, the Trump Organization hasn’t denied that it reimbursed Cohen $420,000 for, among other things, what he claimed was a $50,000 payment to Gauger (it appears, according to court documents and the Journal, that Cohen overbilled the Trumps by about $37,000 on that one). The funds were also meant to make Cohen whole on $130,000 in hush money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, a porn star known as Stormy Daniels, who said she had an extramarital sexual liaison with the president. In a delicious, Trumpian move, Cohen also apparently used some of the funds to pay for a Twitter site, @WomenForCohen, that praised the lawyer as “Snazzy looking & ready to #MAGA” while being “Strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense, business oriented and ready to make a difference!”
The bulk of the payments to Cohen, according to the Journal, came out of Trump’s personal accounts and not the Trump Organization’s coffers. Trump, whom Cohen already captured in a tape recording discussing the best way to handle the Daniels payments, may not have been a hands-on business manager throughout his troubled career. But very little money and no significant deals transited the Trump Organization without his approval. Trump may not micromanage all aspects of his presidency, either, but when it comes to things that matter to him — his media presence and special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, for example — he’s stayed right on top of things.
So could Cohen get $50,000 to fund digital finagling, without Trump knowing? It’s possible, of course, but unlikely. (Cohen’s only receipt meant to verify that the $50,000 was, indeed, a payment to a contractor that was, apparently, a handwritten note for “tech services.”)
If Trump knew of and approved the payment to Cohen to rig some polls, it also raises questions about the president’s knowledge of and role in other significant events that have drawn investigators’ attention. Did Trump know about and approve a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that took place because some Russian visitors promised Donald Trump Jr. compromising information about Hillary Clinton? Did Trump know that his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Cohen had dealings or took meetings with Kremlin allies? Did Trump know that murky funds were flowing out of Eastern Europe and into a prized hotel project in Manhattan?
Federal prosecutors have already said in court papers that Trump directed Cohen to give hush money to Daniels. BuzzFeed reported Thursday night that Trump also told Cohen to lie to Congress about his efforts during the presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. BuzzFeed also reported that Trump encouraged Cohen to pursue a plan in which Trump would travel to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin to secure the Russian president’s support for the Moscow project.
That’s a lot of guidance, isn’t it? And it all suggests that Trump, who micromanages with zeal, is neither an innocent bystander nor a bit player in many of the crimes prosecutors and investigators are examining. He appears to be the director.

Texto completo: Why march again?
That's what many women are wondering as they consider Saturday's third annual women's marches planned in Washington, Boston, and cities across the country. The movement that united women in spontaneous fury two years ago has itself broken down into divisions, as one of its national leaders, who is black, has failed to dispel perceptions of anti-Semitism.
The marches come three months after a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault was confirmed, solidifying a conservative court that could well overturn Roe v. Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion. And President Trump — whose inauguration prompted women's first outpouring of anger — is still president and still offending them, even if he no longer surprises.
Women participating again this year suggest the march is not the point of their activism, but the exclamation point. In between marches, organizers are keeping the grass roots aflame long after the scorching anti-Trump signs are squashed. For evidence of their impact, they say, look no further than the wave of women newly elected to political office. Headlining this year's march in Boston: Representative Ayanna Pressley, whose upset win made her the first black woman to represent Massachusetts in Congress.
“For me, this women's march is not about Trump," said Susan Ward, 54, an Acton woman who plans to march in Washington on Saturday. “It's about the fact that there is a large number of women that are organizing. And when you organize, or have a voice, it empowers other women to have a voice."
Plans for the Washington march — always down to the wire — have been especially spotty amid a government shutdown, a bad weather forecast, and a racially divisive controversy that has cost the D.C. leadership team sponsors and participants.
The Boston event — beginning at 10 a.m. on Boston Common — is run independently of the national women's march but is suffering from brand confusion.
“Without question, the controversies surrounding [Women's March Inc.] and its leadership have complicated our efforts to organize this year's march, even though we have no connection to [Women's March Inc.] formally or informally," said Karen Clawson Cosmas, executive director of the Boston event's host, March Forward Massachusetts.
March Forward Massachusetts is the group that drew an estimated 175,000 people to the Common the day after Trump's inauguration in 2017. A second annual demonstration was moved to Cambridge, planned with partner organizations, and drew roughly 10,000.
But for most women mobilized by the marches, the real work has been happening in between the events. Nationally, in all-politics-is-local fashion, many women worked through “huddles," neighborhood groups formed to work on their own electoral agendas.
In Massachusetts, many campaigned for Question 3, the ballot question that protected transgender people's rights against discrimination. And since the state was already secure with an all-Democratic congressional delegation friendly to women's rights, some turned their progressive attention to candidates in other states. The Walnut Street Huddle in Brookline, for instance, raised money for Pennsylvania's Chrissy Houlahan and made phone calls for Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Gina Ortiz Jones of Texas. Closer to home, they hit the pavement for Jared Golden in Maine and Chris Pappas in New Hampshire.
Organizations that work with the march also have seen a surge in activism from new volunteers and channeled them to new forms of political engagement. The Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action created a new political arm, called JALSA Impact, which tapped 100 volunteers to make 4,500 phone calls for five congressional candidates, including Abby Finkenauer in Iowa, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida, and Antonio Delgado in New York.
“For us, working on the issues that the march is speaking about is not just a one-day event," said Cindy Rowe, JALSA Impact executive director. “It really is the heart of our mission, the pursuit of social, economic, environmental, and racial justice based on our deeply held Jewish values."
Activists' eagerness to tout their Jewish values and allies this year owes to the controversy that has been brewing behind the scenes.
Two national Women's March leaders have been associated with Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who blames Jews in particular for black oppression. Tamika Mallory, a black anti-gun-violence activist and copresident of the D.C. march, appeared with him last fall and has since failed to distance herself from him, leading many to urge her to step down. In November, the Hawaii woman who launched the original idea for the Women's March on Facebook said in a post that leaders were letting racist rhetoric fester “by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs."
Tension only worsened after another original founder of the national march told The New York Times that she believes she was shunted aside, in part because of her Jewish identity. The dispute has become so heated that the Democratic National Committee backed out of sponsoring the D.C. march and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency provided a list detailing which local marches are not affiliated with the national leaders.
In a Monday appearance on ABC's “The View," Mallory continued to defend her loyalty to Farrakhan based on his work for the black community. Though she said she did not agree with his anti-Semitic remarks, she refused to condemn them.
Now, in a vivid display of the division, major cities — including Washington, New York City, and Philadelphia — will host two separate women's marches.
One will be affiliated with Women's March Inc. — the name trademarked by the official national leaders — and one will be staged by local activists who do not want to be associated with that group.
Some of those who still want to march are tuning out the rancor.
“I've become an activist since the women's march," said Ward, a neuroscientist who said that she'd previously never felt the need to protest during her three decades in liberal Massachusetts.
“I didn't feel the pain myself, and I didn't feel I had to do it," she said. “But now I realize that I need to step up and speak out for people who are marginalized."
So she and her sister are again heading to Washington, where she'll feed off the energy for the next round of activism back home.
“If it's not as big as it was two years ago, I don't even care," Ward said. “You can't not do something."

Texto completo: A peacock, a hippo, a monster and a unicorn each take to the stage, performing choreographed moves while belting pop tunes like "Don't Stop Me Now" and "Oops ... I Did It Again." No, you didn't eat one too many edibles. You're watching "The Masked Singer," Fox's new competition series that pits 12 extravagantly costumed celebrities against each other. An adaptation of a South Korean series called "The King of Mask Singer," the American version debuted earlier this month to an audience of more than nine million viewers.
Because the identity of each famous participant is kept secret until the contestant is voted off the show, "The Masked Singer" can't rely on the spectacle of their star power. (The host Nick Cannon, along with the celebrity panelists that include Jenny McCarthy and Robin Thicke, are low-wattage at best.)
That's where costume designer Marina Toybina comes in. A four-time Emmy winner, Toybina got her big break working on Britney Spears's 2007 music video, "Piece of Me," and has since collaborated with other A-list pop stars, including Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. And remember when Katy Perry was famously upstaged by two anthropomorphic dancing sharks during her 2015 Super Bowl halftime show? Toybina deserves much of the credit for the joy that Left Shark brought to our lives.
Toybina spoke to The New York Times about her knack for idiosyncratic animal outfits and creating full-body costumes that won't suffocate the person inside. (Hint: hidden fans.) These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
If you saw what I was wearing right now, you'd probably die. I work from home.
Girl, I just had a newborn. I'm in, like, two robes. I feel you.
You seem to have carved out a niche for yourself as a creator of elaborate viral animal costumes. First, the infamous sharks for Katy Perry's Super Bowl halftime show; and there were a couple of designs you did for Pink's 2018 tour that involved some very realistic animal masks that look somewhat like the ones on "The Masked Singer."
Somehow, they're all coincidences. Going back to the Super Bowl, that was a pretty incredible experience. It was the first time I'd ever dealt with puppetry, so we had to figure out how to start from scratch and learn the entire process day by day. Then in the beginning of last year, I did the costumes for Pink's tour, and the idea was to have this very avant-garde forest scene where it's like, half human, half animal. So there were masks involved there, which was like my trial-and-error before "The Masked Singer."
After designing Pink's tour, two months later I got a call from one of the producers of the show and she sent me the original concept. I watched a few episodes and I was like, "Oh my gosh, we just did this." Everything I've learned in the past five, 10 years led me to figure out how to do this show.
So you don't have a secret animal fetish.
No, not at all! To be honest when I got the call I was just like, "What is happening with all these animals?"
The costumes almost reminded me of Julie Taymor's animals in the Broadway version of "The Lion King" -- it's almost just a suggestion of the animal, rather than a literal rendering.
The idea was always to combine the elements of fashion with costume. So the costume part of it becomes the mask, and the fashion part of it became the outerwear. It wasn't so literal. The deer that I created almost looks like a soldier. We put a lot of details into aging the jacket and creating the elements of this character.
Every character had some sort of world that they lived in. I'm such a big fan of movies and the one thing I haven't really done in my career is film. I was able to introduce everything that I was inspired by -- "Donnie Darko" and "Edward Scissorhands" had a huge influence on the rabbit costume. The whimsical side of Narnia had a little bit of an influence on the lion and the unicorn.
How did you conceive of the designs for the show? Did you first come up with the costumes and then the contestants chose which ones they liked? Or did they have more input?
All the artwork was done before the casting, and once we were working with the casting, the producers and I we were able to figure out which 12 we wanted to keep. From there it was more collaborating, letting some of the cast members possibly choose their own costume or us hearing who's being cast and thinking, "This would be a perfect costume for this person." Somehow it just magically worked, even though it was trial and error.
It sounds like you have really good karma!
Usually when you sketch a 2D design, you do a lot of alterations to it when you start building the costume. If you look at the original sketches for the show versus the costumes that are onstage, we barely had any changes. I think it gave our celebrities, the famous behind-the-mask personas, a little bit of freedom to play around and become these characters because what they saw on paper is exactly what they look like onstage. It almost became like an inner-child experience for a lot of these people, an alter ego -- to go out, cover their faces and become this character and truly have fun with it. I think that's what made this show come to life.
How do your designs differ from those on the Korean version?
The one difference is how anime some of the [Korean-designed] masks were. I wanted to bring something that was a little bit more of a 360[-degree] mask that really hid our talent and embodied all these characters. A lot of the Korean elements had this extravagant mask and extravagant shoulder piece but then everything else was kind of toned down. We created fuller costumes, head-to-toe characters.
One of my favorite designers is [Alexander] McQueen and I made sure the lion and the unicorn had this couture-y drape work that you don't even see anymore. I think both fashion and costuming, the art of it is slowly going away. You see more and more digital work in film, in music videos. It was important for me to design this show the old-school way. It was important to do it all by hand.
Does anyone ever complain that their costume is too heavy or difficult to move around in?
Of course -- you know, a costume is a costume. The difference between the stuff you buy at the store and a costume [is] you are going to have weight. You are going to have extra protection, extra seams, extra material, extra linings. But we were able to adapt different ways for the costumes to be removed so they can breathe. Everything from the way they were constructed was considered -- breathing mechanisms, putting fans inside of masks, putting fans inside of the monster costume. Just making sure that we can circulate oxygen.
Do you have a favorite costume?
It's hard to choose one but as far as intricacy I think the lion would probably be the one that took the longest to figure out, and a lot of heart and soul went into that one.
What is your ultimate career goal as a designer?
My biggest dream is to do film. I would absolutely love to work with someone like Tim Burton. Looking at movies like "Mary Poppins [Returns]" or "The Nutcracker [and the Four Realms]," that's something I would love to do.
So, a trippy adaptation of a beloved classic.
If these characters on the show could be part of Marvel, that would be amazing.

Texto completo: Criminal justice reform advocate and author Shaka Senghor will be the featured speaker Jan. 23 at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg.
Senghor is a best-selling author and award recipient for his work in advocating for prison reform and addressing the negative effects of the prison-industrial complex. He is also president of the group #BeyondPrisons, an initiative designed to highlight the voices and experience of those impacted by the criminal justice system.
Senghor served a 19-year prison sentence in Michigan that included more than five years in solitary confinement after being convicted of second-degree murder.
Senghor's memoir, "Writing My Wrongs," was inspired by a letter he received from his then-1o-year-old son, asking why he was in prison and hoping they would be reunited someday.
The book was released in March 2016 and debuted on bestseller lists in both the New York Times and Washington Post.
"I spent my time reading and writing, using books to free my mind and expand my thinking," Senghor writes on his website. "I clung to words -- my own and others -- as I pulled myself out of the anger that led me to prison and kept me from reaching my full potential."
Senghor's TED Talk, which he delivered at TED's 30th Anniversary Conference, has been viewed more than 1.3 million times.
His appearance at Pitt-Greensburg, supported in part by a Title III SIP supplemental grant award, is part of a campus initiative to further prepare students to discuss controversial issues, especially in settings that include individuals with opposing points of view.
The initiative's ultimate goal is to provide a place for students to learn and talk about new and different ideas, practice civil discourse and understand that disagreement can be constructive, campus officials said.
Senghor's presentation will be at 7 p.m. in the Mary Lou Campana Chapel and Lecture Center on the Pitt-Greensburg campus, 150 Finoli Drive in Greensburg. Copies of "Writing My Wrongs" will be available after the presentation.

Texto completo: Leslie Moonves, the former chief executive of CBS, plans to fight a decision by the company's board that denied him a $120 million severance payment after he was fired for cause following numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.
Mr. Moonves, 69, told CBS that he was demanding an arbitration hearing, according to a securities filing on Wednesday. His termination agreement gives him that right, and he had up to 30 days after his Dec. 17 firing to challenge the board's decision to not pay him the severance.
Under the terms of his termination agreement, CBS has been paying Mr. Moonves's legal fees, making it easier for him to challenge the board through an arbitration hearing. The process could end up costing CBS as much as $50 million in lawyers' fees. But should CBS prevail, Mr. Moonves would have to foot the bill himself.
The details of the arbitration hearing will remain confidential, and any decision will be binding, according to the terms of Mr. Moonves's separation agreement.
CBS directors determined in December that Mr. Moonves had misled the company about multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and that he had tried to hide evidence in a frenzied attempt to save his legacy.
"His willful and material misfeasance, violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract" led to his dismissal, the board said at the time.
After discussing Mr. Moonves's case over several days, the board reached its conclusion based on an investigation conducted by two outside law firms. Mr. Moonves "engaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace, both before and after he came to CBS in 1995," according to a late November draft of the investigators' report reviewed by The New York Times.
The board was unequivocal in firing Mr. Moonves. He has denied the allegations and said any sexual contact with the women was consensual.
CBS could settle with Mr. Moonves, but that could create a public-relations nightmare for a network that has undergone a companywide reckoning in the wake of the #MeToo movement. In addition to Mr. Moonves, Charlie Rose was fired from his roles at "CBS This Morning" and "60 Minutes" in 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct. Days after Mr. Moonves left the network, Jeff Fager, the longtime executive producer of "60 Minutes," was fired after he threatened a colleague who was asking about allegations of harassment against him. The network also paid a $9.5 million settlement to the actress Eliza Dushku after she claimed she had been written off the series "Bull" because she confronted Michael Weatherly, the show's star, about harassing her on the set.
Mr. Moonves reigned as one of Hollywood's most successful and celebrated executives for decades before being forced to step down in September after the allegations were made.
Because of his run of success, Mr. Moonves became one of the industry's highest-paid executives. He has drawn an annual pay package worth $69.3 million. From 2006 to 2017, Mr. Moonves's total compensation, including salary and stock awards, exceeded $1 billion, according to Equilar, a research firm that gathers data on executive pay.

Top Mayoral Aide Was Quietly Ousted Over Sex Harassment Charges

Texto completo: After winning a commanding re-election in 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio was effusive in praising a key member of his core City Hall team: Kevin O'Brien, his acting chief of staff.
"He has done an outstanding job," the mayor said of Mr. O'Brien, "particularly as we went through a very intense 2017."
Less than three months later, Mr. O'Brien was gone. According to documents obtained by The New York Times, Mr. O'Brien was quietly forced to resign after complaints of sexual harassment filed by two female city employees were substantiated.
Yet City Hall officials did not announce his departure or the reason for it.
At least some of the harassment occurred while Mr. O'Brien, 36, was working as acting chief of staff, Eric F. Phillips, the mayor's press secretary, said, adding that City Hall officials first became aware of the allegations in February and acted on them promptly.
"The misconduct in this case literally makes me sick to my stomach," Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday, deliberately devoting a third of his news conference to addressing Mr. O'Brien's case, which had been reported online by The New York Times earlier in the day. "Angry does not describe my view. I am livid. I'm disgusted by what happened. I am deeply disappointed in this individual."
Mr. de Blasio said that he had not been aware of any allegations of improper behavior against Mr. O'Brien when he praised him in November 2017 during a wider announcement of personnel actions that included moving Mr. O'Brien to a senior adviser position.
Referring to the women who accused Mr. O'Brien, the mayor said, "Let me say to them I am deeply sorry, I am deeply sorry this happened on our team. It shocks me and it is absolutely inconsistent with the values of this administration."
A report on Mr. O'Brien's conduct prepared by the city's Law Department and the office of the mayor's counsel says that investigators interviewed the two women and found their statements credible. The investigators said that Mr. O'Brien's account was found "to be not credible," and recommended that he be "terminated from employment at the mayor's office."
The report, dated Feb. 13, 2018, was obtained in response to a request under the state's Freedom of Information Law. It was heavily redacted, and details of the harassment allegations, including when they took place, were not included in the material provided to The Times.
But Mr. de Blasio on Thursday implied that Mr. O'Brien's behavior had been egregious. He said that two or three other sex harassment cases had been substantiated during his administration against employees of the mayor's office, which has about 1,000 employees, but that those cases were "nothing like this incident."
After leaving City Hall, Mr. O'Brien went to work for Hilltop Public Solutions, a political consulting and lobbying firm founded by Nicholas R. Baldick, a close ally of the mayor who initially recommended Mr. O'Brien to City Hall.
Mr. O'Brien's ouster in February 2018 came at a delicate moment for City Hall, as the national #MeToo movement focused attention on sexual harassment, and Mr. de Blasio at the time struggled to answer questions about how his administration handled harassment complaints.
Administration officials, after months of delays, eventually released data on the sexual harassment complaints filed against city employees: From mid-2013 through 2017, there were 1,312 such complaints lodged at all city agencies, with 221 substantiated, the city said at the time. Those substantiated claims were said to involve as many as five mayor's office employees. But the administration gave no details and did not identify the workers.
The report on Mr. O'Brien states that because the two complainants requested anonymity, their names and identifying information were omitted from the document.
The first assistant corporation counsel, Georgia Pestana, who was one of the authors of the investigative report, said the circumstances of Mr. O'Brien's departure were kept private in order to protect his accusers.
"The privacy interest of these women was paramount," Ms. Pestana said, sitting beside the mayor on Thursday in City Hall's Blue Room. " If you don't create a space where people can believe us when we say we will hold your information and your identities confidential, women are not going to come forward."
The Times was able to independently confirm the identity of one of the women, and is withholding her name and details about her job that could identify her because she is a victim of harassment. When contacted by The Times, the woman, who is younger than Mr. O'Brien and was a much more junior employee, declined to speak about the case.
"The complaint alleges sexual harassment in violation of the city's equal employment opportunity policy," the report said.
"Determination: After investigation, the allegations of sexual harassment are substantiated," the report concluded. Referring to Mr. O'Brien, it said: "It is recommended that the respondent be terminated from employment at the mayor's office."
Mr. Phillips said that Mr. O'Brien, whose portfolio as senior adviser -- following his stint as acting chief of staff -- included issues like the opioid crisis and mental health initiatives, was forced to resign within a day or two of the report's completion. He said the decision to ask for Mr. O'Brien's resignation was made by the first deputy mayor, Dean Fuleihan, and Emma Wolfe, Mr. O'Brien's replacement as chief of staff.
However, a resignation form signed by Mr. O'Brien and obtained by The Times is dated March 23, which coincides with the date of Mr. O'Brien's final paycheck. Mr. Phillips said that Mr. O'Brien continued to be paid for several weeks to account for unused vacation days. He was paid a salary of $220,652 a year, according to city records. Only about 10 people in the mayor's office had higher salaries.
Mr. O'Brien, who is married, blamed his actions on alcohol.
"There's no excuse for what I've done; I'm embarrassed and ashamed," Mr. O'Brien said in a written statement. "At an after-work event, I drank too much and acted inappropriately. No one deserves to be treated that way. I've apologized to the people I've hurt and will continue to do so because I am truly sorry.
"My use of alcohol has led me to make horrible decisions," he said, adding that he was getting "professional help."
On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Hilltop said that Mr. O'Brien had taken a leave of absence. On Thursday, Mr. Baldick said he had been fired.
"We weren't aware of the allegations when we hired him," Mr. Baldick said in an email. "When I learned more about the full scope of Kevin's actions today, I asked him to leave the firm."
The company has been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for work for Mr. de Blasio's mayoral campaigns and for the Campaign for One New York, a defunct nonprofit the mayor had used to support his agenda.
Hilltop had listed Mr. O'Brien on its website as a principal in its New York office. That web page was taken down on Wednesday; it had previously chronicled Mr. O'Brien's experience in politics, saying that he had "helped campaigns and causes survive and communicate through crisis."

Texto completo: In just one month, Raja Feather Kelly, the performer, choreographer and artistic director of the feath3r theory, the dance-theater company he formed in 2009, has been recognized with five prestigious awards. In succession they are the Breakout Award from the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation, the Harkness Promise Award, a residency in The Watermill Center Artists-inResidence Program and the 2019-20 Randjelovi/Stryker Resident Commissioned Artist Award.
"It's not lost on me just how hard it is to get support, to be seen and to make the work you want to make," said Kelly. "I'm humbled and scared [for real, for sure], but more than anything, I am thankful to my mentors, friends and especially my collaborators for trusting and sticking with me."
Since forming the feath3r theory, Kelly's work has been recognized as cross-disciplinary theater, and often challenges audiences to look at relationships, human empathy and personal ethics as expressed in popular media. Of his work, The New York Times wrote, "Mr. Kelly's fusion of dance and theater shifts seamlessly from absurd to cheeky to the unexpectedly and piercingly sincere."
Awarded in November, the Breakout Award given by the SDCF board of trustees to an SDC member for a production or selection of work signals a shift in a career and the beginning of critical recognition-a "rising star" moment in the off-Broadway arena. Kelly is charged to make an original work that honors the dance legend Agnes de Mille. Other recipients are Kitty Mcnamee, Al Blackstone, Jenn Rose and Katie Spelman.
Dec. 3, Kelly was awarded the Harkness Promise Award as an emerging young artists. "The award showcases innovative thinking and how to be an effective artist-citizen who positively impacts dance and the broader community through performance, education, organization and activism," stated the press release. Ephrat "Bounce" Asherie is the other recipient, and both artists promised not to let their fans down.
Kelly was named the new artistic director the New Brooklyn Theatre Dec. 11. Founded in 2012 to democratize the American theater, the New Brooklyn Theatre is now merged with Kelly's feath3r theory company.
"Raja Feather Kelly is one of the most innovative artists working at the nexus of dance, theater and media in the U.S. today," said Chairman of the Board Jeff Strabone.
By Dec. 17, The Watermill Center announced that Kelly is one of 15 recipients of their Artists-in-Residence Program. The Watermill Center is an interdisciplinary laboratory where Kelly and the other artists will have full rein over the center's art collection, library, archives and grounds from January to December 2019. The list of recipients also includes Afua Ansong (Ghana), Andrina Smith (USA and Shinnecock Nation), Cleek Schrey (USA), Colectivo Zoológico (Chile and France), Emily Furr (USA), Jeffrey Perkins (USA), Judith Hertog (Netherlands), Laurie Lambrecht and Toni Ross (USA), Lynsey Peisinger (USA), Mallory Catlett/Restless NYC (USA), Matthew Craven (USA), Maya Watanabe and Agustina Munoz (Argentina and Peru), Mountain Time Arts (USA), Ni'Ja Whitson (USA) and Sasha Wortzel (USA).
Then just this week, New York Live Arts announced Kelly as the 2019-20 Randjelovi /Stryker Resident Commissioned Artist Award. Designed as a vehicle for midcareer artists, the award allows Kelly to receive two years of full-time salary, health care benefits, administrative support, dedicated office space, studio time, commissioning funds to develop a new work, a technical theater residency and a fully produced world premiere.
Kelly said. "To be chosen for such an esteemed award ... seemed impossible to me until now. My company of performers and collaborators have persevered through the unimaginable-though we dissect popular culture, we do not make popular work... [so 1 am) ... beyond grateful and excited to continue using our creations to celebrate and interrogate identity, genre, empathy and ethics."
In another promise, Kelly insisted, "I am hoping, with this comprehensive support, to do more than just make work."
Only time will tell now what 2019 will bring for this talented and forward-thinking artist.

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Texto completo: LeBron James still out injured sure as heck doesn't stop the NBA universe from talking about LeBron James, and it doesn't stop the chatter and speculation about his supporting actors in the ever-entertaining Lakers' soap opera either.
The latest plot twist to come out of Staples Center in Los Angeles is a potential cliffhanger involving coach Luke Walton, who, not for the first time this season, finds his seat of employment trending on the toasty side.
Tuesday's victory over the Bulls might have prevented Walton from being given his marching orders by front office duo Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka (general manager), or it might have stopped owner Jeannie Buss from stepping in to veto his firing, depending on which reports you read.
Regardless, let's be clear on this. Sacking Walton would be completely unfair, preposterously hasty and totally out of touch with the reality of what he has had to contend with this season.
But here's the thing. Not one of those factors will matter when it comes to the ultimate decision on his removal.
Johnson, the Lakers' president of basketball operations, cares nothing for what others think is fair or in forgiving a few tough breaks. As you might expect from someone with such a storied resume in basketball and a burgeoning one in business, he cares about winning. Not the kind of 50-32 winning that plenty of teams would be satisfied with, but the kind that nets you a chunky piece of jewelry at the end of it.
For her part, Buss, who according to The New York Times would balk at attempts to get rid of Walton in the immediate term, wouldn't be doing so because he's a nice guy with a dry sense of humor that makes you want to root for him. She'd be doing so because she expected things to get better and because the disruption of letting the coach go midseason could be counterproductive.
Either way, the reality is Walton will get canned eventually if the Lakers' slide continues. As intriguing as things have been in Los Angeles since James' arrival, the outlook for more drama is stronger than the prognosis for a sudden surge in productivity. There have been some positive signs but plenty of troubling ones, too, including inconsistency and continued clumsy mistakes from young players.
Beating the woeful Bulls 107-100 took the Lakers' record to 4-7 since James tweaked his groin during an impressive Christmas triumph over the Warriors.
Yet the visuals have been largely miserable: The games came against teams with a combined record of 181-240, and seven of the 11 were at home. The low point was a Sunday setback against Cleveland that allowed the Cavaliers to end a league-worst 12-game losing skid.
In Lakerland, fans have gotten worried, with a drop in optimism palpable at recent games. Even the Chicago win turned from being a comfortable stroll into a late nail-biter thanks to some careless lapses.
"We had to find out a way to scrap out a win, and we did it," Walton said, in as friendly a spin as he could manage.
To keep Johnson off his case, Walton had to do one of two things. He either had to make the Lakers excellent with James or he had to improve the inexperienced core in a way more obvious than what most people expected.
Neither has really happened, not with any regularity.
Walton doesn't get quizzed hard by the Los Angeles media, which is almost as soft on him as it is on James, but don't expect Johnson to share any of that reticence.
Meanwhile, Walton seems to have retained plenty of support in the locker room. "Luke has done a great job handling all the adversity we have been through," Kyle Kuzma said.
"It's a tough job," Kuzma added, and he's right, perhaps one of the hardest in the league.
Walton has done a decent job in a grueling spot, a better one it could be argued than coaches whose positions are not coming under any kind of scrutiny.
Yet this is Los Angeles, it is the Lakers, and it is the LeBron James Show, where higher standards are expected and different rules apply.
With visits to Oklahoma City and Houston to come, followed by a home tilt against the Warriors, and the schedule on James' return still not concrete, these are challenging times -- and time is a luxury that Walton doesn't have.

Texto completo: Zoe Saldana plays a ruthless assassin in "Colombiana." And Melissa McCarthy is a C.I.A. administrator-turned-agent in "Spy."
What's on TV
COLOMBIANA (2011) 8 p.m. on AMC. It will surprise few that this revenge thriller, with Zoe Saldana as a daughter avenging her parents' murder, was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. A few years earlier, that pair wrote "Taken," and Besson -- whose other movies include "La Femme Nikita" and "Lucy" -- is a maestro in the field of films in which vengeful women erase scores of nameless henchmen. In "Colombiana," Saldana's ultimate career goal as an assassin is to dispose of the drug lord who once ordered her parents' killing.
PLANET EARTH: YELLOWSTONE 8 p.m. on BBC America. While you can still visit Yellowstone during the government shutdown (unlike many other national parks), this three-part BBC nature documentary offers something that you can't get in just one visit: a look at the national park in three seasons. In the "Winter" episode, aerial shots show coyotes trudging through the park, stalking prey in freshly fallen snow. In "Summer," the snow melts away, feeding rivers filled with trout, which are seen being devoured by otters. Among the natural meals enjoyed in "Autumn" is the trunk of a cottonwood tree, consumed with impressive speed by a content-looking beaver. All three episodes will run back-to-back on Thursday at 8, 9 and 10 p.m.
SPY (2015) 7:50 p.m. and 10:10 p.m. on FXM. Melissa McCarthy goes from desk administrator to clandestine agent in this spy movie sendup, directed by Paul Feig (the director of "Bridesmaids"). After a villain (Rose Byrne) learns the identities of the C.I.A.'s top agents, McCarthy's character volunteers to go undercover to stop her. The rest of the movie includes many typical spy movie trappings -- exotic cars, fistfights and chases. There is also an appearance by 50 Cent. "The busy, silly script allows Ms. McCarthy to be her own best sidekick, in effect an entire sketch-comedy troupe unto herself," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.
What's Streaming
THE ASSASSINATION OF GIANNI VERSACE: AMERICAN CRIME STORY on Netflix. Darren Criss won both a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy for his portrayal of Gianni Versace's killer, Andrew Cunanan, in this mini-series, which also stars Édgar Ramírez as Versace, the fashion designer, and Penélope Cruz as his sister Donatella Versace. "Criss is impressive and haunting as the mediocre con man and murderer," Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The Times, "but 'Assassination' is never quite sure what to make of its central figure, his narcissism or, perhaps, his sociopathy." She called the series "surprisingly inert."
A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES on Shudder and Sundance Now. An adaptation of a 2011 novel by Deborah Harkness, this British series takes place at Oxford University, where a historian with magical powers (Teresa Palmer) strikes up a romance with a handsome vampire played by Matthew Goode of "Downton Abbey."

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
When Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, arrived in the press room of the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill last month to have her photo taken for The New York Times, she was wearing a gray suit like the one John F. Kennedy was depicted wearing in his official White House portrait.
Unlike Kennedy's portrait, which was painted posthumously and was noted for its melancholy tone, Ms. Pelosi is looking directly at the camera in her photos. Her arms are uncrossed, and she appears ready to return to her post as speaker of the House. The photographers wanted to reflect the significance of Ms. Pelosi as a key newsmaker in 2019.
"She is the only woman that has achieved the level of elected office that she has," Ms. Herman said. "She is formative in defining what being a woman in power is."
Ms. Pelosi's image appears online and in a special section of Thursday's paper alongside 129 other female senators and representatives in the 116th United States Congress, who were photographed in December and early January.
The Times is printing 27 versions of the section, one at each of the paper's print sites around the country. Each edition will feature a different female member of Congress on the cover according to a print site's location.
"We have written tons of stories on the elections and who got elected," Beth Flynn, deputy photo editor at The Times, said. "But I think this is a smart, elegant way to see change."
Ms. Herman, a photographer and doctoral candidate in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, has studied how portraits have appeared historically. Typically, artists depicted American political figures, like George Washington or Calvin Coolidge, formally dressed, posed in grand-looking rooms with objects of significance like a sword or a book.
"These portraits conveyed that they were important, powerful men," Ms. Herman said. "We have a different class of lawmakers than we have had before, and why shouldn't they get access to that imagery, access to that gravitas, that the generations before them did?"
Ms. Herman had recently photographed the newly elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on election night for The Times. She left thinking about how all these women would transition to their new jobs in Washington.
Ms. Herman brought the idea to photograph members of Congress, in the style of historical political portraits, to Marisa Schwartz Taylor, a photo editor in the Washington bureau of The Times. The photo editors, who had been considering a similar project, suggested they take portraits of all the women of Congress and assigned the photographer Celeste Sloman to partner with Ms. Herman.
Working from a multi-tabbed spreadsheet, they contacted each congressional office individually. "We had no idea if it would be possible," Ms. Herman said.
On two separate trips, the two photographers drove from New York, lugged their equipment through security on Capitol Hill and set up their lights and backdrops.
As news of the project spread, congressional offices that had been difficult to reach contacted Ms. Herman and Ms. Sloman directly to be photographed. Only one woman, Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, wasn't available to be photographed.
Over five days, the photographers worked in five- to 30-minute blocks taking portraits of the members.
They encouraged the members to bring in articles of significance. Senator Tammy Baldwin carried a bobblehead doll. Senator Tina Smith brought a wooden pheasant. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz wore the pink boxing gloves that Senator Amy Klobuchar had given her as a gift for beating breast cancer.
Some of the women resisted being identified as female politicians. They preferred to be seen as politicians who happened to be women. But Ms. Schwartz Taylor felt it was still important to ask women how they felt about being in power.
"Women in power are scrutinized on so many more levels than men in power," she said. "I think it is important to hear these women's own voices -- instead of listening to everyone else's perspective of them."

I survived combat in Iraq and a suicide attempt at home. But many veterans aren't so lucky.

Texto completo: I'm supposed to be a statistic.
On July 14, 2012, drowning in grief and guilt, I tried to kill myself. Like so many veterans, I had found civilian life desperately difficult. War had drained me of joy. The sights, sounds and smells of the battlefield had been relentlessly looping in my head. The suffering seemed endless. And so, thinking there were no other options of escape, I turned to suicide.
Luckily, I survived. I avoided becoming one of the 20 veterans who kill themselves every day in this country. But I also witnessed firsthand all the ways that our nation's mental health resources fail our fighting men and women. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and the military simply aren't equipped to properly treat sick vets. We must do better.
I enlisted in the military on Sept. 11, 2001. My first major combat experience came on a deployment to Sadr City, Iraq, in the winter of 2005, the apex of the insurgency.
War inflicts permanent psychic scars on survivors. Scrubbing a friend's flesh out of a Bradley reconnaissance vehicle, packing up the cold clothes of a new dad to ship home to his family, pulling tortured corpses out of a water treatment facility — the trauma from these experiences is deep and lasting.
Veterans lost to trauma, rather than combat
That trauma can be more deadly than war itself. More of my brothers from that deployment have died from suicide than combat: Nine were killed in Iraq; 15 have killed themselves back at home.
Our company commander, a decorated vet boasting four Meritorious Service Medals, shot himself on Jan. 16, 2016. He was just 44 years old. Readers of his obituary in the local newspaper might have recognized his face; two years earlier, he had appeared in a photo story about a local military appreciation fish fry, grinning from ear-to-ear and playing with his beloved dogs.
My grandfather, a World War II veteran, committed suicide when my father was sent to Vietnam.
And just last month, decorated Navy Vice Adm. Scott Stearney's body was found in his Bahrain residence after an apparent suicide. During his life, Vice Adm. Stearney was awarded the Air Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Defense Superior Service Medal.
Many vets feel ashamed that they're suffering and work to hide their pain, even from their closest friends and family. When a universally respected officer takes his life, the despair trickles down the chain of command.
Vets shouldn't be dying in a VA parking lot
Existing mental health services for vets are clearly insufficient. From 2001 to 2014, vet suicides have jumped 32 percent. The problem is only going to get worse.
Too many VA facilities simply don't have enough staff to provide personalized care. Therapists are badly outnumbered and vets are hurried through their offices.
Sometimes, staffing shortages force facilities to simply turn vets away, leading to the grotesque phenomenon of desperate soldiers killing themselves on VA grounds.
One 51-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran set himself on fire in front of a New Jersey VA clinic after a canceled appointment. Another veteran shot himself in the waiting room of a VA medical center. A 76-year-old vet shot himself in the parking lot of his Long Island VA facility because "he went to the ER and was denied service," as a hospital employee explained to The New York Times.
But improving treatment requires more than new resources. Our mental health system must also evolve its therapeutic paradigms to be more proactive, treating the root causes of mental illness. Too often, VA facilities are purely reactive, only kicking into action once a vet is suffering a crisis. Proactively addressing the precursors to suicidal ideation can prevent the crisis in the first place.
One of those key precursors is isolation. We go to war with our brothers — but we're left to fight demons at home by ourselves. The VA mental health system needs to create more opportunities for vets to meet each other, share their stories, break that isolation, and process their pain. This is battle-forged trust and understanding. We need our battle buddies to survive post-combat as much as we need them to survive during it. Picnics, afternoon runs, bowling tournaments — simple gatherings can work wonders.
That's why my organization, the Independence Fund, is teaming up with the VA to carry out Operation Resiliency. The just launched partnership provides mental health training retreats for vets and their families, and encourages camaraderie among vets through adaptive sports.
Our military should have a role in prevention as well. Americans are expertly trained to go into battle but receive virtually zero training on what comes next. Each branch of the military should work with vets and their families to develop a personalized mental health plan for when they get home.
Veteran suicide is a national scandal. We must repair and expand the mental health system for our fighting men and women. We must win the war at home.
Danny O'Neel, an Iraq War veteran, is a speaker on suicide prevention, PTSD and mental health for the Independence Fund.

Texto completo: Before we get to the question of whether the president of the United States is a Russian asset, let's consider another question: When was the last time a popular and contentious conspiracy theory turned out to be true? Not a little true, but, like, really true?
It does happen. Whittaker Chambers was right about Alger Hiss being a Soviet spy. The government really did put poison in legal alcohol during Prohibition.
But even when conspiracy theorists earn the right to say "We told you so," the actual reality often falls short of the mark. The motives of the conspirators aren't as sinister as claimed, or the plot is better explained by incompetence than malevolence, or the scope of the conspiracy itself isn't nearly as vast as suspected.
This has always been my problem with the most extreme versions of the Russian collusion theories. The British former journalist and politician Louise Mensch offers an extreme version. Among her claims: Vladimir Putin had my late friend Andrew Breitbart murdered so that former Donald Trump consigliere Steve Bannon could take over Breitbart's eponymous website; Russian intelligence planted Hillary Clinton's emails on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop; pretty much the whole of the GOP leadership is in cahoots with the Kremlin.
I have a similar problem with the Deep State theories that have bounced around the Trumpian right: President Trump's problems are all the result of the fiendish doings of a vast "globalist" conspiracy.
"The central premise," Infowars nutter Jerome Corsi writes in his book "Killing the Deep State," "is that President Trump is the target of a coup d'etat being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order." The Deep State hates Trump, the argument goes, because his victory meant it could no longer "continue running the international drug trade while supporting the military-industrial complex in a policy of perpetual war."
Obviously, most sane people on either side of the Trumpian divide reject the cartoonish versions of their own positions. But similarities endure.
The bombshell New York Times report that the FBI opened an investigation into whether Trump was a Russian asset strikes me as simultaneously understandable and outrageous. Trump's behavior in 2016 and early 2017 was enough to overload the pattern-recognition software of anyone not already committed to Trump's innocence at all costs, particularly if you were both reading the news and receiving raw, and occasionally flawed, intelligence such as the Steele dossier.
Trump's disastrous hiring of actual Kremlin stooges and cronies, his praise of Putin, his lies about business dealings with Russia, his public beseeching of the Kremlin to release Clinton's emails, his campaign's infamous meeting at Trump Tower with an actual Russian agent, not to mention his firing of the FBI director and his comments to Russian officials in the Oval Office: One doesn't even need to resort to Deep State theories to understand why the FBI would be concerned.
But that doesn't necessarily make Trump a Manchurian president either. He or his campaign may or may not have colluded with Russia. The Department of Justice might have cut corners to "get" him. Still, rather than elaborate conspiracies, it's far more likely that ad hoc decisions were made in the response to ad hoc actions by a candidate who thought he was going to lose and, later, by a president who didn't know what he was doing.
Jeb Bush was right when he predicted in 2015 that "chaos candidate" Trump would be a "chaos president."
The Atlantic just published a list, "Unthinkable: 50 Moments that Define an Improbable Presidency," and what comes through most is that Trump's glandular, impulsive and often vindictive character is the only reliable signal in the noise that is his presidency.
Any theory that doesn't take this into account is not likely to pan out.

Texto completo: By now you've probably seen headlines from STAT and the New York Times detailing bombshell allegations in a Massachusetts lawsuit filed against Purdue Pharma, the OxyContin maker accused of misleading doctors and patients about the addictive painkiller.
Here are five takeaways from the reporting.
1. Sackler's Strategy A story published Tuesday in STAT, an online health and science publication produced by Boston Globe Media, detailed how Dr. Richard Sackler, who became Purdue cochairman in 2003, outlined a strategy two years earlier to blame addicts for mounting overdoses.
“We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible," Sackler wrote in an e-mail in February 2001, according to court filings reviewed by STAT. “They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals."
2. Tufts and Mass. General linked to Controversy Court records show that Purdue established ties with Tufts University's Health Sciences Campus and MGH in an effort to, as STAT reported, “expand prescribing by physicians, generate goodwill toward opioid painkillers among medical students and doctors in training, and combat negative reports about opioid addiction."
The STAT report said Purdue has paid MGH $3 million since 2009 and proposed “areas where education in the field of pain is needed" and “curriculum which might meet such needs," per court records. Tufts, meanwhile, put a Purdue employee on its adjunct faculty in 2011. Three years later, the STAT report said, Purdue-written materials were approved for teaching to Tufts students.
3. Who's Suing Purdue, Anyway? That would be the state of Massachusetts, led by the office of Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat who's targeted the Trump administration and corporate titans like ExxonMobil in high-profile civil litigation.
In the Purdue suit, the state alleges the company “hammered Massachusetts families in every way possible," according to a legal filing reviewed by STAT. The document noted that since 2007, Purdue has raked in more than $500 million in revenue in Massachusetts, and “the stigma they used as a weapon made the crisis worse."
4. What's Purdue Saying? In a statement to STAT, the pharma giant said its medications are subject to government approval and oversight, and that the state's “amended complaint irresponsibly and counterproductively casts every prescription of OxyContin as dangerous and illegitimate, substituting its lawyers' sensational allegations for the expert scientific determinations of the [FDA] and completely ignoring the millions of patients who are prescribed Purdue Pharma's medicines for the management of their severe chronic pain."
Purdue also asserted that Healey's office omitted information about the company's efforts in the past decade to promote safe and appropriate use of opioid medicines, STAT reported.
5. Has Purdue Faced Similar Lawsuits Before? Yes. From the New York Times on Tuesday: “Since OxyContin came on the market in 1996, more than 200,000 people have died in the United States from overdoses involving prescription opioids, and Purdue Pharma has been the target of numerous lawsuits."
The Times also reported that in 1995, “when the Food and Drug Administration approved OxyContin, it allowed Purdue Pharma to claim that the opioid's long-acting formulation was 'believed to reduce' its appeal to drug abusers compared with traditional painkillers such as Percocet and Vicodin."

Texto completo: I'm supposed to be a statistic.
On July 14, 2012, drowning in grief and guilt, I tried to kill myself. Like so many veterans, I had found civilian life desperately difficult. War had drained me of joy. The sights, sounds and smells of the battlefield had been relentlessly looping in my head. The suffering seemed endless. And so, thinking there were no other options of escape, I turned to suicide.
Luckily, I survived. I avoided becoming one of the 20 veterans who kill themselves every day in this country. But I also witnessed firsthand all the ways that our nation's mental health resources fail our fighting men and women. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and the military simply aren't equipped to properly treat sick vets. We must do better.
Read more commentary:
My husband lost a limb in Afghanistan. Now, as his caregiver, I'm on the front lines.
My partner died by suicide. He doesn't know the damage he left behind.
I lost my job because of the government shutdown, and my family isn't the only one at risk
I enlisted in the military on Sept. 11, 2001. My first major combat experience came on a deployment to Sadr City, Iraq, in the winter of 2005, the apex of the insurgency.
War inflicts permanent psychic scars on survivors. Scrubbing a friend's flesh out of a Bradley reconnaissance vehicle, packing up the cold clothes of a new dad to ship home to his family, pulling tortured corpses out of a water treatment facility — the trauma from these experiences is deep and lasting.
Veterans lost to trauma, rather than combat
That trauma can be more deadly than war itself. More of my brothers from that deployment have died from suicide than combat: Nine were killed in Iraq; 15 have killed themselves back at home.
Our company commander, a decorated vet boasting four Meritorious Service Medals, shot himself on Jan. 16, 2016. He was just 44 years old. Readers of his obituary in the local newspaper might have recognized his face; two years earlier, he had appeared in a photo story about a local military appreciation fish fry, grinning from ear-to-ear and playing with his beloved dogs.
My grandfather, a World War II veteran, committed suicide when my father was sent to Vietnam.
And just last month, decorated Navy Vice Adm. Scott Stearney's body was found in his Bahrain residence after an apparent suicide. During his life, Vice Adm. Stearney was awarded the Air Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Defense Superior Service Medal.
Many vets feel ashamed that they're suffering and work to hide their pain, even from their closest friends and family. When a universally respected officer takes his life, the despair trickles down the chain of command.
Vets shouldn't be dying in a VA parking lot
Existing mental health services for vets are clearly insufficient. From 2001 to 2014, vet suicides have jumped 32 percent. The problem is only going to get worse.
Too many VA facilities simply don't have enough staff to provide personalized care. Therapists are badly outnumbered and vets are hurried through their offices.
Sometimes, staffing shortages force facilities to simply turn vets away, leading to the grotesque phenomenon of desperate soldiers killing themselves on VA grounds.
One 51-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran set himself on fire in front of a New Jersey VA clinic after a canceled appointment. Another veteran shot himself in the waiting room of a VA medical center. A 76-year-old vet shot himself in the parking lot of his Long Island VA facility because "he went to the ER and was denied service," as a hospital employee explained to The New York Times.
But improving treatment requires more than new resources. Our mental health system must also evolve its therapeutic paradigms to be more proactive, treating the root causes of mental illness. Too often, VA facilities are purely reactive, only kicking into action once a vet is suffering a crisis. Proactively addressing the precursors to suicidal ideation can prevent the crisis in the first place.
One of those key precursors is isolation. We go to war with our brothers — but we're left to fight demons at home by ourselves. The VA mental health system needs to create more opportunities for vets to meet each other, share their stories, break that isolation, and process their pain. This is battle-forged trust and understanding. We need our battle buddies to survive post-combat as much as we need them to survive during it. Picnics, afternoon runs, bowling tournaments — simple gatherings can work wonders.
That's why my organization, the Independence Fund, is teaming up with the VA to carry out Operation Resiliency. The just launched partnership provides mental health training retreats for vets and their families, and encourages camaraderie among vets through adaptive sports.
Our military should have a role in prevention as well. Americans are expertly trained to go into battle but receive virtually zero training on what comes next. Each branch of the military should work with vets and their families to develop a personalized mental health plan for when they get home.
Veteran suicide is a national scandal. We must repair and expand the mental health system for our fighting men and women. We must win the war at home.
Danny O'Neel, an Iraq War veteran, is a speaker on suicide prevention, PTSD and mental health for the Independence Fund.

Dietitian tells us how to get and stay healthy

Texto completo: Jaclyn Murphy, a registered dietitian for the Valley Health System, has good news and bad news when it comes to your New Year's weight-loss goals. The bad news is that it won't be an overnight journey.
No one-month shred will sustain a healthy weight loss, she says. The good news? You really don't have to cut out any foods. Carbs, dairy, gluten, even the occasional brownie are all a go ... in moderation, of course.
"Fad diets are very restrictive on food groups and nutrients that our bodies need to function. They can be unsafe and unsustainable in the long run," Murphy said. Indeed, 95 percent of people who go on diets to lose weight fail, according to studies cited by the New York Times and U.S. News & World Report.
So, hopping on the latest fad diet (the words Keto, Paleo and Alkaline come to mind) isn't necessarily the best way to meet that New Year's resolution.
Murphy has a Bachelor's degree from the University of Rhode Island in Nutrition and Dietetics, as well as a graduate certificate from Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine Dietetic Internship Program. At Valley's Center for Health & Wellness, she gives community lectures and works with people on a one-on-one basis to help them lead a healthier life.
A major takeaway from her experience in nutrition, she said, is that everybody is different.
Different plans work for different people, based on dietary restrictions and needs. We spoke to Murphy to bust some myths about dieting, and learn some tips on how to safely work toward a healthier lifestyle.
Myth: Fad diets are sustainable and healthy. Murphy says that most people need to be fueled by every type of food group in moderation. So, cutting out carbs, fat, dairy and legumes (unless there's a medical need), which many fad diets encourage, isn't necessarily healthy. She points to the Keto diet, for example ,which calls for cutting out most carbs, as a potentially unsafe way of eating.
Myth: Eating gluten is bad for you. "Unless someone has a medical need to avoid gluten, like Celiac Disease, it's OK to eat," Murphy said.
Myth: There is "good" food and "bad" food. Murphy tells her clients to avoid labeling foods as "good" or "bad." They all fuel our bodies in different ways. "It's cliché, but I think you can find a balance and a moderation consuming all food groups," she said.
So how do you start a healthy weight-loss program?
"What makes the idea of losing weight difficult is that it's hard to find where to start," Murphy said. "It's one of the biggest challenges. I think adopting a healthy and individualized eating plan is a great place to start."
Here are a few tips from Murphy to help you create a healthy eating plan for 2019:
Ask yourself what your motivation is to lose the weight. Do you want more energy to do the things you love? Do you want to stay healthy for your family? Do you want to feel your best? "Once people start thinking of that they realize what actually matters and why they're getting healthy in the first place," Murphy said.
Focus on creating a plan that's going to incorporate more, rather than less. Eat more whole fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy and whole grains. Drink more water.
Work the foods you love into your eating plan in small portions. "When I work with individuals, I try to be as realistic as possible," Murphy said. "Food is meant to be enjoyed. Don't feel restricted to eat only the 'good-for-you' foods."
Find a way to track your goals. Some people like writing down a plan to see their goals on paper. Others decide to make a food journal to keep track of what they're eating. Either way, Murphy said, it allows you to get to know what you're fueling your body with.
Set smart, realistic time goals. One week to lose 10 pounds? That's not going to work, Murphy said. Slow and steady is the way to go. "If a diet offers a quick fix or it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
Focus on your mental health, as well. "Wellness is a combination of good nutrition, physical activity and positive mental well-being. I think positive mental health has a great impact on our dietary choices being in tune with our bodies ... Know when you're hungry and know when you're full. It all goes back to self-awareness and self-care."
Whole grains are you friends. Murphy recommends trying quinoa, farro, barley and more to round out a meal.
Overall, Murphy said to take pleasure in what you're eating. "I love food. That's one of the reasons I got into nutrition," she said. "Food is something that everyone needs. It's personal, cultural and something that should be enjoyed."

House condemns white nationalism, supremacy; Vote comes in the wake of comments by Iowa Rep. King

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy, a measure prompted by the comments of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who openly questioned why those terms had become offensive.
Having been stripped of his committee assignments Monday and facing further reproach, King went to the House floor Tuesday to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to protest that he had been misquoted in The New York Times article.
"There is no tape for this interview I did. There's no way to go back and listen," he said, conceding that he might have said the quoted words but challenging how they have been interpreted. "That ideology never showed up in my head. I don't know how it would have come out of my mouth."
The resolution, introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., mentions King's remarks in its preamble, but the measure does not directly rebuke King himself. It passed 424-1, with Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ga., voting no because he favors a censure of King.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in floor remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue attendees in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross, and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King said he came from a family of abolitionists, before ultimately calling on his colleagues to support a measure that is intended to serve as a serious admonition against him.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
But those words came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure - the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after GOP leaders moved to punish King by stripping him of his committee assignments and King earned a rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King's comments but stopped short of calling for his resignation.
"I think that's up to Steve King," he said.
Some Democrats are pressing for further punishment. Two Democrats have filed censure resolutions that are set to see floor action by Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., praised Republican leaders for their action but left open the possibility that he would vote for a censure resolution.
Hoyer exploded when asked how King's behavior compared to the last House member to be censured, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
King's conduct, he said, "far exceeds" Rangel's actions, which included improperly using his office to solicit funds and failing to pay taxes on a vacation home.
Hoyer served as majority leader during Rangel's 2010 ethics proceedings and pushed to reprimand Rangel, a lesser punishment than censure.
"What King is doing and what others have done is to encourage the undermining of the basic principles of our country," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House is considering Indra K. Nooyi, the former chief executive officer of PepsiCo, for the position of World Bank president, according to several people familiar with the process.
Ms. Nooyi, who stepped down from her role at PepsiCo last August after leading the company for 12 years, has been courted as an administration ally by Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, who is playing a role in the selection of a nominee.
The decision-making process for the top post at the World Bank is fluid and in its initial stages, and early front-runners and candidates often fall off the radar, or withdraw from consideration, before the president makes his ultimate pick. Mr. Trump often makes his own gut decisions about whom to chose.
It is unclear whether Ms. Nooyi would accept the nomination if chosen by the administration, but Ms. Trump, who has written on Twitter that she views Ms. Nooyi as a "mentor + inspiration," has floated her name as a potential successor. Ms. Nooyi has dined with the president and other business leaders at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. She drew criticism for assuming an advisory role on his business council, which was disbanded after many chief executives quit following Mr. Trump's comments that blamed "many sides" for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.
Negative comments that Ms. Nooyi made after the 2016 election, during which she did not publicly endorse any candidate, are seen as a potential roadblock to her nomination. Mr. Trump's win, she said, created a lot of questions among her daughters and her employees.
"They were all in mourning," Ms. Nooyi said in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times's DealBook conference in 2016.
"Our employees are all crying. And the question that they're asking, especially those who are not white: 'Are we safe?' Women are asking, 'Are we safe?' LGBT people are asking, 'Are we safe?' I never thought I'd have had to answer those questions."
Ms. Nooyi later tried to clarify her remarks, and a spokesman for PepsiCo told Fortune magazine that "Mrs. Nooyi misspoke. She was referring to the reaction of a group of employees she spoke to who were apprehensive about the outcome of the election. She never intended to imply that all employees feel the same way."
That those past comments may hinder her chances are a reminder that Mr. Trump does not have a large circle of loyalists to choose from for top positions.
Other candidates are also being considered, including David Malpass, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, whose loyalty to the president runs deep: He served as an economic adviser on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. Another name in the mix is Ray Washburne, the president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Mr. Washburne also served on Mr. Trump's 2016 finance team and was seen as an early candidate for a cabinet position.
The World Bank's current president, Jim Yong Kim, said this month that he would step down in February to join a private infrastructure investment firm, an unexpected departure that comes nearly three years before the end of his term. Mr. Kim was first appointed by the Obama administration in 2012, on the recommendation of Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and was reappointed by President Barack Obama in 2016 to serve a second five-year term.
The process of choosing a successor is being overseen by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff; and Ms. Trump, whose role in the process was announced by the White House on Monday.
Ms. Trump's role in the process drew some criticism from ethics watchdogs on Monday, who said that it could pose a conflict of interest for the president's daughter to be involved in international economic matters when she has not completely divested from her assets.
But Ms. Trump's role is notable because of her unique sway over her father when it comes to personnel matters. The group was expected to begin the interview process on Tuesday in order to present Mr. Trump with recommendations for a nominee.
A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the candidates.

Texto completo: Watching is The New York Times's TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here .
Freed from holiday obligations, we're back to our regularly scheduled programming. Below are the most interesting of what we've found for new movies and TV series coming to the major streaming services in January, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.)
'Comedians of the World'
Starts streaming: Jan. 1, on Netflix.
Forty-seven stand-up comics from around the world trot out their best bits in this series of half-hour specials, which offers an excellent opportunity to sample new and diverse comedic voices. Want to get out of a sexually awkward situation? Aditi Mittal, who hails from India, has a foolproof excuse for you to try. Thinking of getting a Brazilian wax? The Canadian-American comic DeAnne Smith will slap that out of you. Didn't think it was kosher to joke about H.I.V./AIDS? Loyiso Madinga (South Africa) thinks you should give it a try. Concerned about racial profiling? Nazeem Hussain (Australia) explains how he's learned to use it to his advantage. It's the funniest trip you can take without leaving your couch.
--
'Pan's Labyrinth'
Starts streaming: Jan. 1, on Netflix.
The director Guillermo del Toro knows nightmares -- whether they be fantastical (here, the Pale Man, with eyes in the palms of his hands) or all too real (the fascism under the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco). A pensive little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) tries to navigate both kinds of horrors as her everyday world becomes tangled with a symbolic one. Watch out for the slime-spewing toads!
--
'Leave No Trace'
Starts streaming: Jan. 3, on Amazon.
Debra Granik's beautifully observed story focuses on a father (Ben Foster) and daughter (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie, in a breakout performance) who are living off the grid in the wilds of a big nature preserve. Civilization isn't very far away, however, and it begins to intrude, attempting to force this stripped-down family unit into a conventional lifestyle. The movie asks fundamental questions: What is "home," and how important is community? The answers, like the two extraordinary leads, are deeply moving.
--
'Support the Girls'
Starts streaming: Jan. 3, on Hulu.
Lisa Conroy (Regina Hall) is the manager at a Texas sports bar that's not unlike a Hooters (it's called Double Whammies), and she's having a rough day. Her marriage is collapsing, someone is trapped in one of the bar's air vents, a waitress needs to be bailed out of jail, and -- maybe worst of all -- the cable's out on fight night. This movie is warm and unforced, about the intersections of sex and sisterhood and working-class solidarity. Mainly, though, it's very funny.
--
[Here is The New York Times's list of the best movies on Netflix right now.]
'Annihilation'
Starts streaming: Jan. 5, on Hulu.
It may require more than one viewing to fully process the eerie beauty of this one-of-a-kind sci-fi movie. The mysterious forest into which Natalie Portman and her team of fellow scientists are delving is a zone of dreamlike interspecies mutations, and the director Alex Garland ("Ex Machina") enhances its otherworldly strangeness with a woozy score and unique sound design. Amid all the surreal visuals there are jolts of horror, and the virtually wordless conclusion has a haunting ambiguity.
--
'Eighth Grade'
Starts streaming: Jan. 13, on Amazon.
Middle school can be the worst, as you may well remember -- especially today, when kids are marinated in status-obsessed social media and pressured to perform on multiple platforms. Lovably awkward Kayla (Elsie Fisher) vlogs on YouTube, where she dispenses basic advice ("Be yourself"). But Kayla could herself use some advice as she attempts to navigate her last week of eighth grade in a pond of popular girls and hormonal boys who all seem so much cooler than she is. The writer-director Bo Burnham, in his feature debut, approaches the queasy teenage unease with a gentle fascination.
--
'True Detective' Season 3 Premiere
Starts streaming: Jan. 13, on HBO.
Season 1: brilliant. Season 2: bad -- very bad, actually. Now Season 3 is here, hoping to recapture your attention, and the good news is, it has potential. The story, set in the Ozarks, takes place along multiple timelines between 1980 and 2015, and stars Mahershala Ali (at maximum brood here) as an Arkansas state detective haunted by a case involving two missing children. The story here isn't as philosophically resonant as Season 1, but it's more nuanced, and rich with noirish twists and turns and real-life overtones (at one point it recalls the case of the West Memphis Three). It's all compellingly strange, and worthy of your renewed interest.
--
'FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened'
Starts streaming: Jan. 18, on Netflix.
The calamitous Fyre Festival was initially billed as a luxury package music extravaganza in the Bahamas: Yachts! Villas! Private jets! But the 2017 party never started and was soon the target of bitter jokes, class-action lawsuits and criminal investigations. How did it go so wrong? This documentary tracks the event's many problems, and it's hard to decide which is the most outrageous revelation. Is it that the organizer/grifter Billy McFarland (now serving a federal prison sentence on wire fraud charges) actually instructed one of his crew to bribe a customs agent with sexual favors? Or that stranded attendees wound up locked inside a local airport without food or water? It's a fascinating disaster, its only bright spot being that it didn't happen to you.
--
'Tully'
Starts streaming: Jan. 19, on HBO.
Charlize Theron gives yet another knockout performance as the bedraggled Marlo, a woman who is ground down by her third pregnancy and, after the baby arrives, desperate for help. (Her loving husband is away a lot on business.) Suddenly an effervescent young woman named Tully (Mackenzie Davis) turns up to provide night-nanny assistance, offering much-needed advice, companionship and fresh-baked cupcakes. Marlo slowly gets her life back ("It's like I can see color again," she marvels), but just when you think you see a happy ending on the horizon, the story takes a major left turn, and the director Jason Reitman and the writer Diablo Cody bring it into a whole new emotional realm. The movie casts a magical spell that's likely to stick with you after the end-credits roll.
--
'Incredibles 2'
Starts streaming: Jan. 30, on Netflix.
Everybody's favorite animated superhero family is back. You remember the Parrs: Bob, the dad (Mr. Incredible); Helen, the mom (Elastigirl), their teen daughter, Violet; her little brother Dash; and the baby, Jack-Jack (who now has some surprising super powers of his own). Also returning are the family's frosty super-friend Frozone and their droll spandex guru Edna Mode. But Elastigirl is the center of attention now, facing off against a mysterious new supervillain and, dare we say, stretching herself a bit? You can never get too much Elastigirl!

New York Times wasn't always so suspicious of 'secretive communications' with Russia

Texto completo: Newsrooms turned their attention again this week to the never-ending Russia investigation and their storylines on President Trump’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So it’s as good a time as any to recall the New York Times’ posture on Russia before 2016.

The Times editorial board on Monday listed all the ways Trump is perceived by Democrats and liberals in the news media as working to advance Russian interests, including his “secretive communications with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.” In this case “secretive communications” is short for: Trump had a meeting with Putin, but Trump asked that the American interpreter not share details of the encounter with others. (So “secretive” was the meeting that our top diplomat, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was present for it.)

But the Times was much more generous in describing what you might otherwise call “secretive communications” with Russia when Barack Obama was president. In 2012, during his re-election campaign, Obama was caught by a hot mic whispering to then-President Dmitry Medvedev that he was potentially willing to roll back missile defense initiatives in Europe, something the Russians wanted very much, but not until the 2012 election, the last chance for voters to hold Obama accountable, was over.

“On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space,” Obama told Medvedev, referring to Putin, who would be taking Medvedev’s place in two months. “This is my last election,” Obama continued. “After my election I have more flexibility.”

Unlike Trump’s meeting with Putin, which Tillerson witnessed, Obama’s conversation about his explicit willingness to bow to Russian interests wasn’t supposed to be heard by anyone at all. And yet a Times news story charitably described the exchange as “a private moment of candor.”

Two days after the Times reported on Obama’s hot-mic comments, the paper’s editorial board excoriated and mocked Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for labeling Russia as the U.S.’s “No. 1 geopolitical foe.”

“His comments display either a shocking lack of knowledge about international affairs or just craven politics,” the Times said. “Either way, they are reckless and unworthy of a major presidential contender.”

In 2012, when it involved criticism for Saint Obama, any talk of the Russian threat and confronting it smacked of “craven politics.” In 2016, on the other hand, we are supposed to be suspicious of everything Putin does and worry that the current president is in his pocket.

The Times on Monday, without irony, criticized Republicans who “quite recently regarded [Russia] as America’s chief rival.” There is no reason for anyone to take the Times seriously — the paper that not only failed to take Russia seriously until it was politically convenient, but actually mocked and derided those who did as "unworthy" to participate in modern politics.

Texto completo: President Trump said Tuesday that FBI employees are on his side, and are "disgusted" by what they've learned about how the agency's leaders worked against him.

"The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin' James Comey and the so-called 'leaders' of the FBI," Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. "Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!"

The New York Times reported last week that the FBI investigated whether Trump was working for Russia after he fired former FBI Director James Comey.

When asked on Saturday whether that report is true, Trump said that was as "the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."

But Democrats indicated they want to look more closely at the accusation. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked why Trump is "so chummy" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Deadlocked, President Trump and Congress remain at an impasse over money for a border wall.
But hungry bacteria in a valuable U.S. Geological Survey experiment remain very much alive.
So a furloughed scientist, against orders, sneaks into the closed Menlo Park-based lab to feed the microbes ensuring that the three-year-long project, while hobbled, doesn't fail.
He is just one of the Bay Area's many frustrated researchers caught in the middle of the power struggle that shows no sign of being resolved any time soon.
So far, President Trump has refused to consider a budget that lacks $5.6 billion for a 2,000-mile border wall. On Monday he told reporters as he boarded Marine One that he has rejected a proposal by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start talks with Democratic lawmakers on funding the wall.
At NASA Ames Research Center, scientists are supposed to be busy getting ready to test software that will fly on the International Space Station this year.
They should be designing air traffic control systems for unmanned aircraft and drones. They've already skipped January's big annual American Astronomical Society conference and missed the deadline to submit their work to the upcoming Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, the largest planetary science meeting in the world.
"I can't even read my email," said Ames scientist Jeremy Frank of Sunnyvale, a Ph.D. in computer science who builds software that helps astronauts operate future missions to Mars without assistance from Mission Control. To fend off boredom, he's doing chores, reading and bird-watching at Los Gatos Creek County Park.
With a doctorate in industrial engineering, aeronautics expert Parimal Kopardekar, who is not allowed to say where he works, is spending his time leading hikes in the Cupertino Hills and cooking dinner for his family.
Larry Miller, who studies the fate of chromium in contaminated groundwater, cleaned the family's chicken coop, helped friends by house-sitting and built a dog run for a new puppy. He's also surfing, leaving his El Granada home before dawn.
"The furlough coincides with a nice run of winter surf," he said.
A NASA scientist who asked not to be identified said, "Our whole program for returning to the moon ostensibly a Trump administration priority is slipping on a day-by-day basis. The Chinese are moving forward with great speed, and their achievements are impressing the entire world  while we're unable to do a thing."
Congress has already passed a bill that will provide back pay to federal workers once they are back on the job when the shutdown ends. But federal contractors will not be paid.
And Bay Area labs, which were separately funded through September Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Lawrence Livermore Lab, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Sandia National Labs in Livermore are safe from this shutdown.
But USGS and NASA Ames are closed. So are the Agriculture Department, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is on partial shutdown. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is continuing to pay 794 essential employees, some responsible for maintaining scientific instrumentation and lab animals, plants and test organisms.
The National Park Service suspended wildlife monitoring of species such as the endangered coho salmon at Point Reyes National Seashore and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, because 80 percent of the park employees are furloughed. Other critical research "windows," such as seasonal shifts in insect populations, are missed.
Visitors to Point Reyes, Merced National Wildlife Refuge and other federal parks say they are quiet and beautiful but without facilities.
"We saw a bobcat right near the closed Visitors Center and watched for a good 15 minutes," said Deborah Petersen of Half Moon Bay, who visited Point Reyes on Sunday. "I hate to see this shutdown and feel badly for all the hardworking government workers going without paychecks. But for those of us who took the chance to visit the national seashore, we were rewarded with a more peaceful and wilder experience than usual."
Because furloughed government scientists are banned from any form of work activity, Kopardekar has created a Facebook group called Shutdown Strategies Support Group, where members share coping strategies.
"What I miss is the interaction with colleagues," he said. "I don't like to sit alone. I like teamwork. If I feel unattached from everybody, I realized others might feel the same way."
Some suggestions are homespun: Bake pies! Empty the freezer! Clean up clutter!
Other suggestions, like Kopardekar's scorecard, are analytical. His four-cell table lets furloughed workers track their daily score on four dimensions: self-development, exercise, diet and connections.
"Try to get 4.0 daily!" he wrote.
Scientists say they are still engaged in professional activities. Kopardekar reviews the online curriculum and course content at Colorado State University's business school. He also is volunteering his time and strategic advice to friends' startup companies.
USGS' Miller continues to fulfill one important and deadline-driven part of his job: reviewing manuscripts of journal articles.
"I agreed to do it, so I felt obligated," he said. "Also, I'm the best person to do the review."
Despite pledges from Congress that they will receive back pay, many furloughed workers have financial anxieties. While their working spouses help shoulder the burden, they say the cost of living in the Bay Area is unsustainable on one salary.
"We had a family discussion and decided that we won't go out to eat at all during the furlough," said one NASA scientist who asked not to be named because the agency asked employees not to give interviews about the shutdown. "We're also postponing or canceling planned purchases, and all of our vacation planning for this year is either on hold or we'll cancel it entirely."
To survive, they may seek jobs in the private sector.
"For many of us highly skilled technical workers at NASA and other agencies we could easily get jobs in the private sector paying far more than we make now," the scientist said. "We stay where we are, despite our lower salaries, because of our dedication to our country and because of our passion for what we do tasks that no one else in the world does. Quite simply, we love our work.
"But the current shutdown, perhaps more than any other in the past, has thrown all of this into question," he said. "We can accept lower salaries, but we can't accept no salary at all."

Texto completo: The latest reveals in the Trump-Russia-election saga? That President Donald Trump may have been secretly working for Russia, that the FBI started investigating that possibility back in 2017, and that Trump has gone to great lengths to hide records of his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The news came from separate reports by "The Washington Post" and the "New York Times. "
When Trump was asked whether he was doing Putin's bidding, he said the question was the most insulting one he had ever heard. But at least one late-night comic can think of a more insulting one. Jimmy Fallon tells all (courtesy of Stormy Daniels).
And Stephen Colbert explores whether Trump was duped or a willing participant in a new game show. Want to find out who wins? Watch today's Best of Late Night, above. Hint: It's not America.

Texto completo: Inflammatory remarks
roil party already
struggling on race
President Trump professed ignorance Monday about recent remarks from Rep. Steve King regarding white supremacy, while the storm around the Iowa Republican's inflammatory comments continued to grow and senior GOP officials moved to strip him of valuable committee assignments.
Yet Trump had no qualms about engaging in racially offensive comments of his own over the weekend, invoking the Wounded Knee massacre - which killed hundreds of Sioux Indians on a South Dakota reservation in 1890 - to launch a political attack against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her claims of American Indian heritage.
The fresh controversies underscored the GOP's ongoing struggles over the issue of race, even as condemnations from senior Republicans of King's remarks grew louder on Monday and lawmakers argued that his voice didn't represent the party.
"It is a challenge for us," Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said of the GOP and race. Calling King's remarks "foolish" and "very insensitive," Rounds added: "I think these types of examples hurt us."
Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), vice chair of the House Republican conference, said he was offended by King's comments, "not even just by the words, but even the tone."
"Republicans as a whole have tried to respect the voters' wishes, specifically in Iowa in this case," Walker said. "Even though we've had some things we've gone on record and publicly disagreed with Mr. King on, I think it's reached a place that any time - it's kind of like a football team. . . . If it begins to impact the team in a negative way, then you have a team meeting and say we've got to work on this."
In a tweet Sunday night, Trump mocked Warren - a potential 2020 presidential candidate - over a recent Instagram Live appearance from her kitchen during which she awkwardly announced that she was going to grab a beer as she spoke directly to her followers.
"If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!" Trump tweeted, using a name he has repeatedly used to disparage Warren.
The tweet drew a rebuke from the GOP senators who represent South Dakota, as well as a harsh condemnation from the National Congress of American Indians, which denounced Trump's tweet in the "strongest possible terms." "On behalf of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, I condemn President Trump's racist and disrespectful tweet about this brutal incident, in which an estimated 300 unarmed men, women, and children were rounded up and slaughtered," said Rodney Bordeaux, the tribe's chairman.
In an interview, Rounds said of Trump's tweet: "I do not think he gains any points by using the site of that atrocity in a political speech or a tweet. So I think maybe he should reconsider using that one in the future. That's not appropriate."
"I wish he wouldn't do that. I wish he wouldn't tweet as much, I've said many times in the past," added Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). "That's obviously a very sensitive part of our state's history. I wish he'd stay away from it."
Before he left for New Orleans for a farm conference, Trump dismissed questions about King, who started a firestorm when he asked in a New York Times interview published last week, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
"Who?" Trump responded. When a reporter clarified, Trump responded: "I haven't been following."
When asked about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) calling him a "racist," Trump dismissed the question, saying, "Who cares?"
The comments came as House Republican leaders took action against King and decided not to give King any committee assignments this Congress, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday night. McCarthy and King had met privately on Monday afternoon.
"This is not the first time we've heard these comments. That is not the party of Lincoln. It is definitely not American," McCarthy said. "All people are created equal in America, and we want to take a very strong stance about that."
King said in response to the leadership's decision: "Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth."
But the condemnations from top party leaders grew on Monday.
"I have no tolerance for such positions and those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement to The Washington Post. "Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work."
When asked whether King should resign from his northwestern Iowa congressional seat, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the party's 2012 presidential nominee, responded: "Absolutely." King's comments to the Times has followed a long string of remarks disparaging of immigrants and minorities, as well as a seeming embrace of far-right foreign politicians and parties that have been openly hostile to those groups.
Shortly before the November election, for instance, King lashed out at the media after The Post reported that he had met with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties after flying to Europe for a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group.
This time, more Republicans than ever are speaking out against King, and last week a prominent state senator announced that he would seek to unseat King in the 2020 Republican primary.
There has been no word from party leaders on whether they will get involved against King in a primary. Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra has announced a candidacy, and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) speculated Monday that more could get in the race.
Grassley said he "very seldom" gets involved in primaries, but said King's remarks were "offensive" and added, "I would ridicule any statement about white supremacy, white nationalism, whatever you want to call it, and I detest it and deplore it."
Meanwhile, House Democrats prepared to vote this week on a resolution disapproving of King's remarks, a sanction that is short of a formal reprimand or censure. But leadership faced resistance from rank-and-file members who wanted harsher sanctions against King.
Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, said disapproval did not go far enough and called on the GOP to expel King from the conference and remove him from his committee assignments.
Democratic Reps. Bobby L. Rush (Ill.) and Tim Ryan (Ohio) said the House should take action and separately indicated that they would file resolutions to do so. Censure is a rare punishment for conduct bringing dishonor on the House, the most serious penalty that can be levied short of expulsion.
King is a figure of prominence in the House GOP, not only because of the controversies he has stoked but also as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, a leader in opposing legalized abortion and as chairman of the Conservative Opportunity Society, an internal caucus of right-wing House Republicans that meets regularly.
And because of his position in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses, King's endorsement has also been a coveted one among Republicans vying for the presidential nomination.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--President Trump rejected the notion that there was anything inappropriate in his dealings with Moscow, responding to heightened scrutiny of his interactions with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.
"I never worked for Russia," Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Monday morning for a speech in New Orleans.
House Democrats said Sunday they would explore allegations Mr. Trump has sought to limit documentation of his meetings with Mr. Putin. That came after
the Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported Saturday that there are no classified or other detailed records of Mr. Trump's meetings with Mr. Putin. In addition, the New York Times reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a counterintelligence probe into Mr. Trump in 2017, concerned that the president's abrupt firing of James Comey as FBI director indicated he was working on behalf of Russian interests.
In an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr. Trump didn't directly answer whether he has worked for Russia, saying, "It's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."
A reporter asked the same question Monday, and Mr. Trump said directly that he never worked for Russia. He added: "not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question. It's a whole big fat hoax."
The Comey firing, in May 2017, led shortly after to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller , whose long-running probe into whether members of the Trump campaign helped Russia interfere with the 2016 election--and whether Mr. Trump has obstructed justice--has put several close Trump associates in legal jeopardy.
Mr. Trump on Monday also again blasted Mr. Comey, who told lawmakers a month after he was fired that Mr. Trump had been pressuring him in a bid to secure his loyalty. The president responded: "So what happened with the FBI, I have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey because he was a bad cop, and he was a dirty cop, and he lied. He really lied."
Mr. Comey declined to comment.
Mr. Trump on Saturday said the report that he took extraordinary steps to keep his discussions with Mr. Putin secret was ridiculous.
"I had a conversation like every president does," Mr. Trump told Fox News. "You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. I'm not keeping anything under wraps, I couldn't care less."
Who's Who in the Mueller Probe
Seven people have pleaded guilty in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election:
* Paul Manafort: The former Trump campaign manager was convicted of tax and bank fraud in part related to his political consulting work in Ukraine. He then pleaded guilty to a related charge, and to conspiring to influence the testimony of a potential witness.
* Richard Gates: The former Trump campaign aide and Manafort associate pleaded guilty to charges related to his work with Mr. Manafort.
* Michael Cohen: The former Trump lawyer pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Donald Trump's involvement during the campaign in efforts to build a tower in Moscow. Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to charges separate from the Mueller probe, including campaign-finance violations related to payments to two women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump.
* Michael Flynn: The former White House national security adviser pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about contacts with the Russian ambassador ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration.
* George Papadopoulos: The former Trump campaign adviser pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about contacts with a Russia-linked professor.
* Alex van der Zwaan: The Dutch lawyer pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his contact with Mr. Gates related to work for the Ukrainian government.
* Richard Pinedo: Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in connection with the alleged Russian plot to interfere in the U.S. election.

In that same interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump was asked if he would release details of his conversation with Mr. Putin during a summit meeting in Helsinki last year, in which he took bipartisan criticism for questioning the U.S. intelligence conclusion that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election. "I would. I don't care," Mr. Trump said.
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said Monday that no decision has been made on subpoenaing the interpreter at the July meeting in Helsinki, but he planned to discuss the matter with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.).
"We are not going to do this cavalierly, we are going to put our heads together and get at the truth, and we are going to work together," Mr. Engel said on CNN. "What we are not going to do is sit back and do nothing. We are going to try and get to the bottom of this."
Interpreter groups warned against subpoenaing Mr. Trump's translator when the possibility was first raised after the July meeting, stating that such a move would violate the industry's code of ethics. At the time, Democrats were calling for Marina Gross, the longtime State Department employee reported to have translated the meeting, to testify as a matter of national security.
In his comments Monday, Mr. Trump didn't agree to release any transcripts or notes when asked by reporters.
"I just don't know anything about it," Mr. Trump said. "I read it this morning. It's a lot of fake news."
In a break with precedent, Mr. Trump's White House doesn't keep records of every meeting between the president and foreign leaders, a former national-security official said, adding that was an effort to let the president build relationships with foreign counterparts.
Democrats on Sunday said that the news reports underscore the importance of the Mueller probe.
"It suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion," Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said on "Fox News Sunday."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Two Democratic lawmakers Monday unveiled proposals to formally censure Rep. Steve King over the Iowa Republican's comments on white nationalism that have drawn bipartisan criticism. A third, and a member of Democratic leadership, is considering a resolution of disapproval.
Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. , said King has "become too comfortable with proudly insulting, disrespecting and denigrating people of color. "
"As with any animal that is rabid, Steve King should be set aside and isolated,” Rush said in a statement Monday.
If passed, the resolution would require that King go to the well of the House and listen as a statement of disapproval is read.
King may also faced punishment from his own party. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday that King would not get any committee assignments in the wake of his recent comments about white nationalism.
McCarthy met with King Monday before the Republican Steering Committee denied King committee seats.
“Leader McCarthy’s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth," King said in a statement Monday night.

Meanwhile, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, introduced a more narrow resolution that would also censure King but based solely on the recent comments he had made in The New York Times.
"The dangerous ideology of white supremacy has no place in America — let alone Congress," Ryan said. " We need to send a strong message to our colleagues and the American people that this type of behavior will not be tolerated. "
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King said in an interview with The New Times last week. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
King later sought to tamp down the controversy, saying: "I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define. ”
Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, is considering a resolution that would express disapproval but not go as far as a full censure, according to spokesman Patrick Devlin.
King’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Many of King's colleagues, including Republicans, rebuked him over his comments.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a scathing statement Monday: "Rep. King’s statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work. "
Over the weekend, both Iowa Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, who have campaigned with King in the past, condemned his comments.
After big wins in the November midterm elections, Democrats control the House 235 to 199.
King was abandoned by the House Republican campaign arm going into the 2018 election over alleged ties to white nationalist groups. He narrowly won his election in his deep red district.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's vanquished 2016 Democratic opponent appears to be relishing his recent difficulties with news reports about his relationship with Russia.
"Like I said: A puppet," Hillary Clinton tweeted Monday, referencing a famous exchange between her and Trump during their third and final presidential debate.
On Oct. 19, 2016, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not respect the former secretary of state.
"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States," Clinton replied.
"No puppet," Trump said, talking over her. "You're the puppet. No, you're the puppet. "
Flashback: Trump, Clinton disagree over who's Putin's 'puppet'
"It's pretty clear you won't admit the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race," Clinton continued.
More: Senate reports find millions of social media posts by Russians aimed at helping Trump, GOP
Clinton's tweet reiterating her claim that Trump is a Russian puppet comes after news reports over the weekend that added fuel to the debate over Trump's Russia ties.
The New York Times reported Friday that the FBI investigated whether Trump was working on Putin's behalf after he fired director James Comey. And on Sunday, The Washington Post reported that Trump went to "extraordinary lengths" to conceal details from his conversations with Putin.
"I never worked for Russia," Trump told reporters Monday. He said the very question was a "disgrace" and repeated his belief that the investigation into his potential ties Russian election meddling was "a whole big fat hoax. "

Creation of new hurricane scale worries some scientists

Texto completo: There is consensus that something needs to change about the way forecasters categorize hurricanes. Category 2 storms are inflicting Category 5 damage. If you're only looking at that one number, you might not think you need to evacuate your coastal home, for example, like the 1,300 people who were rescued in New Bern, N.C., when Hurricane Florence made landfall last year.
"A lot of people did stay because the storm went down from a Category 4 to a Category 2, and they think of that number as being the end-all," Amber Parker, public information officer for Craven County, N.C., said at the time.
Since Florence, and Hurricane Harvey before that, and even Hurricane Sandy before that, which technically wasn't even a hurricane when it made landfall in New Jersey in 2012, the meteorological community has been considering whether the Saffir-Simpson scale, which quantifies only wind speed, is good enough to convey a storm's threat.
On Thursday, the private company AccuWeather announced it was launching its own hurricane scale this year, 1 to 5, just like Saffir-Simpson. Joel Myers, AccuWeather's founder and chief executive, said the RealImpact Scale for Hurricanes, or RI, takes into account wind, flooding rain, storm surge and economic damage. He said he heard the outcry for a better categorization system and that no one else stepped up.
"The current scale does not reflect the real impact of hurricanes," Myers said. AccuWeather's RI is a forecast that tells people what's going to happen over land, he said. "It's just a larger scale [than Saffir- Simpson] that is more comprehensive."
Myers wouldn't share with The Washington Post how the algorithm works ("We're not going to reveal that, but there is a system"), but he did say AccuWeather tested it on storms dating to 2000 and that it performed well, in the company's opinion. According to a news release, Hurricane Florence would have been an RI4 at landfall vs. a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Hurricane Harvey would have been an RI5, and so would Sandy.
Meanwhile, as AccuWeather was developing its algorithm, a small group of scientists and communicators were meeting almost weekly to discuss how to improve the Saffir-Simpson scale. Hurricane Florence tipped the scales for them, too.
"My family has property close to New Bern, so I was paying attention" to Hurricane Florence, said Ricky Rood, a professor of meteorology at the University of Michigan. After that storm, he contacted a few other scientists to see if they were interested in collaborating to change the categorization system.
Ultimately, Rood said, "we decided it was premature." Several members of the group interviewed people about their interpretation and use of the Saffir-Simpson scale and the warnings, and "they felt like we needed a whole lot more information on how emergency managers used the current information . . . before we started to propose new scales."
"We also felt strongly that we needed to coordinate with the Hurricane Center to be effective," Rood added.
James Franklin worked at the National Hurricane Center for nearly two decades before he retired in 2017. He knows the shortcomings with the Saffir-Simpson scale, which, other than wind, "doesn't do anything particularly well," he said.
"Rather than rework the scale, it seems to me that we really want to focus on each hazard separately," Franklin said. "The Hurricane Center has tried - maybe not with a great deal of success - but has tried to de- emphasize the scale and emphasize the hazards instead. We understand the limits of this one scale. And now you're going to have another one," he said of AccuWeather's RealImpact announcement.
The history of the Saffir- Simpson scale is punctuated with revisions. When it was developed by engineer Herbert Saffir and meteorologist Bob Simpson in 1971, it wrapped in all of the impacts: wind, surge and flooding. In 2009, after seeing the scale perform less than adequately in conveying particular threats, specialists at the hurricane center decided to reduce the scale to only wind. Since then, they have added storm surge warnings to their portfolio and tweaked the wind speed categories. Generally, though, it appears the NHC would also like the scale to disappear.
"If I could wave a wand and make it go away, I would," Bill Read, then the NHC director, said in 2009.
Myers said that's kind of the point. No one is filling this need, so he and his business are stepping in, whether the rest of the community likes it or not. And he's no stranger to criticism, whether it be for 45-day forecasts, 90-day forecasts or issuing nongovernment tornado warnings to clients.
"We're going to continue to innovate," Myers said, "and as all innovators, we're going to continue to be criticized."
But there could be bigger issues than industry acceptance when two scales are being used to categorize a potential disaster: confusion. Anxiety. Panic. Even AccuWeather's announcement listed several examples of where the RealImpact category would be significantly different than Saffir-Simpson. In practice, having the NHC say a storm is a Category 2 while AccuWeather predicts it will be a RealImpact 5 might not go well.
"By itself, this scale has merits," said Gina Eosco, a weather communications specialist with Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs. "The concern is that we're asking people to attend to the information more carefully by asking them to understand the underlying mechanism of both [scales], and that can be difficult in a high-pressure situation."
Rood made it clear he didn't want to say the public is ill- informed, "but" - he took a long pause - "there are many levels of being informed," he said. "Adding more complexity is likely to create more confusion. That was one of the reasons we felt we should not start creating new scales."
Myers totally rejects the premise that his new scale will be a problem.
"The Weather Channel for years has been naming storms, and in my opinion, that's much more misleading," Myers said. And, he noted, there's confusion every day in the media, "between Fox News and MSNBC and the New York Times and The Washington Post," so he finds the accusations weak.
"We're going to save tens of thousands of lives," Myers said, "and we're proud of it."

RBC fought for a prominent sign, but was it worth the effort?

Texto completo: Michael Armstrong, chief executive of RBC Wealth Management-U.S., recently wrote the Minneapolis City Council's zoning and planning committee that the "ability to brand our new building with a rooftop wall sign is critical to our company's future growth and success."
At face value, that's one of the saddest statements from a business executive to ever appear in the Star Tribune.
The success of a big firm hinges on a little sign? Like, the business goes sideways without it?
He didn't mean it, of course. RBC is a Top 20 wealth-management firm in the United States and part of the Royal Bank of Canada, neck and neck with Toronto-Dominion Bank for title of biggest bank north of the border.
Friends work there, including our family's financial adviser, and I can confidently say that RBC has been plenty successful already and doesn't need a sign at its new place. But it sure wanted one, atop a proposed new headquarters that would be built by United Properties in Minneapolis.
So Armstrong, or his PR advisers, played it about right. If it's up to politicians -- and the vote went RBC's way last week at a pivotal committee meeting -- it never pays to be the side that quietly understates its argument.
Here's the most interesting thing about it: It's a fight over something that isn't worth that much. For the residents of Minneapolis, changing a neighborhood street traffic signal could have a bigger impact on the quality of life. For RBC it was even worth less. Maybe that speaks to the state of land-use regulations in 2019.
The plan is for RBC to be the lead tenant in the Gateway project, at Hennepin and Washington avenues in Minneapolis, with more than half a million square feet of office space, condos and a Four Seasons Hotel. RBC's sign would appear nearly 500 feet above street level.
In Minneapolis, that's not done. As city staff noted in its background memo, the Minneapolis skyline does not have the visual clutter of signs at the top of its tallest buildings on purpose.
Lots of things that property owners might want don't meet the letter of the zoning rules, and many will assume that's by design. Their ideas might make sense for the property and even be good for a city, but the property owner will still need to apply to get an exception to the rules. This gives city officials the chance to horse trade, maybe for a few nice-to-have features.
All involved knew that United Properties needed to win an
exception to get RBC its sign.
In calling around the real estate industry last week, it was difficult to put a ballpark price on the value of RBC's rooftop sign, as there doesn't seem to be much of an active market for these things.
No one thought RBC would be paying so much as a penny per foot extra for a tower sign. If it is willing to sign a long-term lease for a few hundred thousand square feet of office space, that's motivation enough for an owner to get RBC what it wants.
That suggests that sign rights are a close cousin of building names, also not usually something paid for separately in lease agreements for big tenants or even baked into a premium base rental rate on the space.
These things are added to the list to be worked out with the landlord, along with how much the landlord contributes to build out the space, parking, lease renewal rights and everything else. The tenants likely will have to pay the hard costs for any sign that gets erected.
Lots of buildings in downtown Minneapolis are named for tenants, including the home of the Star Tribune. The adjacent Capella Tower was named for a for-profit education company that last year was acquired by Strayer Education, only because it grew to pay rent on a very big chunk of office space.
There's a temptation to think of the far more visible rooftop signs as similar to the brands all over sports stadiums, like the soon-to-be finished Allianz Field soccer stadium in St. Paul or U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.
These are undeniably valuable but not as big billboards. If TV, radio and other media stopped caring about NFL football, the value to U.S. Bancorp for its brand on the stadium would sink like a stone.
That's why U.S. Bank doesn't get nearly as much value from having its name on office buildings. Just in downtown Minneapolis there is U.S. Bancorp Center on Nicollet, headquarters for the big banking company, and U.S. Bank Plaza. Both have a Caribou Coffee shop, making "let's meet at the Caribou in the U.S. Bank building" one of the most confusing suggestions you can e-mail a friend.
With no reason for these buildings to ever be on the TV news or ESPN, nobody involved in lease negotiations could have been arguing about a big fee for the naming rights. It's not like anybody can plan on something like a raccoon attracting a global internet and TV audience.
That's what happened last June at the UBS Plaza in St. Paul, as a raccoon making its way to the roof of the building captivated that portion of the public without enough meaningful work to do that day.
Accounts of the raccoon's long climb in the New York Times, Washington Post, CNBC, and the Guardian in the U.K. all show up near the top of internet searches on UBS Tower or UBS Plaza in St. Paul. And the UBS logo was far easier to spot in some of the video and photos than the varmint.
There is no chance the Swiss-based UBS Group and its small office in St. Paul pays much if anything for the right to have its logo at the top, other than maybe having to maintain its sign.
For a brief moment last summer, UBS had itself a branding bargain.

Texto completo: The Limited No. 4 train steamed out of Duluth about 2 p.m. that Saturday, Sept. 1, 1894 -- meaning porter John Wesley Blair should have made it home in time for dinner in St. Paul with his wife, Emma, and their two preteen sons.
First, he made the 125 passengers comfortable as the locomotive pulled seven cars south toward Hinckley. Unbeknown to Blair and the others, two forest fires were merging into a deadly firestorm down the tracks.
"An affable, round-faced young man with a pencil-thin mustache, Blair was probably the only African-American on the train," according to Daniel Brown's 2006 book, "Under a Flaming Sky."
Born in 1853 in Arkansas, possibly into slavery, Blair spent the next seven hours calmly handing out wet towels so passengers and fleeing survivors could cover their faces as the train cars became engulfed in flames. His hands swollen and blistered, Blair sprayed down passengers with fire extinguishers as they climbed out of the burning train at Skunk Lake -- a marshy, mucky swamp 18 inches deep where 300 people survived a few miles north of Hinckley.
"Splashing water onto children too frightened to move," Brown details how Blair led those still alive to the muddy water to bathe their eyes and burns before dragging them back near the burning coal car for warmth when the fire finally gave way to a chilly night.
At least 418 people died 125 years ago during the Hinckley fire, which scorched more than 300,000 acres and consumed the nearby lumber communities of Sandstone, Mission Creek, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama. The death toll, far greater than the Chicago fire 23 years earlier, would have been even worse without Blair's calm heroics.
"The train's porter, John Blair, was the one who first mentioned the water's nearness and pointed out that we should get down in" Skunk Lake, one passenger said in an 1894 account translated from Swedish.
Another passenger, quoted in an 1895 publication, said Blair "stood at his post in the burning car passing water as coolly and collectedly as if he were on a summer excursion. He stood there … until the last passenger was safe."
Asked later how he stayed calm while all hell and panic erupted around him, Blair said: "I just resolved I would not lose my head, and if I had to die, I would do it without making a fool of myself …
"All I can say is that on that awful night I did what I thought to be my duty."
While the New York Times failed to mention the portly porter's actions in more than a dozen stories, the black community in St. Paul raised money and honored him a few weeks later with a gold badge. The St. Paul and Duluth Railway Co. gave him a gold watch, engraved with the words: "For gallant and faithful discharge of duty."
At that ceremony, a judge named C.D. O'Brien, who was riding the No. 4 Limited, walked across the stage to shake Blair's hand after saying:
"I am proud to be alive to take him by the hand and thank him for his humanity …
"We stood in flame that is indescribable. John Blair might have sought his own safety but he was too much a man for that. He stood there, a willing sacrifice, ready to lay down his life for those in his charge, following the dictates of a heart as pure and noble as any that ever beat in a human breast, never forgetting those who are helpless and who needed his assistance."
Brown earned literary praise for his 2013 book "The Boys in the Boat" about the U.S. rowing team at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi-led Germany. His Hinckley fire book came out seven years earlier and had a personal connection for the author -- his grandfather was among the Hinckley survivors.
Blair emerges as one of the characters who stick with you after reading Brown's book. As he describes Blair distributing wet towels as flames consume the train, Brown writes:
"It must have been a sudden and unexpected role reversal for Blair, a man who had had to be deferential to his mostly white passengers throughout his lifetime, and who now found himself more or less in command of the situation. And it must have been no less of a reversal for the passengers to find themselves looking now to this quiet, unassuming porter with his sweet, boyish face for strength and reassurance in the midst of the crisis of their lives."
Brown points out Blair's heroics came the same day as five African-Americans in Missouri -- accused of arson but never tried -- were bound and shot in the back of a wagon.
John Wesley Blair died at 68 in 1922 and is buried at St. Paul's Oakland Cemetery -- just off Case Avenue, where he lived in 1894 and where that Saturday night dinner awaited him.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Loewy streamlined daily life

Texto completo: In the middle of the Depression, Sears and Roebuck hired Raymond Loewy to completely redesign its Coldspot refrigerator. Residential refrigeration was in its infancy and there were several offerings on the market. The Sears model had been around for several years already, but the addition of Loewy's design caused sales to soar.
The ease of refrigeration allowed for development, even in the desert. Loewy noted, "What I had instinctively believed was being proved by hard sales figures. You take two products with the same function, the same quality and the same price: the better-looking one will outsell the other." What seems like an obvious observation now, was revolutionary in the 1930s. The spectacular success of his design launched Loewy into a career that would define a whole new category of endeavor: industrial design.
Loewy would go on to imagine better-looking products in every aspect of American life in an unlikely career of his own invention. New York Times reporter Susan Heller wrote at the time of his death, "One can hardly open a beer or a soft drink, fix breakfast, board a plane, buy gas, mail a letter or shop for an appliance without encountering a Loewy creation." Unabashedly, Loewy himself said, "I can claim to have made the daily life of the 20th Century more beautiful."
Indeed, Loewy designed automobiles, Coke vending machines and delivery trucks, railroad engines and cars, gas station logos, cigarette packaging, toasters, furniture, refrigerators, a pencil sharpener, Air Force One's iconic coloring and interiors for NASA's Skylab.
By the outbreak of World War II, Loewy was a design consultant to more than 100 companies and had a staff of 300 in offices in New York, London, Chicago, Sao Paulo and South Bend, Indiana. And in 1946, he would build a home in Palm Springs.
That Loewy would build himself a house in the desert was testament to how swanky the town was in the 1940s. In collaboration with Swiss émigré Albert Frey, Loewy created a bachelor pad unlike any other. Situated next door to department store magnate Edgar Kaufmann's Neutra-designed house, Loewy's seemingly modest abode was actually quite dramatic.
The living room was made small by the intrusion of the swimming pool, a portion of which could be enclosed by a great sliding glass door. William Powell, the impossibly elegant Thin Man himself, famously fell in with his cocktail in hand, managing not to spill, prompting Loewy to graciously jump in himself and call for another round of drinks.
The pool was literally central to the house, with protruding boulders and a framed the desert beyond. A large, pink, glass jug filled with water was placed just so at the water's edge to punctuate the view, in a tableau designed like a painting.
Loewy's musings on proper design and aesthetics read like philosophy and his aphorisms ring true today. He lived by his own maxims and his book published in 1951. "Never Leave Well Enough Alone" recounts his adventures in streamlining almost every aspect of American life.
His philosophy was profound and interestingly, Loewy did not appreciate its degradation by trivialization of its principles. He criticized the appropriation of streamlining, "There is a frantic race to merchandize tinsel and trash under the guise of 'modernism.'"
That modernism has become synonymous with Palm Springs today might amuse Loewy. One of his ardent admirers, Jacques Caussin, transplanted to the desert after operating a gallery in New York's SOHO district and founding the Miami Modernism Show created an event in Palm Springs, dedicated to modern design as first promulgated by Loewy.
Caussin's modern furniture show on a weekend in February in 2006 exploded – not unlike the sales of Loewy's Coldspot refrigerator decades earlier – into the Palm Springs Modernism Week of today. Caussin is expert in the amazing life of Raymond Loewy and will recount its highlights on January 23rd at 6 p.m.

Texto completo: Still scared by the last few months’ scary stories? Relax. My last three columns explained why 2018’s stock market disappointment supports a V-shaped rebound and a happy, profit-rich 2019. Yet many worry this time is different. Do you?
If so, consider this: Without global recession, a long bear market is super unlikely. Two negative years in a row have never happened without a worldwide recession or global war. To foresee that risk, consider the Conference Board’s fantastic Leading Economic Indexes (LEIs) and global purchasing managers’ indexes (PMIs). They currently presage global expansion.
LEI combines 10 forward-looking economic indicators into one super-accurate predictor of future growth (or recession). Components include items like factory orders, credit availability, and, most telling, the yield curve spread (see my July 22 column on yield curve).
No U. S. recession has started while U. S. LEI was high and rising. It always fell for months beforehand. If recession were nigh, LEI would warn us. Now it screams growth. It’s high and rising – up 18 of the past 20 months.

More Money: Jeff Bezos and those texts: How to keep what you text private
Not just here! The Conference Board runs LEIs for 11 other countries, the eurozone and the world. Its eurozone LEI remains in a long uptrend. Ditto for China, India, Korea and the world. Britain’s is down, but its weakness comes from sentiment-based components, bashed by Brexit fears. Britain’s fundamental components point positively.
Combining LEIs with monthly PMI surveys adds belts to your forecasting suspenders. PMIs estimate what percentage of a country’s businesses grew. If PMI tops 50, over half grew, implying monthly economic growth. If under 50, then contraction.
Don’t fixate on any one country – even America. Instead, scope out the biggest chunks of global GDP. Like America, 24. 4 percent of the world. Or the 28-country eurozone, 15. 9 percent. Add China (16. 1 percent), Japan (5. 9 percent), Britain and India (3. 2 percent each) – and you’ll have enough.
December PMIs just came in – showing growth in nearly all major nations. U. S. manufacturing PMI was 54. 1. Nonmanufacturing – the vast majority of GDP – hit 57. 6. Britain’s manufacturing (54. 2), service (51. 2) and construction (52. 8) PMIs also showed growth. Every major European country reached or exceeded 50 except France (where “yellow vest” protests disrupted business – a one-off). Otherwise, growth!
China’s manufacturing PMI is below 50, but barely.
The global economy doesn’t need – and seldom has – all countries growing at similarly strong rates. It’s about areas of strength outweighing weak spots. Today, the strength far outweighs weakness. Yet sentiment presumes the reverse, setting up big positive surprise potential as recession doesn’t happen. Of course, stocks don’t typically move for long in a perfectly straight line.
But fathom global growth, and believe in the V!

Bigoted King out of step with American ideals

Texto completo: As a percentage of its population, Iowa sent more troops to fight in the Civil War than any other state. Iowans fought on the side of the Union against the Confederate South. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States and the commander in chief of Union forces, was the first Republican president.
So it seems odd (to me, at least) that a Republican congressman from Iowa would display a Confederate flag on his desk. But that's what Rep. Steve King did as recently as 2016. (He removed it only after it was revealed that a cop killer had waved a Confederate flag at an Iowa high school football game.)
I'm not one of those people who think everyone who displays a Confederate flag is necessarily a racist or a bigot. But I usually reserve the benefit of the doubt for actual Southerners who are nodding to tradition or nostalgia.
If there's one thing King has not earned it's the benefit of the doubt. Even accounting for an IQ that seems to be in conflict with the idea that white people are superior, the man understands what he's up to.
In an interview with the New York Times published Thursday, King asked: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
The obvious answer is because he needed an education — and still does.
At the 2016 Republican National Convention, King responded to the suggestion that the GOP needs to appeal to Americans other than old white people: "I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you're talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"
Contrary to the prattle of white nationalists and supremacists (and, interestingly, various left-wing theorists and black nationalists such as Louis Farrakhan), Western civilization is not synonymous with whiteness. Many of the people King would count as white today were not considered white by various giants of American white nationalism and white supremacy. Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, Greeks et al. weren't "whites" at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Steve Kings of that era were terrified of non-white immigrants.
In 1911, the joint congressional Immigration Commission completed a 41-volume report that included the Dictionary of Races or Peoples, a pseudoscientific grab bag containing "a motley compendium of ethnic stereotypes, skin complexion, head shape, and other hardy perennials of the race science literature," according to Princeton historian Thomas Leonard in his vital book "Illiberal Reformers."
Bohemians had heavy brains. Southern Italians were too "excitable" and "impulsive" to adapt to organized society. Slavs were overly prone to "periods of besotted drunkenness" and "unexpected cruelty." Germans from the Tyrol region were too broad-headed to be of desirable stock.
In fairness, "white" wasn't a term of art back then, so white supremacists were actually Aryan or Nordic or English (not Irish!) supremacists. But you get the point.
Then there's the notion that non-whites haven't made worthy contributions to civilization. Leave aside that by not counting Italians (sorry, Galileo and Da Vinci!), East Europeans (sucks for you, Copernicus!) or Jews (Einstein? Good riddance) as white, you're bequeathing many of the glories of civilization to non-whites. But even with the most expansive definition of "white" possible, how do we account for the fact that Chinese, Ottoman and Arab societies were leaps and bounds ahead of Europe for centuries? The Chinese invented the compass, paper, movable type, mechanical clocks, iron smelting and countless other innovations when "white" Europe was a barbaric backwater. And let's not forget that Christianity is a cultural import from that great melting pot that was the Middle East.
One is reminded of Benjamin Disraeli's famous retort to an Irish Catholic parliamentarian's anti-Semitic attack on his heritage: "Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon."
But this is the wrong way to respond to King's bigotry. Among the best ideas and ideals of Western, Christian and, most importantly, American civilization is that we are supposed to judge people on their individual merits, not keep score based on their ancestry.
This vision was central to the creation of the Republican Party, which is why it's so dismaying that Rep. King calls himself one.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Saturday unleashed an extended assault on the FBI and the special counsel's investigation, knitting together a comprehensive alternative story in which he had been framed by disgraced "losers" at the bureau's highest levels.
In a two-hour span starting at 7 a.m., the president made a series of false claims on Twitter about his adversaries and the events surrounding the inquiry.
He was responding to a report in The New York Times that, after he fired James Comey as FBI director in 2017, the bureau began investigating whether the president had acted on behalf of Russia.
In his tweets, the president accused Hillary Clinton, without evidence, of breaking the law by lying to the FBI. He claimed that Mr. Comey was corrupt and best friends with the special counsel, Robert Mueller.
He said Mr. Mueller was employing a team of Democrats - another misleading assertion - bent on taking him down.
Individually, the president's claims were familiar. But as the special counsel's inquiry edges ever closer to him, Democrats vow a blizzard of investigations of their own and the government shutdown reaches record lengths, Mr. Trump compiled all the threads of the conspiracy theory he has pushed for many months in an effort to discredit the investigation.
Mr. Trump accused the FBI of opening "for no reason" and "with no proof" an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia, painting his own actions toward Russia as actually "FAR tougher" than those of his predecessors.
The Times article, published Friday evening, reported that law enforcement officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump's behavior surrounding his firing of Mr. Comey that they took the explosive step of opening a counterintelligence investigation against him.
In another development, The Washington Post reported Saturday that Mr. Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including on at least one occasion taking possession of the notes of his own interpreter and instructing the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials, current and former U.S. officials said.
Mr. Trump did so after a meeting with Mr. Putin in 2017 in Hamburg that was also attended by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. U.S. officials learned of Mr. Trump's actions when a White House adviser and a senior State Department official sought information from the interpreter beyond a readout shared by Mr. Tillerson.
The constraints that Mr. Trump imposed are part of a broader pattern by the president of shielding his communications with Mr. Putin from public scrutiny and preventing even high-ranking officials in his own administration from fully knowing what he has told one of the United States' main adversaries.
As a result, U.S. officials said there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Mr. Trump's face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years. Such a gap would be unusual in any presidency, let alone one that Russia sought to install through what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as an unprecedented campaign of election interference.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including on at least one occasion taking possession of the notes of his own interpreter and instructing the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials, current and former U.S. officials said.
Trump did so after a meeting with Putin in 2017 in Hamburg that was also attended by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
U.S. officials learned of Trump's actions when a White House adviser and a senior State Department official sought information from the interpreter beyond a readout shared by Tillerson.
The constraints that Trump imposed are part of a broader pattern by the president of shielding his communications with Putin from public scrutiny and preventing even high-ranking officials in his own administration from fully knowing what he has told one of the United States' main adversaries.
As a result, U.S. officials said there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Trump's face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years.
Such a gap would be unusual in any presidency, let alone one that Russia sought to install through what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a campaign of election interference.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is thought to be in the final stages of an investigation that has focused largely on whether Trump or his associates conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Trump's secrecy surrounding Putin "is not only unusual by historical standards, it is outrageous," said Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state now at the Brookings Institution, who participated in more than a dozen meetings between President Bill Clinton and then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s. "It handicaps the U.S. government -- the experts and advisers and Cabinet officers who are there to serve (the president) -- and it certainly gives Putin much more scope to manipulate Trump."
A White House spokesman disputed that characterization and said that the Trump administration has sought to "improve the relationship with Russia" after the Obama administration's "flawed 'reset' policy."
Trump allies said the president thinks the presence of subordinates impairs his ability to establish a rapport with Putin, and that his desire for secrecy may also be driven by embarrassing leaks that occurred early in his presidency.
Still, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview that his panel will form an investigative subcommittee whose targets will include seeking State Department records of Trump's encounters with Putin, including a closed-door meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki last summer.
"It's been several months since Helsinki, and we still don't know what went on in that meeting," Engel said. "It's appalling."
The concerns have been compounded by actions Trump has taken that are seen as favorable to the Kremlin.
He has dismissed Russia's election interference as a "hoax," suggested that Russia was entitled to annex Crimea, repeatedly attacked NATO allies, resisted efforts to impose sanctions on Moscow, and begun to pull U.S. forces out of Syria -- a move that critics see as effectively ceding ground to Russia.
At the same time, Trump's decision to fire Comey and other attempts to contain the ongoing Russia investigation led the bureau in May 2017 to launch a counterintelligence investigation into whether he was seeking to help Russia and if so, why, a step first reported by the New York Times.

Why I Didn't Answer Your Email

Texto completo: I'm 47 years old. Two days ago, you sent me an email, which I did not answer. I didn't answer it, in part, because I am 47 years old.
I appreciated your email. You are a person, who has written an email, and I am a person, who should reply to that email. However, your email arrived on Wednesday afternoon, and just as I opened it, my 16-year-old son came in. He wanted to describe to me an app he is in the process of developing. Then he showed me a funny article someone had sent him, and I showed him a funny article someone had sent me, and then I explained that I had work to do, that I needed, in fact, to respond to your email, and also to write 3,000 words in the next 36 hours. "I've only written 300," I said.
"Then you just have to do that again," he said, "10 times."
This seemed to me very encouraging. I reapplied myself to my computer, where your email was open on the screen, and he left, and then he returned.
"Actually," he said happily, "you only have to do it again nine times."
I was so inspired by this that I abandoned your email, and I applied myself to my work. I would have replied to your email after a few hundred more words, I am certain, except that my 11-year-old daughter came in, clutching some pieces of paper that I had earlier asked her to remove from the kitchen counter because I had accidentally started to butter one of them.
"That's O.K.," she'd said. "They're supposed to look old."
That explained the tea stains. Now, the papers having dried, she proposed to read them to me. "Dear Becky," she began, "I take my pen in hand to tell you that I am well, but so afeard and worried, for we are going to the battle tomorrow."
She looked up. "It's a letter from Jeremiah, a solder in the Civil War," she explained, unnecessarily. Only a few hours earlier, I had typed Civil War letters for her brother, who is in the same class, and just two years ago, I had listened to Civil War letters read by her older sister, and a little earlier still, just a few blinks of the eye, to historic missives drafted by the now-16-year-old. Those letters had the exact same match-burned edges and had been stained with the exact same tea.
My 11-year-old read on, while I wondered where she'd found the matches. I am afraid the story of Jeremiah did not go well, and he ended his third letter, the one written after he was wounded in the stomach, by imploring Becky to hear his voice in the wind in the trees. Jeremiah's Civil War experience stood in stark contrast to that of Johnny, as penned by my youngest son. Johnny was a captain who had trained all his men perfectly and had plenty to eat and drink and was very excited about the battle, which he then enjoyed, thank you very much, dear Grandpa, with much love from Johnny.
Was there, I inquired, perchance another letter, detailing Jeremiah's miraculous recovery?
"No," my daughter said. "He got shot in the stomach, and that always kills you, because you can't remove a stomach." During this conversation, I did not answer your email.
I think that I would have answered your email if you had sent it earlier, by which I mean several years earlier, when these children were smaller and their conversation more repetitive. I would have been hidden in my office, a younger, more driven me, instead of sitting, as I often do now, in the middle of the house, an invitation to interruption. I would have put the contrast between Jeremiah and Johnny out of my mind and focused on the screen. Instead, after a lengthy discourse on dismembering delivered in the still-piping voice of my delicate fairy of a child, I found that I needed to go outside and walk aimlessly down the driveway, and then, filled with purpose, to the mailbox.
I also had to make dinner.
I almost answered your email later, after bedtime, which is when I have often answered emails. My laptop was perched on my bedside table. My husband was perched on his side of the bed, and he leaned back and asked me if I'd given any thought to whether the chickens would need to be kept away from the apple trees after he sprayed them with something to keep the bugs away.
We moved on to the children's math grades, then to the way they just take their socks off and leave them, inside out, no matter where they are. I looked at the clock and saw that it was not as early as I'd thought, not for a lot of things, and so we turned off the light, and I did not answer your email.
Your email sat among emails from bosses and editors and orthodontists all through the next workday. My children were at school, and I had not yet managed to write 300 words nine more times. I thought about answering your email in the afternoon, while my older daughter and I waited outside the school for her sister to finish a piano lesson. My daughter probably would not have minded. She is almost 13, and sometimes, when she sits in the house texting while I try to talk to her, I squirt her with the bottle I keep on the counter to spray the cats when they start scratching the back of the sofa. I could have answered your email then. I admit it. We could have sat there, in peaceful silence, each staring at our phone. I had time to answer your email, and I did not.
I snuggled my youngest son at bedtime that night, because he asked. I snuggled him even though your email was calling, and some part of me wanted to pull away from the tedium of bedtime and reply. Replying would have felt fresh and new, while bedtime felt old and stale, although it has grown far less demanding of late, with no more reading out loud and no more splashing baths, many of which I spent answering emails, which was fine, because there were so many bedtimes and so many baths, so very, very many of them, until suddenly there weren't, although there were still a lot of emails.
I would like to say I snuggled my son and did not give your email one single thought, but that would not be true, and it would also be rude, even though it is a state of mind to which many of us aspire. Instead, I hovered somewhere between mindful presence in the bedtime moment and awareness of your email and many others. I spend a lot of time in that gap, sometimes drafting mental responses to emails, which I am later surprised and dismayed to find I have not actually sent.
It is possible that I will answer your email later, in a few hours, or in a few years, maybe when I am 57, and I will be so happy to have your email. We will trade words, and those words will again seem so real to me, a whole world in my laptop, where I live, sometimes, because there is so much that is seductive in there, where time moves fast and yet never moves at all. I will take my laptop outside and I will sit among the trees, listening for the voices of children who are no longer home, and I will answer your email.
It is also possible that I will not -- that I, in fact, will never answer your email. If that is the case, if the people and the places and the things around me still press upon me with more urgency than your email and so many others, I hope that you will forgive me. I have already forgiven myself.

Pegan diet could be next big trend

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual."
Organic produce is recommended as part of a pegan diet.

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."

Texto completo: Two people were seriously injured after a head-on collision in Odenton on Wednesday.
Firefighters responded to a report of a crash in the area of the 8900 block of Piney Orchard Parkway near Patuxent Road at 3:23 p.m. Wednesday, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said in a news release.
Responders found two vehicles that had been involved in the collision, including an SUV that had come to rest against a tree.
The department said the 49-year-old female driver of the SUV was trapped inside and it took about 30 minutes to free her from the vehicle.
She was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore to be treated for serious injuries not believed to be life-threatening.
The 19-year-old male driver of the second vehicle was able to free himself from his vehicle before firefighters arrived on the scene. He was taken to the Johns Hopkins Bayview trauma center in Baltimore for serious injuries also not believed to be life-threatening.
No other people were reported injured in the crash.
Crownsville

Bowie
Middle school lockdown lifted after former student found with BB gun
A former Benjamin Tasker Middle School student was arrested outside the school Wednesday after police found a BB gun in his bag.
Prince George's County Public School's spokesman John White said at 2 p.m. a former student came to the school and security staff searched the child.
They found a BB gun in his backpack, White said, and contacted county police who took the child into custody.
Everything happened outside of the school, White said. The school was placed on a short lockdown.
In 2002 a 13-year-old boy was shot outside Benjamin Tasker Middle School. He was the youngest victim of the D.C. sniper, according to a story in the New York Times, and survived being shot in the chest.

Texto completo: Take a look at the can for Philadelphia’s Urban Village Brewing Co. Rye Bread India pale ale and you’ll find a whimsical portrait of a gentleman with a long, sweeping grain beard who is wearing a top hat. The top of the hat is actually a brown loaf of bread with a lovely open crumb, and there’s a plump hop cone where a pocket handkerchief might go.
When he gets hungry, he can just reach up and take a big old bite of that rye bread, and with those puffy, fair-weather clouds in the sky behind him, he doesn’t have to worry about any rain while he’s out and about.
He’s dapper, curious and quite clever, the sort of person you might want to invite over for dinner because you’re certain his storied adventures are ones to hear by a crackling fireplace.
While we don’t find rye much used in breads here in the U.S., it’s a commonly used cereal grain in Europe and other parts of the world. Throughout history, it was sometimes disregarded by some as a rustic peasant bread that graced the tables of the poor while the wealthy could afford a light, fluffy loaf made of refined wheat. In reality, rye bread offers an alternative that has more character than bleached white wheat could ever provide. That’s my humble opinion.
Sometimes mixed with other grains to give it a more approachable texture and oftentimes made with sourdough leavening, rye bread is part of the cultural tapestry for many people in the world.
In Germany, most breads are made with at least some percentage of rye flour. A 1998 story from The New York Times writes of German breads that there are more than 300 varieties. One you might be familiar with is pumpernickel, made entirely with rye. Also, there is a plethora of other regional breads contain varying amounts of rye and other grains, hearty and ready to slice and serve with fresh butter and cheese.
A pastrami sandwich just doesn’t taste quite right if it isn’t served on thinly sliced rye bread studded with caraway seeds, a sort of anise-flavored ingredient that can actually reduce flatulence, a common complaint when eating whole grains that are high in fiber. In fact, as I’m sitting here writing this, all I can think about is making a trip to Katz’s Delicatessen in New York City for a pastrami sandwich that brings heaven just a little closer to earth with every flavorful bite.
Denmark also has its own national rye bread, rugbrod. It’s made entirely of rye grain, but can have various seeds added. This bread is typically made with a sourdough starter, giving it a tangy aroma and flavor. It’s sturdy and chewy, making it the perfect base for the Danish traditional meal of smorrebrod, an open-faced sandwich.
Urban Village Brewing Co. embodied every ounce of rye bread’s dense, chewy character in its Rye Bread IPA, and you might not have to drive to Philadelphia to find it. Check your favorite local craft beer purveyor to see if they have it in stock.

Rye Bread IPA
Rye Bread IPA poured a thick and hazy amber-brown from the can and was topped with a tightly dense, persistent light tan head.
Its aroma greeted me with pine, mango, guava, grapefruit and an expected rye spiciness.
The flavor was an everything bagel sans garlic and onion, the rye bread I first bite into when eating a Reuben sandwich, and a loaf of Irish soda bread. The rye malt offered spicy, peppery and bold qualities with just enough aniselike piquancy to let itself be known without overwhelming in any way. There were pine, lemon and earthy notes in it that added to the pleasing overall experience of flavor in a body that started chewy before ending with a clean bitterness and scratchy dry sensation across the center of my tongue.
Rye Bread IPA is the savory salvation for those of you who are tired of all the juicy, hazy IPAs out there. It’s a unique and enjoyable respite. If ever there was a beer brewed that embodied the experience of eating a slice of hearty rye bread, this is it.

Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller probe, to leave post

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist from California, said Wednesday he wouldn't seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, focusing instead on his multimillion-dollar effort to impeach President Trump.
Mr. Steyer said during an appearance in Iowa, the home of the nation's first presidential caucuses, that he would spend at least $40 million in 2019 to promote efforts to impeach the president. He said his plan would include town-hall meetings across the nation and an "impeachment summit" in Washington, D.C., in late January, all aimed at mobilizing millions of people to press for the president's impeachment.
"I will be dedicating 100% of my time, effort and resources to one cause: working for Mr. Trump's impeachment and removal from office," Mr. Steyer said in Des Moines. "I am not running for president this time. Instead, I'm strengthening my commitment to 'Need to Impeach' in 2019 until the House starts impeachment proceedings or Mr. Trump resigns. That's how we will define success."
The Steyer-backed Need to Impeach, which was launched in October 2017, plans to focus some of its attention on supporters who live in House districts held by Democratic lawmakers who lead committees with investigative powers, including Reps. Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters of California, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Elijah Cummings of Maryland.
Mr. Steyer's plans were first reported by the New York Times.
Mr. Steyer, 61 years old, was among a small group of wealthy businessmen considering entering the 2020 Democratic primaries, and he could have spent millions of dollars of his own money in the race.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently visited Iowa and has expressed interest in joining the race. The field could also include former Starbucks CEO and Chairman Howard Schultz.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro have launched exploratory campaigns but the field is expected to grow as a number of lawmakers and governors make their intentions known.
Mr. Steyer, a hedge-fund manager and philanthropist, has devoted tens of millions of dollars to a number of causes, including climate change and efforts to engage young voters. He had previously considered a run for California governor but has focused instead on environmental issues and impeaching Mr. Trump.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the United States from Mexico, in one of his central justifications for building a border wall.
But his own government's assessments conclude that Mr. Trump has seriously overstated the threat. And counterterrorism officials and experts said there had never been a case of a known terrorist sneaking into the country through open areas of the southwest border.
Despite the administration's focus on security threats at the border, a White House strategy document sent to Congress last month outlining steps needed to monitor and intercept terrorists included no reference to the need for construction of barriers, fences or walls. Separately, an intelligence analysis concluded that cyberattacks are the top threat to the United States -- not terrorists at the border.
"There is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States," Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said on Tuesday. "It simply isn't true."
In a rare prime-time address to the nation, broadcast at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Trump was expected to describe a national security crisis brewing at the Mexican border. It was his opportunity to directly defend his demands for $5.7 billion for a border wall -- funding that congressional Democrats have refused to provide, fueling the 18-day government shutdown.

Many Latin American countries have border law enforcement gaps -- limited law enforcement capabilities and established smuggling routes -- that extremists could exploit to harm the United States, according to the State Department's latest Country Reports on Terrorism.
But, the report concluded, that has not happened.
"These vulnerabilities offer opportunities to foreign terrorist groups, but there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region," the report said.
The latest ranking of urgent national security vulnerabilities, compiled annually by American intelligence agencies, puts the terrorist threat from the southwest border low on the list and then mentions it in a discussion of how "worldwide production of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is at record levels."
Over the last several days, White House and Department of Homeland Security officials have relentlessly pushed the case that the situation at the border is both a national security crisis and a humanitarian one.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday that "nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally," and added that the "most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border."
A day later, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, called those comments "an unfortunate misstatement."
At the same time, in a memo sent to journalists late Monday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, cited "more than 3,000 'special-interest aliens' -- individuals with suspicious travel patterns" who posed a potential national security risk.
"The threat is real," she wrote in a series of tweets on Monday afternoon. "The number of terror-watchlisted encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive and details about these cases are extremely sensitive."
Former national security officials and analysts have pushed back -- especially on the notion that terrorism suspects or their sympathizers use the southwest border as a door to the United States.
"That 4,000 number was bull," said W. Ralph Basham, who served as commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009, during the Bush administration.
"The idea that you have that many terrorists flooding across the border when you have all of these dedicated agents focused on stopping that kind of activity is ridiculous," Mr. Basham said.
A senior American counterterrorism official said on Tuesday night that an annual average of three known or suspected terrorists -- all of whom were on watch lists -- had tried to enter the United States at a legal border crossing or entry point over the last several years, and had been denied.
A 22-page National Strategy to Combat Terrorism Travel, overseen by the staff of the National Security Council and under Mr. Trump's signature, cited a broad commitment to making it "more difficult for terrorists to cross U.S. borders."
Sent to Congress on Dec. 21, the day before the government shutdown began, the document urged data sharing and improved coordination with foreign partners to identify terrorists before they travel. It did not urge the construction of a border wall.
The only explicit reference to "border security" in the document, which was obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times, is a listing of executive orders that Mr. Trump has already signed. It also included strategies to "interdict" potential terrorists with plans to "maintain the equipment and technology" necessary to stop bad actors and share real-time information between law enforcement agencies.
The 2018 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ranked cyberattacks against utilities, communications systems and markets as the top threat to the United States. Published annually by American intelligence agencies, the ranking has not changed much over the past five years.
But the government shutdown has furloughed nearly half of the work force of the Department of Homeland Security's new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is advertised as the first line of defense against network attacks. Mr. Trump has also dismantled the office of the White House cybersecurity coordinator, the job that was supposed to sew together offense and defense against the daily barrage of cyberattacks.
After cyberattacks, the top threats to the United States include the rise of smaller, more deadly nuclear and biological weapons; terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda; and Russian-style influence campaigns and threats to the United States' space assets.
Counterterrorism officials have long discounted the threat of Islamic State or Qaeda terrorists entering through the southwest border. In some cases, the opposite has happened, said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University's program on extremism, citing homegrown American extremists who crossed into Mexico to avoid being detected on no-fly lists.
Officials included the case of Jason Ludke of Milwaukee, who pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State. He and a co-conspirator were headed to the border in Texas, with plans to join the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq, when they were arrested.
According to the plea agreement, Mr. Ludke had planned to work under the Islamic State's direction and control and recorded a video of himself pledging his allegiance to the terrorist group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mr. Ludke told an undercover F.B.I. agent that he had training in jujitsu and computers, which he believed would benefit the Islamic State.
Even as Mr. Trump has lobbied for the wall, he has also pressed the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately tighten security on the border.
On Dec. 27, homeland security officials asked for assistance that the Pentagon later estimated would require 3,000 additional military personnel to be sent to the border, according to memos exchanged by the two departments over the last two weeks. The force could include a combination of National Guard troops, active-duty military personnel and volunteers, but that was not made clear in the documents, officials said. It remains an issue of hot debate inside the Pentagon.
The Homeland Security Department also requested 146 mobile surveillance vehicles to be sent to four border states, along with enough personnel and material to install 150 additional miles of barbed concertina wire. The homeland security memo also again asked Defense Department officials to provide additional aviation support to monitor and control the flow of immigrants.
The Pentagon has not yet approved the request. It included guidelines for Ms. Nielsen and other homeland security officials to "take the lead" on strategic communications intended to highlight the Pentagon's role. It also made clear the troops would carry no weapons.

Texto completo: DAKAR, Senegal - The Nigerian military stormed the headquarters and three satellite offices of one of the nation's largest newspapers on Sunday, detaining at least two journalists and seizing computers, phones and other equipment.
The military released a statement calling its actions an "invitation" to talk to staff about a lead article on Sunday in the newspaper, Daily Trust, about a planned military operation in the town of Baga, that it said had divulged classified information, "thus undermining national security."
The Sunday edition also included an editorial criticizing the military for its lack of progress fighting Boko Haram, the Islamist terrorist group that has unleashed violence in the northeast of the country for nearly a decade.
The military raid came less than two months before scheduled presidential elections in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, and after a series of stinging losses in the war with Boko Haram.
Soldiers arrived Sunday afternoon at the Daily Trust office in Maiduguri, where Boko Haram was founded, and rounded up two journalists working there, Uthman Abubakar, a regional editor, and Ibrahim Sawab, a reporter who has worked in the past for The New York Times. The men were detained in a military barracks.
Sawab was released several hours later, but Abubakar remained in custody on Monday, colleagues said.
Later Sunday afternoon, armed soldiers in five vehicles stormed the paper's main office in the capital, Abuja, and ordered journalists working inside to evacuate. They occupied the building for four hours, according to Mannir DanAli, the paper's editor-inchief, ransacking the newsroom and carting away dozens of computers. Soldiers also entered the newspaper's offices in Lagos and Kaduna.
Their actions "strangulated the production of the Monday edition of the paper," Dan-Ali said.
President Muhammadu Buhari, who is running for re-election next month, made big gains against Boko Haram when he first took office in 2015, but some of that success has slipped away in recent months, as the group has carried out a series of successful attacks against the military.
Boko Haram fighters have killed dozens of soldiers, even posting online a gruesome video of one attack, and rumors have circulated that they once again control some territory in the country's northeast.
Soldiers have complained about long tours of duty that have left them with no days off for months, worn-out equipment and low rations, according to local news reports. The military has disputed all such claims.
Late Sunday, Buhari ordered soldiers out of Daily Trust offices, saying issues between the military and newspaper "will be resolved through dialogue."
In its statement, the military said, "The Nigerian Army has no intention of muzzling the press or jeopardizing press freedom." It added that the military would "not tolerate a situation where a publication would consistently side with terrorists and undermine our national institutions."
The action was criticized by the Committee to Protect Journalists and by Amnesty International, which has also faced criticism by the military after releasing reports of human rights abuses by soldiers.
Soldiers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters from a minority Muslim religious group, and the military lashed out at UNICEF, briefly ordering the group out of the country before relenting. Soldiers were angry about a training program by the aid group that aimed to teach people to spot and report military abuses.
The raids on Sunday seemed to be an escalation of the military's lashing out at critics.
Abubakar Ibrahim, features editor at the Daily Trust, was on the third floor of the newsroom in Abuja on Sunday when soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying guns rushed inside and ordered everyone to shut down their computers and place them on a table.
"They collected the computers and our laptops then ordered everyone to the reception under escort," he said. "Soldiers were pointing guns at journalists."
Ibrahim said soldiers also raided a printing press building, effectively shutting it down.
"We've seen the military's attitude to the population and how they can behave. That was playing in my mind," he said. "Amongst us there was bafflement that something like this could happen in this age, supposedly in democratic society."

Texto completo: Illustration Senator-elect Doug Jones (D-AL) speaks during a Dec. 13, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala.

With the conspicuous exception of President Trump and some of his supporters, Americans were appalled when it was revealed that Russian "troll farms" had launched a disinformation campaign on social media designed to influence the 2016 election. But online deception about elections is detestable even when it originates inside this country, as it apparently did in a 2017 special election for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama.
The New York Times reported Monday that progressive Democrats opposed to Roy Moore, the odious Republican candidate in that race, created a Facebook page and Twitter feed purporting to represent Moore supporters opposed to the sale of alcoholic beverages. The convoluted strategy behind the "Dry Alabama" campaign was to associate Moore with calls for a statewide ban on the sale of liquor in order to alienate moderate, pro-business Republicans and help Democratic candidate Doug Jones. (Jones, who says he had no idea that the deception was underway on his behalf, was narrowly elected.)
"Dry Alabama" was actually the second case of Russian-style disinformation in the Alabama campaign uncovered by the New York Times. In December it reported on an "experiment" in which a phony Facebook page was created to try to drain support for Moore from conservatives and a "false flag" operation was created to suggest that the Republican candidate was being followed on Twitter by Russian bots.
Ironically, one of the participants in that project was Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, a cyber security firm that compiled a report on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee. Morgan said that his intention was to understand the mechanics of disinformation tactics, not to affect the outcome of the election. But the New York Times quoted an internal report saying that the project sought to "enrage and energize Democrats."
The architects of "Dry Alabama" made no apology for trying to influence the election. Matt Osborne, a progressive activist who worked on the project, told the New York Times that while he hoped that deceptive tactics would someday be banned from American politics, in the meantime Democrats "cannot unilaterally give it up."
That's ludicrous. Misleading voters is not just another campaign tactic. It's a corruption of democracy.

AT&amp;T is labeling phones '5G Evolution.' Don't be fooled, they aren't 5G

Texto completo: Shopping for a new phone on AT&T's website, you might come across a feature tab labeled "5G Evolution. "
Don't be fooled. This isn't actual 5G but rather AT&T's marketing department at work.
While the rest of the wireless industry gears up for next generation 5G wireless networks, AT&T has gone ahead and rebranded some of its latest 4G LTE phones. The goal: To convince people that these phones, which includes a number of recent iPhones, Galaxys and LG devices, are similar to the 5G devices due to arrive in the coming weeks and months.
AT&T is even updating the icons on some of its existing Android phones to feature a "5G E" logo.
Hate to break it to you, but your existing iPhone 8, iPhone XR, Galaxy S9 or LG V30 did not magically gain 5G capabilities. They will work the same as they did before, connecting to AT&T's updated 4G LTE network.
Actual 5G phones will need to have the proper chips inside to connect to the new networks, something current devices lack. Samsung, LG and OnePlus have all said they will release 5G phones this year, with AT&T announcing it will have two 5G Samsung phones in 2019.
These 5G devices will be able to take advantage of 5G's improvements, including its faster speeds and more responsive performance. While current 4G LTE phones will still work fine over the next few years, calling them a form of 5G is misleading. (Making things more confusing: AT&T plans for two different versions of 5G, one called 5G and another 5G+).
On its website, AT&T justifies the marketing by saying that they've "made changes that are already bringing faster speeds to the latest devices on our LTE network. "
More: Tech in 2019: 5G, AI, 8K – the year ahead looks like an alphabet soup of progress
More: AT&T turns on its mobile 5G network on Dec. 21, starting with 12 cities and mobile hotspot
More: You’re going to love 5G, but there are a few things you need to know first
Not the first time
This isn't the first time AT&T, or the wireless industry, has tried to blur the lines when it comes to new technology.
Before T-Mobile launched its LTE network, it rebranded its improved 3G network, known as HSPA+, as "4G" in 2010 to tap into the excitement around 4G and keep itself competitive in the public eye with the 4G networks being launched by its rivals.
The move ironically angered AT&T at the time, though the company soon rebranded its own HSPA+ network as "4G," changing the designation for its improved 3G network as it worked to launch LTE in 2011.
This switch is also why AT&T and T-Mobile iPhones today show "4G" when not connected to their respective LTE networks.
Verizon and T-Mobile have both taken advantage of AT&T's latest marketing ploy to get in a few digs at their shared rival.
In a tweet, T-Mobile replaced the LTE logo on an iPhone with a "9G" sticker, adding, "didn’t realize it was this easy, brb updating. "
Verizon, meanwhile, took out full-page ads in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and USA TODAY Tuesday to seemingly address AT&T's recent moves.
"The potential for 5G is awesome, but the potential to over-hype and under-deliver on the 5G promise is a temptation that the wireless industry must resist," Kyle Malady, Verizon's chief technology officer, writes in the ad. Confusing terms "risk alienating the very people we want most to join in developing and harnessing this exciting new technology. "
"Verizon is making this commitment today: We won’t take an old phone and just change the software to turn the 4 in the status bar into a 5. We will not call our 4G network a 5G network if customers don’t experience a performance or capability upgrade that only 5G can deliver. "

Texto completo: If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November, she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points -- the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the new Congress, 31 Democrats represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue -- 41, if the Democrat is declared the winner in a North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi River from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer; 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a police officer. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trapshooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- who have been the United States' largest age cohort for more than five decades will, in 2019, be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are -- were; they are shuffling off the stage -- almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In November's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" -- people with no religion -- "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, Calif., seats in November -- the Democrats lost only two seats nationally -- there are no Republicans from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. There also are no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party -- as of January, there are more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined -- they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that, in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election cycle since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked whether her family went out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income. Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four victories have been by margins of 6, 11, 20 and 24 percentage points.

Texto completo: Denying a shift,
he appears to endorse plan to finish ISIS fight
President Trump vowed a "prudent" withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, embracing a new, more cautious timeline on Monday while appearing to deny that he had ever ordered an immediate troop departure in the first place.
"We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump said in a morning tweet. That was "no different from my original statements," he said, accusing the news media of inaccurately reporting "my intentions on Syria."
Last month, Trump declared the Islamic State defeated in Syria and said troops would be "coming back now." Since then, senior officials have issued a series of statements that have cast doubt on his promise of a quick departure.
The president's endorsement of a flexible departure, conditioned on the still-to-come defeat of the Islamic State, was the latest indication of his administration's zigzagging foreign policy, in which decisions are often made by dramatic presidential tweets and followed by more-circumspect policies reflecting top advisers' views.
The initial plan for a quick withdrawal, which would require turning over the U.S.-supported effort against remaining militants to NATO ally Turkey, was met with dismay among officials and lawmakers who feared the Islamic State could return in force. A day after Trump's announcement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest.
Trump's new remarks appeared to endorse a revised proposal, floated by national security adviser John Bolton a day earlier, that would allow U.S. troops and their local allies to extinguish a small but stubborn militant force before they depart. It would also require Turkey to refrain from attacking Syrian Kurdish troops who are the chief U.S. partner on the ground.
The evolving plans came as Bolton traveled Monday to Ankara, Turkey's capital, for talks with Turkish officials on the U.S. withdrawal, including protection of the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Turkey has vowed to expel from northeast Syria.
Officials across the government have scrambled in recent days to keep up with shifting statements from administration leaders, even as they continued to make plans for a near-term military exit that they cautioned could squander the fruits of a four-year military effort.
While Trump initially demanded a 30-day departure, officials said the administration later settled on an exit within 120 days to give troops more time to break down bases and safely remove equipment and personnel. The latest comments from Trump and Bolton intensified questions about what would occur concerning the more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
Joshua Geltzer, who served as a White House counterterrorism official during the Obama administration, said the back-and-forth was an obstacle for diplomats and military planners.
"It's hard enough to plan military operations when there's a clear sense of the assets and resources available. It's even harder with this persistent uncertainty," said Geltzer, who is now at the Georgetown University Law Center.
Trump's pullout plan fueled concerns among allied nations, including France and Britain, which have sent their own troops to Syria. It also drew criticism from some in his own party, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who on Sunday said Trump had "made a mistake" with his initial pronouncement but was now "slowing down."
On Monday, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused Trump of "changing course like a drunken sailor."
"It shows that our president literally doesn't know what he is doing. He is making it up as he goes," Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) told CNN. "The way he is going about it is disastrous."
But Trump and his top advisers were defiant Monday as they denied that their Syria plans had changed.
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria," Trump said in the same tweet, referring to articles on Sunday from numerous publications, including the Times and The Washington Post, that noted the shifting accounts of the military exit. "No different from my original statements."
Trump kicked off weeks of confusion with his declaration last month, bucking the advice of top advisers who urged patience as U.S. and allied troops sought to eradicate remaining militants. Since he was a candidate, Trump has vowed to end the Syria mission.
"Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won," Trump said in a Dec. 19 video message on Twitter.
More recently, Trump and other senior officials have backed away from asserting victory over the Islamic State, as the military continues to conduct hundreds of airstrikes against a still-potent militant force.
Military officials are awaiting decisions from Trump and others about the withdrawal, including whether the United States will continue its air campaign in Syria and how the administration plans to position Special Operations forces to enable periodic missions against militant leaders.
"We've seen a slight exhale among those in the Pentagon who were worried about planning and executing a withdrawal," said Mara Karlin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who previously served as a senior Pentagon official.
In an opinion piece published Monday by the New York Times, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised that his nation would fill the gap left by the United States. He noted that Turkey, unlike the United States, had sent ground troops several times to directly battle the Islamic State in northern Syria.
Erdogan voiced support for an American exit but said it should be "planned carefully and performed in cooperation with the right partners to protect the interests of the United States, the international community and the Syrian people."
"Turkey, which has NATO's second largest standing army, is the only country with the power and commitment to perform that task," he wrote.
Under the earlier White House plans, Turkish-backed forces would press into areas now controlled by the SDF, a notion that American officials have cautioned could lead to deadly Turkish-Kurdish battles.
Erdogan, who has called the SDF a terrorist group, has vowed to send his own troops, along with allied Syrian fighters, across the border to push out the SDF. Bolton's revised plan appears to link the U.S. withdrawal to Turkish guarantees to refrain from such an incursion.
Hours before Bolton's arrival in Ankara, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar insisted that Turkey's problem was not with Kurds in general but with those belonging to the People's Protection Units, or YPG. "The fight of the Turkish armed forces is not against our Kurdish brothers, with whom we have shared the same geography and the same bread for centuries," Akar said.
The Kurdish ethnic group is spread across a contiguous area that includes portions of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. In Turkey, a Kurdish group allied with the Syrian YPG has fought for autonomy for decades.
But YPG fighters make up the bulk of the SDF, which the United States has trained, armed and advised as the primary ground force against the Islamic State in Syria. As northeastern Syria has been cleared of the militants, the Kurds have set up a provisional government that now borders Turkey.
The YPG has been in contact with both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and with Russia, Assad's primary backer, as a backstop against a U.S. withdrawal.

Texto completo: One of the two Americans reportedly captured by The Syrian Democratic Forces — a U.S.-backed militia fighting the Islamic State — had applied for a job teaching English to students of the Islamic State.

“Dear Director, I am looking to get a position teaching English to students in the Islamic State,” Warren Christopher Clark, 34, wrote in a letter to ISIS, per the New York Times.

“I believe that a successful teacher can understand a student’s strengths and weaknesses,” he said, adding that teachers should “use that understanding to help students build on their understanding of the English language.”

Clark, 34, is originally from Houston and previously served as a substitute teacher in the Fort Bend Independent School District in Sugar Land, Texas after graduating from the University of Houston. Documents recovered from a home in Mosul, Iraq indicate that Clark also had taught English in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Positions after 2015 are vacant on his resume and suggest he joined ISIS afterwards.

Clark’s father denied that he was involved with a group such as ISIS, and claimed his “son would not be involved in anything along those lines.”

“My son doesn’t have an evil thought in his mind about hurting anyone,” Clark’s father, Warren Clark, told the New York Times.

The Syrian Democratic Forces announced Sunday that Clark had been captured with another American, Zaid Abed al-Hamid, along with others from Pakistan and Ireland. The Pentagon said the incident is under investigation.

“We are aware of open source reports of reportedly American citizens currently in custody who were believed to be fighting for ISIS," Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson said in a statement. "However, we are unable to confirm this information at this time. The incident is under investigation."

‘A high standard, for music and the good life’: Local native of hit ’50s group the McGuire Sisters remembered

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN —
The eldest sister of the McGuire Sisters, the trio born in Middletown and raised in Miamisburg, with six Top 10 Billboard hits including No. 1 hits “Sincerely” and “Sugartime,” died just before New Year’s in Las Vegas.
Born Ruby Christine McGuire, the sister behind the iconic group’s matching attire, to Asa and Lillie McGuire on July 30, 1926, died on Dec. 28, 2018, at 92. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday, according to the New York Times, and no cause of death was given.
Phyllis McGuire, 87, the youngest of the trio, is the sole survivor of the McGuire Sisters, who were born in Middletown. Dorothy “Dottie” McGuire died in 2012 at 84.
The McGuire Sisters performed for five presidents — Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush — and Queen Elizabeth II. They were inducted into three halls of fame: the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009.
The sisters stopped performing in the late 1960s but made a comeback in 1985, including performing at casinos and clubs in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Their last televised performance was a 2004 PBS special, “Magic Moments: The Best of ’50s Pop.”
The sisters were close, said Pat Hayes, of Middletown, who organized the McGuire Sisters’ 1991 Middletown bicentennial performance at the Sorg Theater.
“I’m sure (Phyllis) is a very lonely lady,” Hayes said after hearing the news of Christine’s death. “They were really quite close as sisters, and I’m sure as entertainers.”
In their 1991 Middletown performance, the McGuire Sisters had a sold-out one-night, two-show performance, said Hayes, who organized the event with her husband, Norm.
“They put on a really big show,” she said.
The McGuire Sisters started out singing in church and after being discovered on local television, signed with Coral Records in 1952. Their first record, “Picking Sweethearts” was released in 1953. Their first Top 10 hit, “Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight,” reached No. 7.
“They definitely set a standard, a high standard, for music and the good life,” said Hayes, who recalled the sisters as “very much down-to-earth” and consummate professionals. And as with most professionals, they had a few requests before they performed. One request was something they grew up with: Jug Burgers from The Jug on Central Avenue.
“They were just really fun,” Hayes said.
Ann Mort, a former Middletown school board and city council member, said that 1991 performance “was a major event” in Middletown.
“And every man of a certain age claimed to have dated one of the sisters,” she said.
Christine McGuire’s death is “certainly a major name being lost to the music world,” Mort said. “They did a lot for their home communities, and were always interesting and fun people as a group.”

Texto completo: A newspaper in Vermont is not only asking Senator Bernie Sanders not to run for president — it's begging him.
In an editorial published Saturday, The Barre Montpelier Times Argus argued that, while making the decision to beg Sanders against running was difficult, there are reasons to be concerned with his potential second run.
And they're right.
The newspaper's editorial board points to its frequent questioning of Sanders's record for his “home" state and notes that “you are more likely to catch Sanders on Colbert, CNN, or MSNBC than you are to see him talking to reporters here in Vermont. Evidently, microphones here don't extend far enough."
The editorial also acknowledge fears that another Sanders run will divide the Democratic Party.
“For us, this comes down to principle over ego," the newspaper wrote. “It is one thing to start a revolution, but at a certain point you need to know when to step out of the way and let others carry the water for you."
And they call him tired, exhausting even.
But it's the last poignant point in the editorial that makes the case against Sanders.
Accusations published in The New York Times last week against Sanders's 2016 campaign staff ranged from sexist comments to poor treatment of women and a wage gap.
In fact, according to the Times, two “delegates who supported [Sanders] two years ago recently told his staff that he can't run for president again without addressing the sexism they believe surfaced in his last campaign."
When Sanders was given the chance to respond on CNN Wednesday night, he apologized and promised to do better if he ran again, but he also said that in 2016 he was “a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case" for his presidency.
That will not do. Not in 2019. Not after #MeToo. Not after Time's Up.
This year welcomed the historic 116th Congress, where record numbers of women and people of color are serving in the House after having been elected in the 2018 midterms — an election that was widely seen as a rebuke of President Trump and his policies as well as a stand against his treatment of women and minorities.
Sanders was aware of the sexism and misogyny that “Bernie Bros" — his most ardent and hostile supporters — brought to the 2016 presidential campaign, but he claims he didn't notice anything wrong in the very room where his staff planned rallies that the bros flocked to.
“I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right, in terms of human resources," he told Anderson Cooper Wednesday, barely acknowledging his campaign's shortcomings.
But even giving him the benefit of the doubt, it's still not enough.
Sanders dodged responsibility with his answer on CNN. And, sure, he might not have known, but a workplace culture — a campaign's culture — does not grow in a vacuum. Real leadership would be taking responsibility. Sanders's TV sound bite sounds like a dodge.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN —
The eldest sister of the McGuire Sisters, the trio born in Middletown and raised in Miamisburg, with six Top 10 Billboard hits including No. 1 hits “Sincerely” and “Sugartime,” died just before New Year’s in Las Vegas.
Born Ruby Christine McGuire, the sister behind the iconic group’s matching attire, to Asa and Lillie McGuire on July 30, 1926, died on Dec. 28, 2018, at 92. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday, according to the New York Times, and no cause of death was given.
Phyllis McGuire, 87, the youngest of the trio, is the sole survivor of the McGuire Sisters, who were born in Middletown. Dorothy “Dottie” McGuire died in 2012 at 84.
The McGuire Sisters performed for five presidents — Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush — and Queen Elizabeth II. They were inducted into three halls of fame: the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009.

Will: A sign of intelligent life in the Democratic Party

Texto completo: In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue - 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less.
Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 - who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades, will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996.
Boomers are - were; they are shuffling off stage - almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" - people with no religion - "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, the New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November - the Democrats lost only two seats nationally - come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party - come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined - they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income.
Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

5 things about next PAC musical

Texto completo: The Fox Cities Performing Arts Center isn't wasting any time getting the new year started, with the touring production of the Broadway musical "Anastasia" opening Tuesday for a six-day, eight-show run.
Before the third show of the PAC's Broadway season begins its journey to the past, here's a roundup of what you should know — about the musical, its history and whether or not it's worth opening your wallet for.
So, 'Anastasia.' What is it? "Anastasia" is a musical inspired by the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, who was murdered with her family by Bolshevik secret police in 1918. In this story Anastasia survives, suffers from memory loss and years later learns of her true identity. Perhaps you remember the animated film from 20-some years ago?
It's not a direct adaptation of the 1997 Fox Animation Studios movie of the same name, but is inspired by it. Same goes for the 1956 "Anastasia" film that won actress Ingrid Bergman an Academy Award. (You may run into a tagline or two about the musical being "inspired by the 20th Century Fox motion pictures." That's why.)
A few of the songs from the 1997 film, including "Once Upon a December" and "Journey to the Past," are in the musical, but the majority of the songs are new.
Among the elements not making the trip to the stage are Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok, the villains of the animated version of the story. Instead the antagonist here is Gleb, a Bolshevik general.
Lila Coogan, the actress who plays the lead role of Anya (Anastasia) on the tour, said the musical is sort of like a grown-up version of the story from the film.
"We don't have a talking bat. We don't have a fantastical demon from the other world," she said. "We have real people struggling with real issues in a real time setting."
Who's behind it? Terrence McNally, a playwright with a lengthy list of accolades to his credit (including multiple Tony and Drama Desk awards), wrote the book. Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, two more Tony winners, handled the music. Those three also worked together on the decorated mid-'90s musical "Ragtime."
Darko Tresnjak directs. He's best known as the Tony Award-winning director of "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder."
Is it new? Yes. It made its debut on Broadway in March 2017 and the tour on its way to Appleton began in October. This visit to the Fox Cities PAC is its Wisconsin premiere.
How's it been received? Reviews have been mostly called it ... fine. The Hollywood Reporter labeled it a "pretty but anodyne musical, which ends up being more satisfying than the sum of its parts."
In the New York Times it was compared to "those mid-20th-century musicals that must've sounded like a good idea at the time, but tend to be remembered today only by hard-core aficionados of the genre." Young adults who remember the animated film may latch on, the Times' Ben Brantley wrote, but those without "such nostalgic insulation are likely to find this 'Anastasia' a chore."
The Broadway production picked up two Tony Award nominations in 2017: one for actress Mary Beth Peil and one for costume design. Neither won. At the Drama Desk Awards, there was more love in the form of nine nominations, though the result was just a single win in the projection design category.
What else is there to know? Coogan said the first thing she often hears praise for is what the musical looks like.
"I think visually, across the board, the show is absolutely stunning," she said. "We have the best costumes that anyone could ask for, designed by Linda Cho; a gorgeous, gorgeous set; these projection screens that take you from Paris to Russia and all over the place, they're just so beautiful. It's magical to see."
If you thought the animated "Anastasia" movie, done by Fox Animation Studios, was made by Disney, it's a common mistake. That's because it looks like a Disney film and its directors, Gary Goldman and Don Bluth, had both worked for Disney. (Bluth also directed "An American Tail," "The Land Before Time" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven." Goldman was a producer on each.)
That movie, which featured voice work by Meg Ryan, Christopher Lloyd, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Hank Azaria, made more than $58 million and was the second highest-grossing animated movie of 1997. ("Hercules" was first.)
Coogan said she loved the 1997 movie and the Anastasia character specifically.
"She was the first princess I can recall that kind of had a bit to her," she said. "I personally am not like a flowers and sunshine kind of girl. I'm a little bit spunkier and kookier than that. It was just way more relatable at that time in my life for me."
The "Anastasia" opening is one of three Wisconsin premieres in the 2018-19 Kimberly-Clark Broadway Across America-Fox Cities Series. By season's end, the Fox Cities PAC will have hosted 36 statewide premieres since opening in 2002. Next up this season? "The Lion King," which made its Wisconsin premiere at the PAC in 2007.
"Anastasia" opens on Jan. 8 at the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center in Appleton.

Texto completo: Jessica Chastain plays an underground poker ringleader in "Molly's Game." And "Annihilation" hits Hulu.
What's on TV
MOLLY'S GAME (2017) 6:40 p.m. on Showtime. This week's announcement that the actor Idris Elba will be D.J.-ing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival may not have been the news that many pine for (that would be the prospect of Elba as James Bond), but it did bring to light one of Elba's lesser-known talents. See him here as he plays a lawyer opposite Jessica Chastain in the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut, a fictionalized (and sympathetic) account of the life of the skier-turned-underground poker ringleader Molly Bloom. Dense with quick-moving dialogue, the film follows Bloom's rapid rise from the back seat of a high-end Los Angeles poker game to her eventual F.B.I. and legal troubles. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that "Mr. Sorkin has written some sharp characters and cast them accordingly." But she also said that the film's endeavor to view Bloom as a victim and put a feminist spin on the story is a feeble one. "By attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim -- and by glossing over her culpability -- Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency," Dargis wrote.
SISTERS (2015) 5:30 p.m. on FXM. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play sisters with midlife troubles in this comedy, by the longtime "Saturday Night Live" writer Paula Pell. Fey is perennially unemployed, with a temper. Poehler is a nurse who is divorced. Their childhood home is being sold, so the siblings decide to throw a final party there. In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott called the film "uneven, generally enjoyable, self-consciously naughty and also, despite drug use and jokes about anal sex, more concerned with reassurance than transgression."
SUPER TROOPERS 2 (2018) 6:30 p.m. on HBO. Broken Lizard, the troupe behind the cult classic "Super Troopers," raised more than $2 million from fans to get this sequel made -- and, judging by the results, they had a lot of fun making it. The plot (which Glenn Kenny, in his review for The Times, called "largely unimportant") reunites the original Vermont state trooper characters as they supervise an extension of the United States border into Canada, cracking jokes all the while.
What's Streaming
ANNIHILATION (2018) on Hulu. The great unknown comes to Florida in Alex Garland's follow-up to the dark sci-fi of his directorial debut, "Ex Machina" (2015). His sophomore effort casts Natalie Portman as a biologist who, along with a posse that includes a physicist played by Tessa Thompson, ventures into a mysterious glistening force field that has descended onto a patch of marshland. "Mr. Garland likes to play with tones, mixing deadpan in with the frights, and later 'Annihilation' becomes something of a head movie, swirling with cosmic and menacingly lysergic visions," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "He keeps the tension torqued throughout this phantasmagoric interlude, sustaining the shivery unease that is one of this movie's deeper satisfactions."

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts —started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change . . . To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2. 2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99. 8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown is headed towards a third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House, only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off.
Trump, who has demanded $5. 6 billion to help pay for a border wall, acknowledged he had warned Democrat leaders that an impasse could last for months or even years if a deal cannot be reached on financing for the wall.

Texto completo: An acclaimed local tour company is moving out of its original spot in downtown Montgomery's renovated Kress building as part of a wave of changes to the business.
Michelle Browder's More Than Tours was one of the first spaces open when the new-look Kress on Dexter debuted in April, after a years-long renovation to the former department store. It was joined by local coffee shop Prevail Union and others in the following weeks.
Since then, the tour company has been featured in a New York Times travel article highlighting the best of Montgomery, and Browder has been honored by the city and others as a "Community Hero" for her work as an ambassador and educator.
Now, Browder plans to move More Than Tours to a new, smaller spot by mid-January. She wasn't ready to reveal the location, but she said she isn't going far. And the tours aren't going anywhere.
Browder said her tour business has tripled since the Equal Justice Initiative opened its memorial and museum nearby.
"With what's happening with Montgomery and the new folks that are coming in... it has been a tremendous blessing for us, as far as my youth organization and our business side," she said. "It's been a blessing. We're going to revamp, restructure, and hopefully we'll be able to provide a better service."
Those changes include adding some help and other upgrades. At the same time, the company will trim its number of public tours to accommodate a growing number of advance bookings by tourists from around the world.
"People are coming and booking by the tens, the twenties, to the point where we're just going to go to one tour a day for the overall public," Browder said. "We still want to provide that service. But for the most part we want to concentrate on group tours."
For now, she's focused on downsizing. That includes selling an array of furniture, clothing and artwork inside the current 36 Dexter Ave. space, some of which she created.
In addition to running the tour company and the I Am More Than youth nonprofit, Browder is a trained artist who teaches art at Valiant Cross Academy. She wants to use part of the new More Than Tours space as a gallery.
Browder praised the effort by the Kress building's owners to spread the word about the business and help drive its growth in 2018, and she said she's optimistic about what's ahead.
"We're just looking forward to 2019 and seeing the new attractions, and the people that are coming here because of the resurgence of (interest in Martin Luther) King, Rosa Parks, the Civil Rights movement and the city itself, and what we have to offer in terms of tech and hospitality," she said. "I think it's going to be great."

Texto completo: Wow! I intended to do a Part 2 on the US status and foreign countries. There's so much going on that's on the back burner. The news seems to be primarily aimed at elected officials beating up and criticizing each other in a see-saw tug a' war for power and even if one side does something good, the other finds a way to deny, distort or discredit. The United States is in a jeopardous precarious position. We're in the 7th day of the government shut down. Each side blames the other as they're fussin' and fightn.' I hear so much craziness on the television about the universities and what students are exposed to: our children and grandchildren. There's talk about pronoun accuracy from he, she, her, him, they, us and whoever?? We're being educated to use pronoun correctness as needed. "Grammar conventions are shifting. Efforts to introduce nonstandard pronouns, some of which date to as early as the 1850s, have generated a vast array of alternatives, including "xe," "ze," "phe," "er," "ou." In 1884, several newspapers tried to make "thon" happen. Increasingly, courtesy titles like "Mr." and "Ms." are having to make room for novel varieties like "Mx." pronounced "mix." Today, many transgender people prefer the conventional "he" or "she," but those who have adopted "they," "them" and "theirs" as personal pronouns have become much more visible. Over the last few decades, The New York Times has changed the way it writes about transgender men and women. The power of language cannot be overstated. It can legitimize or it can dismiss." Newspaper reporters are challenged on how they report their stories. Let's show we can be better and rise above the confusion. Look forward to brighter future days in our own lives. There we have more influence. What is unchanging? The incontrovertible truth. It can be distorted, perverted; but it's permanently correct. Some will deny that. Others will accept it. Some will believe and others won't believe. Learn where you excel. Find your "glow." What is your brightest spot? What do you do best? What is your gift or talent? If you don't know yet; start asking yourself these questions. Sometimes it takes time to "spot" your "glow." Is your glow music, serving, researching, culinary arts, organization, building, architecture, gardening, art, medicine, so many things and so many ways. Most importantly; DO NOT give up! Search for "your powerful glow." Find it. You have it! If you don't already know it, it's waiting for discovery. Now the "He" mentioned in the title: "He is a person." He's the Holy Spirit! He's alive, actively waiting to be proactive in your life. Access dunamis! Power that begets power!

Kellyanne Conway: Trump's 90-minute Cabinet meeting 'shows his transparency'

Texto completo: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway argued Thursday that President Trump's hour-and-a-half Cabinet meeting the day before "shows his transparency."

The freewheeling meeting, which the media was invited to watch, touched on a variety of topics, including Syria, the border wall, and politics, and was roundly criticized for including a number of false or misleading statements.

"Look, I think the president is speaking for 95 minutes and holding forth on any number of issues shows his transparency and shows he is always willing to have the press in the room," Conway said in an interview with Fox News.

Conway brought up "transparency" when asked about the appearance of a poster inspired by the HBO series “Game of Thrones" on the desk in front of Trump during the White House meeting. The poster, which was was originally posted to Twitter by the president in November, says, “Sanctions are Coming,” a play on the line from the books and the show and also includes a photograph of Trump.

“I’ll let it speak for itself. The president will maybe be asked about that later on but a lot was said yesterday," Conway said.

Trump's extended remarks were criticized by some politicos and journalists.

"If I were asked to fact-check TRUMP’s rambling 95-minute cabinet meeting performance, I’d probably still be curled up in the fetal position under my desk," remaked the New York Times' Kenneth Vogel in a tweet.

Outlets including the Times and the Associated Press ran fact-checks on Trump's claims.

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
On June 1, 2018, a 20-year-old medic named Rouzan al-Najjar was killed by Israeli gunfire while she was volunteering on a protest field less than a mile from her home in Khuzaa, Gaza Strip. She was the latest casualty in a wave of protests this year in Gaza that often culminated in violence near the boundary fence with Israel.
My colleagues Yousur Al-Hlou and Neil Collier had met Rouzan during a reporting trip three weeks earlier and were struck by her charisma and her determination to help the injured. We felt duty bound to investigate her death -- and, along with The Times's Jerusalem bureau chief, David M. Halbfinger, spent five months doing so. We interviewed more than 60 people (witnesses, family members, friends, teachers, acquaintances, members of the Israeli army, and medical, legal and ballistics experts).
The weekend that Rouzan was killed, David went to Khuzaa to talk with her family and medics on her team, and Yousur and I began to gather video evidence, to piece together what happened. Our goal was to freeze that fatal moment in time and find out why that shot was taken.
We discovered that most of the day was documented in pictures by journalists, protesters, medics and bystanders taking selfies. Over months of reporting from New York and Gaza, we collected more than 1,000 videos and photographs directly from the cellphones and cameras of more than 30 key witnesses. Getting the original pictures gave us file metadata -- information that allowed us to verify the authenticity of the footage and to arrange clips in the order in which they were taken.
Later, we realized that some pictures were out of sequence because the time was incorrectly set on several cameras. So we compared each device against an accurate clock to recalibrate the metadata and create a precise tick-tock of events.
We laid out hours of footage minute by minute, and were able to triangulate moments from multiple angles, including the fatal shot: Six cameras captured that moment.
We made several trips to Gaza. Complicating matters on the ground was the Israeli closure policy, which makes crossing in and out impossible from Thursday at 3:30 p.m. to Sunday at 7:30 a.m. On a hunch, David raced to meet a couple of Rouzan's former high school teachers at noon on a Thursday, one eye on the clock. He learned from them, for the first time, of how Rouzan had testified against her own grandmother in a homicide case in which members of her family had sought to keep quiet.
Our next step was to map out the protest field. We circled it using high-definition drone cameras and partnered with the British research agency Forensic Architecture to create a 3D model using photogrammetry software. Nicholas Masterton, a researcher at the agency, used every frame of the photos and videos we collected to precisely sketch out where people and objects were on June 1. He positioned the Israel Defense Forces soldiers, their jeeps, a sniper's bunker and sand berms used by soldiers on the Israeli side of the fence. Mr. Masterson and our colleague in Times Video, Tim Chaffee, painstakingly plotted the positions of cameras filming on the Gaza side into the model; inserted the medics, protesters and bystanders at key moments; and reconstructed that deadly scene.
The bullet hit two medics and sprayed a third with shrapnel and debris. Having accurately calculated their positions, we drew a line through them and retraced the bullet to sand berms where Israeli snipers had taken up position minutes before the fatal shot. One of the medics, Mohammed Shafee, was sprayed in the chest and pelvic area by debris and shrapnel from the bullet. Videos confirmed that at the moment of the shot he was facing the fence. So the bullet had to have come from the Israeli side, not from behind Mr. Shafee.
A senior Israeli commander told David that soldiers shot four protesters in Khuzaa on June 1. He gave specific details: the minute each protester was shot, what they were wearing and that they were acting violently. We had uninterrupted footage extending over this period, and confirmed that four shots were fired at the times the commander said they were. We also identified the first, third and fourth targets. But we determined that the Israel Defense Forces' account of the second shot -- fired at 6:31 p.m. -- is inaccurate. Critically, this is the shot that killed Rouzan.
The Israel Defense Forces' rules of engagement are secret, but Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, told us that its soldiers only target protesters who are posing a violent threat, like "cutting the fence, throwing grenades."
The Israeli military maintains that the 6:31 p.m. shot targeted and hit a protester wearing a yellow shirt who was throwing stones and pulling at the coils of barbed wire laid out 40 yards from the security fence. We identified several men and boys wearing yellow shirts that day. Only one was near the direction of fire. From several videos, we could determine that he was standing around 120 yards from the fence and that he did not appear to be protesting violently in the minutes leading up to the shot. Indeed, we didn't see any violent protesting in that area in the minutes before the fatal gunshot, suggesting that the shot contravened the Israeli military's own rules about targeting protesters. What's more, behind the target was a group of bystanders and medics in white coats. Former snipers in the United States Army and the Israel Defense Forces told us that, without a backstop, it was a reckless shot to take.
The bullet missed and hit the ground a few yards in front of the medics. Michael Knox, a forensic ballistics investigator, told us that the type of bullet used by the Israeli sniper could skim like a stone off the rocky soil. When it hits soil at a low angle, it pushes the soil ahead of it into a miniature ramp and projects itself up and out of the ground. Mohammed Shafee was hit in the torso with shrapnel. The bullet grazed Rami Abo Jazar's thigh and continued its upward trajectory to pierce Rouzan just above her chest, severing her aorta.
Traditional reporting in Gaza was critical to bolstering the forensic analysis. We reviewed the video with the witnesses whom we and our Gazan colleague, Iyad Abuheweila, identified in the footage. We studied autopsy reports and interviewed the doctors who tried to save Rouzan. We read Supreme Court petitions and judgments, and talked with international legal experts about the rules governing the use of live fire.
Though Israel claims Rouzan's killing was unintentional, our investigation shows that her shooting appears to have been reckless at best, and possibly a war crime, for which no one has yet been punished. During our reporting we learned that by August, 60 to 70 Gaza protesters had been killed "unintentionally." Yet the Israeli army's rules of engagement remain unchanged, the military says. What's certain is that Rouzan's was an innocent life needlessly taken.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue – 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less.
Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches.
The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers – those born between 1946 and 1964 – who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are – were; they are shuffling off stage – almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country.
The Economist says that "Nones" – people with no religion – "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November – the Democrats lost only two seats nationally – come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party – come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined – they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: August 2015 was crucial for Trump -- and a local conservative dissenter

Texto completo: The implications have been slow to surface, but it seems as if the month of August 2015 was an important turning point for two American political players -- one in the White House and another behind a microphone here in Georgia.
We don't yet know whether that single month poses significant jeopardy for President Donald Trump. We do know that Erick Erickson, the conservative WSB Radio host, managed to survive that August -- but still walks a tightrope when it comes to Trump.
"I can see myself voting for him in 2020. I've tried the third-party route -- didn't work out. I like the policies, even if I don't like him," Erickson said last week. "But there's still the overarching issue of character there. I think character matters. And I don't think he has good character. So I'm more torn than I expected to be over this."
Several weeks ago, the U.S. Justice Department let it be known that David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, had admitted attending a meeting with Michael Cohen, the president's lawyer and fixer, to establish a method of paying off -- and so silencing -- women who alleged having sexual flings with the then-presidential candidate.
Independent reports say a third person in the room was Trump himself.
So, in August 2015, we have the beginnings of what might be called a top-level conspiracy to handle the fallout from Trump's physical relationships with women.
No precise date is given for the meeting, but it's worth remembering a parallel event from that same month. On Thursday, Aug. 6, in a first, crowded debate of GOP presidential candidates, then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly had homed in on Trump's attitude toward the opposite sex, noting that he had "called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals."
The next day, Trump went on CNN to dump on Kelly: "You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever." Many considered the candidate's remarks to be a rude reference to menstruation.
One of them was Erickson. The evening voice of AM750 and 95.5FM News/ Talk WSB had put together a three-day national gathering of 700 conservative activists that would begin that same Friday. The event was in Buckhead. (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB Radio are both owned by Cox Media Group.)
The draw was a parade of 10 presidential wannabes, including Trump -- who had been offered the final Saturday speaking slot.
It didn't happen. Trump's remarks about Kelly prompted Erickson to scratch the candidate's appearance. "I don't want Donald Trump in the room with my daughter," he told his crowd.
That summer, we discovered Trump had a Teflon tongue. Nothing that rolled off it could dissuade his supporters. And Erickson learned the price to be paid for dissing the candidate who even then was redefining conservatism and the Republican Party. His family was threatened. Angry strangers showed up at his door in Macon.
Three and a half years later, we now know that Megyn Kelly wasn't the only woman on Trump's mind that August. Shutting them up or dismissing them was something of a late-summer theme.
"When they doubled down and made it all about me the next day -- that was a wake-up call about how they were going to operate moving forward," Erickson said.
We were in the radio host's office in the basement of WSB headquarters off Peachtree Street. I asked him if he had any regrets about what he did that August. Zilch, Erickson answered.
And the hatching of a "catch-and-kill" strategy by the Trump campaign only a few days later?
"I don't think that was coincidental," Erickson said. "But he won."
The radio host would remain a "Never Trumper" through the general election, though he quickly sought to make amends. If you Google the words "Erick Erickson" and "crow," up pops the op-ed he wrote for The New York Times days after Trump's victory.
"Those of us who opposed him should pray for him and give him a chance. But conservatives should realize they won a battle, but are losing a war for ideas," he wrote.
Erickson said his wife, Christy, remains "militantly enraged at the idea of Donald Trump" -- a situation experienced by many Republican husbands these days.
But Erickson himself, 43, remains a man in the middle of the conservative milieu. He no longer has a paid gig as a Fox News contributor -- that ended last January. Even so, he is making more TV appearances than before, albeit unpaid. He has a chair on NBC's "Meet the Press" every other month.
Last summer, in Austin, Texas, Erickson revived a version of the Trump-less gathering in Atlanta that he hosted in August 2015, under the auspices of his new website, The Resurgent. It was a success -- a few Trump officials even showed up -- but the financing was tight. Sponsors are hard to come by. "We don't have the millionaire-billionaire support you get when you're on one side or the other," Erickson said.
Erickson has been on vacation since Trump's renewed insistence on a southern border wall has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government, but he pays homage to the influence Rush Limbaugh, a longtime hero, has on Trump and the rest of the Republican Party. "This is not just Rush Limbaugh saying it -- it's 10, 15 million people. He knows his audience very well. And the president understands that this is a base operation. If he gives up on the wall, he gives up on his base," Erickson said.
And yet, those doubts from August 2015 continue. Erickson's objections to Trump have a religious and moral origin. He already has a law degree but is currently dabbling with an online doctorate program at a Southern Baptist seminary.
On air and in writing, Erickson wonders whether another U.S. Supreme Court appointment would finally satiate conservative Christians and cool their transactional support for President Trump.
Erickson has personally forsworn supporting anyone's third-party presidential bid, but he also thinks one might spring up.
And there were these ambivalent lines he penned for his website, marking the November death of the 41st president:
"As a conservative, I don't dispute that President Trump has done more to advance the conservative policy sphere than President George H.W. Bush did.
"As a conservative, I also note that President Trump has done far more to corrupt and pervert conservatism than President Bush did."
But there are times and places where pursuit of the middle ground has its benefits. On Thursday, Erickson's airtime on WSB Radio will shift, from 5 to 7 p.m. to 4 to 6 p.m. The midafternoon airtime allotted to Sean Hannity, a confidante of Trump, has been shortened to accommodate the move.
"There's something to be said for having two hours where you know the person is fundamentally conservative, fundamentally Christian, but I'm not doing pep rally afternoons," Erickson said.

TIMES IGNORES BIGOTRY

Texto completo: Over the centuries, anti-Semitism has been many things -- a religious conviction, an ideology, a national ethic, an unadorned expression of hate and, in more recent times, evidence of sturdy insanity. Now thanks to a New York Times interview with Alice Walker, it's been reduced to merely a point of view. To cite the Times'own motto, this interview was definitely not "news that's fit to print."
Walker, of course, is a highly praised novelist best known for "The Color Purple," for which she won a Pulitzer Prize. Her renown is great, and it was no doubt on this basis that the Times interviewed her for its"BytheBook" feature that runs in the Sunday Book Review.Thetrouble started with the first question.
"Whatbooks are on your nightstand?" the Times asked.The second book Walker named was "And the Truth Shall Set You Free" by the British conspiracy theorist David Icke.The book is so repellently anti-Semitic that Icke's usual publisher wouldn't touch it. Among other things, it endorses that hoary anti-Semitic forgery "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"which blames evil Jews for much of the world's ills. The book also suggests that schools ought to balance lessons on the Holocaust with some questioning whether it ever even happened,and it reveals that the world is run by a cabal of giant,shape-shifting lizards, many of whom just happen to be Jewish.
Times readers howled. The paper should have flagged the book as an anti-Semitic tome, they insisted. The Times disagreed. It doesn't do that sort of thing in its "BytheBook" feature. In its response, the paper conceded that Icke "has been accused of anti-Semitism,"a bit like conceding that David Duke has been accused of racism. Walker,who last year posted the poem "It Is Our (Frightful) Duty To Study The Talmud" on her blog, is beyond mere accusation. She's the genuine anti-Semitic article. Apparently informed by her odd reading of the ancient Jewish text,Walker's 2017 poem asked some questions: "Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews?" "Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse? Are young boys fair game for rape?"
In its response, the book review editor, Pamela Paul,submitted to some questions,one of which was why the Times did not ask Walker to account for her odd literary taste. "We never question people on their choices,"Paul said. A sentence later, she added, "The people's answers are a reflection of their opinions, tastes and judgment." In other words, anti-Semitism is just another opinion, taste or judgment.
Paul went on in that vein, saying that the Review has been down this road before. "We've also faced criticism when a writer only named white authors, or male authors. My response to that is the same as in this case: Does that answer tell you something about the subject? I think it does."But it doesn't. For some reason,my book group -- wearily stuck on Meacham, Beschloss and Goodwin -- never got around to the Icke book. So, not having heard of Icke, I didn't know that I was being informed that Walker cuddled up nightly with the rantings of a Jewhater. My bad, I suppose.
In interviewing itself, the Times neglected to ask the Times (Paul) if it even knew that Walker was an anti-Semite. It might also have wondered if that might have caused the Times to feature someone else. The tone of Paul's response is appalling. She surely does not mean to, but she manages to treat anti-Semitism as just another point of viewâ"not a hatred with a unique and appalling pedigree that has led to unending slaughter, including the murder of the 6 million,pogroms in Kielcein Poland (1946), York in England (1190), and the lynching of Leo Frankin Georgia (1915). What's lacking from the Times is appropriate shock at AliceWalker's bigotry and its own refusal to admit a mistake. An apology would be fit to print.

Texto completo: This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.
Hundreds of doctors packed an auditorium at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on Oct. 1, deeply angered by revelations that the hospital's top medical officer and other leaders had cultivated lucrative relationships with for-profit companies.
One by one, they stood up to challenge the stewardship of their beloved institution, often to emotional applause. Some speakers accused their leaders of letting the quest to make more money undermine the hospital's mission. Others bemoaned a rigid, hierarchical management that had left them feeling they had no real voice in the hospital's direction.
"Slowly, I've seen more and more of the higher-up meetings happening with people who are dressed up in suits as opposed to white coats," said Dr. Viviane Tabar, chairwoman of the neurosurgery department.
"The corporatization of this institution is clear to many of us who have been here a long time," said Dr. Carol L. Brown, a gynecologic cancer surgeon, according to an audio recording of the meeting.
The meeting ended after several doctors advocated an immediate no-confidence vote in the hospital's senior leadership. The turmoil followed reports by The New York Times and ProPublica that the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, had been paid millions by drug and health care companies and failed to disclose those ties more than 100 times in medical journals, and that hospital insiders had made lucrative side deals that stood to earn them handsome profits, sometimes for work they had done on the job.
The day after the meeting, the hospital's chief executive, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, promised greater openness with rank-and-file doctors about decision-making. He also committed to doing the "root-cause analysis" requested by the doctors of how "egregious conflicts of interest," as one physician put it, had been allowed to happen.
Other hospitals around the country are confronting similar dilemmas. But at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation's leading cancer research and treatment centers, they are especially acute. Internal emails, audio recordings of meetings and interviews with doctors show how this major New York institution has struggled to contain a crisis of confidence in its leadership.
Closer ties between nonprofit research centers like Memorial Sloan Kettering and corporations are being fueled by a rush of potentially breakthrough cancer treatments. Venture capital firms and drug companies have looked to cash in on the scientific discoveries, said Brad Loncar, the founder of an investment fund that focuses on cancer. "Money follows success," he said, and Memorial Sloan Kettering has been a focus "because they conduct terrific science there."
In recent years, the hospital, like its competitors, has struck increasingly sophisticated deals to commercialize its discoveries, in some cases receiving equity stakes in start-ups rather than simply collecting royalties.
The predicament of Memorial Sloan Kettering also reflects a shift in its own culture. Its prior chief executive, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel-prize winning scientist, personally kept companies at arm's length, while Dr. Thompson, also a respected cancer researcher, has more fully embraced such relationships. The new approach has been applauded by some for expanding access to the cancer center's discoveries, even as others have worried that the hospital may be losing sight of its mission.
Its leaders and top researchers also hold influential positions in the corporate world. When news of Dr. Baselga's disclosure lapses broke in September, 12 doctors and researchers at the hospital served on the boards of publicly traded companies, more than at any other major cancer center, according to a review by The New York Times and ProPublica. Dr. Baselga has since resigned from the hospital and the two boards he served on. And a day after the physicians' meeting on Oct. 1, Dr. Thompson resigned from the boards of the pharmaceutical giant Merck and Charles River Laboratories, a health care company, that together had paid him $585,050 in compensation in 2017.
The concern of ethicists and health experts is that a bias in favor of industry can unduly influence scientific research and medical treatments and remove a valuable check on soaring drug prices.

"We do have to sort of decide which side of this we're on, or at least notice that we are feeding at the very trough that is causing worse access here than in any other Western country," Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the hospital's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, said at the Oct. 1 meeting.
The problems at Memorial Sloan Kettering have shaken other cancer centers. At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, officials have said they are considering whether Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher, their chief executive, and others should continue to serve on the boards of publicly traded companies, including the drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, on whose board Dr. Glimcher sits.

At the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, a task force is reviewing the conflict-of-interest policies that govern employees' financial relationships to drug companies. And medical centers around the country have instructed researchers to review their financial disclosures to medical journals, leading to a series of corrections to scientific articles.
Even as Memorial Sloan Kettering leaders have promised greater transparency, they have engaged a public affairs firm, SKDKnickerbocker, to manage their message and have aggressively pushed back against the idea that the hospital's leaders are too close to industry.
"I can see how someone might think that business relationships are problematic," said Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, who has stepped into Dr. Baselga's former position at Memorial Sloan Kettering on an acting basis. "But I'm telling you, as someone who works with patients, and I've worked with patients throughout my entire career here, that working with industry has helped me save lives."
The Times and ProPublica asked to speak to Dr. Tabar and Dr. Brown about the critical remarks they made about the hospital's direction at the Oct. 1 meeting. Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.
Defining an institution's role
Founded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering was the first hospital in the country devoted exclusively to treating cancer. Its benefactors have included some of the wealthiest families in America, from the Astors and Rockefellers in its early years to the Kochs today.
It now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world's largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York's social calendar.
As a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.
But some on the hospital's board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center's chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were "lying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it."
By the time Dr. Varmus left to direct the National Cancer Institute in 2010, Memorial Sloan Kettering's board was looking for a leader who was as comfortable in a corporate board room as in the lab, according to several longtime current and former cancer center employees.
Dr. Thompson met that criteria. He headed the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, was the co-founder of a biotech start-up, Agios, and served on the board of Merck.
His early tenure was marred by controversy. In 2011 and 2012, he was sued by his former employers, the Abramson center and the University of Pennsylvania, which accused him of walking off with valuable research and using it to start Agios. At the time, Dr. Thompson denied wrongdoing and the suits were later settled for an undisclosed sum.
In 2012, Dr. Thompson hired Dr. Baselga to be the top physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Dr. Baselga, who had made his name as a key investigator of the breast cancer drug Herceptin, was also seen as having bridged the worlds of research and industry. Dr. DeAngelis, the hospital's acting physician-in-chief, said that under Dr. Baselga, clinical trials were approved more quickly, helping speed treatments to patients.
But several doctors who worked under Dr. Baselga said in interviews that he had an abrasive style and created a culture where ties to industry were not kept in check. Dr. Baselga has not responded to requests for comment.
In his years at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Dr. Baselga's personal financial conflicts were handled differently from those of other doctors, according to Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, who was chairman of the hospital's conflict-of-interest advisory committee through early 2016, when he left to become chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
Dr. Baselga's conflicts were not overseen by Dr. Hudis's committee, but by the audit committee of the hospital's board of directors. "I was told this was pretty standard for the highest level executives," said Dr. Hudis. "I didn't understand why any clinician would have separate rules from any other."
Mr. Morey said the hospital is evaluating its process for reviewing conflicts of interest, but that executives like Dr. Baselga had their financial relationships overseen by the board "to protect faculty from being put in a position of having to review their supervisor's potential conflicts."
Dr. Baselga is not the only leading researcher to have maintained extensive ties to the drug and health care companies -- as some also did under Dr. Varmus. Dr. Jedd Wolchok, a noted pioneer in immunotherapy, has financial relationships with more than 30 companies, according to recent disclosures. Dr. Charles L. Sawyers, another of the hospital's biggest names, has founded several cancer start-ups, one of which Memorial Sloan Kettering has invested in, and serves on the board of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis.
Ethicists and health experts say having leaders and researchers at nonprofit hospitals sit on corporate boards is especially problematic. When they serve on the board of a publicly traded company, they have a legal duty to the corporation and its shareholders, which can clash with their duty to their patients and primary employers. Those who sit on boards are often paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
"I don't think you can serve two masters," said Dr. Bernard Lo, who led an influential Institute of Medicine panel in 2009 that investigated financial conflicts in medicine. "The whole reason for being in the cancer care business is that you're trying to help people in need, and that's not at all the company's main purpose. It's to generate profits on their products."
A report in November in BioPharma Dive found that 12 of the 19 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies had at least one board member who also worked at a nonprofit health care institution. A 2014 study in JAMA found that about 40 percent of the largest publicly traded drug companies had a leader of an academic medical center on their boards.
Robert Benezra, who heads a lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering that focuses on how tumors grow, is the president, chief executive officer and a board member of AngioGenex, a tiny, publicly traded biotech that is developing drugs to treat cancer based on the discoveries made in his lab.
Though he takes no salary from AngioGenex, Dr. Benezra owns nearly nine percent of the company he helped found through stock or options, setting him up for a lucrative payday if the company is acquired or its drugs come to market.
In 2017, Dr. Benezra wrote AngioGenex shareholders that a recent policy and leadership change at the hospital "afforded me the freedom to assume a more active role in the company" and to recruit other Memorial Sloan Kettering scientists to work with the company.
Dr. Benezra said in a statement issued through the hospital, "While I do not work directly with patients, I hope that this important science can one day make an impact in the lives of cancer sufferers."
Mr. Morey said Dr. Benezra spends just 30 hours a year on business related to the publicly traded company. "We're talking about 45 minutes a week, which is less than what most people spend on Netflix in a night," Mr. Morey said.
Dr. DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief, said the high number of Memorial Sloan Kettering leaders who serve on corporate boards is reflective of their stature. "Maybe we should turn this around and say, we have more people on corporate boards because people value the opinions from our faculty," she said in an interview.
A staff in turmoil
Tensions among doctors at the hospital over conflicts of interests mounted through September. On Sept. 28, Colin Begg, the chairman of its department of epidemiology and biostatistics, wrote other department heads. "The key substantive issue is that the problems we face were not caused by failures to disclose conflicts. The problems were due to the conflicts themselves," he wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Times and ProPublica.
Referring to Dr. Thompson and Douglas A. Warner III, the outgoing chairman of the hospital's board of managers and overseers, who is known as Sandy, he said, "As far as I can tell neither Sandy nor Craig understand this very basic point. And if you don't recognize that a problem exists there is no chance you will solve it."
He also said, "Making billions is not our mission. M.S.K. is a nonprofit with a fundamentally social mission."
Dr. Begg declined to comment.
Shortly before the doctors met on Oct. 1, Dr. Thompson sounded a conciliatory note. "I want to start by apologizing to the medical staff on behalf of myself and the rest of senior management," he said, according to a draft transcript of the staff meeting. "The events of the last few weeks have not been handled as well as I would have liked."
Mr. Warner also addressed the doctors, informing them that the board was assessing whether Dr. Thompson should remain on Merck's board.
"Should Craig continue to sit on the Merck board? We have no policy on that," Mr. Warner said, according to the transcript, noting that Dr. Thompson's role on the board was initially seen as a "good thing" when he joined the hospital. "We need to step back from that now and ask ourselves whether that continues to be appropriate, whether it's appropriate in the future."
The next day, Oct. 2, Dr. Thompson announced that he was resigning from both the boards on which he served.
Requests to interview Dr. Thompson and Mr. Warner were declined. Instead the hospital arranged for reporters to speak to Dr. DeAngelis, who said she saw nothing wrong with the corporate ties that Dr. Thompson had earlier said were under review.
She downplayed the concerns voiced by Dr. Begg about the culture of the hospital. "He is a biostatistician. He does not work with patients. He works with data," she said, adding that he does not have "as full an understanding" about policies to prevent doctors with corporate ties from having an undue influence on clinical trials.
Dr. Thompson and two deputies, including Dr. DeAngelis, sent a note to hospital doctors on Dec. 20, warning them about this article. While it mentioned the ongoing review, it offered a full-throated defense of those serving on corporate boards.
"We expect the piece to question the ethics of some of our most accomplished researchers and clinicians. We want you to know that we reject these insinuations and we stand behind our faculty 100 percent."

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
I have always been a type-A person -- I like structure, planning and efficiency -- and while that has certainly helped me get a lot done, it has also sometimes pushed me to do things too quickly, to be impatient and to miss opportunities to learn through listening.
Yoga has been the counter to that motor -- even when I am upside-down in a headstand. The practice of yoga involves breathing, meditation and postures, sometimes physically challenging ones and sometimes poses that are challenging in their simplicity -- like just being still. I have been practicing yoga for nearly two decades, after being drawn to the physical comfort the stretches brought me as a teenager, and completed my 200-hour teaching training in 2011. In recent years, I have brought that practice to The New York Times, where I have worked for over four years and am now a director of communications.
As my fellow yoga teachers LaShone Wilson, Lara Atella and I recently wrote in our guide "How to Relax With Yoga," "while relaxed forms of yoga are helpful, improving your ability to return to a calm state after stress requires a well-toned nervous system that is resilient. Think of it this way: If we could spend all our time in a quiet, peaceful environment, then stress would not be an issue." In a previous guide, "Yoga to Make You Strong," I detailed some examples of physically strengthening postures that also work the mind.
At The Times, I am especially grateful to offer my colleagues an opportunity to stretch and relax in the stressful world of news. Self-care is important because it enables us to replenish our energy in order to be of service to others. We listen better, empathize more and focus.
An important aspect of yoga is the integration of all things (especially the body and mind). When we compartmentalize our lives, we can sometimes miss opportunities for connections and we may not process our pain and trauma. It's important to be kind to the entire being, all the time, so you can, in turn, be kind to others. As a yoga practitioner and teacher, I have sought to bring yoga into all parts of my life. I practice yoga at home with my 8-year-old son, Kai, and at work with my colleagues, but it is not always easy to prioritize self-care.
Even 15-minute stretch-and-chill sessions, as we call them here -- where we close our eyes, deepen our breath and melt our bodies into the ground -- can make a difference. (As it turns out, even a conference room floor can be relaxing with a bit of music, lavender oil and intention.) It's something you could try in your own office or work space and adjust as you see fit. (We adjusted, for example, from our initial 40-minute sessions to better fit our needs.)
At The Times, we also have a Slack channel dedicated to self-care where we share tips and encourage one another to engage in healing practices -- including heating pad recommendations and discussions about how to stay organized without overdoing it. This space has been a source of positive energy and has also enabled connections between colleagues of all walks of life, parts of the organization and physical locations.
And I'm certainly not the first or only person to do what I'm doing. Kelly Couturier, a yoga and mindfulness teacher and author of the Times guide "Yoga for Everyone," teaches a weekly class at The Times.
As we welcome the new year, I hope that you'll take some time to experience yoga, or do whatever it is that enables you to feel strong, safe, happy and healthy. If you have never practiced yoga before but would like to try it out, I'd encourage you to start with the 15-minute stretch-and-chill session detailed below, which is appropriate for all levels and requires no knowledge of yoga. (If you have any injuries or special conditions, consult with your doctor first.) Of course, listen to your body -- you should feel a challenge of the body and mind in yoga but no pain sensations. If you'd like, you may want to have two pillows and a scarf handy to help with some of the poses, but that is not necessary. A variety of playlists to accompany this practice can be found in the "How to Use Yoga to Destress" guide. And you can join us in practicing it together on Jan. 2 at 3 p.m. Eastern on Instagram and Twitter: @Ari_NYT.
______
Easy Seated Pose: Start in a comfortable cross-legged seated position. Allow your hands to rest on your legs. Drop your shoulders back and down. Lift the crown of the head up and straighten through the spine. Close the eyes.
Deep Breathing: Inhale through your nose and feel the air moving all the way down the spine and exhale out the nose all the way back up the spine. Continue with this deep breathing for three more breaths, inhaling and exhaling through the nose throughout this practice.
Give Thanks: On your next inhale, reach your arms overhead and when you exhale, bring your palms together in front of your chest in prayer hands. Close your eyes and pause for a moment to thank yourself for taking the time to practice.
Side Stretch: Take your right arm to the right and bend your body to the right. Your right forearm may reach the ground, or perhaps your fingers or hand reach the ground as you bend. Remember that all poses are equal. Lift your left arm up over your head for a gentle side twist. You can keep your eyes closed or open throughout your practice. Take three deep breaths in the pose. On your last exhale, reach both arms forward and move to the other side of your body, this time stretching your right side as you bend to the left. Take three breaths on this side before bringing both hands forward again. Press into all 10 fingertips in your gentle forward fold before slowly rolling back up to a comfortable seated position with a straight spine.
Shoulder Stretch: Bring your right hand to the ground to the right of you and bring your left hand to the crown of your head. Use your left hand to gently drop your head to the left, giving yourself a nice shoulder stretch on the right side. Breathe here for three breaths before releasing your left hand back down to your side. Switch sides, using your right hand to guide your head to the right and stretching through the left shoulder. Stay here for three breaths. Gently release the right hand. Return to a straight spine.
Hands and Knees: Inhale your arms overhead and exhale them in front of you, moving onto your hands and knees in what is also known as tabletop position, with your shoulder over your wrists and your hips over your knees. If your knees are sensitive, you can put a pillow underneath them.
Back Bending: Inhale to release your belly toward the floor, looking up and dropping your shoulders back for cow pose, and exhale to round through the back and drop the shoulders down for cat pose. Move through a few rounds of cat and cow poses. The exact poses aren't important -- what's more valuable is the connection between your mind and body.
Resting Pose: Inhale back into your tabletop position and exhale folding your body backward, resting your hips on your feet, with your hands outstretched in front of you. This position is also known as child's pose. You can put a pillow underneath your head or your hips if that feels more comfortable, or you can take your knees out wide and lay your body in front of you on the ground or on a pillow underneath your chest.
Massage: Bring your hands by your side and make them into little fists. Give yourself a massage up and down the back (avoiding the spine) and up and down the sides of your thighs.
A Deeper Shoulder Stretch: If your hands can easily clasp each other behind your back from child's pose, interlace them. If not, take a moment to get your scarf. Return to child's pose, again putting a pillow under your knees if you'd like. Hold the scarf between both of your hands with the scarf lying across your lower back. Gently lift your hips up into the sky and lift your arms away from your back toward the ceiling. You may slowly roll onto the crown of the head for a deeper stretch if it feels comfortable to do so. Alternatively, you can stay in child's pose with your head resting on your legs or you can softly turn your head and rest a cheek on the mat or pillow. This pose helps to reverse the experience of being hunched over a computer. You can straighten one wrist and then the other. Take three breaths in the pose. On your last exhale, relax your hips back down into child's pose and let your hands softly rest by your side. Again, you can put a pillow underneath your head or hips if that feels more comfortable, or you can take your knees out wide and lay your body in front of you on the ground or on a pillow underneath your chest. Take a few breaths in your resting child's pose before sitting up on your knees. If you have any knee tenderness or injuries, return to a comfortable cross-legged position.
Twisted Arms: For the next pose, take your right arm under your left in front of you and twist your arms like ropes, once or twice (only if you are able to do so easily). Keeping the spine straight, aim to lift the elbows up and drop the shoulders down for a shoulder stretch. Take three deep breaths here before releasing and switching your arms to place your left arm under your right, twisting your arms once or twice and breathing here for three breaths.
Wrist Stretch: Take a moment to shake out your arms and then straighten your right arm out in front of you. Bend your right hand so your palm is facing outward. Take your left hand and gently pull back the fingers on your right hand to give yourself a wrist stretch. Breathe in this pose for three breaths, going deeper as it feels comfortable for you or lessening the stretch if it feels like too much pressure. Release the right hand and switch to stretch the left hand in the same way for three breaths. Shake out your wrists.
Hug Yourself: Make your way onto your back and bring your knees into your chest. Grab your legs underneath the knees on top of the thighs or over the top of the calves (not grabbing the knees themselves) and give yourself a squeeze. And if you need a laugh -- this pose is also known as wind relieving pose!
Release the Back: Begin to rock gently back and forth to the left of the spine and to the right of the spine, and/or side to side.
Release the Low Back: Lying on your back, bring your feet in toward your hips and grab your feet from the inside, but keep them close to the body for an amended happy baby pose. Roll left and right on the low back and hips to release the body.
Twist It Out: Release your hands and drop your feet to the floor close to your hips. Make sure you have a pillow handy for the next pose, a spinal twist. Return to the back with your knees bent toward your body and stretch your arms outward on the floor like the letter T. Keep both knees together and drop them to the left of the body. They can go to the floor or to your pillow as you turn your head to look out over the right shoulder. Try to keep the left shoulder on the ground. Take three breaths here and then bring your knees back to center and drop them to the right again to the floor or to a pillow, twisting your head to the left, trying to keep the right shoulder to the ground. Take three breaths here. Bring your knees back into your chest for a final hug before we move into final relaxation.
Final Resting Pose: For the traditional version, lower the legs out in front of you, flop the feet outward, and release your hands by your side with your palms facing the ceiling. If you'd like, you can put a pillow underneath your upper back with your legs outstretched in front of you. Another option is to bring your feet together and put a pillow underneath each of your thighs for a full release of the low back. Whatever position you are in, close the eyes. Release your feet, ankles, calves, knees, hips, belly, chest, heavy and loose. Release your hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, heavy and loose. Release your neck, eyes, nose, ears and mouth, heavy and loose. Feel your entire body melting into the ground in savasana pose. Inhale to the word "let," and exhale to the word "go." Spend as long as you'd like in this pose.
Coming Back to the Senses: As you are ready, gently wiggle your fingers and toes. Inhale to stretch the arms above the head and the legs outward. Exhale to bring your knees into your center. Keeping your eyes closed, give yourself a hug and gently drop your body to the right. Carefully push yourself up to a comfortable seated position.
Sealing Your Practice: Inhale to reach your arms overhead and exhale to bring your palms together in front of your chest in prayer hands. Peace to the mind, body and spirit.
Happy New Year to you and yours, and namaste!
