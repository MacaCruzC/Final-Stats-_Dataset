Texto completo: Every February this nation celebrates Black History Month. This year, due to the leap year, we have an additional day to celebrate the accomplishments of Black Americans from the past and present. Black history is American history and it is shameful that so many Americans do not know the struggles and triumphs of some of this nation's greatest patriots.
In grade schools across the country, American school children learn of the bravery of Harriett Tubman, the wisdom of Frederick Douglass, the courage of Rosa Parks, and the oratory skills of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. These sanitized versions of American heroes seldom delve into the more nuanced accomplishments of these fighters. All four of these individuals fought the white supremacist foundation of this nation and are often presented alongside narratives which represent only a small fraction of their bravery in the face of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism. Most students never know the depths of Tubman's military strategies, Douglass' contributions to the women's suffrage movement, Parks' years as a rape investigator in the deep south, or King's more aggressive vision of attaining equity and freedom. These are merely four of the freedom fighters this nation has produced, and it is shameful that the thousands of Black patriots are often ignored or rendered a footnote to "American" history.
I use each February as a reminder of the gratitude 1 feel being a part of the rich and layered history of Blacks in America. I am so thankful my parents instilled a deep well of pride in me, my culture, and my history'. They and millions of other parents did this on a daily basis. Celebrating Black history isn't merely about looking back, it is also about looking forward to see where we as Blacks in America can contribute to furthering the legacy of our predecessors even as we face a new form of white supremacy, exclusion, and discrimination.
It is my hope that this February will be a time of reflection, but also a time for all of us to think of ways that we can continue to educate ourselves and move our great legacy forward. Some of the things I will do this Black History Month include researching and finding small organizations doing large work to help support future generations. I am inspired by the work of Nikita Stewart, a journalist at The New York Times, who has been writing and working with Troop 6000, the homeless Girl Scout Troop in NYC. She not only serves as a tangible role model to a new generation of girls, she is highlighting their excellence and their experiences as they become future leaders in this country.
Happy Black History Month to all. What will you do this month and for the remainder of this year to contribute to the rich legacy of our ancestors?

Texto completo: Headnote Filmmakers' Goal: 'Normalize Black Hair' and Continue Passage ofCROWN Act
Matthew A. Cherry's "Hair Love" Oscar win for Best Animated Short Film on Sunday Feb. 9 serves as a victory for African-Americans' unencumbered expression of their "natural hair."
Cherry's film features a young father who, in his wife's absence, does their daughter's hair for the very first time. He wears his own hair in locs while his child's hair remains untouched by chemicals - something Cherry suggested as intentional when he spoke to the Academy Award audience.
"'Hair Love' was done because we wanted to see more representation in animation," he said. "We wanted to normalize Black hair."
Cherry and producer Karen Rupert Toliver would be accompanied by co-directors Bruce A. Smith and Everett Downing, Jr., along with DeAndre Arnold, 18, who made national headlines after Barbers Hill High School near Houston banned him from his graduation for not cutting his locs.
New Jersey witnessed a similar case in 2018 when wrestler Andrew Johnson had his locs forcibly cut off before a match.
"There's a very important issue that's out there; it's the CROWN [Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair] Act and, if we can help to get this passed in all 50 states, it will help [prevent situations] like DeAndre's from happening again," Cherry said.
Last year, California became the first to pass the bill into law, ending workplace and school discrimination against African Americans who wear locs or other natural hairstyles. Both New York and New Jersey have since followed suit with the legislation's further pending in 22 other states.
Former presidential candidate Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana introduced the CROWN Act in Congress in December. The House bill has 41 co-sponsors but the corresponding Senate bill has just six. All 47 members of Congress who support it are Democrats.
Dove, the personal care brand owned by Unilever, has adopted the CROWN Act as a corporate cause. It used the "Hair Love" Oscar moment to promote a petition on Twitter to end hair discrimination nationwide. The National Urban League and Color of Change have also come aboard as supporters.
"I think we have such a complicated relationship with our hair and I think the more projects that come out that just normalize us loving it as it is, as it grows out of our head, the better," said Cherry who funded "Hair Love" through a Kickstarter campaign that exceeded $200,000. He has also turned it into an illustrated children's book which quickly became a New York Times best-seller.
Smith, the co-director whose credits include "The Proud Family," said he had a personal reason for pouring himself into the "Hair Love" project.
"Listen, I have a daughter, and I certainly had those lost days of trying to figure out how to do her hair and stuff like that, so I definitely related to the material right away," he said.
"I've never been able to do anything as personal," said Rupert Toliver, who also wears her hair in locs. "It really started to hit me recently about how proud I am."
Rupert Toliver serves as executive vice president of creatives at Sony Pictures Animation, which ran "Hair Love" at the beginning of its animated feature film "The Angry Birds Movie 2" in August.
Issa Rae provided the sole voiceover for "Hair Love." Other producers include: Jordan Peele, Gabrielle Union, Dwyane Wade and Peter Ramsey, who won the Oscar last year for Best Animated Feature as co-director of "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."
Ramsey summed up Cherry's impact with "Hair Love" at the Awards.
"It was based on something real, and he brought it to life," he said. "Now it's resonating with people all over the world."

Our View: Do Democrats understand what's at stake this year?

Texto completo: As the Democratic nomination process begins to sort itself out, all sides of this big-tent party need to calm down.
After essentially tying in Iowa and winning New Hampshire, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders now holds front-runner status to win the presidential nomination of a party to which he doesn't belong. The senator is fiercely independent, leftist and considers himself a democratic socialist. Middle-of-the-road and conservative Democrats worry that makes Sanders vulnerable come November.
Even as Sanders surges, though, it remains possible that a moderate Democrat still could win the nomination. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg might continue his improbable rise, or Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar's momentum from New Hampshire could keep her in the top tier - she finished third behind Sanders and Buttigieg.
Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who has run a terrible campaign, could see his fortunes revived in South Carolina, where many voters hold him in high regard.
In the wings is ex-New York City Mayor (and former Republican) Mike Bloomberg, who won't be on ballots until Super Tuesday in March. He is skipping the first four contests - a move that, if successful, could upend the traditional nominating process.
As he watches, Bloomberg is blanketing primary states with effective, smart TV ads designed to make voters familiar with his name. He essentially is buying his way into the race; as a billionaire, he can afford it.
For many progressives, the thought of what they view as an "establishment" Democrat winning is enough to make them stay home come November. Many find Bloomberg - whose stop-and-frisk policy policies as mayor are particularly troublesome - the most offensive.
It's possible that Democrats, rather than rallying to defeat a would-be authoritarian, will tear each other to shreds before the election. That must not happen.
The nominating process must play itself out, with Democratic candidates and their supporters resolved to unify for November. Forget about trying to figure out who might be most electable. Primary voters can't predict what voters will want come November. Democrats must vote their hearts, be grown-ups if their candidate loses and resolve together to make whoever emerges a winner.
Former Missouri Secretary of State and military veteran Jason Kander had this advice for voters on Twitter: "Stop asking who can beat Trump and start asking: 'If I could make one of these people President tomorrow, who would I pick?' If we all do that, the man or woman we nominate will also be the one who - with our help - has the best chance to beat Trump."
No one is making the stakes clearer than former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh, a conservative Republican who just dropped his own quixotic campaign against Trump for his party's nomination.
"I would rather have ... a socialist in the White House than a dictator, than a king, than Donald Trump," wrote Walsh on Twitter last week.
Unlike too many actual Democrats, Walsh has the good sense to say he will vote for any Democrat over Trump. He wrote in the Washington Post that, "Challenging Trump for the GOP nomination taught me my party is a cult. Real conservatives think for themselves. Trump Republicans have been brainwashed."
It's ironic that a Republican stalwart can make the case for any Democratic nominee better than Democrats are doing themselves, but such is the case in the upside-down world of U.S. politics today. Here are a few reminders why Walsh is correct.
Just this week, Trump's Justice Department asked a federal judge to revise the proposed prison sentence for longtime Trump friend Roger Stone - a move that caused four prosecutors to quit the case in protest. The request came after a Trump tweet decrying the length of the original requested sentence.
The president also has been swift to punish those who testified against him during his House impeachment hearing, pushing Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman out of White House duty and removing an ambassador. Most recently, Trump suggested the military should discipline Vindman. He's just getting started.
The message is clear, writes Peter Baker in the New York Times: "In the days since he was acquitted in a Senate trial, an aggrieved and unbound president has sought to even the scales as he sees it."
The drive for revenge will not end anytime soon - unless, that is, the American people vote Trump out of office. Joe Walsh gets it. If only Democrats did.

Wordplay 2.0, shorter and tweaked; ‘Significant Other’ to open at MJTC

Texto completo: In January, the Loft announced four authors who will appear in this year’s Wordplay festival, set for Saturday, May 9. On Tuesday afternoon, it revealed all the rest – an avalanche of nearly 100 authors including more big names.
Add these to your list of must-sees: cookbook author Alison Roman; novelists Charles Yu and Peter Geye; nonfiction writers Michael Ian Black, Kao Kalia Yang. Nicholas Kristof and Scott Pelley; poets Mark Doty and Danez Smith.
The only author from last year who will return is Laila Lalami, because she has a new book.
We expected a fresh crop of authors, but the festival will change in other ways, too. Which isn’t surprising, since this is only its second year. We spoke with festival founder Steph Opitz about the changes and the thinking behind them.
This year’s Wordplay will be one day, not two. Steph said: “Previously I worked on the Texas book festival, which needs to be two days because of how many people come to it. I was used to a two-day structure. But until we get to be the size that demands two days, one is more fun, easier, and not competing directly with Mother’s Day [May 10]. The size we are now – 10,000 people plus – feels great for one day. If we get to 30,000, our goal in five years, we’ll look at doing two days again.
“The day will be an hour longer than last year. We’ll have more sessions throughout the day, and another outdoor stage. Some of the stages had down times last year, a half-hour or an hour between sessions. We won’t do that this year.”
Prices will go up. Last year’s wristband was $10. This year’s is $17 ($20 at the gate). Last year’s VIP access was $250. This year, there’s a Friend of the Festival wristband for $500. Steph said: “There were two different ticketing levels last year. $10 got you into the street festival, $40 into [author sessions at] the Guthrie. We decided to split the difference to $17, which is all-inclusive. You get into every author session. And you still get a $5 book voucher.
“Last year’s $250 VIP ticket gave you access to certain things and not others. We wanted to give people what they were requesting. The $500 is VIP reserved seating at everything, and admission to a VIP party with authors on Friday.
“We’re definitely trying to support the longevity of the festival. If we charged the actual price, tickets would be $80. Sponsorships help, but we need to charge something. And we really want people to commit to the festival – to put it on their calendar and plan for it.”
Last year’s opening night party was a concert at First Avenue. This year it’s a carnival at Open Book. Steph said: “We’re calling it Play with Words. It’s going to be a big party at Open Book, on all three floors, with a lot of carnival-like things going on. Activities like fishing for books, fortune-telling and impromptu readings. Authors will be there.”
(And we couldn’t resist asking:) Who’s the author you’re most looking forward to seeing? Steph said: “I’m really excited about Clare Beams. She’s coming to the festival with a debut novel, ‘The Illness Lesson.’ She had a collection of short stories that came out last year that I fell in love with. She was definitely among the first people I booked. She’ll be somebody not everyone will have heard of, but after, they’ll want to keep an eye on her.
“Of course it’s exciting to have big names – Steve Inskeep, Alison Roman, Natalie Diaz, Lily King – but I love the idea that somebody will come to the festival, like Clare Beams or Gabriel Bump, for their first book, and maybe by the end of the year they’ll win a National Book Award or something like that.
“When I was running the Texas Book Festival, I remember telling everyone there, ‘You’ve got to go see this author Marlon James. He’s going to be amazing.’ A year later, he won the Man Booker Prize.”
Registration for Wordplay 2020 will open to Loft members on Wednesday, March 18, at 10 a.m. and to the general public on Thursday, March 19, at 10 a.m. See the complete author line-up here.
The picks
Tonight (Thursday, Feb. 13) at Honey: Breaking Down, Breaking Up – A Poetry Show of Break-up Poems. Not in love with Valentine’s Day? Presented by Cracked Walnut, hosted by Erin Murphy, the evening will feature area poets and an open mic, in case you’ve penned a break-up poem you want to share. Too bad Minneapolis doesn’t have a club called The Bitter End. 7-9 p.m., pay-what-you-want.
Friday at the O’Shaughnessy: Kevin Kling & Friends: “The Love Show: Skyway to Heaven.” In love with Valentine’s Day? Settle in for stories by the exceptional Kevin Kling and music by Marc Anderson, Dan Chouinard, Bradley Greenwald, Prudence Johnson, Simone Perrin, Claudia Schmidt and Dane Stauffer. This is a new edition of Kling’s perennially popular V-Day blast – an evening meant for sweethearts. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25-29).
Friday and Saturday at the Cabooze: 28th Annual Songs of Freedom – Bob Marley Remembered. Nothing warms the heart and soul like reggae. (Maybe that’s why the Children’s Theatre scheduled “Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds” for January and February.) An Arctic front makes Marley’s music even more therapeutic. This is the Reggae king’s 75th birthday year, and the Cabooze will celebrate with the International Reggae All-Stars, New Primitives and Innocent Reggae Band. 18+. Doors at 8 p.m., music at 9:30. FMI and tickets ($12 advance, $16 door).
Saturday at the Minnesota History Center: Book launch for Anton Treuer’s “The Language Warrior’s Manifesto: How to Keep Our Languages Alive No Matter the Odds.” Professor of Ojibwe at Bemidji State University, author of several books including “Everything You Wanted to Know about Indians But Were Afraid to Ask,” Treuer has fought for years to revitalize his tribal language. (He learned it as an adult.) His latest book is a compelling and clearly written argument for why this matters and how it can be done. Here’s a series of short videos featuring Treuer that were produced recently for Twin Cities PBS. (The last is “Cultural Conversations: The Importance of Language,” if you want to start there.) Saturday is the History Center’s Dakota & Ojibwe Language Family Day. Treuer’s talk is at 10 a.m. and free. Museum admission is required for the family-friendly language activities scheduled for noon-3 p.m. FMI.
Opens Saturday at the Minnesota Jewish Theatre Company: “Significant Other.” Jordan (Bradley Hildebrandt) is a young Jewish man living in New York. Surrounded by his close group of female BFFs, his social life is full. Then they start getting married, and what about him? Joshua Harmon’s play won raves for its Off-Broadway premiere in 2015 and was included in the New York Times’ top 10 productions of the year. Hayley Finn is the director; the cast also includes Chloe Armao, Olivia Wilusz, Audrey Park, Nancy Marvy, Paul LaNave and Tony Larkin. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($23-38).
Sunday at the Textile Center: Rimon Artist Salon Series: “Handed Down.” Visual artists Robyn Awend, Beth Barron and Rachel Breen will show and discuss newly commissioned pieces informed by lineage, tradition, memories and inherited values. What we have been given by our past, and what we are handing down to those who come after us? Their work incorporates salvaged material scraps, poetic fragments, antique textiles, and reclaimed photographs – recycling as a practice. This is the 13th season of “one of the leading series of Jewish events in the country.” 2 p.m. FMI and tickets ($12; $6 ages 36 and under).

Originally a soul group in Plainfield, New Jersey in the late '50s, The Parliaments had a hit with "(I Wanna) Testify" in 1967. But they shifted to playing a style of music similar to rock 'n' roll artists Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa — combined with R&B groups Sly and the Family Stone and James Brown — and became Parliament Funkadelic.
Clinton took on an eccentric personality similar to jazz musician Sun Ra of being from outer space, complete with dreadlocks, and the band also created unique personalities and stage costumes of their own. A stage full of musicians, backup dancers and vocalists along with a spaceship became part of their live shows.
"Beavis and Butthead" and "King of the Hill" animator and writer Mike Judge featured an episode on Clinton during the second season of his Cinemax-animated music-biopic series "Tales From the Tour Bus." Clinton openly discussed his wild stage shows, his struggles with drug addiction and the origin story of his popular song "Atomic Dog."
In 2018, Clinton said he would retire from touring but has continued to perform beyond his original target date of last year.
George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, Saturday, 7:30 p.m., Riverside County Fair & National Date Festival, 82-503 Highway 111, Indio. $10 for adults, $9 for seniors, $8 for youth, $8 for group tickets and bus tours (minimum of 25). 800-811-FAIR
Best Bets
Friday-Saturday Sinatra: Bob Anderson, who is noted as the No. 1 celebrity impersonator in the world by VH1 and People Magazine, is a master of spot-on impressions. He'll bring his show "Frank - The Man...The Music," honoring the musical legacy of Frank Sinatra and his contribution to the Great American Songbook, to the McCallum Theatre this weekend.
One of Anderson's famous stories is that he snuck into a dress rehearsal of Nancy Sinatra's two-week run of shows at Sahara's Congo Room in Las Vegas in 1973. Her opening act, the Everly Brothers, got into an argument and Anderson stepped in and told the musical conductor he was a singer. The conductor handed him a microphone to prove himself and he replaced the Everly Brothers for the entire two weeks.
"Frank - The Man...The Music," Friday, 8 p.m., Saturday, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., McCallum Theatre, 73-000 Fred Waring Dr., Palm Desert. $38 to $98. 760-340-2787
Friday Title: If you combined Janis Joplin, Florence Welch and Courtney Barnett, you'd have Lauren Ruth Ward. She's won accolades from Noisey, Consequence of Sound and the Los Angeles Times as she's played to sold-out crowds in the U.S. and overseas.
She's performed with Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Shirley Manson of Garbage and country star Keith Urban.
Lauren Ruth Ward, 7 p.m., Friday, Pappy and Harriet's, 53-688 Pioneertown Rd., Pioneertown. $16. 760-365-5956
Saturday R&B: Charlie Wilson, along with his two brothers Charlie and Ronnie, rose to fame as The Gap Band during the '70s and '80s, playing a form of R&B mixed with funk music. They're most remembered for their 1982 song "You Dropped a Bomb on Me," which is played at sporting events.
The Gap Band retired in 2010, but Wilson had started a solo career in the early '90s that took off in 2000. He has 10 No. 1 singles and 13 Grammy Award nominations, and he released his New York Times bestselling memoir "I Am Charlie Wilson" in 2015.
Charlie Wilson, Saturday, 8 p.m., Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, 84-245 Indio Springs Pkwy., Indio. $49 to $89. 760-342-5000
Saturday Tribute band: Black Crystal Wolf Kids aren't just an indie-rock tribute band. They're an over-the-top indie-rock tribute band covering songs from LCD Soundsystem and The Killers to Lizzo and Billie Eilish. Members of Cage the Elephant and Lord Huron have even sat in with the Los Angeles band during performances.
Also on the bill is the Queen of the High Desert, Jesika von Rabbit, playing her blend of calypso, sci-fi, psychedelic, rock, electro and funk
Black Crystal Wolf Kids, Saturday, 8:30 p.m., The Alibi Palm Springs, 369 N. Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs. $15. 760-656-1525

Texto completo: "I didn't want them to have the body or looks of a stereotype and I didn't want a beautiful chorus."
Ron Celona
on casting 'Ballroom'
A musical premiered on Broadway in 1978 called "Ballroom," starring Dorothy Loudon and Vincent Gardenia. It was directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett, who had just come off a wave of success after "A Chorus Line."
Set in New York, "Ballroom" follows a widow named Bea who is convinced by her friend Angie to start experiencing the highs of life again at the Stardust Ballroom, where many escape on the weekend and let loose dancing to cha-cha, merengue and waltz. Bea agrees and ends up meeting a man named Al, who she falls for.
Even though Bennett won a Tony Award for the choreography, the show didn't draw audiences and closed after a few months. The only memory of "Ballroom" is the song "Fifty Percent," which is popular in cabaret.
But CVRep in Cathedral City is out to change that. The 11-year-old theater company bought the rights to the original musical, rewrote the script and worked with the original composer Billy Goldenberg and original lyricist Alan Bergman on the music.
According to CVRep's founding Artistic Director Ron Celona, this is the biggest production the theater has taken on, costing the small company $225,000 that has to be recouped through ticket sales. The show comprises a cast of 26 people, nine musicians and several stagehands.
"I promised my board this won't become a habit, and this is an opportunity," Celona told The Desert Sun. "I have to commend my board for that. They really supported the dream of this project and understood that, but the size of this production is risky."
It all started with 'Fifty Percent' Celona had interest in reviving "Ballroom" after seeing Lucie Arnaz perform "Fifty Percent" at local photographer Michael Childers' "One Night Only" fundraiser for the Barbara Sinatra Center for Abused Children at the McCallum Theatre last May. A fan of the 1975 TV movie "Queen of the Stardust Ballroom" starring Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning, which the musical adaptation is based on, Celona wondered, "Whatever happened to 'Ballroom?'"
"I saw that movie when I was a little kid and the movie also had music in it. I remember it being a sentimental, wonderful, warm, fuzzy experience that was a big sensation," Celona said.
Through a mutual friend in Indian Wells, Celona made contact with Goldenberg, the original composer, last June. Celona met with the 84-year old in a coffee shop in New York City to find out what went wrong with the original Broadway production, and to see if there was any way for CVRep to revive it.
"(Director) Michael Bennett basically came off 'A Chorus Line' as a huge success and bought the rights to the show. He made it a dance show," Celona said. "The story line got minimized. There were these big, flashy, beautiful dance production numbers done by two band singers that had no relationship to the people in the story. I think that was a major flaw in the original. There wasn't enough substance and the audience didn't have a relationship with the characters."
Goldenberg told The Desert Sun it was a "huge disappointment" to him, as well as to the original lyricists.
"It was nowhere near the version we expected," Goldenberg said. "Through the years, the only script that has been sent to theaters is the original script, so we never had a chance to see it in its full-blown form, and (writer Jerome Kass) brewed on this script since we did it on Broadway and unfortunately passed away."
Film producer John Breglio, who wrote the book "I Wanna Be a Producer: How to Make a Killing on Broadway...or Get Killed," said during a 2016 interview that collaboration among creatives behind the show "failed."
"The collaboration among the writer, the composer, the lyricist and Michael (Bennett) never gelled," said Breglio, who was put in charge of Bennett's estate after his death in 1987, according to the New York Times. "Marilyn Bergman, who was a great Academy Award lyricist started being a mother figure to Michael and ended up despising him. Michael didn't respect anybody working on the show because they didn't do what he to do. Jerome Kass was running the book and it was his story, and he was upset because Michael wanted more humor in the piece and Jerome didn't want any humor, so Michael brought in (director) Mike Nichols to write some stuff. It just got worse and worse."
But before CVRep could move ahead with a new version, they had to attain the rights, which were owned by Samuel French, Inc., a publisher of plays. Goldenberg didn't think it would be possible, but Celona knew Samuel French had been purchased by Concord Music, owned by composer and theater director Andrew Lloyd Weber, in 2018.
Goldenberg attained the rights last June from Kass' widow, the Michael Bennett estate and Concord Music, Celona said. It required a large deposit as insurance until final box office figures are reported, but Celona would not disclose the cost of the deposit.
Concord Music did not respond to The Desert Sun's requests for comment.
"They looked at the history of how many people are producing Ballroom, next to zero. No one wants to do it because it's a problem script," Celona said. "If I can make it a better script and musical the way they see it as, it then becomes a marketable product to sell to regional theaters all over the world and it makes money,"
'I wanted to make this feel like real life' Once they attained the rights to the musical, CVRep musical director Scott Storr, Bergman and Goldenberg started collaborating on new songs for the production.
But casting "Ballroom" was difficult because it requires older actors and actresses who can sing and dance, as well as look and act like working-class people. Celona searched for people in Los Angeles and New York.
"I didn't want them to have the body or looks of a stereotype and I didn't want a beautiful chorus. That's not what this is show should be in my head and I wanted to make this feel like real life," Celona said.
Actress, singer and dancer Melodie Wolford, who has also been in a production of "La Cage aux Folles" and had roles on the TV shows "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," "The Perfect Murder" and "New Amsterdam," was cast as Bea.
Broadway veteran Bill Nolte, who has performed in productions of "Cats," the early '90s revival of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," "La Cage aux Folles," "1776" and "The Producers," was cast as Al, Bea's love interest.
Like Celona, Nolte is familiar with the story and saw it on Broadway in 1979. He jumped at the chance to play the male lead because of the music and the song "Fifty Percent."
"'Fifty Percent' became an anthem for women in New York because it's so well written," Nolte said. "I always wondered why 'Ballroom' didn't fly, and this is a chance to tweak it and see if we can find what will make it fly. I think we're off to a good start. The fact that we're working with the actual living composer and lyricist is exciting."
Playing Al also comes with the challenge of the character's secret. Nolte described the role as "problematic," and one that starts off as awkward.
"He doesn't really dance with anyone because he can't find a partner," Nolte said. "He's a mailman from the Bronx who is rather ordinary, and when he meets Bea and she finally agrees to dance with them, they discover they're both kind of awkward in this Stardust Ballroom and together they make a good team."
Wolford said "Ballroom" is her dream role. She listened to the Broadway recording with friends while attending University of Southern Mississippi 40 years ago and proclaimed she would one day play the role of Bea on Broadway.
But, as a singer, it has come with a challenge. "(Original cast member) Dorothy Loudon, who was spectacular, had five songs. I have 10 songs. I'm a soprano and this is not a soprano role. It's been a challenge, but I'm working very hard," Wolford said.
The cast also includes Teri Ralston, one of the original stars of the Broadway musical "Company," playing the role of Angie, a waitress and friend to Bea.

Is China giving us all facts related to coronavirus?

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2.5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I.
Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: "Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1% every day since Jan. 30. 'This magical virus is very good at math!' I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime's rule. ... I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line."
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials are lying, but perhaps they're telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what's going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what's really happening.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
It's a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities' position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there's no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there's no way for the people at the top to know whether they're being told the truth.
Healthy systems of organization ensure that bad news can always flow from the bottom to the top. Systems that don't do this become increasingly disconnected from reality and unstable.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I'd be worried.
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get. Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can't always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they're doing, it looks like they're pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China's already sluggish economy, suggests something serious. At the same time though, China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don't need the help, or because they have secrets they'd rather keep? For now, there's no way to know.
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we'll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let's hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won't be too expensive.

Texto completo: When conservative ringmaster Matt Schlapp officially didn’t invite Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to his annual ultra-right confab — the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) — eye-rolling was suddenly trending.
And rather than simply not inviting Romney, Schlapp tweeted a photo of the senator looking like a corpse-eating zombie along with the CPAC logo and the words: “Not invited: Mitt Romney.”
Ostensibly, Schlapp was concerned that Romney might be subjected to physical violence at the conference because of his solitary Republican vote to convict President Donald Trump on one of two charges, abuse of power, in the impeachment trial. This concern could have remained buried in Schlapp’s furrowed brow but for his apparent determination to say it aloud in the context of a mean-spirited noninvitation.
It’s not for nothing that Schlapp has seen his lobbying and public relations firm, Cove Strategies, win massive earnings in the Trump era. He boasted to The New York Times that lobbying revenues increased from $600,000 in 2015 to more than $1 million in 2017, and that “strategic communications” revenues were even higher. In the swampiest of swamps, “strategic communications” obviously pays.
What’s clear, of course, is that Schlapp was never going to invite Romney to CPAC. Not only has Schlapp been a Trump man since Day One, as he told me back in 2017, but he also sensed at the onset that Trump would win.
Proactively snubbing Romney was a win-win for Schlapp that showcased his messaging skills and, inadvertently, revealed his character. When a man is down, by all means kick the daylights out of him. In so doing, Schlapp ingratiated himself to his base, received bounteous media attention, and maybe even earned a little grace for his wife Mercedes “Mercy” Schlapp.
Mercy was White House director of strategic communications until July when she joined Trump’s reelection campaign. Meanwhile, the past overlap of Schlapp’s CPAC sponsors and his clients — including Comcast, Altria and the Motion Picture Association of America — has not gone unnoticed by a contingent of critics who refer to the conference as “The Matt and Mercy Show.”
Schlapp knows as well as anyone that Romney is an honorable man and is surely believable when he says his Senate vote was a matter of principle and not, as some have suggested, revenge. What does Romney really get out of being an outlier — other than the respect of liberals who would admire Hannibal Lecter if he feasted on Republicans?
Poor Romney — right as rain, yet nobody can spare an umbrella.
An argument could be made that Schlapp really was concerned about violence, but what kind of show is he directing? At the 2018 CPAC, conservative columnist Mona Charen had to be escorted out by security when she was booed for scolding Republicans for not condemning Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct. But more likely, such alleged fears were an excuse rather than a reason to justify his tweet.
By essentially encouraging the mob, Schlapp made his bed on the wrong side of conservative principles and, ultimately, of history. Luckily for him, the Romney we both know would probably accept an apology.

Texto completo: Monday night, members of Grandview United Methodist Church voted 174 to 5, with two abstentions, to begin disaffiliation talks with the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference of The United Methodist Church.
The church, the first United Methodist Church in Lancaster County to declare itself open and affirming, had been contemplating such a move since February 2019 when delegates at General Conference voted to impose enhanced sanctions on member churches if they ordained LGBTQ pastors or performed same-sex marriages.
The Rev. Andrea Brown, the church’s lead pastor, said the decision does not change the church’s current status but was taken as a precaution as the denomination prepares to vote on the “Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation,” which likely would split the denomination. That plan is expected to be voted on at the denomination’s General Conference in Minneapolis in May.
“The congregation plans to vote again in June, after we see what General Conference does,” Brown said in an interview on Tuesday. “The results of this vote won’t be finalized until at least mid-June. So for now, we remain Grandview United Methodist Church, even as we continue to make our congregation more just.”
Grandview’s vote comes nearly one year after the denomination’s Judicial Council ruled that legislation adopted by the General Conference providing a path for churches to leave the denomination was constitutional. The Taylor Disaffiliation Petition created a process for exit that took effect immediately.
The Taylor plan amended an existing rule stating that the local church holds in trust property for the annual conference.
“So our property is not really our own property — not just the building but all of our assets are owned by the conference,” Brown said in a meeting ahead of her congregation’s vote. “The Taylor plan gives rules for how you break out of that if you have a disagreement of conscience.”
Although the Taylor plan makes it easier for churches to retain property and other assets, congregations still would have a hefty bill to pay for insurance and pensions.
Brown said in Grandview’s case that could cost as much as $700,000.
Church leaders approve proposal that could split the United Methodist Church
But she believes the Taylor plan may be amended at the General Conference to lessen the burden on churches that opt to leave the denomination.
“What I think will happen in May is there will be an even greater loosening of the Trust clause, but we don’t know,” she explained in a meeting with LNP prior to the vote. “So in the meantime, we know we may need to leave because we’re too much in conflict with the existing rules of the church.”
On Tuesday, Brown said in addition to the protocol, there are a number of other proposals.
“And it’s possible the denomination won’t pass anything, which will leave it as a traditional denomination.
“It’s virtually certain the some traditionalists will split off from the United Methodist Church, but it is also quite likely that some traditionalists will remain in the United Methodist Church, and some discrimination against LGBTQ people will continue within it.
“Therefore, some churches that want an end to such discrimination may also split off. Just as the denomination’s policy forbids discrimination against female clergy, Grandview United Methodist Church believes it is time, and long past time, to end discrimination against policies that discriminate against LGBTQ people.”
Regarding a name for a new denomination, Brown said it’s too early to say what that could be.
“There’s a gathering in Dallas in March that may clarify that," she said.
As for this controversy, Brown said, it’s healthy to have this conversation.
“It will make us a better congregation," Brown said.
The Rev. Darryl Stephens is director of United Methodist studies at the Lancaster Theological Seminary and worships at Grandview United Methodist Church. He said he is relieved that the congregation has freed itself to live out its mission.
“It has chosen debt over discrimination,” he said. “It will cost the church over half a million dollars to disaffiliate from the denomination. The congregation has chosen short-term financial debt over long-term moral debt.”
Stephens said the important part of what is next is that the congregation is continuing to fulfill its mission to be an instrument of healing and grace.
“‘To make gentle a bruised world’ has been the congregational tag line for more than 20 years,” he said.
Stephens is the author of several books, including “Out of Exodus: A Journey of Open and Affirming Ministry,” which he said is the witness of the Grandview United Methodist Church congregation, with personal testimonies, sermons and reflections on what it means to be Christian in the world.
The book, he said, tells through these personal testimonies the history of how the congregation came to be a reconciling congregation.
“Last night’s vote is consistent with what this congregation has been doing for the past 15 years…. Every congregation is unique, they have different personalities, like individuals," Stephens said.
The Rev. Peggy Johnson, bishop of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church, said Tuesday evening that she celebrates Grandview’s “diverse and mission heart.”
“I’ve been here 12 years," Johnson said. "I know this church. I’ve been on the journey with them in discussions about sexuality. I understand their perspective, that this is a justice issue.”
But Johnson emphasized “that this is not a done deal. This is preliminary… It’s not like they are leaving, goodbye. It’s only step one.”
Johnson also noted the larger uncertainties surrounding the United Methodist Church's Feb. 2019 vote to strengthen its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy. The New York Times reported on several voting irregularities from the Feb. 2019 vote, including votes by ineligible individuals. The church's judicial council is currently reviewing the matter.
“If the Judicial Council, which is like our Supreme Court, finds the disaffiliation vote is null and void, out of order, it can’t be done," Johnson said. "But if they say okay, then we go forward.”
Johnson said she was hoping Grandview would not have voted Monday night, because it would be better to wait to see if it can be consummated.
“I respect their integrity, their commitment to justice and inclusivity,” she said. “But the final decision rests with the Judicial Council the end of April.”

Texto completo: On Friday Feb. 21, the Midtown Scholar Bookstore in Harrisburg will host former advisor to President Obama, New York Times bestselling author of “Yes We (Still) Can,” and cohost of the political podcast “Pod Save America,” Dan Pfeiffer to present his latest book “Un-Trumping America: A Plan to Make American A Democracy Again.”
Pfeiffer will be interviewed on stage by civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson – author of “On the Other Side of Freedom: A Case for Hope,” a prominent voice in the Black Lives Matter Movement and co-founder of Campaign Zero – a platform dedicated to ending police violence in America. McKesson famously quit his job as educator to join the protests after the Ferguson riots in 2014.
The discussion will likely focus on Pfeiffer’s book “Un-Trumping America,” in which Pfeiffer looks at the 2020 election and beyond as well as presents plans to fix the democratic process, as well as insights from Mckesson on equality and justice. Both Pfeiffer and Mckesson will be available to sign copies of their books.
A limited amount of standing-room-only tickets are available for $30. The ticket includes a copy of Pfeiffer’s “Un-Trumping America.”

Rethinking Drag Queen Story Hour

Texto completo: Librarians love Drag Queen Story Hour. Many parents don't.
The concept of having drag queens read to children has the backing of the American Library Association, the oldest and largest library association in the world. Yet the five-year-old trend has set off controversies in local libraries across the United States, and some families feel as if their opinions on the subject don't matter.
A Missouri lawmaker wants to put parents back in the picture.
The "Parental Oversight of Public Libraries Act," a bill introduced last month by state Rep. Ben Baker, would require each library in Missouri to have "a parental library review board" made up of five adults in the community. The purpose of the board would be to "determine whether any sexual material provided to the public by the public library is age-inappropriate sexual material."
"The most support I have received has been from parents who are concerned about the well-being of their children, as well as local government officials who have been ignored when they speak out against certain content and events that have been allowed in our libraries," Baker said in an email.
Critics have focused on a section at the end of the bill, which specifies that those who defy it could be subject to "a fine of not more than five hundred dollars" or "imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year."
A year in jail for trying to sneak some mature content into the children's section of a library sounds severe. But, according to Baker, the penalty is the same as the one already in place for librarians who willfully refuse to implement filtering software on library computers.
"I don't foresee anyone being jailed for noncompliance," he said. "I think it is appropriate to have a strong penalty for anyone who would willfully provide obscene or objectionable sexual materials to children."
Why should librarians find themselves railing against what concerned members of the community decide is appropriate for children? They see it as a form of censorship.
"We were, of course, dismayed and unhappy to see a bill that would essentially put librarians in jail for sharing materials that are constitutionally protected and age-appropriate except in the eyes of five people," said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.
Drag queens, equally up in arms, are planning a protest of the bill next month.
But the bill has its supporters, who appreciate its goal: to protect children. A parental review board could flag books such as Make Trouble by Cecile Richards, the former Planned Parenthood CEO who wrote the book, in part, "to talk about the reproductive system and sex education."
With these kinds of topics in the balance, Baker insists that the legislation is about caution, not censorship.
"This would not ban books or censor literature," he told the New York Times. "It would simply give an opportunity for the community to weigh in on what should be available to children in a taxpayer-funded space."

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City currently surging to top-tier status among the Democratic presidential primary candidates, has found something new to spend his money on. According to the New York Times, the diminutive sugar hater “has contracted some of the biggest meme-makers on the internet to post sponsored content on Instagram promoting his presidential campaign.” It’s an abundantly silly story, filled with nonsense words and phrases such as “primary liaison with the meme community,” “grapejuiceboys,” and “a powerful force in the influencer economy.”
Stupid neologisms aside, employing people among the hoi polloi to spread positive words about you to the great unwashed is a time-honored tradition among the rich. In medieval England, criers (or “bellmen”) were tasked with spreading word of royal proclamations. “Don’t shoot the messenger” carried the force of law.
The town crier draws on an even earlier method of promulgation, the bardic tradition. Lords across Europe and beyond paid bards to tell great tales and poems of their goodness and mercy or to sing songs of their mighty victories and military prowess. Think Paul Bettany’s medieval hype-man character of Geoffrey Chaucer in A Knight’s Tale or the minstrel Jaskier singing the exploits of Geralt of Rivia in Netflix’s The Witcher.
These bards were also routinely employed to slander opposing lords and patrons. During the early 17th century, following the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the petty, polemical back-and-forth between Irish court bards escalated to a yearslong controversy known as “the Contention of the Bards,” or Iomarbhágh na bhFileadh, in Irish. (The disputation and its players are too intricate to recount here, but imagine an ancestral family feud in the form of a Gaelic rap battle.)
Kings and patrons also hired historians and men of letters to write hagiographic histories favorable to their rule or lineage. Niccolo Machiavelli, for instance, wrote his Florentine Histories at the behest of Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici, who commissioned the work and expected an account favorable of his family’s deeds. As such, Machiavelli was forced to employ a cunning rhetorical strategy to critique the family that had deprived his native city of its liberty, damning with faint praise and putting condemnations into others’ mouths and contexts. Sure beats memes.

Breaking: Men and women still different

Texto completo: Fifty years of the sexual revolution and four waves of feminism have succeeded in increasing women's workforce participation and average educational attainment. However, it still hasn't gotten men to, just once, wipe down the kitchen counters before going to bed.
That's the repeated social science finding lamented across academia and the media — and reinforced by two recent studies.
Even though they're "open-minded" and use woke "pronouns," young people, the New York Times laments, "are holding on to traditional views about who does what at home."
Gallup, in a recent survey, interviewed couples who were either married or shacking up and asked who did more of the given chores. It turns out that the younger, more feminist generation doesn't divide chores evenly. In fact, a young male millennial or Gen Zer living with his girlfriend or wife is not significantly more likely than a baby-boom man to do most of the laundry, child care, or dishwashing. Cooking is the only area where the 18-34 crowd is significantly more egalitarian than the older folks.
Part of the story is that many couples still have the old-fashioned economic arrangement in which the man does the work that makes money while the woman does the work that keeps the house in order. Dual-income families are more likely (47%) to split child care evenly than to leave it mostly up to the woman (44%). Where there's a sole breadwinner, on the other hand, women do most of the child-raising in 61% of the homes, according to Gallup.
This division of labor makes sense. It's also true that men are more likely than women to want to work full-time jobs outside of the home. Even in our "open-minded" times, it seems that preference rather than "tradition" determines the shape of household life in 2020.
One recent survey of high-school seniors in the journal Sociological Science found that the "husband-as-earner/wife-as-homemaker arrangement remained most desired." A massive study of 80,000 individuals published in 2018 found, in the words of Scientific American, that "greater national wealth and gender equality are tied to bigger differences in preferences between men and women rather than to stronger similarities."
The persistence of gender roles is very upsetting to the academics and reporters who have come across it.
"Surprisingly, young couples today are not that much more egalitarian in dividing household chores than they were three-quarters of a century ago," the New York Times caption notes.
Gallup illustrated its write-up with a photo of a faceless housewife carrying a toddler with one arm and pushing a vacuum cleaner with the other while her skinny jeans-clad man sits on the couch, idly fiddling with his smartphone.
The persistence of gender roles doesn't tell us anything about human nature, sociologist Joanna Pepin told the New York Times. Instead, it's "evidence that our beliefs about gender are really strong and sticky. ... That's yet another thing that's getting in the way of social change."
Don't you hate it when human nature gets in the way of sociologists' dreams?

Texto completo: "1776" is an assembly of independent voices who uphold our country’s authentic founding virtues and values and challenge those who assert America is forever defined by its past failures, such as slavery.
The concept was well-intended, and the execution of its first episode well-documented. Yet, it left me feeling that the New York Times missed at least half of the story. By looking through the lens of black victimization, it paid too little attention to what I call “black overcoming” — our victories over adversity and achievements of success, sometimes in conflict but also often in cooperation with people from other races and ethnic groups.
The New York Times incorrectly assumes that the challenges facing particularly inner-city blacks are related to a legacy of slavery and discrimination. This is patently untrue. Let’s look at the issue of poverty and how we’re treated.
Our perceptions are distorted by the “colorization of poverty” in the mid-1960s. Media images of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “war on poverty” focused mostly on poor whites in Appalachia, where LBJ announced his initiative — and where I later would work with mostly white teens in the Upward Bound program as a college student in 1967. But with the outbreak of riots in Watts, Harlem, Chicago, and other urban centers, news media images of rural poverty were replaced by images from the “ghetto.”
Colorization has had a profound impact on other issues too. In the 1980s, for example, crack cocaine was perceived as a mostly black problem and a law enforcement issue. In the 1990s, opioid addiction was perceived as a mostly rural white problem and a public health issue.
J.D. Vance, writing in Hillbilly Elegy about growing up in the same Ohio town where I had grown up almost two generations earlier, ignited a new discussion from the grassroots of white poverty and drugs that showed me the important similarities between poor blacks and whites in America, despite the tribalism encouraged by demagogic leaders in both races. “I have known many welfare queens,” Vance writes. “Some were my neighbors, and all were white.” His candor is refreshing.
Vance tends to view poverty in the way many people in the traditionally Republican town of Middletown, Ohio, as a problem of culture, morality, character, and personal responsibility. I agree that personal character matters, but I also have witnessed those values undermined by what William Julius Wilson called “the disappearance of work” — of Ohio’s well-paid, low-skill industrial jobs that lured Vance’s family from Kentucky and mine from Alabama.
Vance’s book forced me to take a new look at my life and hometown and about our similarities and our differences. Vance explains in his introduction how personal stories offer cultural insights that are essential to any serious discussion of equal opportunity.
“Nobel-winning economists worry about the decline of the industrial Midwest and the hollowing out of the economic core of working whites,” he writes. “What they mean is that manufacturing jobs have gone overseas and middle-class jobs are harder to come by for people without college degrees. Fair enough — I worry about those things, too. But this book is about something else: what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south. It’s about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible. It’s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.”
It’s not laziness that’s destroying hillbilly culture, says Vance. It’s what psychologist Martin Seligman calls “learned helplessness.” Too many of us African Americans have picked up that malady as well.
Where should we go from here? Similarities between Vance’s life and mine showed me how much we need to desegregate our poverty discussion, to learn across the lines of race and class the true causes of poverty and inequality — and, more importantly, what works to solve them.
Yes, blacks have fought to make true the ideals in our nation’s founding documents, as the New York Times says. But its statement that the “founding ideals were false” is misleading and even counterproductive to our understanding of the founding documents as aspirational. The principle that “all men,” or people, “are created equal” was true in early American law only for white, property-owning men. But the Founders, as a minority themselves, wisely took that principle of equality very seriously in the abstract, understanding that they themselves might need it someday. They established a tradition: Guarantee “inalienable rights” to some but also establish the legal mechanisms to extend those equal protections to others without — and this is important — taking those rights away from those who have them.
Our project, “1776,” puts less of an emphasis on history and more on the question prophetically raised by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., at the height of his civil rights revolution: “Where do we go from here?” Mindful of the inevitable criticism that his movement was subversive, King made a special effort to ground his historic 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech in “a dream as old as the American dream” by repeated references to the nation’s founding documents, including Abraham Lincoln’s “Gettysburg Address.” He assured friends and foes alike that his civil rights movement had come not to deny the gospel of the American dream, but to fulfill it.
We must disrupt the long-held stereotypes of black people as helpless bystanders in their own history. We have had entrepreneurs, skilled tradesmen, military officers, inventors, organizers, and many others who responded to adversity by marshaling resources, building local enterprises, and creating jobs. We organized and acted to defeat slavery, segregation, and deprivation, and then we persevered to build businesses that included banks, hotels, small factories, and a black-owned railroad.
In addition to the consequences of slavery, these contributions of black Americans should be at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Even in bondage, slaves had agency in various amounts, or to varying degrees, and they acted on it in a variety of ways. Those who prefer to focus on our victimization don’t always want to recognize it, but the ways our ancestors exercised agency in bondage formed the foundation of their successes (or failures) after they were freed.
Americans are optimistic people, but we care more about the future than the past. We care about the past mostly as much as it helps us to deal with the uncertainties of our future. Changes, demographic and otherwise, are tearing us apart. Our historic victimization must never be forgotten, but it is best remembered through the stories of our groundbreaking victories over oppression through faith, courage, talent, persistence, ingenuity, and hard work.
It may be a cliché these days to note that our differences should not be allowed to stand in the way of what we share in common, but too often they still do. We must find ways to appreciate the contributions that our diverse population contributes to American life. We need to study not only the atrocities of U.S. history but also America’s magnificent capacity for self-improvement as we seek the tools and knowledge to help us face our shared future with new hope — together.

'Dangerous' PragerU conservatives clap back at Samantha Bee

Texto completo: Conservatives are firing back after Full Frontal comedian Samantha Bee said their ideas were "dangerous."
The liberal TBS show host sparked controversy when she took aim at Prager University on Wednesday, a nonprofit organization that creates online conservative content.
“Prager U’s website says 'Prager University is not an accredited academic institution...but it is a place where you are free to learn.' That describes every single place! The last place Sam learned something for free was in a bra store. She learned she’s been wrong for 35 years,” Bee tweeted.
Tweet
The Washington Examiner reached out to some of the most-watched personalities on PragerU, all of them saying that their goals are to counter "groupthink" and expose young people to new ideas.
“Samantha Bee’s horror that PragerU would expose students to basic historical and philosophical concepts tells you everything you need to know about the dismal state of education in our society. The sole purpose of my PragerU show the Book Club is to encourage people to read great books,” Michael Knowles, show host at the Daily Wire and co-host of The Verdict podcast with Sen. Ted Cruz, told the Washington Examiner.
Knowles hosts a show on PragerU called Book Club, where he and other guests read through works of fiction and nonfiction, emphasizing the significant themes in each book. In his first episode, Knowles and PragerU founder Dennis Prager read through Viktor Frankl’s memoir Man’s Search for Meaning, where the two discussed the author’s reflections on surviving the Holocaust. Knowles said he plans to explain the importance of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet on the next episode of his show in a knock on Bee.
“Does Samantha fear Shakespeare will corrupt the youth? What is the Left so afraid of? Samantha Bee should consider tuning in. Maybe she’ll learn something," he said.
Bee criticized the organization for providing what she calls “shitty” and “factually untrue” commentary, targeting its anti-abortion, pro-nuclear family, and Judeo-Christian messages. “Come on; the important thing isn’t whether God is a woman or a man. The important thing is that God is hot,” the comedian joked after playing a clip from Prager, who discussed biblical descriptions of God.
Bee, known for her crude and insensitive humor, said, “Finally, for once in my life, I want to feel the Lord in me.”
On her YouTube channel, Bee captions her segment by saying, “Turns out right-wing propaganda networks aren’t just for your racist grandparents anymore!” But Dave Rubin, host of The Rubin Report, begs to differ. Rubin, who identifies as a “classical liberal," notes that the organization repeatedly invites him to produce content despite political disagreements.
“It’s ironic because, Samantha Bee, the New York Times, and Media Matters claim PragerU is propaganda, while they push progressive groupthink to the masses. The folks at PragerU know I have some political differences with the purely conservative position, but they still invite me to do their videos,” Rubin told the Washington Examiner.
Rubin often hosts political commentators, religious figures, and psychologists to discuss a wide range of worldviews, giving them free agency to make their case for their belief system. In a report published last year by the New York Times, the news outlet found that online “radicals” moderated their political views after listening to Rubin and others within the identified “Intellectual Dark Web.”
Rubin said he is creating a third video for the organization, scheduled for release in April. Rubin said he wants to inform his listeners of how to “truly break away from Leftist factory settings that most of us are force-fed in school and through media.”
“PragerU and by extension a huge crew of classical liberal, libertarian, and conservative voices are exploding online because we are offering a counternarrative. Samantha Bee has a team of 20 comedy writers and a huge budget for a show nobody is watching," Rubin said.
PragerU responded to Bee on Twitter, jokingly thanking the liberal host for “advertisements." “Maybe you think we’re “dangerous” because it’s clearer than ever before that we’re winning the culture! We’re reaching millions of people each day with conservative ideas!”
The group then retweeted a large number of supporters and shared other videos pertaining to philosophy, ethics, and other topics.
Tweet
Before comparing Prager University to “Monsters University,” Bee slung ad hominem attacks against Prager himself, calling the conservative “bonkers” and his organization a “fake ass university.”
Responding to Bee, contributors to the nonprofit organization said she could learn something by watching PragerU content.
Allen Estrin, the co-founder of Prager University and executive producer of the Dennis Prager Show, echoed the sentiment of his organization's public statement to the Washington Examiner.
"Samantha Bee did get a couple of things right. PragerU is reaching millions of young people. And we are dangerous — to the Left," he quipped.

Camelot created the modern presidency

Texto completo: The famous thousand days of President John F. Kennedy’s “Camelot” brought many new developments to American politics and society. The potential for a glamorous and wealthy post-White House career for staffers was one of the most enduring, and often overlooked.
For the first 150 years of U.S. history, presidents relied on their Cabinet secretaries to formulate policy. The White House staff was, like the government itself at the time, small and highly focused. The big personalities, chief policymakers, and visionary thinkers were heads of the most prestigious agencies — typically the Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, and War. In the 1930s, this changed under Franklin Delano Roosevelt. An activist president facing a massive depression needed more manpower, specifically in the form of aides who could report directly to him and do his bidding.
The first entity to recognize the need for a White House staff was the Brownlow Committee on Administrative Management, set up by Roosevelt in the summer of 1936. The committee considered how to reshape the executive branch to deal with expanded governmental responsibilities: “There is need for improvement of our governmental machinery to meet new conditions and to make us ready for the problems just ahead.” In 1937, the committee issued its famous four-word conclusion: “The president needs help.”
Initially, this help would come via “not more than six administrative assistants” and the movement of the Bureau of the Budget into White House operations. These six “executive assistant” positions would “remain in the background, issue no orders, make no decisions, [and] emit no public statements.” Chosen by the president, all assistants had to be “possessed of high competence” and a “passion for anonymity.”
The committee’s recommendations became law when Congress enacted the Reorganization Act of 1939, which created the Executive Office of the President, composed of a new entity, the White House Office, as well as the existing Bureau of the Budget, which had been lodged in the Treasury Department. The famous four words of the Brownlow Committee had set into motion a decadeslong expansion, leading to the current White House operation of more than 1,600 people and the creation of the modern White House staff, now a glamorous group inspiring novels, TV shows, movies, and generating many prominent careers.
Growth of the modern White House staff took time. Both Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower followed the old ways and looked to their Cabinet secretaries to make policy, using a tightly structured, loyal staff organization to tamp down rivalries. By the 1960s, however, Kennedy, following Roosevelt’s model, made policymaking a White House prerogative, hiring prominent and experienced presidential aides. This has continued in every presidency since then, in one way or another. And since the Kennedy administration, presidential aides could also become political and media heavyweights with lucrative careers later.
The power of television was instrumental in electing Kennedy, as modern celebrity culture began to influence the world of politics. While the concept of aides with a “passion for anonymity” still existed, the advent of the celebrity White House aide was certainly not what the Brownlow Committee had expected.

Some of the Kennedy team, such as longtime speechwriter Ted Sorensen, became famous as a result of his association with Kennedy. Others, such as Harvard professor Arthur Schlesinger, were part of Kennedy’s active effort to recruit prominent intellectuals to his team. Both garnered considerable press attention during their time in the White House. Sorensen had the more prominent role inside the White House, but Schlesinger was already famous and a Pulitzer Prize winner before joining the White House staff.

Once advisers such as Sorensen and Schlesinger became household names, their memoirs became highly anticipated and greatly desired. Sorensen and Schlesinger, as two of Kennedy's best-known aides, stayed briefly in the Johnson administration, each leaving in early 1964, and then set out to write their memoirs of the Kennedy administration. In January 1964, Schlesinger wrote in a letter to his parents, “I am inclining more and more to the idea of writing a book about the Kennedy administration, though I understand that Ted Sorensen has this in mind too.” The race was on. This contest between the two men to get a book out first fascinated the media and contributed to book sales. Sorensen finished first, and his book, Kennedy, hit No. 1 on the bestseller list. Schlesinger’s book, A Thousand Days, came second, and it also hit No. 1, displacing Sorensen's. Sorensen reacted to being leapfrogged by sending Schlesinger a chipper note: “Welcome to the number 1 slot. As number 2, we try harder.”
The Kennedy mystique, and the attention generated by the Schlesinger and Sorensen memoirs, further raised the profile and prominence of the position of White House aide. Following Kennedy, exiting top White House officials now had access to lucrative book contracts, as well as an array of glamorous and career-defining job opportunities. Jack Valenti left Lyndon Johnson’s administration to head the Motion Picture Association of America. William Safire left the Nixon administration to become a New York Times columnist, and Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote a bestselling memoir and secured a Wall Street Journal column. Former Carter aide David Rubenstein helped found the Carlyle Group. Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos became the host of ABC’s This Week. Former White House aides have become Cabinet secretaries, members of Congress, and Supreme Court justices as well.
Given the potentially rewarding and high-profile careers that serving in a White House could bring about, the position of White House aide became highly sought-after. People toiled away in staff jobs in Congress or joined political campaigns in the hope of someday securing a spot in the White House — and a choice job or book contract afterward.
With opportunity came risk. As the White House slots became less anonymous and more prominent, staffers also became targets, facing enemies from both within and without. White House rivalries are among the most poisonous, and the media and opposing party can and do target individual aides as well. Accordingly, many a White House aide hoping for fame or fortune has instead faced legal jeopardy, or left in disgrace.
But the chance for career-making riches and fame keep White House placement enviable. The jobs continue to evolve, especially today, as White House aides now maintain their own Twitter accounts, which is a far cry from Brownlow’s suggested “passion for anonymity.” But the prominence that the Kennedy administration brought to a position that was once relatively obscure has only grown since.
Tevi Troy is a presidential historian and former White House aide. His latest book is Fight House: Rivalries in the White House from Truman to Trump, from which this is adapted.

Colorado lawmaker wants to strike phrase 'illegal alien' from state law

Texto completo: A Democratic Colorado state representative wants to do away with the term “illegal alien” in state law because it disparages migrants.
Susan Lontine told the New York Times on Thursday she planned to introduce legislation later this month that would eliminate the term “illegal aliens” from the state's books. She instead wants lawmakers to use the term “undocumented immigrants.”
Lontine said she blanches when she hears President Trump use “illegal immigrants” during speeches and was further motivated to nix the phrase when a friend of hers found it while training for a new job for the city of Denver.
“She goes: ‘Why are you using that? That’s an awful term,’” Lontine said.
This isn’t the first time a lawmaker has wanted to eliminate the phrase.
Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas introduced legislation in July that would do away with the words “alien” and “illegal alien” from the Immigration and Nationality Act. He instead wants the federal law to use the phrases “foreign national” and “undocumented foreign national.”
“Words matter,” Castro said in a statement. “It’s vital that we respect the dignity of immigrants fleeing violence and prosecution in our language. The words ‘alien’ and ‘illegal alien’ work to demonize and dehumanize the migrant community. They should have no place in our government’s description of human beings.”
“Immigrants come to our borders in good faith and work hard for the opportunity to achieve a better life for themselves and their family,” he added. “Eliminating this language from government expression puts us one step closer to preserving their dignity and ensuring their safety.”
Democrats control Colorado’s Legislature and governorship, potentially allowing the upcoming proposal to face fewer impediments than if Republicans held control.

Texto completo: There's an old saying about baseball and life that no one ever had a 1.000 batting average. It turns out, that's not exactly true. At least when it comes to the Trump economy, anti-Trumpers defied the near-impossible statistical odds and somehow have batted 1.000 on their predictions. They managed to get it wrong every time.
A chorus line of President Trump's critics, including the best and brightest minds of the liberal intelligentsia, predicted an economic and stock market free fall if Trumponomics were implemented. They weren't just wrong, but in many cases, fantastically wrong. So wrong that Paul Krugman, the leader of the Armageddon brigades four years ago, recently had to cry "uncle." He begrudgingly admitted the Trump economy is doing "pretty well," which is like saying that Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a "pretty good year." Then, he insisted that Trump is a moron.
Having worked as an economic adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign, I had to do battle almost every day with the whiz kids who predicted economic apocalypse if Trump won. "Under Trump, I would expect a protracted recession to begin within 18 months," moaned former President Bill Clinton's and Barack Obama's chief economist Larry Summers. Well, where is it?
The former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Eric Zitzewitz, warned on the eve of the election, "If Trump wins we should expect a big markdown in expected future earnings for a wide range of stocks — and a likely crash in the broader market." The market is up roughly 60%.
The New York Times summarized a 2016 study by economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics by warning, "If Donald Trump were elected president and put in his stated policies, the United States would experience a lengthy recession, enormous job losses, much higher interest rates, and diminished long-term growth prospects." The economy under Trump has precisely the opposite result on every measure.
Even more wrong was Steve Rattner, MSNBC's economics guru (still!) and former Obama automobile czar, who told investors, "If the unlikely event happens and Trump wins, you will see a market crash of historic proportions, I think ... the markets are terrified of him."
And in case there was any voter confusion about the menace that Trump represented, a Washington Post editorial in October 2016 declared, "A President Trump Could Destroy the World Economy." There were dozens of stories about why the Trump tax cuts couldn't and wouldn't work.
You might even say there was a "scientific consensus."
The purpose of this column is not to rub their noses in it — well, maybe a little. The truth is, I've been wrong in some of my economic predictions over the years. I thought the Clinton presidency would be a disaster for the economy. Still, after his first two shaky years in the White House and a GOP takeover of Congress, Clinton announced that "the era of big government is over," and the economy soared. I've admitted my mistake. I will readily concede that the economic winds could shift next week, and the economy could start to slip.
My point is, where are the mea culpas from the liberals who got predictions about the economy upside down over the last three years? Their economic malpractice was the equivalent of a doctor amputating the wrong arm.
I don't have to recite the catalog of statistics on how good financial conditions are today. It's all wrapped up in the recent Gallup poll, which finds nearly 9 out of 10 people feel good about their lives. Trump didn't destroy the economy. He rebuilt it.
Where is the humility from the Left in admitting, "Hey, my economic worldview has been put to the test and proven all wrong? I better rethink this. Maybe tax cuts and deregulation and energy production really do fire up the supply side of the economy. Maybe putting America first really does help the stock market and raise incomes. Maybe everything I was taught in college and grad school about Keynesian economics is a fraud."
Alas, we hear none of that, just flimsy excuses for why they were so wrong about Trump. First, the economy was going to crash. Then, when it didn't crash, the boom was just a "sugar high" from large budget deficits and tax cuts. Then, when the "high" lasted three years, we were told a recession was "right around the corner." Then, when the recession didn't happen, and the economy picked up steam in the last six months, we heard that this was just the continuation of the Obama trend. So this is the Left's line of reasoning: If the economy crashes, it's Trump's fault. If the economy soars, Obama gets the credit.
The wonder of it all is that the anti-Trumpers are still squawking from their lofty perches as if nothing that happens in the real world, rather than in la-la land or on MSNBC, really matters. Being wrong five to 10 or 100 times isn't punishable; it can even win you a Nobel Prize.
It is the unique sanctuary of punditry and academia. If you hired a stock picker that consistently recommended losing stocks, would you keep that person on retainer? If you hired a contractor and the house collapsed, would you pay him? If a football team lost every game, would you give the coach a five-year contract extension?
But the press keeps turning to the same sources no matter how many times they have been wrong on the economy. Then, they wonder why they receive criticism for being fake news.

Voting on your phone: New elections app ignites security debate

Texto completo: For more than a decade, it has been an elusive dream for election officials: a smartphone app that would let swaths of voters cast their ballots from their living rooms. It has also been a nightmare for cyberexperts, who argue that no technology is secure enough to trust with the very basis of American democracy.
The debate, long a sideshow at academic conferences and state election offices, is now taking on new urgency. A startup called Voatz says it has developed an app that would allow users to vote securely from anywhere in the world — the electoral version of a moonshot. Thousands are set to use the app in this year’s elections, a small but growing experiment that could pave the way for a wider acceptance of mobile voting.
But where optimists see a more engaged electorate, critics are warning that the move is dangerously irresponsible. In a new report shared with The New York Times before its publication Thursday, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say the app is so riddled with security issues that no one should be using it.
In response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security organized a series of briefings in recent weeks for state and local officials who are planning to use Voatz’s technology.

“The choice here is not about turnout,” the report says, “but about an adversary controlling the election result and a loss of voter privacy.”
With security already a dominant theme of the 2020 elections, last week’s debacle at the Democratic caucuses in Iowa — an app used to report results failed to, well, report results — has raised new questions about the role technology should play in American elections and prompted calls for it to be scaled back.
While a return to the analog days of punch cards and hanging chads is unlikely, there is growing unease about how far state and local governments should go in modernizing election infrastructure — from registration databases and electronic poll books to the voting machines themselves.
At the far edge of that debate are systems that let users cast their ballots over the internet, including the platform built by Voatz, the only voting app on the market.
An initial experiment with wide-scale online voting took place in Washington a decade ago. It was called off after researchers hacked into the system, electing HAL 9000 — the computer from “2001: A Space Odyssey” — as mayor and making the University of Michigan fight song play every time a ballot was cast.
Since then, some states have allowed online voting through web portals, emails or digital faxes, despite the security risks. But they have restricted it to groups of people who cannot make it to the polls, mostly overseas military personnel.
Voatz says its technology has overcome the security problems through biometrics and other measures built into newer smartphones, as well as a back-end system that records and stores votes on a blockchain, the technology underpinning Bitcoin. It also says its platform creates a paper trail for election officials and the voters using the app.
Since its debut in 2018, Voatz has run several pilot projects aimed largely at deployed service members, tallying about 600 votes across federal elections in Denver, West Virginia and five counties in Oregon, Utah and Washington state. Now, it is poised to expand its reach in the presidential election as a number of additional states consider whether to use it for some categories of absentee voters.
West Virginia, for instance, is planning to use the app to meet new requirements that it find a way to make sure the disabled and infirm can participate, a move that is likely to add thousands of voters this year.
Until now, security experts have focused criticism on what they described as Voatz’s opaque systems, which make it impossible to verify its security claims.
Beneath that criticism, there is also some very real animus — many in the tightly knit cybersecurity community blame Voatz for helping spur an FBI investigation of a University of Michigan graduate student who tried to breach the company’s systems in 2018. The student says he was conducting research.
In the new paper, the MIT researchers, Michael A. Specter, James Koppel and Daniel J. Weitzner, go beyond speculation and detail how they found serious security issues by reverse-engineering Voatz’s app and recreating what they could of the company’s server from publicly available information.
Flaws in the app, the report says, would let attackers monitor votes being cast — and might even allow them to change ballots or block them without users’ knowledge.
Perhaps the biggest risk, according to the researchers, is that the attacks could create a tainted paper trail, making a reliable audit impossible.
They pointed to the problems in Iowa caucuses as an instructive example. Though those problems were caused by technical faults, not a security breach, officials in Iowa have had to tally votes through paper backups, some of which are not complete. More than a week later, a definitive result has yet to emerge.
“Imagine that on a national scale,” Specter said in an interview.
The researchers took their findings to the Department of Homeland Security in January, setting off a process through which Voatz was made aware of the research and election officials who use the platform were briefed.
In a statement, Homeland Security said that while no one was known to have exploited the flaws found by the researchers, “we will continue to work with our partners to deepen understanding of the risk.”
Voatz, which has reviewed the report, strenuously objected to the researchers’ claims, saying in a statement that the researchers acted in bad faith, used an outdated version of the app and “fabricated an imagined version” of the servers.
The company said that its nine previous elections had gone off without incident, and argued that its pilot projects had pushed “innovation forward in a responsible, transparent way.”
The company is backed by Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and philanthropist. In an interview last year with Harvard Business Review, he also brushed aside security concerns. “It’s not that cybersecurity people are bad people per se,” he said. “It’s that they are solving for one situation, and I am solving for another.”
Caught in the back-and-forth between Voatz and the researchers are election officials who must soon make a decision on whether to use the app this year. At least one Voatz client, Mason County, Washington, has already pulled out, citing fear of media blowback.
Others say they are pressing ahead with plans to use Voatz.
The app “is not perfect — nothing is — and security is always a concern for us,” said Donald Kersey, a senior election official in West Virginia. “But this is about using new technologies that give us a way to make sure people who maybe can’t always vote have that opportunity.”

Texto completo: Perhaps you think New Hampshire sent us a mixed message. After all, Bernie Sanders won but the moderates got more votes, and Tuesday night three different candidates seemed to be giving victory speeches.
What does the Democratic rank-and-file really want? Well, the answer is: Ralph in Michigan.
Ralph is the symbol of all the people in swing states who went for Barack Obama and then turned Republican in 2016. Democrats want him back! They care way less about finding a candidate with the perfect health care plan than finding one who can rid the world of President Trump.
And who does Ralph want? Somebody who looks more reasonable than the current occupant of the White House? Well, that’s all the Democratic candidates. And pretty much every other elected official in recent memory.
OK, maybe not the senator who got arrested for lewd conduct in a men’s restroom. But even the congressman who used campaign donations to fly around his pet bunny can’t compare to a president who bills the government $650 a night for putting up the agents who have to provide security when he goes to Mar-a-Lago.
Getting rid of Trump is everything. While nobody in either party has ever described him as restrained, he’s gotten worse since he skittered past the impeachment crisis. A normal unhinged president might, say, fire a Cabinet member on a whim. Trump preferred to can a distinguished military officer for being the brother of an officer who testified about the Ukraine situation under subpoena.
How do you think Ralph would react if a Democratic candidate connected the brothers’ story to Trump’s draft-dodging bone spur? Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan, is definitely into bringing up that bone spur.
We’re presuming Ralph is a non-crazy, non-racist average person who thought it was time for a change when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee. And liked Trump’s, um, spunkiness. Now he’s begun to worry that there’s a tad too much spunk in the current White House.
Who do you think he’d be looking at now? Probably not Joe Biden anymore.
Although Biden is certainly holding out hope. “It is important that Iowa and Nevada have spoken, but, look, we need to hear from Nevada and South Carolina,” the former vice president said, in what would have been a New Hampshire concession speech if he had not forgotten the name of the state he just lost.
Biden has now run for president three times and he’s never won a primary. Or come in second. Or third. Ralph cannot possibly be impressed.
Elizabeth Warren’s only possible consolation for her poor showing was that she came in ahead of Joe Biden. But she was spunky even in defeat. Warned the party against “harsh tactics” and then posed for a ton of selfies. Kudos.
And what about Bernie Sanders? He won, but he beat Buttigieg by fewer than 4,000 votes — out of nearly 300,000 cast. And although Sanders does do well with working-class voters, I doubt Mrs. Ralph is going to come around unless he learns how to talk about, say, eliminating college tuition without shouting and scowling.
The big winner in New Hampshire was Amy Klobuchar, who came in a rather impressive third. Now she’s a very serious candidate, and it will be interesting to see how Trump decides to attack her. Sanders has already entered the president’s rally speeches as Crazy Bernie, and Trump has devoted quite a bit of time to making fun of Buttigieg’s name. Klobuchar hasn’t really come up much, except for a tweet in which he referred to the Minnesota Democrat as “Snowman (woman)!”
If Klobuchar keeps climbing, soon the Trump crowds will be chanting “Lock her up!” Really, any woman will do. This week, they did it for Nancy Pelosi. Any minute now, it’ll be Oprah Winfrey.
But back to Ralph the target swing voter. We have not discussed how old he is. That matters a lot. Sanders, 78, has huge support from younger Democrats, but in New Hampshire he got only 14% of the voters over 65. Buttigieg, 38, got nearly a quarter of those older voters.
What’s the story?
A) Mayor Pete reminds them of their grandchildren.
B) Bernie reminds them of the guy at their coffee shop who never treats and won’t stop complaining about the weather.
C) Millennials hear Sanders speeches and think he’s rapping.
We should probably pause to congratulate New Hampshire for getting the votes counted right away. It’s sort of the dream state for candidates who believe that if the citizenry just got to know them, they’d be converted to their cause. Now the dream is over for people like Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet. We’re down to just eight contenders.
Civics quiz: Name all eight of them.
Don’t look at me — I’m not going to tell you.
Right now, Michael Bloomberg is pretty darned popular. Most people don’t know much about him except his ads — he’s sort of the political equivalent of Geico. But we’ll have much more opportunity to be snide about his campaign once we get to Super Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Ralph hasn’t made up his mind. But we’ve come a long way. Hopes soaring, hopes crushed. And if we ever get Iowa totally straightened out, the Democrats will have allocated nearly 2% of the delegates to the convention.

Texto completo: Let’s state some facts: Michael Ruben Bloomberg notoriously expanded stop-and-frisk in New York City to obscene proportions, violating the bodies and constitutional rights of mostly minority men and boys, and not only defended the policy, but mocked his detractors and bragged about it.
What Bloomberg did as mayor amounted to a police occupation of minority neighborhoods, a terroristic pressure campaign, with little evidence that it was accomplishing the goal of sustained, long-term crime reduction.
Nearly 90% of the people stopped were completely innocent. He knew that. They were the collateral damage in his crusade, black and brown bodies up against walls and down on the ground, groped in the middle of the city by strange men with guns, a vast expanse of human psychological wreckage about which he couldn’t care less.
A recording from a speech Bloomberg delivered at the Aspen Institute in 2015 underscores just how callous and cavalier he was in his thinking about this racist policy.
“Ninety-five percent of your murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one MO,” Bloomberg said. “You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That’s true in New York. That’s true in virtually every city.”
He goes on to say: “One of the unintended consequences is, people say, ‘Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana, they’re all minorities.’ Yes, that’s true. Why? Because put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that’s true. Why do we do it? Because that’s where all the crime is.”
Later he says, “The way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.”
So many things to dissect here.
First, Bloomberg didn’t see individual criminals, many of whom happened to be minorities; he saw a class of criminals who were minorities. “They are male, minorities, 16 to 25.” Many of these were children.
He was articulating an explicitly race-based policy.
He spoke nonchalantly about giving these young people criminal records for marijuana, ignoring the enormous harm these criminal records cause to individuals and whole communities. And a vast majority of those people and communities were minorities.
As Daniel Nichanian, editor of The Appeal, wrote this week on Twitter: “Each year of Bloomberg’s 12-year mayorship, at least 50 percent of the people arrested for marijuana were black. And at least 85 percent were nonwhite each year, usually much higher. That’s tens of thousands of people each year.”
And Bloomberg defended the practice by saying that the only way to get the guns out of the kids’ hands was to throw the kids against a wall. But nearly 90% of these young people were completely innocent. They had done absolutely nothing wrong, let alone possess a gun.
The Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Fagan produced a report that became part of a class-action lawsuit against the city in 2010. It found that “(s)eizures of weapons or contraband are extremely rare. Overall, guns are seized in less than 1 percent of all stops: 0.15 percent. … Contraband, which may include weapons but also includes drugs or stolen property, is seized in 1.75 percent of all stops.”
As Fagan wrote, “The NYPD stop-and-frisk tactics produce rates of seizures of guns or other contraband that are no greater than would be produced simply by chance.”
Bloomberg didn’t care about any of this. He didn’t care about these innocent black and brown bodies. Somewhere in each barrel of good apples there was a bad one, and he was willing to spoil the whole batch to purge that rare bad one.
These minority boys were being hunted. Their neighborhoods were experiencing an occupation. Citizens wanted crime abatement, but they didn’t expect apartheid.
And yet in the same way that white people in New York City had turned away when Bloomberg was executing his racist policy, many Democrats — including some black ones — appear willing now to turn a blind eye to his past.
Bloomberg is blanketing the airwaves with slick ads and glamouring liberals into amnesia and acquiescence. These liberals are then openly gaming out scenarios in which Bloomberg is the last, best option.
They don’t recognize that Bloomberg is the master of this sort of emotional manipulation. During his 2001 campaign for mayor, he ran ads that The New York Times noted focused on old crime fears.
“The scenes, set to dramatic synthesizer music punctuated by sharp blasts of percussion, come from what could well be called ‘N.Y.P.D. Bloomberg,’ ” The Times reported. “They seem calibrated to throw fear into the hearts of the citizenry at the thought of crime mushrooming again in a post-Giuliani New York City.”
During a campaign debate that year, Bloomberg, a Republican at the time, was asked how prevalent he believed racial profiling was in the New York Police Department. His answer is fascinating to examine in retrospect. He said: “In terms of the actuality, it is probably a very small number of police officers. Most police officers in this city work very hard. They are not racist thugs.”
But then he turned them into just that, making them part of a citywide system of racial profiling. Even the police objected. When Bloomberg was finally forced last fall to apologize for stop-and-frisk so he could run for president, Patrick Lynch, president of the city’s Police Benevolent Association, issued a blistering statement:
“Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street. We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities. His administration’s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe.”
In 2012, after millions of stops, Bloomberg stood up in a church in Brownsville, Brooklyn, among the neighborhoods hardest hit by the policy, and declared that racial profiling was banned in the Police Department. “We will not tolerate it,” he said.
That was a Donald Trump-level lie.
The next year a federal judge ruled that the way the city used stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional because it amounted to a “policy of indirect racial profiling.”
No amount of Democrats’ anti-Trump fear and panic will ever erase what Bloomberg did. Democrats have a field of fascinating candidates. Many have some crime and justice issues of their own, but nothing approaching the scale of Bloomberg’s racist policy.
If Democrats cast aside all of these candidates in favor of Bloomberg and his wealth, I fear they will be making it harder to defeat Trump in November.

Texto completo: Here’s further proof that air pollution ignores borders: In most states, about half of the premature deaths caused by poor air quality are linked to pollutants that blow in from other states, a new study found.
The study investigated the sources and effects of two major pollutants that harm humans, ozone and fine airborne particles, in the lower 48 states from 2005 to 2018. It found that in New York, nearly two-thirds of premature deaths are attributable to pollution from sources in other states. That makes the state the largest “net importer” of early deaths, to use the researchers’ term.
Ozone and fine particles are a result of fuel burning, so the analysis, published Wednesday in Nature, could have implications for policymakers looking for ways to reduce air pollution, and premature mortality, by regulating so-called cross-state emissions. So far only emissions from electric power generation are regulated in this way, but the study looked at six other sources of pollutants, including other industries, road transportation, aviation and commercial and residential sources like heating for homes and buildings.
“We know air quality is bad in many ways, and if we want to continue to improve it we need to understand what the causes are and what the effects are and to target the biggest contributors,” said Steven R.H. Barrett, director of the Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an author of the study.
Scientists have long known that air pollution from one area can have effects elsewhere. Damage to forests by acid rain in the Northeast in the 1960s was linked to coal-burning power plants in other regions, for example.
The new study, by Barrett, Irene Dedoussi of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and others, quantifies the effects of each state on every other, using pollution data and computer models to track pollution in the atmosphere. “It’s putting a head count on it,” Barrett said.

The study found that the states that emitted pollution that caused the most early deaths in other states were in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Ozone and fine particles emitted in Wyoming and North Dakota, for example, lead to few deaths per capita in those states. But the pollution is carried eastward by the prevailing winds, leading to more deaths elsewhere.
The analysis also found a decline in cross-state deaths linked to electricity generation since 2005, an indication that pollution regulations, like the Environmental Protection Agency’s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, are working. The rule, established in 2011, requires about 27 states, mostly in the eastern half of the country, to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which lead to formation of ozone and fine particles.
Premature deaths linked to pollution from road transportation have also declined with the adoption of more efficient fuel standards and emissions controls. But the declines have not been as great as with electricity generation, Barrett said, because it takes years to replace the nation’s entire fleet of vehicles with cleaner ones.
As a result of the drop in early deaths linked to power generation and road transportation, the overall effect of cross-state pollution has declined, the study said. But at the same time, residential and commercial emissions are now the leading cause of cross-state early deaths, a finding that came as a surprise to the researchers.
“They may not have seemed so important 10 or 20 years ago, but these commercial and residential emissions now look really important, in big part because progress has been made in other sectors,” Barrett said. “Future research and future policy are going to have to bear down on these emissions and start controlling them,” he said.
The study did not look at pollution from wildfires, which increasingly contribute to poor air quality in the United States. “They are currently less important for the long-term averages that affect human health the most,” Barrett said. “That might change in the future if wildfires become more common under a changing climate.”
Michael Brauer, an environmental health specialist at the University of British Columbia in Canada who was not involved in the study, said the findings show that work needs to be done to reduce pollution from smaller sources like commercial buildings and homes.
Decreases in early deaths from pollution from larger sources like power plants, he said, are “a result of the effectiveness of federal regulations.”
“The cross-state rule was really pretty effective,” he added. “We need to not relax rules like that.”
Barrett said that it was not until he and his colleagues did all their calculations that he realized how much progress had been made on electric power generation. “It really has been the thing the EPA has been working hard on improving,” he said.
Efforts by the Trump administration to overturn some regulations — although the White House has supported the cross-state rule — are potentially concerning, Barrett said. “It could be pretty worrying if those changes have time to take hold,” he said.

Nicholas Kristof: I worry about Sanders, and his coattails

Texto completo: In 1981, as a Washington Post intern prowling for stories, I called the new socialist mayor of Burlington, Vermont.
He was an earnest and intelligent oddball, I decided, but not a serious politician with a future. So I didn’t write about Mayor Bernie Sanders — underscoring that I have a record going back almost four decades of misjudging political talent.
Sanders is now the front-runner to win the Democratic nomination. Yet note that in the betting markets, Sanders is the leader to win the nomination but President Donald Trump is favored to then win reelection in November.
I cringe as I write that. Yet Trump’s Gallup job approval rating has reached a new high and oddsmakers have significantly elevated his chances of reelection.
So that is the prism through which to view this election: Would Sanders increase or reduce the likelihood of a Trump victory? And would he help or hurt Democrats running for the Senate in states like Kansas and Alabama?
I admire Sanders for his authenticity and passion. He has poured his heart into ending U.S. complicity in atrocities in Yemen, even though this cause wins him no votes. Likewise, Sanders has shown unusual political courage in criticizing Israel’s land grabs in the West Bank, leading a political action committee to run attack ads against him. (The accusation that Sanders, who lived on an Israeli kibbutz for a time and would be the first Jewish president, is anti-Israel is absurd.)
That said, Sanders raises some red flags.
Sanders voters said in exit polls that they were drawn to him because of his positions on the issues. But his proposals have almost no chance of becoming law, particularly if the Senate stays in Republican hands. If there is to be some progress on health care, or college affordability, or income inequality, or the appointment of judges, it will come through the election of a new president with hefty “coattails” — the capacity to help candidates lower on the party’s ticket. In particular, much will depend on the outcomes of Senate races in a handful of states.
Thus a candidate’s precise positions may matter less than his or her coattails. If you want universal health coverage, a fairer tax system, sensible judges and action on climate change, then you should focus on who is best placed to beat Trump — and on who can most help Democrats like Doug Jones, an endangered senator from Alabama, also win in November.
So is Sanders electable? Can he help Senate Democrats? Frankly, we have no idea, and we all tend to project electability on candidates we like.
“Electability is truly in the eye of the beholder,” notes Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. “We’re all terrible at figuring out who is electable and who isn’t.”
Back in 1980, Sabato noted, some Democrats rejoiced when Republicans nominated an obviously unelectable candidate named Ronald Reagan. Then in 2016, the one thing many pundits agreed on was that Trump was unelectable. So let’s bring some humility to the exercise.
Still, consider who voters say they might support. Gallup finds that 93% of voters now say that they would be willing to vote for a well-qualified woman, up from 33% in 1937. And 96% say they could support a black candidate, up from 38% in 1958. (Voters may exaggerate their own tolerance, but the trend is clear.)
Similarly, 78% of voters say they would be willing to support a gay candidate, up from 29% in 1983. Indeed, Pete Buttigieg might face more resistance because he is young (only 70% are willing to back a candidate under 40) than because he is gay.
Yet there is one kind of candidate that Americans remain hostile to. Only 45% say that they would be willing to vote for a socialist. And Sanders faces another hurdle: Only 69% say they would consider a candidate over 70.
These are generic questions, and it’s possible that voters would warm to a particular septuagenarian socialist, especially when the alternative is a certain septuagenarian Republican. In head-to-head polls against Trump, Sanders does well; all Democrats do similarly. Yet I keep thinking of how British voters recently overwhelmingly reelected a deeply flawed conservative leader over a socialist challenger.
Supporters of Sanders believe that he would greatly increase turnout, but there was no sign of that in Iowa or New Hampshire. Sanders won in New Hampshire only because the liberal wing of the party is uniting around him, while the moderate wing is deeply divided (in some ways, this is an echo of 2016, when Republicans could not coalesce around a rival to Trump).
Joe Biden is the electability candidate who keeps losing. Buttigieg is a brilliant talent but relatively untested. Michael Bloomberg would reassure centrists but is an establishment figure in an anti-establishment moment, and he is particularly unproven in swing states.
In the end, Amy Klobuchar might be the strongest Democratic nominee in swing states. And because she projects “Midwestern unthreatening,” it would be difficult to demonize Senate candidates for associating with her.

Utahns approve of law enforcement’s use of facial recognition technology, poll says

Texto completo: Many Utah lawmakers were alarmed last year when they learned that federal law enforcement had used facial recognition technology to scan thousands of photos in the state’s driver license database for suspects.
Legislators peppered Department of Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson with questions in a September meeting, as a researcher claimed that "nearly every Utah adult has been affected by facial recognition technology.” They debated an initial bill on the issue in November and now are considering a new bill from Sen. Kirk Cullimore, R-Draper.
Despite the uproar, most Utah residents say they approve of law enforcement searching the state database for suspects, according to a recent statewide poll by The Salt Lake Tribune and Suffolk University.
Just over 63% of Utahns polled said they either somewhat approve or strongly approve of law enforcement using the technology to comb the state’s driver license database. Just over 29% disapproved and 7.6% said they didn’t know.
Pollsters surveyed 500 Utahns from Jan. 18 to Jan. 22 over landlines and cellphones. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
Two Utahns who support law enforcement use of the technology told The Tribune that they weren’t worried about police looking at their faces because they haven’t done anything illegal.
“I know there’s reservations, that people are worried that it’s invasive, that it kind of interferes with people’s rights, and I can understand that," said Katie Stack from Ivins, "but at the same time, for me, if you’re not doing anything wrong, why be worried about it?”
Stack, 31, added a caveat to her approval: Facial recognition technology shouldn’t be the end-all, be-all for identifying suspects. It should just be “one piece of the puzzle,” she said.
Darren Day, of North Salt Lake, said he sees the driver license database as just another part of society ripe for data-mining in an increasingly technological world. If one chooses to opt in by getting a license or posting on social media, he said, they also opt in to the consequences of that choice.
“We all know that stuff stays out there,” the 46-year-old said. “If we’re doing improper things, we’re gonna be held accountable.”
ACLU Utah and the libertarian Libertas Institute have both spoken out against use of facial recognition technology in Utah. Connor Boyack, president of the institute, told The Tribune he wasn’t surprised by the poll’s findings — and that they don’t change how lawmakers should feel about the practice.
“You might find similar numbers, or even greater numbers, of people who are supportive of government access to our emails, to our phone calls, to our computers,” he said. “Just because there appears to be many people who are fine with government surveillance does not mean that the government should have unfettered access to surveil people.”
Gay Anthony, 66, agreed with Boyack. The Taylorsville resident said she disapproved of law enforcement looking through the database with facial recognition technology for the same reason she doesn’t like how social media sites somehow know what products she’s interested in purchasing.
“I’ll be talking to my best friend about something, and then it’s on our Facebook Apps," Anthony said. "You know, if we’re talking about going on a cruise or something and then we get advertisements for cruises.”
It’s weird, she said, and an invasion of her privacy.
But privacy isn’t the only concern when it comes to facial recognition technology.
It can also incorrectly identify possible suspects in cases because it sometimes can’t accurately discern between different people of color, women and older and younger people, said Marina Lowe, ACLU Utah’s legislative and policy counsel. Anderson acknowledged some of those points during the September meeting.
In a worst case scenario, Boyack said, the technology could send a SWAT team to someone’s door based on a partial and incorrect facial match and that person could be accidentally shot.
“Is that likely to happen? No,” he said. “Is it within the realm of possibility? Sure.”
When the technology is being used in connection with potential criminal liability for someone, Lowe said, there should be a high level of certainty that it’s pointing out the right person.
“The point is that people should have a say in whether their face is going to be searched by law enforcement,” Lowe said, "especially when they signed up for their face to be captured by the government for an entirely different purpose.”
Utah lawmakers began discussing how to regulate the use of the technology after the Washington Post and New York Times last year reported that the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement mined driver license databases in many states, including Utah, analyzing millions of motorists’ photos without their knowledge.
Since then, a facial recognition technology startup, Clearview AI, has made headlines nationally for scraping photos from social media sites for its own database. Its technology, marketed only to law enforcement agencies, allows investigators to upload, for instance, images from surveillance footage to search for a match.
The New York Times reported last month that the tool “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously."
The Utah attorney general’s office met with Clearview AI to discuss the technology, spokesman Richard Piatt said, but decided not to use it because “it has not been properly vetted.” Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Marissa Cote said DPS isn’t using the technology and doesn’t know of any law enforcement agencies in Utah that are.
To find consensus on rules and protections for using facial recognition technology, Cullimore has been working with groups, including the ACLU, Libertas Institute and the Department of Public Safety. He told The Tribune he’s not sure what those requirements will be just yet, but he hopes to get a bill passed this session.
The legislation, Cullimore said, will likely go further than Sen. Daniel Thatcher’s November proposal, which added a disclaimer when a person applies for a license or government ID that warns the photos would be entered into a database that law enforcement could search it using facial recognition technology. It also codified the existing practice that recognizes DPS is the only state entity authorized to use facial recognition technology.
Cullimore said he hopes the bill will also address the future uses of this technology, such as for live streaming, where law enforcement could conceivably search a crowd for faces in real time.
“Anytime that government can breach what could be deemed as privacy, we need to at least be cautious about it and see that there’s not violations of constitutional rights — or that there could be the perception of that,” he said.
For instance, he asked, if police could search live footage of a protest for faces, could that stymie free speech and assembly? Might people be less likely to show up for fear of being surveilled?
Cullimore said he’s had discussions about adding an opt-in or opt-out feature in the driver’s license application process. Some have suggested the legislation should require a warrant for these kind of searches. Cullimore said he’s skeptical of both those options.
“But,” he conceded, “I guess I’m pretty open right now. I am a little bit hesitant to have these databases used for any and every purpose under the sun, but I recognize that there are legitimate purposes. And so, again, let’s find out where that happy median is.”

Texto completo: Ed Mullins, presidente de la Asociación Benevolente de Sargentos (SBA) de la policía de Nueva York (NYPD), visitó la Casa Blanca ayer, pocos días después de decir que NYPD le había declarado la “guerra” al alcalde Demócrata de NYC, Bill de Blasio.
“Gran reunión en la Casa Blanca hoy”, escribió Mullins al publicar en la cuenta Twitter de la SBA una foto suya en la puerta del edificio.
“La administración Trump es muy consciente de la difícil situación de los agentes de policía en Nueva York y está monitoreando de cerca (…) ¡ Trump nos respalda !”, agregó.
Mullins no precisó con quién se reunió allí. La SBA y la Casa Blanca no respondieron de inmediato la solicitud de comentarios, informó New York Post.
Tras el doble tiroteo a agentes de NYPD el fin de semana en El Bronx, el mandatario Donald Trump fue el primero en encender la llama, recurriendo a Twitter el domingo para acusar al gobernador de NY, Andrew Cuomo , y a De Blasio de tener un “liderazgo débil” y de ser blandos con el crimen, además de dejar a los agentes de NYPD “bajo asalto”, resumió The New York Times.
El sindicato policial SBA lo secundó diciendo que Trump estaba “100 por ciento correcto”. Agregaron que la ciudad estaba “asediada” y que “los miembros de la policía de Nueva York están declarando la guerra al alcalde” por fomentar un ambiente anti-policial.
“¡Alcalde De Blasio, los miembros de la policía de Nueva York están declarando la guerra contra usted!”, dijo el sindicato en su cuenta Twitter. “No lo respetamos, NO nos visite en los hospitales”.
Un día después, el comisionado de policía de Nueva York, Dermot Shea, condenó el mensaje de SBA.
“Cien por ciento es inapropiado”, dijo el jefe policial, dirigiéndose a los periodistas cuando uno de los agentes heridos salió del Hospital Lincoln en El Bronx. “Éste es un momento en el que debemos unirnos ante todo”.
Es un nuevo capítulo de tensiones entre NYPD y el alcalde, el gobernador de Nueva York y hasta Trump, quien ha opinado en varias oportunidades a favor de los policías y en contra de los líderes Demócratas regionales.
Este jueves Cuomo tiene previsto reunirse con Trump para discutir la suspensión que el gobierno federal aplicó al programa “Global Entry” en todo el estado Nueva York, en “castigo” por la legislación que desde diciembre otorga licencias a indocumentados.
Great meeting at the White House today. The Trump administration is very aware of the plight of police officers in NYC and is closely monitoring the situation. @realDonaldTrump has our backs!???????????? pic.twitter.com/TI4NeN0H1l

Texto completo: The Democratic race was messy going into New Hampshire. It’s even messier as it moves on.
Yes, Bernie Sanders won the state’s primary on Tuesday night. And that victory, coming on the heels of his functional tie with Pete Buttigieg in the dysfunctional Iowa caucuses last week, makes him the indisputable front-runner for the Democratic nomination.
But look at how closely behind him Buttigieg finished, despite furious attacks from Sanders and other rivals over recent days. Look at the sudden surge of Amy Klobuchar, whose strong third-place finish demonstrates not only how unsettled the contest is but also how many Democrats crave a moderate — or female — alternative to Sanders.
Note that while Sanders is hugely well known in New Hampshire and beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points in its Democratic primary in 2016, he squeaked by Buttigieg this time around, as many people who voted for him four years ago obviously didn’t do so on Tuesda.
Finally, brace for the days ahead, during which Sanders’ strength will be seriously tested as he comes under brutal assault from Democrats who believe that his nomination would be suicidal for the party and guarantee President Donald Trump’s reelection. Sanders, a cranky 78-year-old who includes “socialist” in his description of his politics, is hardly in the clear.
You expected resolution from New Hampshire? What an optimist you are! And how impatient. Resolution was never likely to happen, not this year, not with Democratic voters’ near-crippling anxiety about the surest path to the far side of Trump, not with this many viable but flawed candidates, not when there’s so much noise in Washington and so much frustration in the air, not when so many voters have stopped taking cues from the institutions and traditions they frequently turned to in the past.
Elizabeth Warren was endorsed by respected media organizations. No matter. She finished fourth in New Hampshire, with less than 10% of the vote, though she had lavished hope, energy and resources on the state, next door to Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate.
Joe Biden has high-profile surrogates galore, is as conventionally prepared for the presidency as a human being could be and basks in the vestigial good will that many Democratic voters feel toward President Barack Obama’s administration. None of that did him any good. He finished fifth, with less than 9%, and the dearth of confidence in him following his fourth-place showing in Iowa deepened, perhaps irreparably.
But add Biden’s, Buttigieg’s and Klobuchar’s votes in New Hampshire and they far exceed those for the two prominent progressives, Sanders and Warren. Democrats’ appetite for a nominee less liberal than Sanders is real.
But is there a moderate around whom voters can coalesce?
Buttigieg’s enormously impressive performance in the first two states would make him the natural choice, except that he’s 38, he still lags far behind Biden and Sanders in national polls, his highest office to date is mayor of a city of 100,000 people, and he now moves on to two states, Nevada and then South Carolina, where his utter lack of traction with voters of color could undo his candidacy.
Klobuchar’s sudden surge may well be too little too late, even at this early stage of the contest. Besides, there’s little evidence that she will do significantly better with African American and Latino voters than Buttigieg.
This uncertainty about the Sanders alternative is why you’ll be hearing even more about Mike Bloomberg over the next week than you did over the past one, when you heard plenty. This and the fact that he’ll continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to implant his name in your brain.
The premium on becoming the moderate answer to Sanders was obvious in the speeches by Klobuchar, Buttigieg and even Warren to their supporters on Tuesday night.
“Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is that the people in the middle — the people who have had enough of the name calling and the mud slinging — have someone to vote for in November,” Klobuchar said. She was presenting herself as that someone.
Buttigieg, aware that Klobuchar probably siphoned votes from him in New Hampshire and could do so again down the road, urged Democrats to support a newcomer like him over a longtime senator and Washington insider like her. “Election after election has shown us that putting forward a new perspective is how Democrats win the White House,” he said, returning again and again to the idea that his was a uniquely inclusive campaign with a singularly far-reaching appeal.
And Warren, who months ago competed with Sanders for progressive votes, continued her assiduous repositioning as a candidate able to bridge progressives and moderates. “We will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels like they can get behind,” she said, bemoaning “the fight between factions of our party.”
Now what? I keep hearing Democratic friends grouse that the party’s members need to get on the same page, as if they can be magically muscled there. I keep seeing references in the media to the Democratic establishment and to party leaders, as if those are meaningful forces with indisputable impact.
Maybe they once were, but Trump’s political ascent — which happened, remember, in defiance of the supposed Republican establishment and Republican leaders — demonstrated that the era of an external, elite authority being able to impose its will was over.
That era preceded the explosion of social media. That era was less pessimistic about the country’s trajectory, less cynical about politics and politicians, more faithful on various fronts. That era was less suited to a disruptive iconoclast like Trump — and to a disruptive iconoclast like Sanders.
Sanders will be a major force in the Democratic race until the end. He’s perhaps the only candidate about whom that can definitively be said. He seemed jubilant as he declared victory on Tuesday night, telling his supporters: “We have an unprecedented grassroots movement from coast to coast of millions of people. The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multigenerational, multiracial political movement.”
Not so fast. Younger voters are much more taken with him than older ones. His dominance in the primary at present hinges on the scattered affections of less progressive Democrats.
And this movement isn’t driving voters to the polls in the manner that he and his allies have vowed that it would. Democratic turnout in New Hampshire on Tuesday, like turnout in Iowa last week, wasn’t spectacularly robust.
That means that Sanders, so strong, has weaknesses, just as Buttigieg, so weak in a few ways, keeps flexing unexpected strengths. Mixed signals, a muddle of moderates and Biden on political life support: That’s the Democratic primary, which refuses to conform to predictions or follow any tidy script. Get comfortable with your discomfort. I suspect you’ll be feeling it for a while.

The Dangerous Denial of Sex; Transgender ideology harms women, gays—and especially feminine boys and masculine girls.

Texto completo: Transgender ideology can take on a comical character, as in a recent American Civil Liberties Union commentary objecting to sales tax on tampons and similar products while pondering: "How can we recognize that barriers to menstrual access are a form of sex discrimination without erasing the lived experiences of trans men and non-binary people who menstruate, as well as women who don't?"
Yet it's one thing to claim that a man can "identify" as a woman or vice versa. Increasingly we see a dangerous and antiscientific trend toward the outright denial of biological sex.
"The idea of two sexes is simplistic," an article in the scientific journal Nature declared in 2015. "Biologists now think there is a wider spectrum than that." A 2018 Scientific American piece asserted that "biologists now think there is a larger spectrum than just binary female and male." And an October 2018 New York Times headline promised to explain "Why Sex Is Not Binary."
The argument is that because some people are intersex—they have developmental conditions resulting in ambiguous sex characteristics—the categories male and female exist on a "spectrum," and are therefore no more than "social constructs." If male and female are merely arbitrary groupings, it follows that everyone, regardless of genetics or anatomy should be free to choose to identify as male or female, or to reject sex entirely in favor of a new bespoke "gender identity."
To characterize this line of reasoning as having no basis in reality would be an egregious understatement. It is false at every conceivable scale of resolution.
In humans, as in most animals or plants, an organism's biological sex corresponds to one of two distinct types of reproductive anatomy that develop for the production of small or large sex cells—sperm and eggs, respectively—and associated biological functions in sexual reproduction. In humans, reproductive anatomy is unambiguously male or female at birth more than 99.98% of the time. The evolutionary function of these two anatomies is to aid in reproduction via the fusion of sperm and ova. No third type of sex cell exists in humans, and therefore there is no sex "spectrum" or additional sexes beyond male and female. Sex is binary.
There is a difference, however, between the statements that there are only two sexes (true) and that everyone can be neatly categorized as either male or female (false). The existence of only two sexes does not mean sex is never ambiguous. But intersex individuals are extremely rare, and they are neither a third sex nor proof that sex is a "spectrum" or a "social construct." Not everyone needs to be discretely assignable to one or the other sex in order for biological sex to be functionally binary. To assume otherwise—to confuse secondary sexual traits with biological sex itself—is a category error.
Denying the reality of biological sex and supplanting it with subjective "gender identity" is not merely an eccentric academic theory. It raises serious human-rights concerns for vulnerable groups including women, homosexuals and children.
Women have fought hard for sex-based legal protections. Female-only spaces are necessary due to the pervasive threat of male violence and sexual assault. Separate sporting categories are also necessary to ensure that women and girls don't have to face competitors who have acquired the irreversible performance-enhancing effects conferred by male puberty. The different reproductive roles of males and females require laws to safeguard women from discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. The falsehood that sex is rooted in subjective identity instead of objective biology renders all these sex-based rights impossible to enforce.
The denial of biological sex also erases homosexuality, as same-sex attraction is meaningless without the distinction between the sexes. Many activists now define homosexuality as attraction to the "same gender identity" rather than the same sex. This view is at odds with the scientific understanding of human sexuality. Lesbians have been denounced as "bigots" for expressing a reluctance to date men who identify as women. The successful normalization of homosexuality could be undermined by miring it in an untenable ideology.
Those most vulnerable to sex denialism are children. When they're taught that sex is grounded in identity instead of biology, sex categories can easily become conflated with regressive stereotypes of masculinity and femininity. Masculine girls and feminine boys may become confused about their own sex. The dramatic rise of "gender dysphoric" adolescents—especially young girls—in clinics likely reflects this new cultural confusion.
The large majority of gender-dysphoric youths eventually outgrow their feelings of dysphoria during puberty, and many end up identifying as homosexual adults. "Affirmation" therapies, which insist a child's cross-sex identity should never be questioned, and puberty-blocking drugs, advertised as a way for children to "buy time" to sort out their identities, may only solidify feelings of dysphoria, setting them on a pathway to more invasive medical interventions and permanent infertility. This pathologizing of sex-atypical behavior is extremely worrying and regressive. It is similar to gay "conversion" therapy, except that it's now bodies instead of minds that are being converted to bring children into "proper" alignment with themselves.
The time for politeness on this issue has passed. Biologists and medical professionals need to stand up for the empirical reality of biological sex. When authoritative scientific institutions ignore or deny empirical fact in the name of social accommodation, it is an egregious betrayal to the scientific community they represent. It undermines public trust in science, and it is dangerously harmful to those most vulnerable.

Texto completo: Terrifying violence aimed at New York Police Department officers took place over the weekend in the Bronx.
A lone gunman allegedly shot at police officers in two incidents — one late Saturday and another in the police precinct on Sunday. Cops arrested the gunman, and two officers suffered minor injuries and have been released from the hospital.
But perhaps the more long-term damage was done to the quality of public discourse in our city. Leaders took the shooting as an opportunity to push back against justified police protests. Mayor Bill de Blasio essentially accused demonstrators of "aiding and abetting this kind of atmosphere. "
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea stated that "these things," referring to protests against police use of force and the cop shootings, "are not unrelated. "
These comments are intellectually dishonest. They wrongly connect someone who appears to be a mentally disturbed shooter to New Yorkers exercising their constitutional rights. But more than that, they ignore the very real struggles of people being victimized by cops daily, not just in New York but all over the country.
Targeting people of color
The week prior to these shootings, hundreds of New Yorkers marched through Grand Central Terminal protesting the presence of police on subways.
The demonstrators objected to, among other things, the excessive use of force and inappropriate tactics that subway police sometimes employ. Moments, like the one earlier this month when a cop pushed a teenager out of a subway station who was attempting to walk through an open gate, have been caught on video and gone viral on social media.
Yet the powers that be often look the other way. In that case, the NYPD stated that the video didn't tell the entire story and that the girl, who was African American, had tried to jump the turnstile. Students can ride for free with a school-issued subway card. The officer told the girl she could no longer ride the subway.
Last year, an NYPD officer pulled a gun on another black teen who was sitting in a subway car with his hands in the air. Several officers can be seen in that viral video wrestling the young male, who does not appear to be resisting, to the ground.
There are stark racial biases reflected in the sanctions (including arrests and summonses) that the police impose for subway fare violations.
Last year, the city issued about 65,000 sanctions for subway fee evasion (that's about 180 sanctions per day). And about 85% of "theft of services" sanctions, which in addition to turnstile jumping can include other infractions like not paying for cab fare, involved New Yorkers of color who were either black or Hispanic.
Police are regularly directed to target black and brown communities and people, including on the subway system, according to a New York Times report about cops suing the NYPD for discrimination.
If that wasn't enough, recordings released recently of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg reveal the former New York mayor's 2015 philosophy on policing and race. In a statement, he pushed cops to target minorities and encouraged officers to go where the crime was. For him, that meant black and brown communities.
Right after news of the shootings broke, de Blasio and Shea rushed to a harsh negative judgement. In an irresponsible act of intellectual dishonesty, they laid blame for the shootings at the feet of demonstrators.
No city official or agency, including the police, has established a link between the protests and the apprehended shooter, Robert Williams.
By many accounts, Williams, 45, has led a miserable and violence-prone life. His first encounter with police came when he was 14, for robbery. He returned to the system multiple times and was released from prison in 2017 after serving a lengthy sentence for attempted murder.
According to reports, the accidental shooting death of Williams' son, Robert Williams Jr. , drove him over the edge. A case can be made that Williams' repeated encounters with law enforcement, including long stretches in prison, turned him into a ticking time bomb.
Criticizing protesters is a diversion
New York isn't the only major city targeted by protesters, and de Blasio and Shea aren't the first government and law enforcement officials to make pronouncements calling for legitimate protesters to tamp down their rhetoric.
Attorney General William Barr made similar statements in December when speaking to cops during an awards ceremony. He stated that if communities (meaning protesters) don't show sufficient respect to police, "they might find themselves without the police protection they need. "
These comments intentionally seek to divert attention from a central, relevant truth. For the many New Yorkers (and I would say protesters nationwide) who fear, loathe and distrust the police, there are all-too-substantive reasons: the daily targeting, harassment and harm inflicted on poor people and people of color.
Until policymakers take steps to end rather than protect and promote these abusive, biased practices, the protests will continue.
And they should.
The demonstrators carrying them out, protected by our Constitution's Bill of Rights, should not have to fear verbal attacks from the most powerful officials representing our government.

Could A Keto Diet Be Bad For Athletes’ Bones?

Texto completo: A low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet could alter bone health in athletes, according to a thought-provoking new study of elite racewalkers and their skeletons. The study, one of the first to track athletes during several weeks of intense training, finds that those following a ketogenic diet developed early signs indicative of bone loss.
The study adds to the considerable existing evidence that how we eat can affect how exercise affects us. It also raises concerns about possible, long-term health effects from popular diet plans, including a high-fat, ketogenic diet.
Anyone interested in health, wellness, weight loss, exercise, food or bestseller lists is familiar, by now, with ketogenic diets. Known more familiarly as keto diets, they are extremely low-carbohydrate, high-fat regimens, with as much as 90% of daily calories coming from fats.
Ketogenic diets, if followed scrupulously, reshape how our bodies fuel themselves. Because carbohydrates can be rapidly metabolized, our bodies typically turn to them first for energy, whether the carbohydrates come from our diets or stored sources in our muscles and livers.
But if people follow a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet, they soon burn through their stored carbohydrates and their bodies start relying on fat for energy. The fat must be broken down first, however, and, as part of that process, the liver creates substances known as ketone bodies that can be converted into energy.
Ketogenic diets are popular now among people hoping to lose weight, control blood sugar or otherwise regulate their health. Some athletes also follow the diet, hoping that it will improve performance, since fat, as fuel, is ample, slow-burning and long-lasting.
Some studies have suggested, though, that low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets might change bone metabolism. In athletes, going for a day or two without carbohydrates can change some blood markers related to bone health.
But no experiments had tracked bone metabolism in competitive athletes on ketogenic diets for longer periods of time. So, for the new study, which was published in January in Frontiers in Endocrinology, researchers in Australia decided to ask a group of world-class racewalkers if they could fiddle with their food for a few weeks. Thirty of the athletes, all of whom were about to embark on intense training for upcoming world championships and other competitions, agreed. The athletes then sorted themselves into two groups, based on whether they were willing to try a keto diet or not.
About half said that they were and subsequently began a strict low-carbohydrate, high-fat routine. The other men and women continued with a high-carbohydrate diet.
Before the diets kicked off, though, the researchers drew blood from the athletes before and after a workout, to establish their baseline bone health and other markers of their health and fitness.
Then the athletes embarked on 3½ weeks of intense training, while eating mostly fat or mostly carbs. Afterward, the researchers again drew their blood and rechecked the markers of bone health.
They found differences. The markers of bone breakdown were higher now among the athletes on the keto diet than at the start of the study, while those indicating bone formation and overall metabolism were lower. These same markers were generally unchanged in the high-carb athletes. The athletes on the ketogenic diet, in other words, showed signs of impaired bone health.
How their bones might have been affected by their eating is still unclear, said Louise Burke, the head of sports nutrition at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra and one of the lead authors of the new study.
“We believe that the keto diet may affect bone metabolism due to the downstream effects of low-carbohydrate availability on certain hormones, along with other factors,” she said. But more study, of course, is needed.
The researchers also did not look directly at changes, if any, in the athletes’ bone density or follow them beyond 3½ weeks. Whether any worrisome effects on bone health would linger, intensify or disappear after a longer period of high-fat eating remains unknown, as does the question of whether those of us who are not world-class racewalkers would be similarly affected, if we work out while eschewing carbs.
But the study does remind us that the interplay of nutrition and exercise is intricate, and we do not yet fully understand its implications for our health.
Burke and her colleagues plan to study the longer-term effects of ketogenic diets and exercise in future studies.

Texto completo: A low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet could alter bone health in athletes, according to a thought-provoking new study of elite racewalkers and their skeletons. The study, one of the first to track athletes during several weeks of intense training, finds that those following a ketogenic diet developed early signs indicative of bone loss.
The study adds to the considerable existing evidence that how we eat can affect how exercise affects us. It also raises concerns about possible, long-term health effects from popular diet plans, including a high-fat, ketogenic diet.
Anyone interested in health, wellness, weight loss, exercise, food or bestseller lists is familiar, by now, with ketogenic diets. Known more familiarly as keto diets, they are extremely low-carbohydrate, high-fat regimens, with as much as 90% of daily calories coming from fats.
Ketogenic diets, if followed scrupulously, reshape how our bodies fuel themselves. Because carbohydrates can be rapidly metabolized, our bodies typically turn to them first for energy, whether the carbohydrates come from our diets or stored sources in our muscles and livers.
But if people follow a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet, they soon burn through their stored carbohydrates and their bodies start relying on fat for energy. The fat must be broken down first, however, and, as part of that process, the liver creates substances known as ketone bodies that can be converted into energy.
Ketogenic diets are popular now among people hoping to lose weight, control blood sugar or otherwise regulate their health. Some athletes also follow the diet, hoping that it will improve performance, since fat, as fuel, is ample, slow-burning and long-lasting.
Some studies have suggested, though, that low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets might change bone metabolism. In athletes, going for a day or two without carbohydrates can change some blood markers related to bone health.

Britons debate role of race in Royal family

Texto completo: LONDON - It has been a month since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced that they would "step back" as senior members of the British royal family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex can no longer use their "royal highness" titles and will no longer receive public funds for their royal duties.
The couple - he is 35, she 38 - and their 9-month-old son, Archie, have been relaxing on the west coast of British Columbia. They were recently spotted in Miami, where they attended a private function for JPMorgan and dined with Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez. There are reports that the couple are looking for a house in Los Angeles.
The British have a lot on their minds - it was only last month that the nation formally exited the European Union, ending a tumultuous 47-year affair with the Continent - but it is clear, at least from recent conversations with Londoners, that the royal couple's departure is still fresh in people's consciousness. For a nation that has long grappled with its identity, and with its former status as an empire, the question of race looms large.
In 2018, when Markle, a Los Angeles-born divorced former actress whose mother is African American, married Harry, the sixth in line to the British throne, some observers heralded it as a "post-racial" moment. An African American minister, the Most Rev. Michael Curry, delivered a stirring sermon. The Kingdom Choir, a British gospel group, performed "Stand by Me," a tune made famous by the African American singer-songwriter Ben E. King.
Inevitably, their marriage appears to have revealed complex dimensions of race, class, power and privilege, rather than resolving them.
Slavery helped build modern Britain; at its peak, the British Empire covered a fourth of the world's land mass. Over the past 75 years, since the end of World War II, Britain has struggled to change from empire to commonwealth, and from colossus to mere country; its debates over how much it should integrate with the rest of Europe have been emblematic of that struggle.
In an opinion essay last month in The New York Times, Afua Hirsch, a black British journalist who teaches journalism at the University of Southern California, said the reasons for Markle's departure from the royal system were of no surprise to black Britons, noting racist headlines in The Daily Mail, a tabloid, about Markle being "(almost) straight outta Compton" and having "exotic" DNA.
Even before the couple married, they complained of vicious treatment by the press; in an extraordinary 2016 statement, the royal family condemned "the racial undertones" of commentary directed at the couple.
"No matter how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy, charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will still follow you," Hirsch wrote.
In an interview, Hirsch said that in the United States, "people acknowledge that race is a thing," whereas in Britain, "all of our energy is expended trying to prove it exists."
Hirsch said that some Britons maintain a sense of moral superiority because Britain was not home to the chattel slavery that existed in societies from Brazil to Cuba to the United States. And yet, it was not until 1807 that the British Empire abolished the slave trade, and British merchants and landowners operated plantations across the Caribbean well into the 19th century.
Hirsch's narrative touched off debate. Writing in the conservative newspaper The Telegraph, columnist Sherelle Jacobs argued that Hirsch "conveniently overlooks the overwhelmingly fawning coverage that the duke and duchess enjoyed, from their engagement to their wedding day," and the harm the couple might have done to their own reputations. "Emotional baggage from our country's legacy of aristocratic privilege has endowed Middle England with the kind of stridently meritocratic values that are a complete anathema to judging people by their color," Jacobs argued.
In recent interviews, a number of black Londoners said the role of race could not be denied.
"In British society, people want to say racism doesn't exist," said Esther Adjepong, a 35-year-old musician who lives in Brixton, a South London neighborhood with a historically large Afro-Caribbean community. She said that addressing race is like "banging your head against a brick wall," adding: "You can be a black person in this country screaming out 'I'm discriminated against,' and you'll just be told, 'No, you're not. What are you talking about?'"
The reality Markle has endured is familiar to Adjepong. "We recognize that as being racially motivated because it's how we are treated and have to navigate society," she said. "People aren't willing to just be honest and open their eyes to see what's right in front of them."
Amy Francis, 73, a retiree who lives in the borough of Wandsworth in southwest London, said the couple's departure should serve as a rebuke to British society. "May they shame the public and live together till death do they part," she said. "Leaving was right. They need freedom. I'm glad they're free."
She added: People don't "love Meghan, because she's black."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump's former communications director, Hope Hicks, is set to return to the White House where she will focus on shaping the Republican's political operation as he approaches re-election.
Ms. Hicks left the administration last February and took a role at Fox. In October, she became chief communications officer at Fox, a new company that includes 21st Century Fox Inc.'s entertainment and news assets that weren't sold to Walt Disney Co.
Fox Co-Chairman Rupert Murdoch is also executive chairman of Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.
Ms. Hicks is expected to return to the White House in the coming weeks as a counselor to the president, administration officials said. She will report to Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser who is overseeing the re-election bid. Her return was first reported by the New York Times.
Ms. Hicks has been one of Mr. Trump's longest-serving aides and confidantes. She handled communications responsibilities for the 2016 campaign and followed the president into the White House.

Texto completo: Dear reader:
Michael Bloomberg’s path to the Democratic presidential nomination remains wide open. Yes, Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary yesterday – but just by a hair and with less than 26 percent of the vote. The Democratic field is splintered.
That feeds right into the Bloomberg playbook: open the mega-billionaire’s wallet, flood the airwaves with ads, rake in endorsements (notably, so far, from mayors of cities with large African American populations), and watch Democratic voter support grow. The former New York City mayor is now averaging third place in national polls of Democrats.
Mr. Bloomberg’s plan is to compete in the primaries starting March 3, Super Tuesday. He certainly has his work cut out. He has to perform well in the coming debates, if he actually participates (and assuming he will qualify). He also has to overcome deep concerns about his record as mayor, notably his “stop and frisk” policy. A recording released this week by a progressive podcaster had Mr. Bloomberg defending the policy in blunt terms long after he had left office. In responding, the ex-mayor made claims that a New York Times fact-checker found misleading.
But Mr. Bloomberg is still very much in the hunt. And he has long been on Team Trump’s radar. At a Monitor Breakfast in August 2018, Corey Lewandowski – President Donald Trump’s first campaign manager and still an informal adviser – was asked who he thought would be the president’s toughest challenger in 2020. His response: Mr. Bloomberg.
"Michael Bloomberg has created tens of thousands of jobs... That is a story the American people like, and he’s an outsider. So I think it would be a very, very competitive race," Mr. Lewandowski said.
To see his full response, watch this C-SPAN clip starting at the 1:20 mark.
Now, President Trump says he would rather face Mr. Bloomberg over the Vermont senator, “because Sanders has real followers.” Mr. Lewandowski, speaking on Fox News, agreed. Both also highlighted Senator Sanders’ democratic socialist views. We think that’s the real point. And if one considers which Democrat Mr. Trump spends the most time attacking , then it may be that Mr. Lewandowski had it right the first time.

Texto completo: HONG KONG - Jade Doringo arrived at Manila's international airport more than five hours before her scheduled departure to Hong Kong, where she worked as a software engineer. But instead of getting on her flight, she was asked to surrender her boarding pass.
That morning, Feb. 2, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines had announced a temporary travel ban that barred flights arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. At the airport, officials told Doringo that the ban also applied to Filipino travelers going in the opposite direction.
As the new coronavirus has spread around the world, several countries have issued restrictions on travelers arriving from mainland China. The Philippines, which has reported one death from the virus, is unusual in imposing rules that prevent its citizens from traveling also to Hong Kong and Macao, semi-autonomous Chinese territories.
Doringo is among hundreds of Filipinos whose lives have been upended as they find themselves unable to return to their jobs in the two cities. "Imagine the confusion we felt at that time, not knowing everything," she said in a phone interview last week.
Doringo had been sitting at the gate, watching as the crew waited for approval to board the flight and listening as airline employees repeated an announcement about the new travel ban. At 4 p.m., all Filipino passport holders were asked to go to immigration. Around her, domestic workers called their employers in Hong Kong, their voices rising in panic.
Then her suitcase got lost. But there was little else she could do besides huddle together with the other grounded passengers. Most of them had not eaten since that morning.
At 11 p.m., Doringo left the terminal empty-handed.
She had moved to Hong Kong two years ago with dreams of creating a better life for her family. The job in Hong Kong paid a better salary than what she would have earned back home, and soon after starting she was able to buy a plot of land in her rural province. She began setting aside money every month to build a house for her family.
She missed them constantly, particularly during the chaos of the past seven months when Hong Kong was rocked by anti-government demonstrations. Her homesickness only intensified in late January as the coronavirus spread.
"Protests, disease, the loneliness of living alone - all of this triggers the longing of going back home," she wrote in an Instagram post Jan. 25 before she returned to the Philippines for a nine-day vacation. "To your real home."
That trip started out in Manila, where she took her siblings and their families to eat lechón, a spit-roasted suckling pig, at a mall.
Later, she returned to her hometown in the countryside and rode on a motorized tricycle with her father to a creek near where she planned to build a house for them. Her mother cooked her a steaming beef broth. She cried, feeling relieved to be under their roof.
"I get to eat in Hong Kong, but it's different when you get to share the meals with your family," she said.
When it came time for her to return to Hong Kong, her brother bought a box of masks for her, and her parents nagged her to be careful. She ended up spending all day at the airport after her flight was canceled, then stayed at her brother's home in Manila. Her lost luggage showed up two days later.
Her supervisor gave her permission to work remotely, but she was worried about being absent for too long.
"As overseas Filipino workers, none of us can afford to lose our jobs," she said.
Doringo still is not sure when she will be able to return to Hong Kong. But she has stocked up on masks, rubbing alcohol and snacks so that when she does, she will not have to venture outdoors.
"I am afraid to get sick. We all are, but it's our decision to take the risk," she said.

Texto completo: The news seemed to be positive: The number of new coronavirus cases reported in China over the past week suggested that the outbreak might be slowing -- that containment efforts were working. Stocks ticked upward in the United States, as some analysts declared it safe again to invest in companies that depend on China.
But Thursday, officials added more than 14,840 new cases to the tally of the infected in Hubei province alone, bringing the total number to 48,206 -- the largest one-day increase recorded. The death toll in the province rose to 1,310, including 242 new deaths.
The sharp rise in reported cases illustrates how hard it still is to grasp the extent and severity of the coronavirus outbreak in China, particularly inside the epicenter, where thousands of sick people remain untested for the illness.
The authorities were confronted by so many people with symptoms -- and such a shortage of kits to test officially for the virus -- that they had to change the way the illness is diagnosed.
Hospitals in Wuhan -- the largest city in Hubei province and the center of the epidemic -- have struggled to diagnose infections with scarce and complicated tests that detect the virus's genetic signature directly.
Officials now seem to be including infections observed on lung scans alone. This shortcut will help get more patients into needed care, provincial officials said, but it also shows the enormous number of people who are sick and have not been counted in the official tally of the outbreak.
The few experts to learn of the new numbers Wednesday night were startled.
"We're in unknown territory," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
Doctors in China probably don't have the chemicals necessary to perform complicated testing, and perhaps insufficient numbers of technicians, he speculated.
But lung scans are a perilous means to diagnose patients. Even patients with seasonal flu may develop pneumonia visible on a lung scan.
"They're talking about using this as another diagnostic test, but we haven't seen it validated by data," Schaffner said.
A social media campaign started by a physician in Wuhan last week called for using CT scans to simplify the screening of patients suspected of having the coronavirus and accelerate their hospitalization and treatment, instead of waiting for test results.
CT scans produce immediate results, she said, and Wuhan was running short of testing kits.
The change in diagnosis may make it harder to track the epidemic, said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.
"It makes it really confusing right now if they're changing the whole way they screen and detect," he said. Now estimating the scale of the epidemic "is a moving target."
The news is the latest in a set of confusing data points suggesting the epidemic is far from contained.

Sanders prevails. Cue the Democratic Party panic. [Corrected 02/15/2020]

Texto completo: The Democratic race was messy going into New Hampshire. It's even messier as it moves on.
Yes, Bernie Sanders won the state's primary Tuesday night. And that victory, coming on the heels of his functional tie with Pete Buttigieg in the dysfunctional Iowa caucuses last week, makes him the indisputable front-runner for the Democratic nomination.
But look at how closely behind him Buttigieg finished, despite furious attacks from Sanders and other rivals over recent days. Look at the sudden surge of Amy Klobuchar, whose strong third-place finish demonstrates not only how unsettled the contest is but also how many Democrats crave a moderate -- or female -- alternative to Sanders.
Note that while Sanders is hugely well-known in New Hampshire and beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points in its Democratic primary in 2016, he squeaked by Buttigieg this time around, as many people who voted for him four years ago obviously didn't do so on Tuesday night.
Finally, brace for the days ahead, during which Sanders' strength will be seriously tested as he comes under brutal assault from Democrats who believe that his nomination would be suicidal for the party and guarantee President Donald Trump's reelection. Sanders, a cranky 78-year-old who includes "socialist" in his description of his politics, is hardly in the clear.
You expected resolution from New Hampshire? What an optimist you are! And how impatient. Resolution was never likely to happen, not this year, not with Democratic voters' near-crippling anxiety about the surest path to the far side of Trump, not with this many viable but flawed candidates, not when there's so much noise in Washington and so much frustration in the air, not when so many voters have stopped taking cues from the institutions and traditions they frequently turned to in the past.
Elizabeth Warren was endorsed by respected media organizations. No matter. She finished fourth in New Hampshire, with less than 10% of the vote, though she had lavished hope, energy and resources on the state, next door to Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate.
Joe Biden has high-profile surrogates galore, is as conventionally prepared for the presidency as a human being could be, and basks in the vestigial good will that many Democratic voters feel toward President Barack Obama's administration. None of that did him any good. He finished fifth, with less than 9%, and the dearth of confidence in him following his fourth-place showing in Iowa deepened, perhaps irreparably.
But add Biden's, Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's votes in New Hampshire and they far exceed those for the two prominent progressives, Sanders and Warren. Democrats' appetite for a nominee less liberal than Sanders is real.
But is there a moderate around whom voters can coalesce?
Buttigieg's enormously impressive performance in the first two states would make him the natural choice, except that he's 38, he still lags far behind Biden and Sanders in national polls, his highest office to date is mayor of a city of 100,000 people and he now moves on to two states, Nevada and then South Carolina, where his utter lack of traction with voters of color could undo his candidacy.
Klobuchar's sudden surge may well be too little too late, even at this early stage of the contest. Besides, there's little evidence that she will do significantly better with African American and Latino voters than Buttigieg.
This uncertainty about the Sanders alternative is why you'll be hearing even more about Mike Bloomberg over the next week than you did over the past one, when you heard plenty. This and the fact that he'll continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to implant his name in your brain.
The premium on becoming the moderate answer to Sanders was obvious in the speeches by Klobuchar, Buttigieg and even Warren to their supporters on Tuesday night.
"Donald Trump's worst nightmare is that the people in the middle -- the people who have had enough of the name calling and the mud slinging -- have someone to vote for in November," Klobuchar said. She was presenting herself as that someone.
Buttigieg, aware that Klobuchar probably siphoned votes from him in New Hampshire and could do so again down the road, urged Democrats to support a newcomer like him over a longtime senator and Washington insider like her. "Election after election has shown us that putting forward a new perspective is how Democrats win the White House," he said, returning again and again to the idea that his was a uniquely inclusive campaign with a singularly far-reaching appeal.
And Warren, who months ago competed with Sanders for progressive votes, continued her assiduous repositioning as a candidate able to bridge progressives and moderates. "We will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels like they can get behind," she said, bemoaning "the fight between factions of our party."
Now what? I keep hearing Democratic friends grouse that the party's members need to get on the same page, as if they can be magically muscled there. I keep seeing references in the media to the Democratic establishment and to party leaders, as if those are meaningful forces with indisputable impact.
Maybe they once were, but Trump's political ascent -- which happened, remember, in defiance of the supposed Republican establishment and Republican leaders -- demonstrated that the era of an external, elite authority being able to impose its will was over.
That era preceded the explosion of social media. That era was less pessimistic about the country's trajectory, less cynical about politics and politicians, more faithful on various fronts. That era was less suited to a disruptive iconoclast like Trump -- and to a disruptive iconoclast like Sanders.
Sanders will be a major force in the Democratic race until the end. He's perhaps the only candidate about whom that can definitively be said. He seemed jubilant as he declared victory on Tuesday night, telling his supporters: "We have an unprecedented grassroots movement from coast to coast of millions of people. The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multigenerational, multiracial political movement."
Not so fast. Younger voters are much more taken with him than older ones. His dominance in the primary at present hinges on the scattered affections of less progressive Democrats.
And this movement isn't driving voters to the polls in the manner that he and his allies have vowed that it would. Democratic turnout in New Hampshire on Tuesday, like turnout in Iowa last week, wasn't spectacularly robust.
That means that Sanders, so strong, has weaknesses, just as Buttigieg, so weak in a few ways, keeps flexing unexpected strengths. Mixed signals, a muddle of moderates and Biden on political life support: That's the Democratic primary, which refuses to conform to predictions or follow any tidy script. Get comfortable with your discomfort. I suspect you'll be feeling it for a while.

Amazon fells the Third Reich

Texto completo: Amazon is quietly canceling its Nazis.
Over the past 18 months, the retailer has removed two books by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, as well as several titles by George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. Amazon has also prohibited volumes like "The Ruling Elite: The Zionist Seizure of World Power" and "A History of Central Banking and the Enslavement of Mankind."
While few may lament the disappearance of these hate-filled books, the increasing number of banished titles has set off concern among some of the third-party booksellers who stock Amazon's virtual shelves. Amazon, they said, seems to operate under vague or nonexistent rules.
"Amazon reserves the right to determine whether content provides an acceptable experience," said one recent removal notice that the company sent to a bookseller.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have been roiled in recent years by controversies that pit freedom of speech against offensive content. Amazon has largely escaped this debate. But with millions of third-party merchants supplying much of what Amazon sells to tens of millions of customers, that ability to maintain a low profile may be reaching its end.
Amazon began as a bookstore and, even as it has moved on to many more lucrative projects, now controls at least two-thirds of the market for new, used and digital volumes in the United States.
With its profusion of reader reviews, ability to cut prices without worrying about profitability and its control of the electronic book landscape, to name only three advantages, Amazon has immense power to shape what information people are consuming.
Yet the retailer declines to provide a list of prohibited books, say how they were chosen or even discuss the topic. "Booksellers make decisions every day about what selection of books they choose to offer," it said in a statement.
Gregory Delzer is a Tennessee bookseller whose Amazon listings account for about a third of his sales. "They don't tell us the rules and don't let us have a say," he said. "But they squeeze us for every penny."
When Amazon drops a book from its store, it is as if it never existed. A recent Google search for Duke's "My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding" on Amazon yielded a link to a picture of an Amazon employee's dog. Amazon sellers call these dead ends "dog pages."
Some booksellers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said they had no problem with the retailer converting as many offensive books to dog pages as it wished.
Now Amazon is becoming increasingly proactive in removing Nazi material. It even allowed its own Nazi-themed show, "The Man in the High Castle," to be cleaned up for a tribute book. The series, which began in 2015 and concluded in November, is set in a parallel U.S. where Germany and Japan won World War II.
"High Castle" is lavish in its use of National Socialist symbols. "There's nothing that there isn't a swastika on," actor Rufus Sewell, who played the Nazi antihero, said in a promotional video.
But in "The Man in the High Castle: Creating the Alt World," published in November by Titan Books, the swastikas and eagle-and-crosses were digitally erased from Sewell's uniform, from Times Square and the Statue of Liberty, even from scenes set in Berlin.
An Amazon spokeswoman said, "We did not make editorial edits to the images." Titan, which wanted to market the book in Germany, where laws on Nazi imagery are strict, said Amazon approved the changes.

Texto completo: No piece of furniture says "me time" quite like a chaise lounge. With its reclined back and elevated feet, it offers the promise of serenity in a package designed for just one person.
"It's great for creating a secondary space that's tucked away and a little more private" than a home's social spaces, said Corie Sharples, a founding partner of New York-based SHoP Architects, where she leads the interiors group.
A chaise lounge is ideal in a library, a corner of the master bedroom or an alcove off the living room. And because it usually sits by itself, it can be more sculptural than other pieces of furniture.
"A chaise is always a statement piece," Sharples said.
Of course, because it's so comfortable, it also runs the risk of being monopolized by unintended users. The chaise lounge in Sharples' home, for instance, has been claimed by the dogs: "It's where they like to play king of the hill."

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders' victory in New Hampshire has driven the Democratic Party establishment into mass hysterics.
Now they rush to embrace multibillionaire Mike Bloomberg, the former Republican mayor of New York City, to save them from President Donald Trump.
Bloomberg is buying this thing.
They're afraid of young people voting. But if they want a "moderate," they've got Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who came in third in New Hampshire, beating former can't-miss candidates Sen. Elizabeth "Pow Wow Chow" Warren and former Vice President Joe "Dead Man Walking to South Carolina" Biden.
"Lying dog-faced pony soldier!" shouts Joe "Dead Man Walking." "No malarkey!"
This has been too much for him.
Mayor Pete came in second to Sanders. He's calm and says nothing, with elegance. But he might be too calm, bordering on the Manchurian. He never sweats. Don't other Mayor Pete models come from the factory with lifelike pores?
"Hello, America! I'm Amy Klobuchar and I will beat Donald Trump," Klobuchar told a crowd of her cheering supporters in New Hampshire. "My heart is full tonight. ... We have beaten the odds every step of the way."
Yes, Amy, you did.
If Bloomberg really wants to get rid of Trump, Mike should just climb down off that little box of his and give $300 million or so to Klobuchar.
She's not perfect. And there's that business about Klobuchar eating a salad with a comb. I hope she doesn't like chunky blue cheese dressing.
But politics is all about matchups. She's smart, she's got personality. Against Trump, she could win.
The Democratic establishment isn't listening. It's too busy panicking over Bernie.
The establishment talks about finding "moderates" to combat Bernie's socialism, but get real. There are no "moderates" in the Democratic Party. John Kennedy couldn't get the nomination from today's Democrats. They've all moved far to the left.
And any who haven't, like pro-life Democrats, have been hunted to extinction. They're exceedingly rare, like the white-rumped vulture or the Bornean orangutan.
David Attenborough should narrate a nature documentary and open with Illinois Democrat U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski having morning tea after Mass:
"As you can see, Lipinski sips his tea rather calmly, unaware he's being hunted by woke warrior priestesses who are determined to take his head and shrink it."
The real reason establishment Democrats are in hysterics over Sanders is this: If he wins, he won't let them control things.
That terrifies them. But they don't say that.
Instead they use "Fear of Bernie" and "Fear of Trump" interchangeably, which, sadly, is what people do when in the grip of mass hysteria.
This is what happens when human beings flee from reality -- like many did after Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton -- and seek refuge by constructing intricate fantasy mind palaces.
What's extremely dangerous is if you're in a mind palace alone with Adam Schiff. You stare into his bulging eyes and can't help but believe him when he insists that he's got evidence Trump colluded with Russia, and that Trump will be impeached. The eyes grow larger, the stories more fanciful.
But when reality intrudes, as it always does, and you realize Schiff offers nothing but his charm, the mind palaces collapse. And panic ensues.
This collective obsessional behavior, is, according to scientists, "a phenomenon that transmits collective illusions of threats, whether real or imaginary, through a population in society as a result of rumors and fear."
So wrote the author of "Witchcraft and Mass Hysteria in Terms of Current Psychological Theories." Or perhaps it was Robert E. Bartholomew, who in 2001, presaging the Fear of Bernie, wrote "Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion."
Whatever. They were both mentioned on Wikipedia in the footnotes. Did you read their books? I didn't.
There are many examples, including that nun in the Middle Ages who began to meow like a cat, and soon all the sisters of the convent were meowing too.
Or the infamous dancing plague of 1518, which bedeviled Strasbourg as "numerous" people began to dance, uncontrollably, without stopping for weeks. Some died of heart attacks.
The last one was just a few years ago, the Evil Clown Panic of 2016. Americans began reporting having seen random clowns and being scared to death.
Something else happened in 2016. What was it again?
In 2020, the Fear of Bernie manifests itself in Media Adulation of Mike.
To puff up Bloomberg, Democratic establishment scribes sing his praises, including Thomas Friedman of The New York Times.
In "Paging Mike Bloomberg," a gushing column full of childlike yearning for a political savior, Friedman searches for the right candidate to defeat Trump and save us.
"And this candidate knows how to get stuff done -- he can fight this fire at the scale of the fire. His team has for years used social networks to promote progressive issues to centrist and conservative audiences. He won't cede the internet/Facebook/Twitter battlefield to Trump's team, who are killers in that space.
"And this candidate is now rising steadily in the polls. This candidate is Michael Bloomberg. This candidate has Trump very worried."
Bloomberg must have loved it. But at the end of the pro-Bloomberg column of gushing praise, there was this from Friedman:
(Disclosure: Bloomberg Philanthropies has donated to Planet Word, the museum my wife is building in Washington, to promote reading and literacy.)
Shouldn't that have been the headline, before the Bloomberg gushing commenced?
If I did that in the Chicago Tribune and gushed over a politician who gave money to my wife, I'd be fired.
They're so irrational. It's that fear, the Fear of Bernie, that compels them, for the Love of Mike.

Texto completo: Matteo Salvini can hardly believe his good fortune. He's facing prosecution.
In another country, that might spell trouble for a politician like Salvini, Italy's nationalist leader. But Salvini is being pursued for turning away rescued migrants when he was interior minister, by southern prosecutors who have called it an abuse of power and an act of abduction.
As the effort to criminally pursue Salvini comes to a critical juncture, just weeks after a defeat in an important regional election thwarted his attempted return to power, he has seized upon it as a political life raft.
"Immigration is surely not a theme that scares me," said Salvini in an interview in his Senate office, surrounded by the law enforcement shirts he often dressed up in, dozens of cross necklaces dangling in a row like Mardi Gras beads and assorted gifts that he receives on the campaign trail.
It's not hard to see why. The potential prosecution has unwittingly revived migration as an issue despite only a trickle of arrivals to Italy.
And it has rearmed Salvini, an expert in political victimization, with a powerful issue to rally his base.
"I see the similarities of a left that tries to win through legal means that which it can't win through democratic means," Salvini said in the interview, on the day of President Donald Trump's acquittal in a Senate trial.
He added that prosecutions "against Trump will end in nothing, and they will end in nothing for me."
Rather than run from the case, Salvini can hardly stop talking about it, in his daily Facebook Live soliloquies, campaign trail appearances and interviews. He spoke with amazement about a schedule of votes this month and the next to determine whether or not he could be prosecuted for the signature issue that fueled his rise to become the most popular politician in Italy.
"Here," he said, "every month there is a request to prosecute on immigration that they send forward."
They, as Salvini sees it, are ideologically motivated magistrates spurred on by liberal enemies determined to stop his rise in Italian politics.
Salvini's critics see a more straightforward case of his breaking the law, not to mention disregarding the dire human suffering of those on board the ships he left floating at sea and of a judicial system doing its job to hold him accountable. They are doubtful that Salvini will actually vote for the case to go ahead in another legislative step Wednesday. His office says it is still evaluating what to do.
Either way, Salvini, despite his complaint about having to eat breakfast with his lawyer rather than his girlfriend, is now relishing the opportunity.
In the politics of persecution, Salvini has few peers, having picked up where Silvio Berlusconi left off. The media magnate and former conservative prime minister spent decades excoriating Italy's prosecutors as the country's Communist opposition -- to great political fortune.
Salvini has replaced Berlusconi as the de facto leader of the Italian right, though he has sat on the sidelines since his coalition government collapsed last summer.
But even Salvini's political opponents have sensed the danger of turning him into a martyr on the migration issue. They have wavered on whether to let the prosecutions proceed, suggested they be delayed until after regional elections and ultimately abstained in critical votes.
There has, however, been one surprise advocate for allowing the prosecutions to go forward: Salvini himself.
"They will put on trial the entire Italian people," he took to saying on the campaign trail, often to sustained applause.
Salvini and his nationalist allies understand how much the issue of migration still resonates with European voters. This month, Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, appeared at a conference of international conservatives in a Rome hotel and said the importance of the 2015 migration crisis was that it had lifted the taboo of speaking about identity and national borders.
Since Salvini's failed bid to trigger early elections by pulling the plug on his coalition with the 5-Star Movement last year, staying at the center of things has become more of a challenge.
That problem has intensified since his candidate's loss in the regional elections in January in Emilia Romagna, a traditional left-wing stronghold where Salvini spent weeks campaigning to demonstrate his dominance of Italian politics and his appeal in formerly enemy territory. He lost badly.
In an effort to find his footing, he has focused on more regional elections this year to apply pressure on Italy's fragile government, an awkward alliance of his former, and cratering, 5-Star partners and the center-left Democratic Party.
But the man who just weeks ago was in such a hurry to collapse the government now seemed resigned to the fact that he had to play a long game. The next elections are not scheduled until 2023.
When discussing his potential comeback, Salvini exclaimed, "There's no rush!"
In the meantime, Italian political analysts have argued that Salvini needed to move more toward the center to expand his support beyond 33%. There were some indications that Salvini wanted to shed his hard-right image.
In the interview, Salvini said that it was "probably a reductive vision" to lump him in with other nationalists like Orban and Marine Le Pen in France based solely on their shared opposition to migration.
His League party, formerly the Northern League, he pointed out, ran many of Italy's regions, including one of its richest and most successful, Lombardy.
It had also, he failed to note, once advocated breaking Lombardy and the rest of the north away from Italy in a fictional nation called Padania. But now, Salvini said, the League was a truly national party, and it had become clear that "Lombardy alone goes nowhere."
Even so, Salvini argued that he was in no way distancing himself from the hard-right nationalist milieu in which he emerged as a global leader. Despite failing to appear at the conservative conference, he met privately with Orban and "brainstormed about scenarios of future collaboration."
His hard line on immigration -- prosecution or not -- was a winning one and one from which he wouldn't budge.
"I don't move," he said, as he sat at his desk, waiting for the bell signaling the next Senate vote to ring.

Study: Muscle mass key to men's heart health Exercise, active lifestyle beneficial as males get older

Texto completo: How much muscle you have now could indicate how healthy your heart will be later, according to an interesting new study of muscle mass and cardiovascular disease. The study finds that, for men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle lowers the subsequent risk of developing heart disease by as much as 81%, compared with the risks for other men.
These results add to the growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle is essential for healthy aging, while also underscoring that the effects may be different for women and men.
Skeletal muscle is, of course, one of the body's most versatile and active tissues, providing the strength and power we need to grasp, reach, lift and stride. Muscle is also critical for our metabolic health, slurping and storing blood sugar and producing specialized hormones that move to other tissues, like the brain and fat cells, where they jump-start various biochemical processes.
But our muscle mass almost invariably declines as we grow older, with the loss often starting when we are in our 30s or early 40s and accelerating as we pass through midlife. Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with frailty and other medical conditions in the elderly, along with loss of independence and premature death.
But even relatively moderate declines in muscle mass are linked with worse outcomes in older people. Some past studies have found that, particularly in older men, low muscle mass tends often to be associated with concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Those studies, however, did not look at which condition might have come first, and so cannot indicate whether there are links between diminished muscle at one age and heart disease later - or vice versa.
So, for the new study, which was published in the January issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, an international group of scientists interested in muscle health and sarcopenia decided to track people's muscles and heart health as they moved through middle age.
They began by turning to data from the ongoing ATTICA study in Greece, a large-scale look at the underpinnings of cardiovascular disease in a group of Mediterranean men and women. The study, at this point, had enrolled several thousand adults in and around Athens and brought them in to a clinic for extensive medical exams and to fill out lifestyle questionnaires. None of the participants, who ranged in age from early adulthood to retirement age, had cardiovascular disease when they entered the study.
About 10 years after joining the study, each man and woman returned to the lab for another round of testing, focused on their cardiovascular health.
The authors of the new study now zeroed in on the men and women who were at least 45 years old at that second check-in. They wound up with records for 1,019 people, most of them past the age of 55, meaning they had been in their 40s when they joined the study.
Using information from these participants' original medical tests, the scientists calculated each person's overall muscle mass and then looked at whether he or she had developed heart disease by the time of the second clinic visit, about 10 years later.
It turned out that more than a quarter of them had. Almost 27% of the participants, in fact, now had heart disease, with the incidence about six times higher among the men than the women.
And people's muscle mass at the study's start was linked to their chances of heart disease now. Those people with the most muscle then were the least likely to have heart disease now.
That association remained significant when the scientists controlled for people's diet, education and physical activity, but not when they looked at gender. Women's muscle mass was not associated with later risks for heart disease, in large part because so few of the women had developed heart disease. In general, women tend to get heart disease about 10 years later than men.
But for men, having relatively large amounts of muscle early in middle age dropped the risk of heart disease later by 81%, the researchers determined.
"The association was that strong," said Stefanos Tyrovolas, the study's lead author, member of CIBERSAM and principal investigator at the Sant Joan de Deu Research Institute.
This study does not show, though, that having plenty of muscle directly staves off heart disease, only that the two are related. It also cannot tell us just how muscle helps to protect the heart, but Tyrovolas suspects that the metabolic effects of the tissue, which include better blood-sugar control and less bodily inflammation, are likely to contribute.
Well-muscled people also tend to be more active than others, he said, which helps to protect the heart.
But the overall message of the findings, he said, is that "muscle-mass preservation, through physical exercise and an active lifestyle," is probably key to protecting middle-aged hearts, especially for men, and provides another compelling reason to visit the gym or fit in a push-up or 10 today.

Larson is one of the announced winners of the 2020 Music Educator Awards, honoring individuals "who make a difference in the community through a dedication to music education and promotion of a greater understanding of and appreciation for the art form," according to a Columbus Symphony news release.
Three nominees from across central Ohio were selected in the categories of elementary, secondary, and community education.
Larson, founder and artistic director of the Newark-Granville Youth Symphony, was selected for the 2020 Music Educator Award – Community Education.
She was surprised with the honor by symphony officials during a recent evening rehearsal with her students at the Reese Center on the OSU-Newark Campus.
"I thought we were going to be kicked off the stage," Larson said when members of the CS entered the auditorium to surprise her with the honor.
Bob Cochran of the Symphony Board of Directors told Larson's students, "You know how hard she works... Those of you who have been in here a while know how much she means to you."
From 2006 to 2011, Larson was director of orchestras for Newark City Schools.
In 2009, her string orchestra, the Newark High School Sinfonia, was awarded first runner-up for the National Orchestra Cup at Lincoln Center, earning the orchestra a front-page story in The New York Times and an invitation to the White House, according to a Symphony news release.
For 15 years, Larson was director of orchestras for Bexley City Schools.
She is currently a violin, viola, and chamber music instructor for the Denison University Suzuki Program and executive director of the Newark-Granville Symphony Orchestra.
She has been a conductor and clinician for school ensembles, regional orchestras, and honors orchestras throughout the Midwest.
She has conducted the Women in Music Symphony Orchestra and String Sinfonia and has served as conductor and music director for Otterbein University.
Each award winner is to receive a $2,500 grant to spend at their discretion on music education endeavors.
Past winners have used these funds to host guest instructors, repair instruments, take professional development classes, or purchase new instruments, computer software, and music, according to the Columbus Symphony.
The winners will be presented with their awards at a dinner at 5:30 p.m. March 28 at The Sheraton Capitol Square, 75 E. State St.
Tickets to the event are $65, and include admission to that evening's Columbus Symphony concert, "The Rite of Spring," at the Ohio Theatre at 8 p.m. Tickets can be purchased by calling 614-221-4916 before March 16.
The Music Educator Awards were made possible through the support of Kim and Jude Swanson, with additional support from Canneto Studios.

Texto completo: How much muscle you have now could indicate how healthy your heart will be later, according to an interesting new study of muscle mass and cardiovascular disease. The study finds that, for men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle lowers the subsequent risk of developing heart disease by as much as 81%, compared with the risks for other men.
These results add to the growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle is essential for healthy aging, while also underscoring that the effects may be different for women and men.
Skeletal muscle is, of course, one of the body's most versatile and active tissues, providing the strength and power we need to grasp, reach, lift and stride. Muscle is also critical for our metabolic health, slurping and storing blood sugar and producing specialized hormones that move to other tissues, like the brain and fat cells, where they jump-start various biochemical processes.
But our muscle mass almost invariably declines as we grow older, with the loss often starting when we are in our 30s or early 40s and accelerating as we pass through midlife. Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with frailty and other medical conditions in the elderly, along with loss of independence and premature death.
But even relatively moderate declines in muscle mass are linked with worse outcomes in older people. Some past studies have found that, particularly in older men, low muscle mass tends often to be associated with concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Those studies, however, did not look at which condition might have come first, and so cannot indicate whether there are links between diminished muscle at one age and heart disease later - or vice versa.
So, for the new study, which was published in the January issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, an international group of scientists interested in muscle health and sarcopenia decided to track people's muscles and heart health as they moved through middle age.
They began by turning to data from the ongoing ATTICA study in Greece, a large-scale look at the underpinnings of cardiovascular disease in a group of Mediterranean men and women. The study, at this point, had enrolled several thousand adults in and around Athens and brought them in to a clinic for extensive medical exams and to fill out lifestyle questionnaires. None of the participants, who ranged in age from early adulthood to retirement age, had cardiovascular disease when they entered the study.
About 10 years after joining the study, each man and woman returned to the lab for another round of testing, focused on their cardiovascular health.
The authors of the new study now zeroed in on the men and women who were at least 45 years old at that second check-in. They wound up with records for 1,019 people, most of them past the age of 55, meaning they had been in their 40s when they joined the study.
Using information from these participants' original medical tests, the scientists calculated each person's overall muscle mass and then looked at whether he or she had developed heart disease by the time of the second clinic visit, about 10 years later.
It turned out that more than a quarter of them had. Almost 27% of the participants, in fact, now had heart disease, with the incidence about six times higher among the men than the women.
And people's muscle mass at the study's start was linked to their chances of heart disease now. Those people with the most muscle then were the least likely to have heart disease now.
That association remained significant when the scientists controlled for people's diet, education and physical activity, but not when they looked at gender. Women's muscle mass was not associated with later risks for heart disease, in large part because so few of the women had developed heart disease. In general, women tend to get heart disease about 10 years later than men.
But for men, having relatively large amounts of muscle early in middle age dropped the risk of heart disease later by 81%, the researchers determined.
"The association was that strong," said Stefanos Tyrovolas, the study's lead author, member of CIBERSAM and principal investigator at the Sant Joan de Deu Research Institute.
This study does not show, though, that having plenty of muscle directly staves off heart disease, only that the two are related. It also cannot tell us just how muscle helps to protect the heart, but Tyrovolas suspects that the metabolic effects of the tissue, which include better blood-sugar control and less bodily inflammation, are likely to contribute.
Well-muscled people also tend to be more active than others, he said, which helps to protect the heart.
But the overall message of the findings, he said, is that "muscle-mass preservation, through physical exercise and an active lifestyle," is probably key to protecting middle-aged hearts, especially for men, and provides another compelling reason to visit the gym or fit in a push-up or 10 today.

Kentucky bill targets doctors who help transgender kids

Texto completo: Doctors could be jailed for providing transgender youth with identity-related medical treatments under a new bill in the Kentucky legislature, the latest in a series of conservative legislative efforts in several states aimed at transgender minors.
The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Savannah Maddox, would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe medications, including puberty-blocking or hormone treatments, or conduct surgeries, for anyone younger than 18 with the intent to alter their gender.
Ostensibly aimed at barring children who could still be grappling with their gender identity from undergoing body-changing treatments, the measure drew a sharp rebuke from LGBTQ advocates and families who say it would only heighten risks for transgender youth.
"These sorts of decisions need to be made by medical providers, not politicians," said Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ-rights organization in Louisville. He said it represents a "coordinated political attack" on transgender people "for election-year purposes."
Maddox did not respond to messages seeking comment. But last fall she wrote on her Facebook page her intention to draft the bill, saying, "I am a strong advocate for parent's (sic) rights — but it is not the right of a parent to permanently alter a child's gender or identity, even when based upon certain behaviors or the perceptions of a child's mind which has not yet had time to fully develop."
It's rare for transgender minors to get surgery, and most have undergone years of consultations with doctors, counselors and family, often first changing names or how they dress, before any medications are adopted, experts said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week issued a study that found access to puberty blockers helped reduced risks of mental health problems and suicide attempts, which some studies say are as high 40% among transgender youth.
"It's a horrible thing," Cassie Kasey said of the bill. Kasey said puberty blockers were important during a critical juncture for her transgender daughter, Maddie Dalton, who is now 20.
Dalton was among the first students at Louisville's Atherton High School to come out as transgender, and her subsequent push for a policy allowing her to use the women's restroom and locker room sparked a fiery public controversy in 2014 that made national headlines.
The measure joins several other proposed bills targeting transgender individuals in Kentucky's General Assembly this year.
That includes a resurrected "bathroom bill" that would ban transgender students from using public restrooms that align with their gender identities.
Another bill targets transgender individuals in sports, forcing student-athletes to compete in school sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.
Bills restricting access to hormone treatment and surgeries for young transgender people have been introduced in several states, including South Dakota, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
Such measures run counter to standards and guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, the group said.
The Kentucky Medical Association did not immediately provide a response to the legislation. Some transgender residents said it would make getting knowledgeable transgender medical care extremely difficult for families.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving youths access to "comprehensive gender-affirming and developmentally appropriate health care" while laying out risks and benefits.
Janet Vessels, a Kentucky clinical counselor who works with transgender youth in collaborations with doctors, said providers follow established medical guidance and families carefully weigh risks and benefits at every step.
"They don't do it haphazardly," she said.
"There are a lot of things about trans kids that a lot of people don't understand," said Jeri Stine Hahn, who raised a Lexington transgender stepdaughter and who runs a support group for parents.
Her stepdaughter, Crystal Hahn, 20, said she socially transitioned at age 10, began hormone blockers at age 11 and began estrogen treatment at age 15. If the proposed bill were law, she said, the struggles would have been monumental.
"I genuinely don't know if I'd even be alive," she said.
Hahn believes the bills were fueled in part after conservatives seized on a case in Texas last year, when two parents clashed in a highly publicized custody battle that included a clash over their 7-year-old and gender identity.
According to media reports, the father alleged that the mother, a doctor, had pushed their child into self-identifying as a girl and advocated for related medical care, a charge the mother flatly denied.
Nonetheless, the father drew support from conservative politicians. Donald Trump Jr. last fall tweeted, "This is child abuse. People need to start to stand up against this bullshit."
The New York Times reported that the South Dakota bill received input from groups including the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom. The Arizona-based group didn't comment on whether it had consulted on Kentucky's law but issued a statement.
The proposed bill in Kentucky also would create protections for public employees who express opinions about gender identity.
And it says parents can withhold consent for "any activity designed and intended to form their child's conceptions of sex or to treat gender dysphoria," the mismatch between gender identity and a person's sex at birth.
The state, under the bill, cannot infringe on that decision. Its intent may be to give objecting parents a legal foothold, Keisling said. The measure exempts children with a medically verifiable genetic disorder of sexual development, the bill says.

Texto completo: During a trip to China in 2018, we were watching BBC News in our hotel room. When the anchorman started to talk about something going on in the country's western provinces, the screen went blank. After a minute or so, the picture returned. The newscaster had moved on to the next story.
The next day, we mentioned the interruption to one of our tour guides. "The government wants us to be happy," the guide said with a wry, tight-lipped smile. "So they try not to show us things that would make us unhappy."
I recalled that exchange last week when I heard about the fate of Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who tried to sound the alarm about the new virus now spreading around the world.
Li was a 34-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. On Dec. 30, he took to WeChat to warn fellow doctors that several patients from a local market had come down with an illness resembling SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
Soviets downplayed Chernobyl Like the Soviet authorities who downplayed the severity of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, local Chinese officials sought to keep the lid on Li's information. The doctor was accused of rumor-mongering. Security police forced him to sign a letter that accused him of "making false comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order."
After returning to work at Wuhan Central Hospital, he contracted the coronavirus from a patient who saw him for glaucoma on Jan.10. "If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better," he texted The New York Times from his hospital bed. "There should be more openness and transparency."
Dr. Li died last Friday, one of more than 1,100 victims of the coronavirus so far. He left behind a pregnant wife and child.
Li's tragic story isn't just a faraway tale of the damage that can be done when communist authorities try to suppress bad news, imperiling their own citizens and those of other nations. It's also a warning to Americans about the consequences of discrediting people who attempt to call out wrongdoing or danger.
Think such a thing couldn't happen here in the USA, where laws protect whistleblowers from retribution? Don't be so certain.
U.S. whistleblower under attack Last summer, after an unidentified National Security Council aide raised alarms through proper channels on President Donald Trump's arms-for-dirt deal with Ukraine, the administration tried to suppress the complaint. Failing that, it assailed the whistleblower.
Never mind that subsequent testimony thoroughly confirmed the whistleblower's allegations. And never mind that Republican members of Congress used to be big champions of whistleblower protections.
Trump attacked the whistleblower on Twitter and retweeted articles that purported to reveal the person's identity. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tried to expose the identity during the question-and-answer portion of the impeachment trial. Wisely thwarted by Chief Justice John Roberts, Paul went ahead later and publicly disclosed the name anyway. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans an investigation — not of Paul's actions, but those of the alleged whistleblower.
"If they carry out this threat of state-sponsored retaliation, whistleblowing as we know it may be over," Walter Shaub, a former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, warned in The Washington Post. "That would be a disastrous blow to government integrity."
As the sad case of Dr. Li shows, it would also be a threat to your health and safety. Contrary to what certain leaders here and abroad might want you to believe, ignorance is not bliss.

Stewart understands importance of 'Picard' CELEBRITIES

Texto completo: In "Star Trek: Picard," Patrick Stewart reprises his iconic role as Jean-Luc Picard, a character he played for seven seasons on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and in four feature films.
It almost didn't happen. Stewart, who hadn't played Picard since the 2002 movie "Star Trek: Nemesis," long resisted a return, believing he had completed his job as one of the franchise's most popular captains.
But he changed his mind after reading a lengthy proposal put together by Berkeley author (and diehard "Trek" devotee) Michael Chabon, Alex Kurtzman and a few others. Now he's on board for a possible three-season run. (The show already has been renewed for a second season on CBS All Access).
Stewart recently fielded questions during a TV industry event.

Q: Had you gone through the process of saying goodbye to the character for good?
A: Oh, yes, years ago. But the context in which the work was done, the fact that we were then, as we are now, an ensemble and not a star-led series, it has been far easier than I expected to make this transition nearly 20 years later. But because ... the man exists inside me, the interesting question for me is ... what happened in those 20 years? So now I have a very, very clear vision, and little snippets of that backstory will creep into the series.

Q: Has this role been a career burden at times?
A: Yes. I've been honest about this. I found quite soon after we wrapped the fourth of our movies, "Nemesis," that I had hung a, kind of, albatross around my neck. And so I went out of my way to try to find as many diverse roles as possible, and that was fun. It has taken a while for me to truly absorb the impact of this work. And being with a new ensemble you've seen already some of it, a brilliant ensemble I feel, once again, the sense of pride of being ... not the leader, but in a sense, I'm a kind of symbol.

Q: Jonathan Frakes and Brent Spiner appear in "Picard." Is there anybody else from "Next Generation" who is going to appear in the series?
A: We actually talk all the time. The whole "Next Generation" cast are very, very close. I love all of them, and they are dear, dear friends. Jonathan, Marina Sirtis, Jonathan Del Arco, and Brent, of course, do appear in Season 1. It is my hope that whenever that point arrives in which we are wrapping the series, that we will have encountered all of the principal actors from "Next Generation."

Q: Why do you think "Star Trek" has endured as a franchise for all these years?
A: Hope. It is the dominant emotion behind everything that we did on "Next Generation" and, as I'm beginning to discover, on "Picard" too. It has always been part of the content of "Star Trek" that it will be attempting to create a better future with the certain belief that a better future is possible if the right kind of work and the right kind of people are engaged in that. And my feeling was ... there has never been a more important moment when entertainment and show business can address some of the issues that are potentially damaging our world today.

Texto completo: HONG KONG - Jade Doringo arrived at Manila's international airport more than five hours before her scheduled departure to Hong Kong, where she worked as a software engineer. But instead of getting on her flight, she was asked to surrender her boarding pass.
That morning, Feb. 2, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines had announced a temporary travel ban that barred flights arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. At the airport, officials told Doringo that the ban also applied to Filipino travelers going in the opposite direction.
As the new coronavirus has spread around the world, several countries have issued restrictions on travelers arriving from mainland China. The Philippines, which has reported one death from the virus, is unusual in imposing rules that prevent its citizens from traveling also to Hong Kong and Macao, semi-autonomous Chinese territories.
Doringo is among hundreds of Filipinos whose lives have been upended as they find themselves unable to return to their jobs in the two cities. "Imagine the confusion we felt at that time, not knowing everything," she said in a phone interview last week.
Doringo had been sitting at the gate, watching as the crew waited for approval to board the flight and listening as airline employees repeated an announcement about the new travel ban. At 4 p.m., all Filipino passport holders were asked to go to immigration. Around her, domestic workers called their employers in Hong Kong, their voices rising in panic.
Then her suitcase got lost. But there was little else she could do besides huddle together with the other grounded passengers. Most of them had not eaten since that morning.
At 11 p.m., Doringo left the terminal empty-handed.
She had moved to Hong Kong two years ago with dreams of creating a better life for her family. The job in Hong Kong paid a better salary than what she would have earned back home, and soon after starting she was able to buy a plot of land in her rural province. She began setting aside money every month to build a house for her family.
She missed them constantly, particularly during the chaos of the past seven months when Hong Kong was rocked by anti-government demonstrations. Her homesickness only intensified in late January as the coronavirus spread.
"Protests, disease, the loneliness of living alone - all of this triggers the longing of going back home," she wrote in an Instagram post Jan. 25 before she returned to the Philippines for a nine-day vacation. "To your real home."
That trip started out in Manila, where she took her siblings and their families to eat lechón, a spit-roasted suckling pig, at a mall.
Later, she returned to her hometown in the countryside and rode on a motorized tricycle with her father to a creek near where she planned to build a house for them. Her mother cooked her a steaming beef broth. She cried, feeling relieved to be under their roof.
"I get to eat in Hong Kong, but it's different when you get to share the meals with your family," she said.
When it came time for her to return to Hong Kong, her brother bought a box of masks for her, and her parents nagged her to be careful. She ended up spending all day at the airport after her flight was canceled, then stayed at her brother's home in Manila. Her lost luggage showed up two days later.
Her supervisor gave her permission to work remotely, but she was worried about being absent for too long.
"As overseas Filipino workers, none of us can afford to lose our jobs," she said.
Doringo still is not sure when she will be able to return to Hong Kong. But she has stocked up on masks, rubbing alcohol and snacks so that when she does, she will not have to venture outdoors.
"I am afraid to get sick. We all are, but it's our decision to take the risk," she said.

Magazines Boost Production of Video Content

Texto completo: One of the nation's biggest magazine publishers is doubling down on its Hollywood ambitions, part of an effort by publishers to convert print stories into documentaries, movies or TV shows.
Conde Nast Entertainment, the production and video arm of Conde Nast, said it is launching five branded studios built around Conde Nast's best-known magazines: Vanity Fair, Wired, GQ, Vogue and the New Yorker.
The move comes as entertainment companies including Walt Disney Co., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. are racing to develop new shows for their recently introduced or coming streaming services. Collectively, streaming platforms are expected to spend $30 billion annually on content in the U.S. by 2024, according to GroupM's Brian Wieser -- an explosion of new offerings that will keep fueling demand for original content.
For Conde Nast Entertainment, the goal is to create a pipeline of material to feed that demand. "Studios can't get enough intellectual property for the streaming wars," said Oren Katzeff, the head of Conde Nast Entertainment.
Other media companies including New York Times Co., Vox Media Inc., Meredith Corp. and BuzzFeed Inc., are also producing video content. Vox is making shows for Netflix Inc., the Times started a documentary series on Hulu and FX, while Meredith is leveraging its biggest brand, People magazine, into a half-hour show that will air in prime time on the company's roster of TV stations starting this fall.
Conde Nast Entertainment's most recent feature film, "City of a Million Soldiers," is set to come out in theaters in June. The project started with "The Desperate Battle to Destroy ISIS," a 2017 New Yorker article about the battle for Mosul.
"We read it when it came out at the time of publication and were impressed by how cinematic and humanistic the story was," said Mike Larocca, president of AGBO Films, a Los Angeles-based entertainment company that served as the movie's lead production entity and financier. "Even though it's set in a part of the world that the audience may not know that much about, we felt it was accessible."
He expects the movie's association with the New Yorker to give it a greater cachet and recognition. "It's a prestige brand and speaks to a level of quality," Mr. Larocca said.
Mr. Katzeff said the decision to start five studios tied directly to five of Conde Nast's best-known magazines is meant to generate greater involvement by each magazine's senior editors who know those stories best, which should help Conde Nast create more content at a faster rate.
Mr. Katzeff, who took over Conde Nast Entertainment in late 2018, has struck deals with Whalerock Industries, a Los Angeles-based TV production and digital media company, and talent agency WME, a unit of Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. that will provide access to deal makers and package CNE's stories.
CNE's five new studios already have a slate of projects under way, including two potential films based on Vanity Fair stories. One focuses on Thomas Gilbert Sr., a hedge-fund founder murdered by his son; the other a story about fake antique furniture.
"This is a brand famous for longform narrative storytelling, one that naturally embraces the stories we're seeing in scripted series, limited series, and documentaries," said Radhika Jones, editor in chief of Vanity Fair. "We haven't had the keys to unlock the chest. This is an effort to arm us with those keys."
CNE previously sold two series to Netflix, including "Fastest Car," about quarter-mile racing, and the football docuseries "Last Chance U."
Conde Nast Entertainment already generates about $200 million in annual revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman declined to comment. Conde Nast is owned by closely held Advance Publications Inc.
Roger Lynch, Conde Nast's chief executive who earlier in his career ran Dish Network Corp.'s internet-based SlingTV, said he expects Conde Nast Entertainment to become a $1 billion business, though he hasn't set a target date.
Mr. Lynch said Conde Nast has 1,800 journalists in 31 markets producing content, which should give it an edge with streaming services that need local content for local audiences as they expand internationally. "We can provide that," he said.
Conde Nast's diversification effort comes as publishers are looking for new revenue streams at a time print advertising and newsstand revenue continues to deteriorate, while new digital advertising spending is dominated by such tech companies as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Disney, AT&T, Apple Inc. and Comcast are among the companies that have recently launched or are about to launch streaming services, competing with more established players such as Netflix and Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video.
"The stakes are much higher," media consultant David J. Fishman said. "This is about publishers placing their content in the premiere position it should have been in all along."
Some media companies have invested significantly in developing their own production facilities, while others have in-house capabilities for short-form video but typically need to join with production companies or Hollywood studios for larger projects.
Vox Media Studios has invested in production facilities in New York and Los Angeles, enabling it to hire line producers, rent trucks and edit in its offices.
The New York Times last year partnered with an outside production company when it launched the video documentary series "The Weekly." "We didn't want to reinvent the wheel," said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor responsible for audio, film, TV projects and other digital initiatives.
Meredith, the country's largest magazine publisher, is focusing on creating original TV programming from some of its biggest brands, including People and Southern Living, and is rolling those shows out across its own group of 17 TV stations. The media company is using its own in-house facilities. "PeopleTV" will make its debut this fall with Meredith trying to syndicate it.

Texto completo: Aram Demirjian, now in his eighth season as music director of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, led the Portland Symphony Orchestra in an all-20th century program at Merrill Auditorium. While it would be almost impossible to bring together all, or even most, of that stylistically chaotic century's musical currents, Demirjian offered a handful that sat together comfortably, and highlighted some of the tendrils connecting them.
Demirjian also offered a nod to Black History Month, opening his program with Florence Price's "Dances in the Canebreaks" (1953). Price, who lived from 1887 to 1953, has been enjoying a revival in recent years, ever since a stack of her manuscripts was discovered in an abandoned house in Chicago, and given to the Center for Black Music Research.
Last season, the Portland String Quartet performed her magnificent "Five Folksongs in Counterpoint" (1951), and judging by both that work and "Dances in Canebreaks," more pleasant surprises are undoubtedly forthcoming. Perhaps in a future season, the Portland Symphony will program her Symphony in E minor, which the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered in 1933, making her the first African American, female composer to have a work played by a major orchestra.
The three-movement "Dances in Canebreaks," one of Price's last works, was composed for solo piano, and was orchestrated after Price's death by William Grant Still. Its language is that of spirituals, blues and early jazz, couched in the harmonies and techniques of the European classical tradition - pretty much the recipe for an American style that DvorÃ¡k proposed during his visit to the United States in 1892.
Still's orchestration gives this melodic, rhythmically vital music an extra measure of depth and perspective, and honors its essentially neo-Romantic spirit. Demirjian led a supple performance that kept the music's folk inspiration and structural techniques finely balanced and always clearly in sight, and the orchestra gave it a beautifully subtle performance.
The rest of the first half was devoted to Ravel's Piano Concerto in G (1931), which embraces Ravel's love of jazz, but mixes it with other currents of what was then modernism. The solo piano line, and at times the orchestral fabric, make blatant allusions to Stravinsky, whose "Firebird" suite was the major offering in this concert's second half.
This could have been a superb performance. The orchestra's winds and brass played vividly, and its strings and harp provided the right measure of Ravelian lushness and textural magic. But in a piano concerto at the Portland Symphony Orchestra, there is always the hurdle of Merrill Auditorium's Steinway, a dry instrument, particularly in the middle range, that some players are able to conquer, and others fight valiantly without making it truly sing.
Joyce Yang, the soloist here, is a fine pianist whose performance had all the right contours and exactly the kind of agility the Ravel demands. But timbre is always an issue in Ravel, and there Yang was thwarted by this piano's dullness.
It seems odd that an auditorium that is home to a magnificent organ, the Kotzschmar, should also have such a spectacularly unspectacular piano. It's time for the orchestra, Merrill (the piano takes its toll on Portland Ovations recitals, as well) or a wealthy, piano-loving donor, to upgrade this instrument before it muffles another performer's work.
After the intermission, Demirjian and the orchestra gave a sumptuous, otherworldly reading of Delius' "The Walk to the Paradise Garden," an interlude from the composer's fourth and most popular opera, "A Village Romeo and Juliet," followed by its polar opposite, the suite from Stravinsky's alternately gauzy and brutally energetic "The Firebird."
Stravinsky's suite of six connected movements touches on most of the highlights of the full ballet score, particularly the "Infernal Dance," with its aggressive brass, throttling percussion and tightly compressed string writing. Here again, the chemistry between Demirjian and the orchestra seemed perfect. He shaped the performance carefully but with an ear toward the ballet's story line, and the orchestra responded with a vibrant, texturally transparent account. Standing ovations often seem indiscriminately granted at the orchestra's concerts, but the players, and Demirjian, earned this one.

Good Theater resurrects old play about lies and Russians spies 'Pack of Lies,' which opened this week at St. Lawrence Arts, explores what happens when lying becomes part of our routine.

Texto completo: A play which opened Wednesday at Good Theater examines what happens when Russian spies infiltrate the domestic affairs of another country.
It's not a new play and it's not set in America, but it raises timely issues about the truth and trust and what happens to friendships when the truth is blurred and trust is broken. "Pack of Lies," by the recently deceased English playwright Hugh Whitemore, who wrote for the stage and the BBC, is based on a true story from London in the 1960s.
Brian Allen, artistic director of Good Theater, wanted to present it in Portland during this election season when so much of the political talk is about truth and lies and the insidious impact of perpetuating falsehoods. "This year, it's absolutely perfect," Allen said. "This being an election year, a play about the evils of lying seemed like a really good thing to do. It's a great story, it's true and it's a really fun play."
Whitemore wrote it in 1983, based on a true story from the early 1960s. In real life, British intelligence authorities placed agents in the home of a suburban London family to spy on their friends and neighbors, who were part of successful and notorious Soviet espionage network known as the Portland Spy Ring. In Whitemore's hands, the fictional version that plays out in "Pack of Lies" leads viewers to question if we ever really know and whether we can ever really trust our friends, colleagues and neighbors - or even our own family members.
Are they who they say they are? And once we learn the truth, is it more important to honor the truth or protect your friends?
In a long-ago review, The New York Times described the play as being about "the morality of lying" and Whitemore's portrayal of lying as "a virulent disease."
Allen assembled an experienced cast. Paul Haley and Denise Poirier portray the unsuspecting couple, whose home is taken over by the MI5 to surveil the neighborhood. Kathleen Kimball and Chris Holt are the spy couple in the neighborhood. Tony Reilly plays the MI5 agent. The cast also includes Casey Turner, Heather Irish and Sophie Urey.
Poirier's character, Barbara Jackson, is given little information about what's really going on, and struggles to keep her family together, balancing her duty to crown and country with her feelings of helplessness as an ordinary citizen to stand up to the state.
"From her perspective, it's about the license of state over the power of individual. How much can she say and do to protect her family and daughter and her own well-being? She feels like it's being forced on them," Poirier said. "My character is frustrated because of how little they are told about what is going on, and their lives are just taken over."
It's been an interesting play to work on from the perspective of technology, Reilly said. The spy technology at the center of the true story in the 1960s was microdots, tiny bits of text or images that are so small they can't easily be detected by people out of the know. When the play debuted in 1983, email and other forms of accessible electronic communications popular with spies today were relatively nascent.
"Now it's done on the internet, and the level has gotten exponentially crazy. It's not just Russia, it's China, it's Iran, it's anybody with a computer," he said.
Reilly's character has his own issues with the truth. The agent coerces his way into the unsuspecting couple's home, and deceives them with falsehoods about why he's there and what's he's looking for.
Reilly has enjoyed reading about the people at the heart of the real-life story, both the spies, whose real names were Morris and Lona Cohen, and the MI5 agent he portrays. The American-born Cohens - she was born in Massachusetts and he was born in New York - were vital Kremlin assets in the Cold War, and also were involved with smuggling atomic bomb diagrams out of Los Alamos. They were convicted and jailed, and treated as heroes in the Soviet Union, their images honored on Russian stamps.
"Pack of Lies" puts today's discussion about Russian hacking in context, Reilly said. The 19 Russians indicted in the Mueller report might be seen as the modern-day equivalents of the Cohens, he said.
That's why Allen chose this play now. "Back then, it was just a play about a domestic incident. Today, it's much more a commentary about where we are in the world. In some respects, the play is more relevant 35 years later than when it was originally done," Allen said.
Poirier enjoys the period feel of the piece. "It's pure kind of drama, a la the '70s film dramas. It feels like the whole spy thing, with people experiencing the dark undercurrent of real life."
Good Theater presents the play at the St. Lawrence Arts Center through March 8.

Feb. 4 - " 'I believe that the president has learned from this case,' (Sen. Susan) Collins said in an exclusive interview with 'CBS Evening News' anchor Norah O'Donnell on Tuesday, before a speech on the Senate floor about her decision (to vote for acquittal). 'The president has been impeached. That's a pretty big lesson. ... I believe that he will be much more cautious in the future.' "
- CBS Evening News
n
Feb. 5 - "Trump, on the other hand, declared himself completely innocent, and set out to settle scores. 'We went through hell, unfairly,' (Trump) said, after holding up a front-page Washington Post story about his acquittal. 'Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong.' "
- The Washington Post
n
Feb. 6 - "Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, Mr. Trump ordered Gordon D. Sondland, the founder of a hotel chain who donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, recalled from his post as the ambassador to the European Union on the same day that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council staff, was marched out of the White House by security guards. The ousters of Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman - along with Mr. Vindman's brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, an Army officer who also worked on the National Security Council staff -- may only presage a broader effort to even accounts with the president's perceived enemies. In the two days since his acquittal in the Senate, Mr. Trump has railed about those who stood against him, calling them 'evil,' 'corrupt' and 'crooked,' while his press secretary declared that those who hurt the president 'should pay for' it."
- The New York Times
n
Feb. 10 - "The White House is expected to pull the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be the Pentagon's comptroller and chief financial officer in the latest staffing fallout from President Trump's impeachment, The Post has learned. McCusker resisted the president's directive to stall about $250 million in military aid to Ukraine and her emails protesting the delay were leaked in January to the blog Just Security ahead of Trump's Senate trial. 'This administration needs people who are committed to implementing the president's agenda, specifically on foreign policy, and not trying to thwart it,' a White House official told The Post."
- New York Post
n
Feb. 11 - "The four lawyers who prosecuted Roger Stone quit the case Tuesday after the Justice Department overruled them and said it would take the extraordinary step of lowering the amount of prison time it would seek for President Trump's longtime ally and confidant. The departures raised immediate questions over whether Trump, who earlier in the day had blasted the original sentencing recommendation as 'very horrible and unfair,' had at least indirectly exerted his will on a Justice Department that he often views as an arm of the White House."
- The Associated Press
n
Feb. 11 - "President Trump on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of former U.S. attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District of Columbia to a high-ranking Treasury Department post after being lobbied by critics of her office's handling of cases, including ones inherited from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, two people familiar with the decision said."
- The Washington Post
n
Feb. 12 - "(Alaska Sen. Lisa) Murkowski, asked by reporters if Trump learned a lesson from impeachment: "There haven't been very strong indicators this week that he has."

Texto completo: A sequel to "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" is on Netflix. And the second episode of "Indebted" with Fran Drescher airs on NBC.
What's Streaming
TO ALL THE BOYS: P.S. I STILL LOVE YOU (2020) Stream on Netflix. Netflix's teen romantic comedy "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" ended with a kiss on a lacrosse field. This sequel begins with a happy solo dance in front of a mirror. Based on a young adult novel by Jenny Han and heavily inspired by teenage comedies of the 1980s, the movie became a streaming hit when it debuted in 2018. The sequel continues the story of the teenagers Lara Jean (played by Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), whose happily-ever-after ends up being complicated by the fact that, well, they're in high school, and they're human. "When dealing with a franchise, especially one that was as successful as the first film, you really want to follow up with something that isn't just exactly what the audience would want," Centineo said in a recent interview with The New York Times. But they also obviously want the new recipe to spark the same kind of joy that the original did in its devotees. Or, as Centineo put it: "Chicken soup for the soul, baby. That's what we want."
THE BREAKFAST CLUB (1985) Stream Starz platforms; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In her review for The Times, Amy Nicholson wrote that "To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You" seems as though it has been "beamed in from a staticky old channel," and compared it to John Hughes's 1980s movies. So it's fitting that one of Hughes's most famous films, "The Breakfast Club," is turning 35 years old this month. Revisit it to see five cheeky high-school students (Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall) making conversation and experimenting with marijuana in detention.
INTERROGATION Stream on CBS All Access. Peter Sarsgaard and David Strathairn star in this true-crime series, which is based on an actual murder case and built on a novel concept: Viewers can choose the order in which they watch it. Episodes each center on individual interrogations, and are self-contained enough that most of them make sense in any order. (Be sure to save Episode 10, the finale, for last, though.) Don't like the gimmick? "Any order" includes straight through, if you wish.
What's on TV
INDEBTED 9:30 p.m. on NBC. "We're here, we're broke, get used to it!" That proclamation is made by Fran Drescher in this new sitcom, which is premised on a rather serious topic: Debt. Drescher and Steven Weber play Debbie and Stew Klein, a boomer couple who go bust and decide to move in with their adult son (played by Adam Pally) and his wife (Abby Elliott). The first episode aired last week; it's available to stream on NBC platforms and Hulu for those who want to catch up before the second episode, which will air on Thursday.

Texto completo: Readers express fear that Bernie Sanders is "the dream candidate for Donald Trump" and assess the strengths and weaknesses of the other contenders.
To the Editor:
Re "Sanders Is Winner in New Hampshire" (front page, Feb. 12):
Bernie Sanders is the dream candidate for Donald Trump. He is not even a real Democrat and never got any significant legislation passed in the Senate. He talks about health care and a free education for all, but would have no legislative pull to bring that off. He is 78 and recently had a heart attack. He is popular with younger voters, who generally have low turnout, because he promises them free stuff.
Bernie Sanders would be another George McGovern, who lost every state but Massachusetts. He would certainly make Mr. Trump's campaigning easier. Mr. Trump would raise the specter of socialism and it would not be a lie.

To the Editor:
About 10 years ago, my sister came down from Vermont to celebrate Thanksgiving. As we were sitting down for drinks the night before, her cellphone rang. She answered it and said: "Oh, wow! Hello. No, I can't think of anything. Thank you." I asked her who it was. She said: "That was Senator Sanders. He wanted to know if I had anything on my mind."
I'm an Amy Klobuchar man. But anyone who counts Bernie out is a damned fool.

To the Editor:
The total of the votes for the moderates in the New Hampshire election far exceeded those for the so-called progressive wing. Instead, the emphasis has been on Bernie Sanders apparently seizing control in the Democratic race. He won by a small margin, and even if his support is combined with that of Elizabeth Warren, who like him had a geographic advantage, what is significant is that a large majority of New Hampshire voters repudiated them in favor of those with more moderate stances. This is what is significant in the primary.

To the Editor:
Joseph Heller would appreciate this. The Democrats may well face this lose-lose proposition: Bernie Sanders may have the most delegates by June, but not a majority. If he is ultimately nominated, Donald Trump likely will win. But if other candidates combine their delegates to nominate someone else, a significant number of Bernie supporters will cry betrayal and won't vote for that nominee -- and Mr. Trump likely will win.
Allan Hillman

To the Editor:
If Joe Biden's run for president is, as he has declared, a battle for the soul of this nation, then he should listen to his own soul. There's no question that he could restore decency to the White House. The question is can he go all the way to the White House. Senator Amy Klobuchar shares his basic sense of decency. Could Mr. Biden find it in himself to step aside and then use his influence and support to endorse Ms. Klobuchar?
Ms. Klobuchar is a tireless campaigner who can articulate her progressive ideas in a way that lets her stand out on a debate stage. She has the plans, the vision and, most important, the temperament to serve.
Until today, I supported Mr. Biden for president; now I call on him to step up to the role he should be playing at this time. Do the decent thing. Endorse Amy Klobuchar. This selfless act would startle the electorate and electrify the Democratic Party.
Errol Selkirk

To the Editor:
The Center for Biological Diversity has called Amy Klobuchar a "disaster for the environment." Here are the reasons: She supports fossil fuel mining on public lands. She sponsored legislation to remove protections of gray wolves. She considers the Green New Deal merely a guideline. She refuses to declare a global climate emergency. She supports "clean coal" technologies. She supports nuclear power.
Ms. Klobuchar's supporters in New Hampshire who pushed her into third place might have reconsidered their choice had these facts been publicized in the media before the primary.
Lorna Salzman

To the Editor:
How can you not like young, articulate, attractive and oh so smart Mayor Pete, who is doing so well so far in the primaries? Reflect, though, on whether one of our youngest presidents, John F. Kennedy, would have been hoodwinked by the military-industrial complex into invading Cuba or getting entangled in Vietnam had he had 10 or 20 more years of life experience.
At least one of the presidential aspirants should thus very publicly say to Pete Buttigieg: "For you to become president now would be to deprive our country of a brilliant leader in the making. Time and experience yield knowledge, wisdom and seasoning. It is what America needs in a president. And to insure you get it, I promise to appoint you to an indisputably high position in our government. Drop out and join me. Let's win together."

Texto completo: The author, who has been in hiding in the Italian Riviera, was accused of defending and justifying child sexual abuse through his many books and public appearances.
PARIS -- Gabriel Matzneff, the French writer who talked openly for decades about engaging in pedophilia, was charged on Wednesday in a Paris court with promoting the sexual abuse of children.
Mr. Matzneff, who has been in hiding in the Italian Riviera and did not appear in court, was accused of defending and justifying pedophilia through his many books and public appearances, according to the case filed by l'Ange Bleu, an anti-pedophilia organization.
The court set September 2021 as the start of the trial, which will scrutinize not only the author's actions but also those of the French elite who published his books, promoted his career and even helped him evade justice.
"Everyone will have to take responsibility," l'Ange Bleu's lawyer, Méhana Mouhou, said after the hearing.
Mr. Matzneff was represented in court by his longtime lawyer and supporter, Emmanuel Pierrat, who is also president of the PEN Club in France, a writers' association, and the secretary general of a museum in Paris devoted to the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, who died in 2008 and was one of Mr. Matzneff's benefactors. Mr. Pierrat declined to comment.
L'Ange Bleu is using a special legal procedure to force Mr. Matzneff to stand trial, arguing that its interests as an organization devoted to fighting pedophilia were damaged by Mr. Matzneff's longstanding promotion of pedophilia. If convicted in that case, Mr. Matzneff, 83, could face up to five years in prison.
Although Mr. Matzneff is not scheduled to appear in court until next year in the case brought by the anti-pedophilia organization, he could face legal challenges sooner if prosecutors decide to charge him in specific cases of abuse.
Prosecutors, who have been criticized in recent weeks for their long inaction despite Mr. Matzneff's avowed pedophilia, are moving on a separate track that could lead to more criminal charges.
They said on Tuesday that they would actively seek other victims of the author, and on Wednesday they raided for the second time the headquarters of Gallimard, one of Mr. Matzneff's publishers, to seize more of his books and manuscripts, according to the French news media.
Mr. Matzneff openly talked and wrote about pedophilia, but the dynamic changed after the publication last month of "Le Consentement" ("Consent") by Vanessa Springora, the first testimony by one of the writer's underage victims.
Fueling an abrupt cultural shift in France, the book touched off the sudden downfall of Mr. Matzneff, who was dropped by his three publishers, stripped of a rare benefit from the French government and abandoned by longtime supporters.
On Wednesday, Christophe Girard, the deputy for culture to the mayor of Paris, released a statement on his Twitter account acknowledging that he had arranged the payment by the Yves Saint Laurent design house of Mr. Matzneff's hotel bills in the mid-1980s, as reported by The New York Times. Mr. Girard said he had followed the instructions of Pierre Bergé, the business tycoon and partner of Mr. Saint Laurent.
Mr. Girard also wrote that it was "possible" that when he occupied the same position in Paris in 2002, he had written a letter of support that won Mr. Matzneff a seldom-awarded lifetime annual stipend from the National Book Center.
Until just a few weeks ago, Mr. Matzneff was recognized as a celebrated writer. He won one of France's most prestigious literary awards in 2013. His most recent book, "L'Amante de l'Arsenal" ("The Mistress of the Arsenal"), came out three months ago in the prestigious "Collection Blanche" of Gallimard, regarded by many as France's most distinguished publishing house. He had also enjoyed a wide audience through a column in the magazine Le Point.
As "Le Consentement" was about to be published, Mr. Matzneff left France to spend Christmas with friends in Rome, he said in a long interview with The New York Times, in which he asked that his exact location not be revealed.
Then, as the scandal broke in Paris and nearly all of Mr. Matzneff's supporters ran for cover, Mr. Matzneff moved to a hotel in the Italian Riviera.
Mr. Matzneff, who said he did not know when he would return to Paris, will be compelled to appear at the start of the trial next year.
In many books, Mr. Matzneff writes about his relations with teenage girls in France and sex tourism in the Philippines with boys as young as 8. His breakthrough book as an author, from 1974, had the title "Les Moins de Seize Ans" ("Under 16 Years Old").
As a transgressive figure rooted in French literary tradition, Mr. Matzneff appealed to many in France's elite, in publishing, journalism, politics and business.
In the recent interview with The Times, Mr. Matzneff angrily defended himself, saying that he wrote about what many others did in secret, especially in the years following the May 1968 countercultural revolution.
"Even the silly things I might have done during those euphoric years of freedom, I wasn't the only one," he said. "What hypocrisy."
Mr. Matzneff wrote in meticulous detail about his sexual history, especially in his diaries, which the anti-pedophilia group is planning to present in court as the main evidence of his conduct.
In the interview with the Times, Mr. Matzneff said he renounced nothing in his diaries -- a stand that some admirers say reflects his full commitment to literature but now poses legal risks.
Mr. Matzneff said he made up nothing and hid nothing in his diaries. "To my mind, a diary is really of interest only if it deserves the title that Baudelaire gave to one of his, 'My heart laid bare,"' Mr. Matzneff said, referring to the 19th-century French poet.
"A fake diary is of no interest," he said, adding that, in real writing, "there has to be blood, there has to be sperm, there has to be life."
But asked whether, in hindsight, he would write less candidly, he said, "At this moment, I'd tend to say yes, considering how the sky is falling on me."
In "Le Consentement," Ms. Springora, now 47, writes that she first met Mr. Matzneff when she was 13 and he was nearly 50. When she turned 14, they became involved sexually for two years, according to her account and Mr. Matzneff's own diary of the era, "La prunelle des mes yeux" ("The apple of my eye").
Ms. Springora writes that the relationship led to years of depression and other psychological problems.
In France, it was, and remains illegal, for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, although judges have broad leeway to decide what punishment, if any, to impose.
"I am who I am, in good and in evil," Mr. Matzneff said in the recent interview. "My books are there. When I'll be gone, they'll judge my books."

Voting by Phone? Elections App Sets Off Alarm

Texto completo: For more than a decade, it has been an elusive dream for election officials: a smartphone app that would let swaths of voters cast their ballots from their living rooms. It has also been a nightmare for cyberexperts, who argue that no technology is secure enough to trust with the very basis of American democracy.
The debate, long a sideshow at academic conferences and state election offices, is now taking on new urgency. A start-up called Voatz says it has developed an app that would allow users to vote securely from anywhere in the world -- the electoral version of a moonshot. Thousands are set to use the app in this year's elections, a small but growing experiment that could pave the way for a wider acceptance of mobile voting.
But where optimists see a more engaged electorate, critics are warning that the move is dangerously irresponsible. In a new report shared with The New York Times ahead of its publication on Thursday, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say the app is so riddled with security issues that no one should be using it.
In response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security organized a series of briefings in recent weeks for state and local officials who are planning to use Voatz's technology.
"The choice here is not about turnout," the report says, "but about an adversary controlling the election result and a loss of voter privacy."
With security already a dominant theme of the 2020 elections, last week's debacle at the Democratic caucuses in Iowa -- an app used to report results failed to, well, report results -- has raised new questions about the role technology should play in American elections and prompted calls for it to be scaled back.
While a return to the analog days of punch cards and hanging chads is unlikely, there is growing unease about how far state and local governments should go in modernizing election infrastructure -- from registration databases and electronic poll books to the voting machines themselves.
At the far edge of that debate are systems that let users cast their ballots over the internet, including the platform built by Voatz, the only voting app on the market.
An initial experiment with wide-scale online voting took place in Washington a decade ago. It was called off after researchers hacked into the system, electing HAL 9000 -- the computer from "2001: A Space Odyssey" -- as mayor and making the University of Michigan fight song play every time a ballot was cast.
Since then, some states have allowed online voting through web portals, emails or digital faxes, despite the security risks. But they have restricted it to groups of people who cannot make it to the polls, mostly overseas military personnel.
Voatz says its technology has overcome the security problems through biometrics and other measures built into newer smartphones, as well as a back-end system that records and stores votes on a blockchain, the technology underpinning Bitcoin. It also says its platform creates a paper trail for election officials and the voters using the app.
Since its debut in 2018, Voatz has run several pilot projects aimed largely at deployed service members, tallying about 600 votes across federal elections in Denver, West Virginia and five counties in Oregon, Utah and Washington State. Now, it is poised to expand its reach in the presidential election as a number of additional states consider whether to use it for some categories of absentee voters.
West Virginia, for instance, is planning to use the app to meet new requirements that it find a way to make sure the disabled and infirm can participate, a move that is likely to add thousands of voters this year.
Until now, security experts have focused criticism on what they described as Voatz's opaque systems, which make it impossible to verify its security claims.
Beneath that criticism, there is also some very real animus -- many in the tightly knit cybersecurity community blame Voatz for helping spur an F.B.I. investigation of a University of Michigan graduate student who tried to breach the company's systems in 2018. The student says he was conducting research.
In the new paper, the M.I.T. researchers, Michael A. Specter, James Koppel and Daniel J. Weitzner, go beyond speculation and detail how they found serious security issues by reverse-engineering Voatz's app and recreating what they could of the company's server from publicly available information.
Flaws in the app, the report says, would let attackers monitor votes being cast -- and might even allow them to change ballots or block them without users' knowledge.
Perhaps the biggest risk, according to the researchers, is that the attacks could create a tainted paper trail, making a reliable audit impossible.
They pointed to the problems in Iowa caucuses as an instructive example. Though those problems were caused by technical faults, not a security breach, officials in Iowa have had to tally votes through paper backups, some of which are not complete. More than a week later, a definitive result has yet to emerge.
"Imagine that on a national scale," Mr. Specter said in an interview.
The researchers took their findings to the Department of Homeland Security in January, setting off a process through which Voatz was made aware of the research and election officials who use the platform were briefed.
In a statement, Homeland Security said that while no one was known to have exploited the flaws found by the researchers, "we will continue to work with our partners to deepen understanding of the risk."
Voatz, which has reviewed the report, strenuously objected to the researchers' claims, saying in a statement that the researchers acted in bad faith, used an outdated version of the app and "fabricated an imagined version" of the servers.
The company said that its nine previous elections had gone off without incident, and argued that its pilot projects had pushed "innovation forward in a responsible, transparent way."
The company is backed by Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and philanthropist. In an interview last year with Harvard Business Review, he also brushed aside security concerns. "It's not that cybersecurity people are bad people per se," he said. "It's that they are solving for one situation, and I am solving for another."
Caught in the back-and-forth between Voatz and the researchers are election officials who must soon make a decision on whether to use the app this year. At least one Voatz client, Mason County, Wash., has already pulled out, citing fear of media blowback.
Others say they are pressing ahead with plans to use Voatz.
The app "is not perfect -- nothing is -- and security is always a concern for us," said Donald Kersey, a senior election official in West Virginia. "But this is about using new technologies that give us a way to make sure people who maybe can't always vote have that opportunity."

Texto completo: Donald G. McNeil Jr., a health and science reporter for The Times, discussed his coverage of the epidemic.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Donald G. McNeil Jr., a science reporter for The New York Times, has covered infectious diseases since 2002. He rattles off epidemics like a military veteran recalling battles.
"I've covered SARS, MERS, the H5N1 bird flu scare, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, Zika, dengue, chikungunya," he said. SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, were caused by two coronaviruses, which led to epidemics and the deaths of hundreds of people.
Mr. McNeil is part of a team of science reporters struggling to make sense of the spread of the latest coronavirus and the medical response. The following conversation about his observations and concerns has been condensed and edited for clarity.
What do we know, and what don't we know, about the coronavirus?
In the beginning of every epidemic, there is the fog of war.
I'd say we're still in that fog. We know this virus is much more transmissible than SARS or MERS. We don't know if it's quite as transmissible as the flu. We know it can kill people. We know it's not nearly as lethal as MERS or SARS, but we don't know where exactly it falls in between.
One of the things we don't know is what the Chinese aren't saying about what they know. We know that they're reluctant to let in outside experts to root around and ask a lot of questions, and wouldn't share samples of the earliest cases with the C.D.C.
When you ask scientists, "What's your fear for the Big One, the pandemic that's going to kill us all?" -- not that there is a pandemic that's going to kill us all -- but if you ask them that, they say, "Flu." They worry about some new flu, bird flu or swine flu, that's highly lethal but becomes very transmissible between humans. I only know one or two scientists who have said, "You know, I also worry about coronaviruses being the Big One."
I don't want to raise alarm that this is the Big One. But this is a new, scary and confusing one, and we don't yet know how far it's going to spread and how many people it's going to kill.
What would be a sign that the disease is becoming more dangerous in the United States?
The first thing for Americans to worry about is sustained human-to-human transmission. We know of 13 cases, and only one of them has been transmitted from person to person. But if that changed to hundreds of cases, we might get an outbreak that contact tracers, people who find every person who has been exposed to a virus, are not able to get ahead of.
It's possible that would have happened already if we hadn't cut off flights from China. We're buying time to find out, "Hey, do these cures that they're testing in China work?" It's going to take at least a year to have a vaccine.
What do you think about the public's reaction to your reporting?
I'm always trying to figure out, "Am I being alarmist or am I not being alarmist enough?" I was too alarmist about H5N1 back in 2005, the bird flu. I was not alarmist enough about West Africa and Ebola in its early days. All previous Ebola outbreaks had killed a few hundred people. That one killed 11,000.
A lot of people write panicky, naïve stories. They make it on TV and everybody says, "What about the possibility this is a bioweapon?" It's not enough for me to say, "No, it's not a bioweapon." I have to explain, "If it were a bioweapon, here's what you would see in the genetic sequence of the virus."
That requires some digging, because I don't know the answers off the top of my head. I have to call several scientists. A lot of what I do is write notes to my bosses and colleagues saying, "This is why we should -- or shouldn't -- ignore this."
That's a big part of my beat -- debunking the panicky stories. It actually consumes almost as much of my time as reporting does.
I try to spread truth instead of panic, even if it takes me a little longer to get it right.

In Turnout, The Numbers Are Higher, But Deceptive

Texto completo: Nearly 300,000 people cast ballots in the Democratic primary, far surpassing the 2016 turnout and breaking a record set in 2008.
In Iowa last week, Democrats looking anxiously for a surge in caucus turnout -- higher, some expected, than the record set in 2008 -- were dismayed when the numbers barely even exceeded the much lower bar set in 2016.
New Hampshire gave them better news. But it still wasn't really what they were hoping for.
The final precinct in New Hampshire reported its results Wednesday, bringing the total count of Democratic ballots to 296,622. That is substantially higher than in 2016, when turnout was 250,983. But taking into account the state's growing voting-age population, it was pretty much on par with the turnout in the past two cycles in which only one party had a competitive primary -- a more apt comparison.
Those cycles were 2012 (when Republicans had a competitive primary but Democrats had an incumbent) and 2004 (vice versa). Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, calculated before the primary that if turnout rates were similar this time, Democrats could expect 295,000 to 300,000 voters to turn out.
The final number was right in that range. "Not blockbuster, not below average, but just about normal," Dr. Scala said.
Some Democrats have cited an exciting-sounding statistic: Turnout broke the record set in 2008, when 287,542 people voted in the Democratic primary. This is noteworthy, but it is mostly attributable to the fact that there are more eligible voters in New Hampshire now than in 2008. The percentage of eligible voters who participated did not change much.
Also, because unaffiliated voters can participate in primaries in New Hampshire, it is tricky to compare cycles in which both parties have competitive races -- meaning unaffiliated voters have to choose between two serious contests -- with cycles in which one party has an incumbent whose renomination is a foregone conclusion.
This did not mean that breaking the 2008 record was insignificant -- "a lot of people did come out to vote," said Mia Costa, a political scientist at Dartmouth who studies electoral participation, "and there was a possibility that that wasn't going to be the case, because that's not what we saw in the last primary here" -- but the numbers did not indicate unusual enthusiasm among Democrats.
The most interesting signals can be found in the demographic breakdown of the electorate.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won the primary by about 3,900 votes over former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., was buoyed by very strong support among young voters. Exit polls show that Mr. Sanders overwhelmingly won voters under 40, while voters over 40 were split between Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and that dynamic might have been decisive, Dr. Costa said.
But the results do not appear to support one of Mr. Sanders's biggest arguments for his "electability": that he will bring a slew of first-time voters, formerly disaffected, into the fold.
That theory would call for turnout to be high over all, and especially high in the places Mr. Sanders did best. Dave Wasserman, an editor at the Cook Political Report, estimated on Wednesday that the largest increases in turnout, in comparison to 2016, had actually come in the places Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar did best.
Dr. Scala said: "One would think that if Sanders's theory was right, turnout would be above the norm, and what I'm saying is it looks pretty normal to me. To hear Sanders tell it, there's going to be this tidal wave of new voters. I don't see it."
Across the aisle, more than 150,000 voters -- 151,602, to be precise -- turned out for the Republican primary even though its outcome was never in doubt. That is extremely high for a noncompetitive primary. By comparison, about 54,000 people voted in the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 2012, and about 57,000 voted in the Republican primary in 2004.
Democrats, desperate to beat President Trump, have been trying to read the tea leaves of primary turnout for signs of a blue wave in November. But while trends in the primaries may be suggestive of trends in the general election, it is very difficult to draw reliable conclusions.
"I don't think it would be inaccurate to say that this is a really important election for a lot of people, and people are going to be more fired up now than in other elections," Dr. Costa said. "But it's an unknowable question."

Iowa Democratic Party Leader Resigns After Chaotic, Error-Filled Caucuses

Texto completo: Mr. Price announced he was stepping down after overseeing the chaotic Iowa caucuses that embarrassed the state and national party.
DES MOINES -- Troy Price, the beleaguered chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, resigned on Wednesday, a week after overseeing the chaotic Iowa caucuses that embarrassed the state and national party and left Democrats open to accusations of incompetence by President Trump's re-election campaign.
The Iowa Democratic Party failed to report any results from its first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses on Feb. 3 until the next afternoon. When it did report results, they were filled with errors. Even once the Iowa Democratic Party released what it said were full results, errors remained in the tabulations, and the campaigns of the two victors, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Bernie Sanders, have both asked for a partial recanvass of the results.
Mr. Price, 39, has been the public face of the Iowa caucus debacle, as he has struggled to offer reassuring explanations about the integrity of the caucus reporting process and final results.
"While it is my desire to stay in this role and see this process through to completion, I do believe it is time for the Iowa Democratic Party to begin looking forward, and my presence in my current role makes that more difficult," Mr. Price wrote in a letter to party officials. "Therefore, I will resign as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party effective upon the election of my replacement." The party said its State Central Committee would elect an interim chair on Saturday.
While he acknowledged that the failure of the reporting process "was simply unacceptable," Mr. Price sought to put the best possible light on the events of the past nine days.
"By all accounts, the precinct and satellite caucus meetings themselves went well," he wrote. "In the days following the caucuses, our staff worked under immense pressure to produce a complete report of results from the caucuses and was able to do so in 72 hours. Enduring threats to personal safety, taunts and anger from people around the globe, our staff worked in a professional manner to produce a final result."
The Democratic National Committee and some Iowa Democratic Party leaders have pointed fingers at Mr. Price for not doing more to ensure that changes to the caucus process this year, such as the use of a new results-reporting app, were fully tested and clear to the precinct leaders and many others involved in running the process.
In a conference call with his central committee two days after the caucuses, Mr. Price was pressed by two members over the appearance of cronyism because of his friendships, dating to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, with a senior adviser to Mr. Buttigieg who is married to the founder of the company that developed the caucus app. (The New York Times was provided with a call-in number for the call.)
"We have seen the pictures of you, Troy, with app developers and people with the Buttigieg campaign, and that's concerning," said Holly Brown, a committee member. She told Mr. Price he should not be involved in a planned post-mortem of what went wrong. "We'd like to have you removed from this," she said.
Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats -- who is not on the State Central Committee -- said in an interview that she had been worried about the appearance of cronyism. "Some of the decisions just made it really hard to defend against accusations of cronyism, or conspiracy, frankly," she said.
Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Polk County, which includes Des Moines, said the coziness between state party leaders, vendors and candidates did not originate under Mr. Price. "I think it's been this way for quite some time," he said. "It's kind of like the little families that control petroleum countries. You've got access to resources that everybody wants, and you kind of become your own little kingdom of consultants and advisers."

Texto completo: A reader praises the integrity of the prosecutors who resigned in protest. Also: The burden of being poor; mutual fund disclosure.
To the Editor:
Re "Justice Dept. Acts to Ease Sentence for a Trump Ally" (front page, Feb. 12):
The interference of senior Justice Department officials in the Roger Stone case is a particularly ominous affront to the rule of law. It is but a short step from intervening on behalf of one of the president's allies to intervening to ensure harsher punishment for his enemies.
If Attorney General William Barr acted to advance the president's political agenda, he violated his oath of office and should be impeached.
As for the prosecutors who withdrew from the case and the prosecutor who resigned, I commend them for having the integrity to protest the appalling breach of public trust by senior officials. They are heroes, and I fervently hope that they will someday find themselves on the team assigned to prosecute our lawless president and his henchmen.

To the Editor:
Re "Risk of Losing Benefits From Everyday Errors" (news article, Jan. 30):
The quiz that appeared online with the article accurately describes the enormous administrative burdens placed on my clients, homeless individuals and families in New York City, in order to establish their eligibility for shelter, food stamps, Medicaid and cash assistance.
Many of my clients have experienced the trauma of domestic violence or have mental health challenges and learning disabilities. It is cruel and inhumane to add the burden of having to navigate complex paperwork and bureaucracies to obtain benefits that provide for basic necessities.
Our government should not be setting up roadblocks to assistance, but rather simplifying processes.

Mutual Fund Disclosure Rules
To the Editor:
Re "Mutual Funds Are Still Keeping Secrets" (Op-Ed, Feb. 4):
Arthur Levitt claims that the Investment Company Institute asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to "water down" disclosure requirements.
That's not true. The institute has worked for years with the S.E.C. to modernize shareholder report delivery to help save shareholders millions of dollars every year. Notice and access achieves this goal and helps improve communication by supplying shareholders with disclosures in a format that is engaging, easy to understand and provides access to more information.
In 2021, funds may notify shareholders of the availability of their semiannual and annual report. The notice must include a direct link to the applicable report and instructions on how a shareholder can receive, free of charge, a paper copy. Funds also deliver yearly a summary prospectus, which includes a link to the full prospectus.
I.C.I. continues to work with the S.E.C. to allow funds to use a summary shareholder report, mirroring the design of the successful summary prospectus.
Mr. Levitt seems to measure disclosures by their number and complexity rather than their usefulness. By contrast, the institute is working with the S.E.C. to help funds provide communications that are effective and user-friendly, and in the form that shareholders prefer.

Texto completo: The automaker said it was trying to recoup monetary damages its former chairman had inflicted on the company.
Nissan Motors filed a lawsuit in Japan on Wednesday seeking $ 90 million from its former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who fled the country before his trial on charges of financial wrongdoing.
The automaker says 10 billion yen, or $ 90 million, would cover the monetary damages it says Mr. Ghosn inflicted on the company through misconduct and fraud.
Nissan said it expected that amount to increase as it sought to recover the fines paid to the Japanese Financial Services Agency and other penalties linked to Mr. Ghosn's alleged misconduct.
Mr. Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing. In an emailed statement, a spokesman said, "Nissan's maneuvers continue," noting that the lawsuit was made public one day before the automaker was scheduled to release its earnings report.
"Mr. Ghosn's lawyers will react on the merits of the case once the content of the claim has been brought to their attention," the statement read.
Mr. Ghosn was arrested in Japan in 2018 and charged with underreporting his income and other financial wrongdoing. He fled to Lebanon in late December, an escape that surprised and embarrassed the Japanese authorities, who have issued a warrant for his arrest.
Mr. Ghosn was hailed for years as the rescuer of Nissan, which he made part of a thriving alliance with Renault of France and, later, Mitsubishi of Japan. But his career came to an abrupt end about 15 months ago after he was arrested in Japan and his legal troubles started to play out.
Questions are growing about whether Mr. Ghosn left Nissan in good shape. It has slipped into a deep slump, with revenue and profit falling around the world. Sales in the United States, a critical market for Nissan, fell 10 percent in 2019 even as global auto sales were near record levels.
Analysts and industry executives blame Mr. Ghosn for unrelentingly pushing for growth to the detriment of relationships with dealers who sell Nissan cars.
Mr. Ghosn has been unapologetic, railing publicly against what he says is a vast conspiracy to take him down. "The revival of Nissan, nobody's going to take it from me," he told The New York Times in a January interview.

Texto completo: Mr. Velásquez, who boasted of murdering hundreds of people for Pablo Escobar, in recent years had built a business around the memories of his criminal activities.
Jhon Jairo Velásquez, a former member of the Medellín drug cartel who boasted of committing hundreds of murders on behalf of the drug lord Pablo Escobar, and who parlayed his criminal past into a popular YouTube channel, books and a movie, died on Feb. 6 in Bogotá, Colombia. He was 57.
His death was announced by Colombia's National Penitentiary and Prison Institute. Imprisoned on charges of extortion in 2018, he had been hospitalized since Dec. 31 with late-stage stomach cancer.
Mr. Velásquez said he had murdered more than 300 people and been involved in the killings of 3,000 others, an account that has never been confirmed.
"I'm a professional killer, I killed for money," he said in "Escobar's Hit Man," a 2017 documentary on the Russian television network RT. "I also killed out of love and respect for Pablo Escobar."
Before his latest sentence, he had spent 22 years in prison for plotting the killing of a Colombian presidential candidate in 1989. After his release on parole in 2014, he achieved celebrity by posting dozens of videos on his YouTube channel, called Popeye Arrepentido (Remorseful Popeye), which had more than 1.2 million subscribers.
He also directed a movie about his life, wrote two books and hosted tours of Medellín. In some videos he would visit the graves of his victims and recount how he had murdered them.
To the relatives of victims and the authorities, his celebrity was a slap in the face. They said people should not forget that Mr. Velásquez had been a coldblooded assassin who expressed little remorse.
Some of those close to Mr. Escobar have challenged Mr. Velásquez's self-promotion. Roberto Escobar, his brother, denied the claim that Mr. Velásquez had been Pablo's right-hand man.
"This is the biggest lie ever," Roberto said.
Mr. Velásquez sought forgiveness from his victims' families and insisted that he had changed, yet he would turn on those who refused to forgive him, like the son of a man who was killed in the crash of a plane that had been bombed by Mr. Velásquez's cartel in 1989. He called the son a "bad man with an evil heart."
A Netflix series, "Surviving Escobar," was adapted from one of his books.
"It's not about monetizing my life story but about telling the stories, the things that happened," Mr. Velásquez told The New York Times in 2016, referring to his videos and his second career.
Jhon Jairo Velásquez Vásquez was born on April 15, 1962, in Yarumal, 50 miles from Medellín, in northern Colombia. He wanted to be a police officer and joined the Colombian Navy because, he said, he had loved firearms since he was a child. It was in the navy that he acquired the nickname Popeye, for his wide jaw and strength.
He resigned, he told RT in 2017, because the navy "only had old wooden boats and no warships."
"I only wanted to shoot, kill and get adrenaline kicks," he said.
He started working for Mr. Escobar when he was around 17. He said Mr. Escobar was "a genius -- an evil genius, but a genius anyway."
Under Mr. Escobar's orders, Mr. Velásquez said, he kidnapped, tortured or murdered journalists, judges, politicians and rivals. He said he also organized the kidnapping in 1988 of Andrés Pastrana Arango, who later became president, and the murder of the presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan in 1990. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder.
Mr. Velásquez joined Mr. Escobar when the drug lord agreed in 1991 to be held in a resortlike prison, La Catedral, which he had his own engineers design. Living in luxury, Mr. Escobar ran his drug business from the jail but escaped months later. Mr. Velásquez turned himself in to the police shortly after, in October 1992.
Mr. Escobar was killed 16 months later in a rooftop shooting in Medellín, his hometown, surrounded by 500 police officers and soldiers.
Mr. Velásquez's notoriety illustrated the ambivalent relationship that Medellín had with Mr. Escobar and the crimes committed by his cartel, even decades after his death. While the city seems determined to overcome its grim past, many residents have a tolerant attitude toward the tourism it attracts.
"For me, Escobar was a terrorist, a drug dealer, a kidnapper -- but he was also my friend," Mr. Velásquez said. "He treated me with kindness and respect."
His survivors include a son, Mateo.
Before beginning a sentence at a high-security prison in Valledupar, Mr. Velásquez said he could always some day go back to the mountains that ring Medellín, from which Mr. Escobar had operated.
"Taking up arms is always an option," he said.
María Iguarán contributed reporting from Medellín, Colombia, and Jenny Carolina González from Bogotá.

Texto completo: It's a high-class but increasingly common problem: being a former magazine editor in a digitized world that cares little about whose name used to be on top of a defunct masthead. (A masthead, for those unfamiliar with the term, lists in careful hierarchy the top staff of a publication and is most often printed on paper -- which tells you pretty much all you need to know.)
At 48, Dan Peres is already an old hand at being a former magazine editor. Condé Nast shut down Details, the men's glossy that he had been editor of for 15 years, in 2015. Overnight Mr. Peres went from two decades spent as a coveted presence at fashion shows and parties in the world's capitals to a divorced dad adrift in the 'burbs.
He tried to pivot to digital publications, but quickly learned there is little job security in start-ups. He took on some consulting gigs. He was also jotting down stories from his past life, one not many people knew about.
"I started to have some conversations about next steps career-wise, and during that time I started writing," Mr. Peres said last week, sitting in his home office in Irvington, N.Y., at a wooden drafting desk that he had lugged from Paris. "There were experiences I wanted to get down on paper. I wanted to keep my mind sharp."
The result is a memoir, "As Needed for Pain," which was published this week by Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins.
In the book, Mr. Peres reveals an opioid addiction that he tried for years to hide, and which, until he got clean in 2007, had him taking as many as 60 Vicodin pills a day. Among many anecdotes that illustrate his wincing desperation, he tells of gobbling up pills that had fallen onto the floor beneath a urinal at a black-tie event in 2003. "Does the five-second rule count for piss-soaked drugs?" Mr. Peres writes. "I'd like to say I hesitated."
"You can't fault his honesty, although you've got to wonder about the judgment of his bosses," Jay McInerney wrote in a review for The New York Times. And indeed, "As Needed for Pain" is an eye-opening document of how Mr. Peres for seven years spent his working hours and many of his company's dollars in pursuit of getting high.
Since 2009, Condé Nast has gone from publishing 22 magazine brands (including one digital-only publication) to 16 magazine brands (six of which are digital only). In 2017, the company had about $ 120 million in losses.
Mr. Peres's reign seems to have epitomized the bloated pride before the fall. Founded by Annie Flanders as a scrappy downtown magazine in 1982, Details had gone through several iterations before being taken over by Fairchild, which was ultimately moved under the Condé Nast umbrella. With Mr. Peres as editor, the magazine was retooled as a manual for a metrosexual clinging to a certain frat boy quality, lest you call him gay.
Details had for a time what Tina Brown always used to call "buzz," with cover models like Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Federline (twice!) and Ben Affleck. It was not so filled with ads that it was a doorstop, like the flagship magazines Vogue and Vanity Fair, but it was still robust.
Freelance journalists wanted to contribute to Details (I was one, reporting a profile of Patrick Kennedy for it in 2001), and the magazine won awards for its design.
Condé Nast, which also then regularly published the magazines Gourmet, Jane, Lucky and Domino, had become famous through shows like HBO's "Sex and the City." The company was known for around-the-block Town Cars filled with enigmatic editors who lunched at New York restaurants like the Four Seasons and enjoyed clothing expense accounts and interest-free mortgages provided by their employer.
After being summoned at 28 from Paris where he had worked as a writer and editor for W magazine and given the top job at Details, Mr. Peres lived subsidized for months in the Morgans Hotel. Once, he trashed his room because he couldn't find his Vicodin; he blamed the housekeeper for stealing his drugs.
The hotel staff "called me Mr. Peres," he writes. "I liked it. I never once told them to call me Dan."
Those Were the Days
Editors of glossy magazines had status then because their products seemed important. People went to newsstands or physical mailboxes to find bound pieces of paper dropped by postal workers that would tell them who and what was cool, giving them topics for cocktail-party and water-cooler chatter.
Portable phones were these whiz-bang things that folded shut and were tucked away in pockets and expensive "It" bags.
The early and mid-aughts were the Roaring '20s of magazines, with the looming economic recession not yet imaginable and the disruption of digital media not considered by publishing executives, so infatuated with their pretty print pages and the huge margins that print advertising delivered. No matter that their one real job was to have their fingers on the pulse of What's Next.
"Those that are the oracle never think they're one day not going to be the oracle any longer," said Ariel Foxman, who helped create Cargo magazine in 2003 for Condé Nast, which closed it in 2006.
Mr. Foxman went on to become editor in chief of InStyle, where he remained until 2016. He is currently trying to sell a memoir called "The Magnificent Dissolve," which looks at how magazines "led the conversation and then found themselves in the course of a few years chasing the conversation and trying to stay relevant."
If published, it will join a subgenre of memoirs by onetime Condé Nast editors that includes Ms. Brown's "The Vanity Fair Diaries"; "Save Me the Plums," by Ruth Reichl, the former New York Times restaurant critic who went on to become Gourmet's editor until Condé Nast shuttered it in 2009; and "More Than Enough," by Elaine Welteroth, late of Teen Vogue.
"What a blast to be a part of something at its peak that now can be seen as a golden age," said another memoirist, Dana Brown. Mr. Brown was a bartender plucked for an assistant job by the former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter.
He rose to be one of Mr. Carter's deputies and is now writing "Disappearing Ink," the working title of a memoir about the experience. "It was a time that was pre-technology, it was a time that was magical," he said. "Writers were called writers, photographers were called photographers. It was before we all became 'content creators."'
Kim France was the founding editor of Lucky magazine, which started in 2000 and ceased publishing in 2015. She too is writing a memoir: "This Is Not My Beautiful House," about moving from Texas to New York and building an outwardly glamorous career while battling substance abuse and depression. (She left Condé Nast in 2010.)
Her mood swings and impetuous behavior were initially treated as a sign of her creative talent, Ms. France said. This was the Condé Nast way.
"It was a privately held company, and they could employ all these really creative, kind of crazy people," she said. "You had André Leon Talley swanning around. There was drama all over the place. It was obviously bad that this culture existed the way it did, but it started because they valued creativity and the kind of people that were creative." (As it happens, Mr. Talley also has a memoir set to publish, in April, called "The Chiffon Trenches.")
It was a culture that somehow allowed Mr. Peres for seven years to live a dual life as an editor in chief responsible for the publication of a national magazine and the management of dozens of employees, and an opioid addict.
When writing the book, Mr. Peres said, it didn't occur to him that he might be revealing a lack of corporate oversight at Condé Nast or what a white man could get away with doing (and not doing) at a company known for its lavish spending.
"I didn't overthink it," he said. "I always set out to write a story about myself and my addiction and how intense of a grip it had on me, and in order to illustrate that, I had to touch on a number of elements of my life, including of course my professional life. I really see Details as a character in the book."
A spokesman for Condé Nast said, "We're happy for Dan's recovery and to know that he's doing well. Since the time chronicled in Dan's book, our company and our industry have evolved significantly, and we can't comment on the way our company was run under prior leadership."
Mr. Peres tells in his memoir of frequently not making it into the office; when he did, he sneaked occasional naps on his office couch during the heavy drug years. He fell asleep while interviewing a job applicant. He had an assistant plan an unnecessary trip to San Diego, where he rented a car (he doesn't remember if he or the company paid for it), drove to Tijuana, Mexico, and bought $ 6,000 worth of drugs to smuggle back across the border and then to New York (in between, he appeared on "Politically Incorrect" with Bill Maher in Los Angeles).
He would find reasons to fly to Los Angeles, to meet a publicist, see his girlfriend, do drugs with a rock star, who is unnamed ("plane highs were usually the best, especially in first class," Mr. Peres writes). That girlfriend, the actress Sarah Wynter, would become his wife and then ex-wife; they have three school-age sons.
He spent four days "in a plush terry cloth robe" at the Four Seasons in Milan without attending the fashion shows he had traveled there for because he didn't have sufficient Vicodin to feel like himself. (He then had the front desk send a medico to his room, who wrote him a prescription.)
Mr. Peres conscripted an assistant to unwittingly create with the Condé Nast travel office a 30-day itinerary to Italy and Australia that he could show to doctors as evidence that he needed to fill prescriptions in advance.
On a work trip to Los Angeles, Mr. Peres considered trying heroin and asked his driver to take him to Skid Row, where he was chased by a stranger whom he'd asked for drugs ("It's not easy to run for your life in a pair of Tod's driving moccasins," he writes). He decided buying drugs on the street was not for him.
"I listened to Journey and practically knew the room service menu at the Ritz in Paris by heart," he writes. "I didn't know how to do this."
His Town Car driver in Los Angeles, he writes, became his drug dealer.
'We Were Running the Show'
When he was present, Mr. Peres could be mercurial, some former colleagues said. "You never knew what kind of day it would be," said Ece Ozturk, his former assistant, who worked at Details for about six years. "Would it be a good day with the nice Dan or a bad day with the mean Dan? He could be very charming at times, but people were afraid of Dan. People walked on eggshells around him."
One former employee who had been fired sent a letter to Mary Berner, a publishing executive overseeing the company division that included Details. The letter, which was shared with The Times, cited "Dan Peres's conspicuously frequent absences" and his "admissions about pill-taking."
"The atmosphere at this young men's magazine wasn't just freewheeling -- it was unprofessional," the fired employee wrote.
Ms. Berner, now the C.E.O. of Cumulus Media, said she had no memory of reading the letter. "I wish I had known" about Mr. Peres's drug problem, she said, "because I would have tried to help him."
Mr. Peres writes that his assistant was known to many at Details as "the Rescheduler." In one seven-week period Ms. Ozturk sent at least five emails to staff canceling meetings, according to emails reviewed by The Times. ("Dan is not in this morning, but may be in this afternoon" ... "Dan will be out tomorrow, returning Friday" ... "Dan is out today" ... "Dan will be away on business tomorrow and Thursday, returning Friday." Or maybe not: "Dan did not make it back from L.A. so to those who were supposed to have a 'Vitals' meeting," she wrote, referring to a section of the magazine, "it has been canceled.")
In the absence of a functional editor in chief, the staff of Details worked long hours to put out a magazine. "There were a lot of people there who could pick up the baton," said Andrew Essex, an advertising executive who served for part of Mr. Peres's tenure as executive editor.
Over the years, Mr. Peres's colleagues included Laura Brown, now the editor in chief of InStyle; Jessica Lustig, a deputy editor of The New York Times Magazine; Jeff Gordinier, the food and drinks editor for Esquire; and Andrea Oliveri, a founder of the events company Special Projects.
Even with such support, Details under Mr. Peres had its fair share of mess-ups that these days, under the stern gaze of social media, might have been unsurvivable. In 2007, as Mr. Peres was trying to detox at his mother's house in Baltimore, Mr. Affleck complained that he was misquoted in a cover story.
There was a party that the magazine was hosting in Mr. Affleck's honor, and he needed to be placated. Mr. Peres quickly apologized.
Bart Blasengame, who had written the story, conceded that he had played fast and loose with Mr. Affleck's sentences.
"He said things in fits and starts and I took quotes from different parts of the interview and made them cohesive," said Mr. Blasengame, who now owns and runs a music club in Portland, Ore.
He said part of the fun of working for Details was the lack of oversight. "We were running the show," he remembered of himself and his fellow writers. Then, after the publication of the Affleck story, which had been fact-checked and given the OK by Mr. Peres, his contract was terminated (though he went on to receive other assignments from Details). "Admittedly, I didn't handle it well," he said, "but it definitely felt like getting thrown under the bus."
In 2002, the magazine had published an article, "Dudes Who Dish," that carried the byline of Kurt Andersen, the author well known in media circles as a founder, with Mr. Carter and Thomas L. Phillips Jr., of Spy magazine.
The main problem with the article was that Mr. Andersen didn't write it. He didn't even know of its existence until his wife, Anne Kreamer, saw it while leafing through a Details at the gym and asked her husband why he hadn't told her he was writing for that magazine.
Mr. Peres bragged about landing Mr. Andersen in the pages of Details in his editor's letter, not having done the very editor in chief thing of reaching out personally to Mr. Andersen to thank him.
"The extra weird wrinkle," said Mr. Andersen during a phone conversation last week, was that the magazine featured an "interview" of him among the short bios of that month's contributors. "As well as the terrible piece attributed to me, there was an even worse, horrible, 'Hey dude, it's just gossip' quote from me. It was mortifying. Not just mortifying. Grotesque."
Mr. Andersen said of the magazine, "It was ahead of its time in terms of fake news fantasy-land alternative truth."
One of Mr. Peres's staffers, Bob Ickes, handled the editing of the article. (When contacted this week, Mr. Ickes said he did not write the piece published under Mr. Andersen's name.)
"Mistakes happen at publications," Mr. Peres said last week, while acknowledging his yearslong focus on drugs above work and all else. "Surely the magazine would not have been as good as it was if not for my staff. I know anyone who has spent any time around an addict has to spend a lot of time doing a lot of heavy lifting."
Mr. Essex, the magazine's former deputy, said it is not fair to portray Mr. Peres as having no involvement with the editorial product known as Details. "He could identify bizarre permutations of male behavior particularly at the epicenter of gay and straight," Mr. Essex said.
This sort of "male anthropology," as Mr. Essex called it, did get Mr. Peres in trouble sometimes, like when he assigned to a staffer a 2004 piece titled "Gay or Asian?" that drew protesters to picket outside of the Condé Nast headquarters. "It was a tremendous lapse of judgment," Mr. Peres said.
But cancel culture was not yet ascendant, and he stayed atop the masthead for another 11 years.
"You know when you're in dysfunctional family and it's the only family you know so you think that's how all families are?" Ms. Ozturk said of working at Details then. "It was like that."

Texto completo: The right frame, mattress, and bedding can promote better rest and pull together the look of your entire room with a lot less effort and money than you might think.
Adulting is expensive, and when the bills roll in, blowing a chunk of your paycheck on a new bed can feel daunting. But a good-looking, comfy space to sleep is always a good investment.
The right frame, mattress, and bedding can promote better rest and pull together the look of your entire room with a lot less effort and money than you might think. Whether you're starting from scratch or supplementing what you already own, Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, can help you figure out which items you actually need -- and what you can safely skip.
[It's Sleep Week at Wirecutter! Read more expert-tested bedding and mattress recommendations , and see the best sleep deals for your bedroom.]
Choose the right mattress
The right mattress is crucial to a good night's sleep, as anyone who has woken up with an aching back after spending the night on a saggy hotel bed or a friend's rock-hard sofa knows. Luckily, we're living in a golden age of mattress shopping: Nearly every online brand offers some sort of risk-free trial, which is nice, since finding a comfortable mattress can be hit or miss.
You can expect a new mattress to last you about 10 years (the length of a standard warranty), so don't settle until you find one you want to sleep on long term. Wirecutter's mattress buying guide is a great place to start your shopping. It'll help you answer some basic questions you may not have thought to ask: How much bounce do you want in your mattress? Are you a hot sleeper? What is edge support? For ultimate convenience, consider a foam mattress, which can usually be delivered right to your doorstep. Wirecutter's picks start at around $ 300 (for a queen), and most come with a 100-day trial period, though many offer more -- so you'll never get stuck with a bed you hate.
It's not sexy, but we also suggest safeguarding your mattress with a SafeRest waterproof protector (if you're worried about spills, leaks, or dust mites) or a Protect-A-Bed encasement (if bed bugs are a potential problem). Think of it like insurance -- neither protector will cost you much, but they could save you from needing to replace your mattress before its time.
Add height and air flow with a bed frame
A bed frame is about more than making it look like you have your life together. It adds extra support to your mattress and places it at a comfortable height, making it easier for you to climb in and out of bed. It's also healthier, since a mattress on a flat surface (like the floor) can retain moisture and become a breeding ground for mold. Every bed frame Wirecutter recommends uses slats -- thin wood or metal beams laid across the frame -- to support the mattress and increase air flow. Experts suggest looking for a bed frame with at least 3 inches between each slat, which lets the mattress really breathe.
A tight budget is no excuse to skip a frame. We found several sturdy and stylish platform bed frames for under $ 300. They don't include headboards, but they're simple enough to blend in with any existing décor. And if you're ready to invest in a frame that makes a statement -- or you want something that feels more luxurious -- We also recommend six modern bed frames worth the splurge.
Spending more will usually get you something with extra personality and style, as most of Wirecutter's picks feature details like unique silhouettes, tapered legs, specialized slat systems, or colorful upholstery. Pricier picks typically include headboards, too, which help protect your wall from damage, keep your pillows in place, and give your bed a more upscale feel.
Because they often come with substantial warranties, you can expect to use these bed frames for years (or even decades). Buying pricey furniture that lasts may feel a little risky -- what if your tastes change? -- but these picks have clean lines and classic styling, so they'll never feel out of place.
Find bedding for all seasons
Start with the basics: Cotton sheets. Figure out if you like sheets that feel crisp and cool (percale) or soft and drapey (sateen). Our favorite percale set is made by L. L. Bean, and we also love these affordable sateen sheets from JCPenney.
Having a couple of sets will make your life (and laundry) a lot easier: To tailor the temperature of your bedding and add some texture, expand your repertoire with L. L. Bean's cozy flannel sheets for winter and Cultiver's luxurious and breezy linen sheets for summer. Cultiver also sells sheets by the piece, so if you can't splurge on a full set quite yet, you can still mix some linen into your rotation. Don't bother with sheets made from materials like microfiber, bamboo, or lyocell (the latter two are simply types of rayon). Brands may brag that they're environmentally friendly, but Wirecutter hasn't found any proof that these processed fabrics are any greener than cotton -- and they're not as durable or comfortable.
Most bedding we recommend comes in a wide range of colors, but we don't suggest going too crazy. Classic white sheets work with any décor, and white is the easiest color to keep clean (you can wash white sheets in hot water or use bleach without worrying about fading). Everyone should own at least one set. For a look that's brighter and more fun but still polished, try sticking to one color scheme, mixing a couple of similar shades that work together. It's eye-catching without feeling like a hodgepodge.
Now take a look at your pillow. If you fold it in half, does it spring open or collapse into a mushy blob? If it's the latter, it's probably time for a new one. Since every body is different, pillows are notoriously difficult to buy. Wirecutter loves Nest Bedding's Easy Breather for side- and back-sleepers. Its shredded-foam filling lets you adjust for the perfect fit: Simply unzip the cover and remove as much as you want. Similarly, Sleep Number's PlushComfort ultimate pillow lets you layer one, two, or three inserts inside, a design that helped our stomach-sleepers customize their fit and get more comfortable than they could with the other pillows they tried during Wirecutter's testing.
What size bed should I get?
Wirecutter's rule of thumb: Buy the biggest bed that will easily fit your space. Realize that leveling up means you'll also need to buy a larger mattress and bigger bedding, but if you share a bed with a partner, pets, or kids -- and you have the room -- consider a king. Chances are, you won't regret giving your crew some more breathing room. Those extra inches often mean the difference between an all-night foot in your face and a solid sleep.
However, size up only if you truly have the floor space. If you bonk a knee every time you try to squeeze by, the bed is too big. Being a grown-up means being honest about your needs and making small adjustments until you land on the setup that's right for you.

Texto completo: The list was praised by a range of rights groups and denounced by Israeli officials, who saw it as a capitulation to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
GENEVA -- The United Nations on Wednesday published a much-delayed and contentious list of 112 companies doing business with Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, drawing praise from human rights groups and denunciations from Israel.
Publication of the list was seen as a victory for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which has sought to pressure Israel economically over the settlements, which most of the world considers a violation of international law.
The Israeli government views the B.D.S. movement, which has supporters in many countries including in the United States, as an anti-Semitic plan to delegitimize Israel. B.D.S. supporters deny that accusation.
The United Nations said companies placed on the list had undertaken business "that raised particular human rights concerns" like facilitating the construction, expansion or maintenance of Israeli settlements or the demolition of Palestinian housing and property.
Most of the listed companies are Israeli but a few are international companies, including Motorola Solutions, General Mills, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, and Expedia from the United States; Alstom and Egis Rail of France; and JC Bamford Excavators of Britain.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which compiled and published the list, was acting in accordance with instructions by the Human Rights Council in 2016. In a reflection of the political sensitivity surrounding the list, the office said the list had no judicial or legal status.
Still, the reaction among Israeli officials was furious.
"Whoever boycotts us will be boycotted," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that called the Human Rights Council "a biased body that is devoid of influence." Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, condemned its publication as a "shameful surrender" to countries and organizations that he said wanted to hurt Israel.
Israel and its most important ally in the United Nations, the United States, have long condemned the Human Rights Council for what they describe as promotion of an anti-Israeli agenda. The United States withdrew from the council in June of 2018, calling its passage of numerous resolutions critical of Israel "clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not human rights."
Some of the Israeli reaction on Wednesday was equally unsparing of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile.
The Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz, in condemning the publication, said Ms. Bachelet's office had "lost touch with reality."
Israel's mission in Geneva, home to Ms. Bachelet's office, lamented that she had succumbed to pressure to publish the "defamatory blacklist" and had "lost all credibility or ability to promote human rights in our region."
Publication of the list would have profound consequences for Israel's relations with the high commissioner's office, the Israeli mission said.
The Palestinian leadership, on the other hand, welcomed the move.
Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said it "enhances and consolidates the credibility of the Human Rights Council and international organizations in the face of the fierce attack and the intense pressure that the Trump administration places on these institutions."
He said it was a "crucial first step to restore hope in multilateralism and international law."
The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement welcomed publication of the list, describing it as a "first significant and concrete step by any U.N. entity" toward holding Israeli and international businesses to account for profiting from Israeli settlements.
Publication of the list came a day after the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, denounced the Trump administration's plan for Middle East peace in an address at the U.N. in New York. The plan would allow Israel to annex about 30 percent of the West Bank, including all its settlements there, while offering the Palestinians chunks of territory connected by tunnels and bridges that they could call a state.
Human Rights Watch, an international human rights group, endorsed publication of the list, saying it served notice to companies that "to do business with illegal settlements is to aid in the commission of war crimes."
Omar Shakir, the group's representative in Israel until his deportation in November, said in an email that the list's release underscored international rejection of Israeli and U.S. efforts to legitimize Israeli settlements.
The high commissioner's office was supposed to produce the list in 2017. But it repeatedly delayed release, saying there were complications verifying companies' data.
An interim report at the start of 2018 said the office had identified 206 companies doing business with the settlements. Some were removed from the final list after further investigation showed they were not doing business with settlements.
The practical effects of publishing the database are unclear given the report's explicit statement that it has no legal standing. .
Still, publication "can deliver a significant economic blow" to the companies named, Ofer Zalzberg, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group said on Twitter.
Even before its release, he added, some Israeli firms had encountered difficulties raising loans that required proof of legal conduct, merely on the strength of unconfirmed reports they might be included.
The list formally connects companies to Israeli settlements that are illegal in international law and could prompt some companies doing business with them to end their ties, Mr. Zalzberg said.
Most of the American companies on the list did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
But General Mills said in a statement that it had been listed because of a manufacturing facility that makes Pillsbury products like bread and croissants in an industrial park in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Atarot. The statement said half the workers are Palestinian and that "every employee has full social benefits without prejudice to race, religion or nationality."
Isabel Kershner and David M. Halbfinger contributed reporting from Jerusalem and Rick Gladstone from New York.

Philharmonic's Season Includes Kurtag Opera

Texto completo: An acclaimed Kurtag opera is a highlight of the New York Philharmonic's 2020-21 programming.
Next season, the New York Philharmonic will give the American premiere of "Fin de Partie," the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag's acclaimed opera based on Beckett's "Endgame," in a fully staged production conducted by its music director, Jaap van Zweden.
The Kurtag opera promises to be one of the highlights of the Philharmonic's 2020-21 season, which was announced Wednesday.
The orchestra will also perform new works by Joan Tower, Jessie Montgomery, Mary Kouyoumdjian, Melinda Wagner, Angélica Negrón, Du Yun, Anna Thorvaldsdottir and Caroline Shaw. Those pieces are part of Project 19, the Philharmonic's multiyear initiative commissioning 19 works by women to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which barred the states from denying women the right to vote.
The vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth will participate in several programs over two weeks in February. And the jazz pianist Chick Corea will be the orchestra's artist in residence, performing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24, with his own cadenzas, and writing a trombone concerto.
The new season is not as ambitious as the one unveiled recently by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which has the largest annual budget of any American orchestra. But Deborah Borda, the New York Philharmonic's president and chief executive officer -- and the former leader in Los Angeles -- said it would present the work of important artists and composers in meaningful ways.
"I think that what we're providing, in terms of New York audiences, is really vibrant, and really different, and living up to the thought of being in New York City and in our time," she said in an interview.
Here are some of the events that writers for The New York Times are looking forward to.
A Balanced Program (Sept. 24-29)
Conducted by Mr. van Zweden, this may be one of the season's most well-balanced programs: It opens with the premiere of Ms. Montgomery's piece for Project 19 (prepare with "Banner," her stirring and cleverly political deconstruction of the national anthem); continues with Lisa Batiashvili in Szymanowski's Violin Concerto No. 1, a mercurial thrill ride that she has previously played with astonishing mastery; and concludes with Dvorak's familiar yet irresistible Seventh Symphony. JOSHUA BARONE
Tchaikovsky, With a Spark (Oct. 8-13)
I never would have imagined getting excited over a program offering two overplayed Tchaikovsky works: the First Piano Concerto and "Pathétique" Symphony. But the performers here make all the difference. The conductor is Manfred Honeck, who has been winning acclaim for bringing fresh vitality and insight to repertory staples as the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. And the soloist in the concerto is the brilliant and probing young Italian pianist Beatrice Rana, in her Philharmonic debut. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Malkki Returns (Nov. 12-17)
Susanna Malkki is simply one of the most exciting conductors of the day. Each of the three programs she has offered so far with the Philharmonic (starting with her 2015 debut) has been exceptional. For her next, she leads two works by her Finnish forebear Sibelius: "The Oceanides" and the visionary Fifth Symphony. And it should be fun to hear what she makes of John Adams's Saxophone Concerto, featuring the impressive Branford Marsalis. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Eun Sun Kim's Debut (Dec. 30-Jan. 5)
The fast-rising conductor Eun Sun Kim's appointment as the next music director of the San Francisco Opera made history -- she will be the first woman to hold the post at an American opera company of its size and stature -- so I'm eager to hear her Philharmonic debut. She will lead the pianist Alice Sara Ott in Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, in a program that also features Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 3 and the New York premiere of Texu Kim's "Dub-Sanjo." MICHAEL COOPER
Blomstedt and Levit (Jan. 21-23)
Herbert Blomstedt will be going on 94 -- among the oldest musicians working but undiminished and ever perceptive -- when he returns to the Philharmonic to conduct Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto and Nielsen's Symphony No. 5, which hasn't been heard since 2014, during Alan Gilbert's enlightening Nielsen survey. Joining for the Schumann will be Igor Levit, no stranger to New York but finally making his debut with this orchestra. JOSHUA BARONE
A Thorvaldsdottir Premiere (Feb. 10-13)
Some of the Project 19 commissions feel like they're thrown randomly into traditional programs. Not so with this more coherent bill, in which the Finnish conductor Hannu Lintu leads an evening that includes two touchstones by Sibelius, as well as the American premiere of a new work by the Icelandic Ms. Thorvaldsdottir. The non-Nordic odd man out is Rachmaninoff, whose First Piano Concerto will be played by Yuja Wang. SETH COLTER WALLS
Roomful of Teeth Sings Shaw (Feb. 18-23)
The vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth collaborated memorably with the Philharmonic in a 2018 run of Berio's "Sinfonia." This time, the group will help deliver the premiere of a work by one of its members: the Pulitzer- and Grammy-winning Ms. Shaw. I'll be listening for how the usually hard-charging Mr. van Zweden approaches this composer's subtle and surprising methods of building propulsion. SETH COLTER WALLS
Berg, Brahms and Wagner (April 29-May 1)
For all its pathbreaking 20th century daring, Alban Berg's elegiac Violin Concerto -- dedicated to "the memory of an angel," Manon Gropius, who died at 18 -- has a strongly emotional, Romantic core. So it will be interesting to hear Mr. van Zweden conduct it, with the violinist Renaud Capuçon, on a program that pairs the concerto with music from Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" and Brahms's Symphony No. 2. MICHAEL COOPER
Gaffigan and Americana (May 21-25)
Though he conducted the Philharmonic in parks concerts in 2018, James Gaffigan returns to the Geffen Hall podium this season for the first time since his superb subscription debut in 2015. He'll introduce the orchestra to Dvorak's American Suite, which he recorded (shiningly) several years ago, on a program that also includes Samuel Barber's bombastic, soaring Symphony in One Movement and Bernstein's "Age of Anxiety" Symphony, with the ever-suave pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet as soloist. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Fin de Partie' (June 10 and 12)
When it had its premiere in 2018 in Milan, Mr. Kurtag's first opera captured the paradox of its composer's best music: a sense of unsettled serenity. Perfectly wrought in gnomic scenes, it treats Beckett with spare, sometimes stark delicacy. The Philharmonic brings it to the United States for the first time and just two performances -- conducted by Mr. van Zweden, directed by Claire van Kampen and starring Laurent Naouri, Rod Gilfry and J'Nai Bridges.

Santu Mofokeng, Whose Photos of Apartheid Life Were Like Poetry, Dies at 63

Texto completo: His sublime black-and-white images of everyday life in South Africa both during and after white rule capture hope and unfulfilled expectations.
Santu Mofokeng, a photographer whose searing images of everyday life in South Africa's black townships documented the prospects of freedom from apartheid and the unfulfilled promise of its overthrow, died on Jan. 26 in Johannesburg. He was 63.
His death was announced by Maker, which represents the Santu Mofokeng Foundation. He had progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative brain disease that confined him to a wheelchair and left him unable to speak, according to South African news reports.
While Mr. Mofokeng (pronounced MOE-foe-keng) never considered himself an integral part of the struggle against apartheid, he was steeped in the policy's consequences.
He was raised in an impoverished household by a single mother; attended Morris Isaacson High School, which was a forge for the student uprising in Soweto in 1976 against white rule; and witnessed his younger brother being beaten by white bullies retaliating for the protests against the government and its brutal suppression of dissent.
After beginning his career as a darkroom technician, Mr. Mofokeng plunged into photojournalism, covering demonstrations and strikes and the police's implacable response -- all of which attracted international attention, especially as documented by television cameras.
But he developed a thirst for more perspective than the daily deadlines could deliver, and he concluded that South Africa's eventual transformation into a multiracial society would proceed slowly enough to be documented over time in stark black-and-white still photographs.
"While many other photographers have captured the spectacle of protest, Mofokeng has captured the more subtle sublimity of the body in pain, or the body transfigured -- by political belief, by faith," Ashraf Jamal, a cultural critic, wrote in Aperture. "He is widely celebrated as the spiritual painter of South Africa's tormented body politic, and his uniqueness lies in his ability to capture a subject's aura, their life hidden from view."
Mr. Mofokeng caught that aura in many photographs and projects: a picture of an empty street with a placard that reads "The Power to Fight Back" during his nation's first democratic election, in 1994; "Train Church" (1986), which depicts impromptu religious rituals on a crowded, and segregated, commuter rail car; "The Bloemhof Portfolio" of rural farmworkers, whom he spent years photographing; "On the Tracks," a 1994 photo essay on New York City subway workers; and "The Black Photo Album/Look at Me: 1890-1950," an annotated archive of formal colonial-era portraits of African families.
"It's not about what you see in these photos," Mr. Mofokeng once said. "It's about what you don't see, but feel."
His work has been shown around the world. A color landscape series, "Graves," went on display at the Venice Biennale in 2013. An exhibition at the Walther Collection project space in New York in 2015 surveyed his photographs. A 21-volume collection of 551 photographs from his archive of 32,000 frames, "Santu Mofokeng: Stories," was published by Steidl last year.
Joshua Chuang, the Robert B. Menschel senior curator of photography at the New York Public Library, called Mr. Mofokeng "one of the great world figures in photography of the past 50 years."
"While his pictures are rooted in the realities of apartheid South Africa, they refuse to conform to stereotypes," Mr. Chuang said in an email.
"They are unpredictable, oblique, and varied in their form and approach, transcendent without being heroic," he added. "They convey a complex humanism that is not predetermined, but rather one that allows for vice, irreverence and miracle."
Mr. Mofokeng was born on Oct. 19, 1956, in Johannesburg. His father, a migrant worker, died when he was 4. His mother was a maid.
"I was raised by a parent who instilled in me a religious thing about always searching for meaning and purpose in everything we do," Mr. Mofokeng told the curator and critic Hans Ulrich Obrist in 2002. "This informs my enterprise and the work that I do."
He received his first camera as a gift from his sister when he was 17. That gift, Mr. Chuang said, helped him overcome shyness.
Among Mr. Mofokeng's survivors are his wife, Boitumelo, a community developer and marathon runner, and two children. His brother Ishmael died of H.I.V.-related causes in 2004.
In 1986, Mr. Mofokeng joined the Afrapix collective, a photographic agency established to publicize the abuses of apartheid. He was tutored there by the photojournalist Jurgen Schadeberg.
A year later, he was hired by the South African newspaper The New Nation. From 1988 to 1998, he worked as a documentary photographer and visual anthropologist for the African Studies Institute's Oral History Project at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, where his mentor was David Goldblatt, one of the nation's most acclaimed photographers, who died in 2018. In 1991 he studied at the International Center of Photography in New York.
Mr. Mofokeng's approach to his subjects, and to his métier itself, was unconventional. His work was so metaphorical that he was often described as a poet and an artist as much as a photographer.
"His photographs have a powerful, almost mesmerizing, effect on me. At least, now they do," the photographer and art historian Teju Cole wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 2017. "When I first encountered them, some 15 or so years ago, I didn't understand them."
Only years later, Mr. Cole said, did he uncover Mr. Mofokeng's secret.
"Mofokeng seems to test how many eccentricities a picture can tolerate before it breaks apart," Mr. Cole wrote. He suggested that it took a word from Mr. Mofokeng's native Sotho language, seriti, to define his photographs.
"It is a word whose senses include 'shadow' as well as 'aura,' 'dignity,' 'presence' and 'confidence,"' he explained. "Against the harsh interrogative light of an unjust political reality, Mofokeng offers seriti: knowledge of a more secret sort."

Texto completo: The governor will meet with the president on Thursday to discuss the ban on N.Y.-based applications to Trusted Traveler programs.
ALBANY, N.Y. -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would seek to give federal officials access to state driving records for applicants to Global Entry and other federal programs that allow travelers to quickly pass through airports and borders.
The announcement by Mr. Cuomo comes days after federal officials banned New York residents from applying to -- and re-enrolling in -- the programs, known as the Trusted Traveler Program.
Mr. Cuomo added that he would meet with President Trump on Thursday to discuss the traveler programs and access to the driving records.
Administration officials stressed that the potential change would only apply to applicants to Trusted Traveler programs, such as Global Entry, and not result in carte-blanche access to State Department of Motor Vehicle records.
Mr. Cuomo also suggested again that the Trump administration was extorting the state, using the prohibition on New York applicants as leverage to find information on undocumented immigrants.
"I think that's what they really want," he said in a radio interview on WAMC, an Albany public radio station. "They want access to the undocumented."
The conflict over the Trusted Traveler Program stems from a 2019 law, often known as the Green Light law, that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses and forbade federal officials from accessing state Department of Motor Vehicles records without a court order.
Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced the ban, citing its inability to access D.M.V. records as the reason; the move could eventually affect tens of thousands of travelers at the state's airports and Canadian border crossings.
The move caused a furious reaction from Mr. Cuomo and a lawsuit challenging the federal action from the state attorney general, Letitia James.
Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said on Wednesday that federal law enforcement authorities already had access to criminal records, and were using the Trusted Traveler issue as a feint to play to supporters of the president's hard-line policy on immigration.
"I believe they just want political noise because they really want to make their argument about immigration," the governor said.
Cuomo administration officials said the governor would attempt to make the change via new legislation in the state budget or a separate bill, meaning that most likely the change in state policy would not take effect until April at the earliest.
The White House confirmed the meeting between the president and Mr. Cuomo, but would not comment on its substance. Previously, federal officials have been forceful in condemning New York's Green Light law, presenting it as a threat to national security.
Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said that the department had not received any formal proposal from New York officials and stressed that they needed "full access to D.M.V. data to fulfill their law enforcement, customs, and trade and travel statutory responsibilities."
"It remains our goal to get back to a place where New York is once again sharing critical law enforcement data," Ms. Swift said.
Mr. Cuomo said that his vision for the new policy would involve evaluating federal requests for information on "a case-by-case basis," a potentially daunting task for a program with tens of thousands of applicants currently pending.
Mr. Cuomo insisted that he was not acquiescing to President Trump, saying that he would "never" give federal authorities unfettered access to Department of Motor Vehicles databases, something some other states do.
But if the Global Entry freeze continued, he said, it would have a "dramatic effect on this state." He added that he had privately floated this plan to federal officials last week.
The shift on Global Entry is just the latest possible alteration to a robust progressive agenda passed last year by Democrats in Albany, who had seized a legislative monopoly after nearly a decade of Republican rule in the State Senate.
But several of those policies, including a reform to the state's bail laws, have sparked strong blowback and raised the specter of political losses in this year's elections, particularly in moderate districts in New York City's suburbs.
In an earlier interview on WRCN, a Long Island station, Mr. Cuomo insisted that Mr. Trump was playing politics and catering to conservative supporters. State Republicans took issue with that characterization, and blamed Democrats for prioritizing progressive goals over public safety.
Rob Ortt, a Republican state senator from north of Buffalo, commented on Twitter, "Pure politics is passing laws that prioritize illegal aliens over law-abiding citizens and law enforcement officials to score political points with a far-left base."
Proponents of the Green Light law say that it has reduced the fear of being deported for a driving violation, and provided more economic opportunity for workers previously dependent on public transportation.
"Cuomo must assert that we will not compromise our values," said Javier H. Valdés, an executive director of Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights group, adding: "We draw a bright line between federal immigration enforcement and local law enforcement."
New York is one of more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. The 2019 law repealed a rule dating to 2001, when Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, issued an order requiring applicants to have a Social Security number, citing fears about national security in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
"This isn't some novel idea; it was bringing back something that never should have been taken away," said Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, a Democrat from the Bronx who sponsored the bill. He noted that his father, an undocumented immigrant, had operated a car in New York.
He added that while the Legislature was always willing to listen to critiques, it did not plan on any major changes to the law.
"We were unequivocal in our intent to protect that data," he said. "I'm certainly not willing to make changes just because of the whim of a president who wants to make a political point."

Texto completo: The team of assistant U.S. attorneys withdrew from the case after the Justice Department overruled their sentencing recommendation and pushed for a more lenient punishment for President Trump's former campaign adviser.
They have clerked for Supreme Court justices, served at the State Department and orbited Robert S. Mueller III.
On Tuesday, the four main federal prosecutors working on the obstruction and perjury case of Roger J. Stone Jr. shared another distinction: They quit the case. The abrupt withdrawals came after the Justice Department overruled their recommendation for a stiffer sentence for Mr. Stone, a longtime friend and informal adviser of President Trump. One of the prosecutors resigned outright.
[The Latest: President Trump praises attorney general for intervening in Stone case .]
The prosecutors had asked a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C., to sentence Mr. Stone to up to nine years in prison for obstructing a congressional investigation, witness tampering and making false statements during the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Late Monday, Mr. Trump took a swipe at the prosecutors on Twitter, saying they were beholden to Mr. Mueller and had recommended an unduly harsh sentence in Mr. Stone's case.
Here's what we know about the prosecutors who withdrew from the case.
Jonathan Kravis
Assistant U.S. attorney
Mr. Kravis, 42, said in a court filing on Tuesday afternoon that he had resigned from his post at the Justice Department and "therefore no longer represents the government in this matter."
He worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Also, he had been a trial attorney in the public integrity section of the Justice Department's criminal division, according to his law school biography at George Washington University, where he was listed as a professorial lecturer.
Mr. Kravis, who got his law degree at Yale University, previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. During President Barack Obama's first term, he served as an associate White House counsel.
Mr. Kravis clerked for Merrick B. Garland, the appeals court judge who was nominated by Mr. Obama for the Supreme Court in 2016, but never got a vote by the Republican-controlled Senate. He also clerked for Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court.
Aaron S.J. Zelinsky
Special assistant U.S. attorney
Mr. Zelinsky, 36, was the first of the four prosecutors to file a withdrawal notice in federal court, which said that he had "resigned effective immediately" from his role as a special assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
He will remain an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, said Marcia Murphy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Maryland, where Mr. Zelinsky worked under Rod J. Rosenstein when Mr. Rosenstein was the top federal prosecutor in the state. Mr. Rosenstein went on to become the deputy attorney general.
Mr. Zelinsky played a central role in the prosecution of George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Papadopoulos served 14 days in jail.
Mr. Zelinsky clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy before his retirement from the Supreme Court and for Justice John Paul Stevens after his retirement. He worked for the State Department during the Obama administration and received both his undergraduate and law degrees from Yale.
Adam C. Jed
Special assistant U.S. attorney
Mr. Jed, 38, was part of the cadre of lawyers who worked for Mr. Mueller on the 22-month Russia investigation. He entered the spotlight when he argued in pretrial litigation that certain records should be sealed from the public in order to protect the open investigation.
Mr. Jed had previously worked as an appellate lawyer for the Justice Department's civil division, where he gained recognition in 2013 for arguing that a ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional.
He also clerked for Justice Stevens, according to Harvard Law Today, an alumni publication of the university where Mr. Jed got his law degree in 2008.
Michael J. Marando
Assistant U.S. attorney
Mr. Marando, 42, became the fourth and final member of the prosecution team to withdraw from the Stone case on Tuesday.
He is an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, where he has prosecuted money laundering, fraud and sex offender cases.
In January, Mr. Marando helped to secure a 60-month prison sentence for a Virginia man who pleaded guilty to stealing over $ 1.3 million from companies and individuals by requiring deposits for bogus loans.
In March 2018, he secured an 18-month prison sentence for a dual citizen of Russia and Israel who had pleaded guilty to money laundering as part of an international fraud scheme.
Mr. Marando received his undergraduate and law degrees from Cornell University, according to his wedding announcement in The New York Times.

Texto completo: His synthesizers gave depth and color to the ensemble's sound. He soloed gracefully on grand piano. And he helped write many staples of the group's repertoire.
Lyle Mays, a keyboardist, composer and arranger best known for his long association with the guitarist Pat Metheny, died on Monday in Simi Valley, Calif. He was 66.
His death, at Adventist Hospital, was announced by his niece Aubrey Johnson, a jazz singer. She did not specify the cause, saying only that he died "after a long battle with a recurring illness."
Mr. Metheny has long been one of the marquee names in jazz. But the albums he made with his working band from 1978 to 2005 for ECM, Geffen and other labels were always credited to the Pat Metheny Group, never just to Mr. Metheny. And Mr. Mays was an integral part of that lean quartet from its early days, whether giving depth and color to its sound on synthesizers or soloing gracefully on grand piano.
The group gained fame by merging jazz ideas with a rock sensibility; its later incarnation as a larger ensemble incorporated musical ideas from other parts of the world, notably Brazil.
He also wrote, in collaboration with Mr. Metheny, many staples of the group's repertoire, among them "San Lorenzo," "American Garage" and "James."
The personnel of the Pat Metheny Group changed several times over the years. Besides its leader, Mr. Mays was the band's only constant.
"Lyle was one of the greatest musicians I have ever known," Mr. Metheny said in a statement on his website, adding, "From the first notes we played together, we had an immediate bond."
His contributions to the Pat Metheny Group earned Mr. Mays 11 Grammy Awards. For his work both with Mr. Metheny and on his own, he had a total of 23 Grammy nominations.
Lyle David Mays was born on Nov. 27, 1953, in Wausaukee, a village in eastern Wisconsin. His parents encouraged his interest in music and were musically inclined themselves. His father, Cecil, a truck driver, taught himself to play guitar; his mother, Doris (Olson) Mays, who worked in a bank, played piano and organ in a local church.
Mr. Mays himself began playing organ in church at 9 and developed an interest in jazz not long afterward. After attending the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, he transferred to North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas), where he played piano in the school's celebrated One O'Clock Lab Band while composing and arranging its music. He wrote all the compositions and arrangements on the band's Grammy-nominated album "Lab 75." He left in 1975 to tour with Woody Herman's big band.
Mr. Mays met Mr. Metheny in 1974 at the Wichita Jazz Festival in Kansas. They first recorded together in 1977 on Mr. Metheny's album "Watercolors" and formed the Pat Metheny group shortly afterward. The group's first album, released the next year, was titled simply "Pat Metheny Group."
Their other ventures included writing the score for the John Schlesinger spy thriller "The Falcon & the Snowman" (1985), starring Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton. That score included a collaboration with David Bowie, "This Is Not America," which was a Top 40 hit.
Mr. Mays and Mr. Metheny released one album as co-leaders, the atmospheric and whimsically named "As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls" (1981). Reviewing it for The New York Times, Stephen Holden called it "a winning combination of electronic innovation and neo-Romantic lyricism," and noted that Mr. Mays "dominates the record." In a recent Facebook post, the bassist Christian McBride, another longtime Metheny associate, called it "one of the most moving documents of pure beauty ever made."
Mr. Mays is survived by two sisters, Joan Johnson and Jane Tyler.
Mr. Mays also performed or recorded with Joni Mitchell (on her "Shadows and Light" tour and album), Bobby McFerrin, Rickie Lee Jones and others. He recorded a few albums as a leader, among them "Fictionary" (1992), a trio recital with Marc Johnson on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums, and "Solo: Improvisations for Expanded Piano" (2000).
His last recording with the Pat Metheny Group was "The Way Up," released in 2005. He stopped making music professionally in 2011, although, he said in a 2016 podcast interview for the magazine Jazziz, "I kind of feel like the music industry has left me." In recent years he worked as a software consultant.
Among his other nonmusical pursuits, Mr. Mays was a self-taught architect. His designs included a house for his sister Joan.

Texto completo: HONG KONG - Jade Doringo arrived at Manila's international airport more than five hours before her scheduled departure to Hong Kong, where she worked as a software engineer. But instead of getting on her flight, she was asked to surrender her boarding pass.
That morning, Feb. 2, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines had announced a temporary travel ban that barred flights arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. At the airport, officials told Doringo that the ban also applied to Filipino travelers going in the opposite direction.
As the new coronavirus has spread around the world, several countries have issued restrictions on travelers arriving from mainland China. The Philippines, which has reported one death from the virus, is unusual in imposing rules that prevent its citizens from traveling also to Hong Kong and Macao, semi-autonomous Chinese territories.
Doringo is among hundreds of Filipinos whose lives have been upended as they find themselves unable to return to their jobs in the two cities. "Imagine the confusion we felt at that time, not knowing everything," she said in a phone interview last week.
Doringo had been sitting at the gate, watching as the crew waited for approval to board the flight and listening as airline employees repeated an announcement about the new travel ban. At 4 p.m., all Filipino passport holders were asked to go to immigration. Around her, domestic workers called their employers in Hong Kong, their voices rising in panic.
Then her suitcase got lost. But there was little else she could do besides huddle together with the other grounded passengers. Most of them had not eaten since that morning.
At 11 p.m., Doringo left the terminal empty-handed.
She had moved to Hong Kong two years ago with dreams of creating a better life for her family. The job in Hong Kong paid a better salary than what she would have earned back home, and soon after starting she was able to buy a plot of land in her rural province. She began setting aside money every month to build a house for her family.
She missed them constantly, particularly during the chaos of the past seven months when Hong Kong was rocked by anti-government demonstrations. Her homesickness only intensified in late January as the coronavirus spread.
"Protests, disease, the loneliness of living alone - all of this triggers the longing of going back home," she wrote in an Instagram post Jan. 25 before she returned to the Philippines for a nine-day vacation. "To your real home."
That trip started out in Manila, where she took her siblings and their families to eat lechón, a spit-roasted suckling pig, at a mall.
Later, she returned to her hometown in the countryside and rode on a motorized tricycle with her father to a creek near where she planned to build a house for them. Her mother cooked her a steaming beef broth. She cried, feeling relieved to be under their roof.
"I get to eat in Hong Kong, but it's different when you get to share the meals with your family," she said.
When it came time for her to return to Hong Kong, her brother bought a box of masks for her, and her parents nagged her to be careful. She ended up spending all day at the airport after her flight was canceled, then stayed at her brother's home in Manila. Her lost luggage showed up two days later.
Her supervisor gave her permission to work remotely, but she was worried about being absent for too long.
"As overseas Filipino workers, none of us can afford to lose our jobs," she said.
Doringo still is not sure when she will be able to return to Hong Kong. But she has stocked up on masks, rubbing alcohol and snacks so that when she does, she will not have to venture outdoors.
"I am afraid to get sick. We all are, but it's our decision to take the risk," she said.

But first, there's still time to make big plans for the upcoming three-day weekend — especially if you are looking for a quick getaway to romance your Valentine without all the pink and red decor. The Desert Sun has you covered with a list of the best adventure ideas that will have you day-dreaming through the next two workdays. (And I won't tell anyone if you use the inspiration to take yourself out — let's hear it for self-love, am I right?)
Now, today's news.
The housing crisis is making people sick
A room infested with mice, rats and cockroaches. Showers under a cold drip of water amid moldy walls impenetrable by bleach. Fierce asthma attacks, induced by rodent feces. These are hallmarks of California's housing crisis. Health officials are now warning that the substandard and often overcrowded conditions are becoming a crisis of their own.
The Californian tells the story of a single mother, Tanya Harris, who is working two jobs while she tries to keep a roof over her children's heads. The family of four has had to navigate new health risks that come with housing instability, issues doctors are now seeing across the state.
Along with a rise in asthma attacks, the housing crisis has produced a surge in health problems, including communicable diseases, viruses and head lice. Diseases like tuberculosis and the flu spread more easily in cramped housing and can be a death sentence for the uninsured and low-income people who live there.
Deceit, disrepair and death in a SoCal rental empire
Landlord Mike Nijjar lives in a mansion in one of the most expensive districts of Los Angeles. Tucked in a community behind gates, his six-bedroom, 12,000-square-foot home features a waterfall, a tennis court, vineyard and reflecting pool. But Nijjar earned his millions running an empire of low-income rentals across California — many of which are "dirty, dilapidated, and even deadly," according to a new striking story from LAist.
Diving into code-enforcement documents, lawsuits and public data, and interviewing housing advocates, tenants and former employees of Nijjar's company, PAMA Management, reporter Aaron Mendelson took a deep look into Nijjar's businesses and the devastating conditions affecting tens of thousands of the poorest residents.
What else we are reading today

Ellison to host Trump fundraiser in SoCal
President Donald Trump's approval rating in California is at 31%, according to a January poll by the Public Policy Institute of California. In 2018, the GOP lost seven congressional seats in the Golden State. But California still has almost 5 million registered Republicans and a bounty of conservative campaign financiers who, in the past, haven't hesitated to open their wallets for the GOP's presidential candidates.
Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison will host Trump at a campaign fundraising event at his Coachella Valley estate on Feb. 19, less than two weeks before California's Super Tuesday primary election.
Plans call for a golf outing at Ellison's lux Porcupine Creek home in Rancho Mirage. For $100,000, supporters get golf outing and photo with the president. For $250,000, contributors get a photo, golf outing and participate in a round table.
Riverside County Republican Party Chair Jonathan Ingram said having the president visit the region has "immense" meaning for local Republicans. "It's showing that he understands that California actually matters in respect to being a Republican and a conservative," Ingram said.
Is car commuting exposing you to cancer-causing chemicals?
Californians spend more time commuting in their cars than do residents in other states, an issue that's only gotten worse as high rents have pushed people out to cheaper cities farther from their jobs. Twenty percent of Golden Staters spend two hours in the car getting to work or school each day.
According to a new study out of the University of California, Riverside, these commuters may be exposing themselves to chemicals suspected of causing cancer.
Researchers found that driving is linked to exposure to chemicals used as flame retardants, which are likely inhaled. More time in the car means more time spent with these chemicals.
“We think the possible source of exposure is dust in the vehicle, but we don’t know that for sure," said David Volz, an associate professor of environmental toxicology at the university. "So in the interim, it’s probably a good idea to wipe the dust off your dashboard or vacuum. ”
A new use for poop?
Dairy is one of California's biggest industries, adding roughly $20 billion to the state economy despite a recent downturn. But cows produce more than cash — they are also big methane producers and, well, big mess makers. There's a lot of poop.
The Visalia Times-Delta reports, however, there might be a new eco-friendly way to use all that manure — and it could fuel dairy production further. Western Milling, a company that sells agricultural products, has started running 30 of its 100 trucks on "Cow Natural Gas," produced from poop.
The move has been a big topic of discussion at the World Ag Expo, currently being held in Tulare. "We think it's a great thing for the environment, a great thing for California and a win-win all the way around," CEO Kevin Kruse said.
I'll leave you with proof that data can be beautiful. Today, NASA's Landsat program — which has collected satellite imagery of the Earth since 1972 — tweeted a photo of California farmland that can be used to predict when crops are ready to harvest.
Read the rest of their thread about the data (and how it helps grow our food) here.

No love for Sanders from media

Texto completo: As the presidential campaign got underway last year, we watched the media lavish its affections on Beto O'Rourke for a while, and then Kamala Harris, briefly, and Elizabeth Warren for quite a while.
But, as it will, love waned.
Joe Biden became the new sure thing " experienced, solid and empathetic. Most of all, he possessed that ineffable quality: electability . But last week, after the Iowa caucuses, the attention shifted squarely to Pete Buttigieg, portrayed as a centrist savior, though it's still debatable whether he actually won.
Then Tuesday night, the news media's roving crush moved to Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar. Her third-place finish in the New Hampshire Democratic primary became the story of the night.
Never, though, has mainstream media turned its loving eyes to the front-runner, Bernie Sanders.-Quite the opposite.
'He is a grumpy, angry person on the stump, and he is not going to be elected,' raved Republican strategist Sara Fagen on ABC News one recent Sunday morning.
At the New York Times, columnist Thomas Friedman scoffed at the Sanders surge to write in praise of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is on the verge of being the next flavor du jour, if his record on criminal justice doesn't catch up with him.
On a sentence-by-sentence basis, straight news coverage may not have reflected an anti-Sanders bias, but the framing of that coverage " choices made on headlines and emphasis " sometimes did. (Sanders, in a home page headline in the Times, 'tightens grip' on the party's liberal wing, which sounds more threatening than victorious.)
Meanwhile, Klobuchar was queen for a day, garnering headlines such as this one from Yahoo News: 'Riding wave of momentum, Klobuchar lands in 3rd place in New Hampshire primary.' You heard words such as 'Klobucharge' and 'Klomentum' bandied about.
On MSNBC Tuesday night, host Chris Matthews fawned: 'Bernie indicts. She finds a way to care.'
Amy Goodman, host of the progressive news program 'Democracy Now' and a Sanders defender, recalled hearing one cable pundit say Sanders had 'flatlined at Number One.' On a recent episode she bemoaned that most of the media coverage is 'so anti-Bernie it's just remarkable.'
The subtext behind much of the disdain is a partly a deep-seated sentiment that Sanders, if nominated, has little chance of winning the general election. But it's also partly " and more insidiously " that many journalists don't identify easily with Sanders in the same way they do with, say, Warren or O'Rourke or Buttigieg.
In Iowa early this month, I asked one local reporter who had met all the major candidates who would be the strongest Democratic candidate. 'I don't have a hope, I have a fear,' came the answer. It wasn't hard to figure out what that meant or how that sort of visceral dislike might make its way, subtly, into coverage.
While many reporters and pundits have seemed, until very recently, to casually discount Sanders, a few opinion writers are taking him very seriously " seriously enough to shoot off flares about what a bad choice they think he would make.
'Running Sanders Against Trump Would Be an Act of Insanity,' thundered the headline on a New York magazine piece by Jonathan Chait in late January.
He wrote: 'No party nomination, with the possible exception of Barry Goldwater in 1964, has put forth a presidential nominee with the level of downside risk exposure as a Sanders-led ticket would bring. To nominate Sanders would be insane.'
'Bernie Can't Win,' opined David Frum in the Atlantic, characterizing Sanders in unflattering terms as 'a Marxist of the old school of dialectical materialism, from the land that time forgot.' At The Washington Post, columnist Jennifer Rubin has been equally tough; one recent headline: 'Bernie Sanders's Trump-like campaign is a disaster for Democrats.'
In turn, Sanders keeps dissing what he calls the corporate media, as he has for years.
In the official editorial-board interview with the New York Times recently, Sanders blustered that he doesn't cozy up to powerful media figures as other candidates are wont to do.
'I'm not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I'm not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you'll love me and you'll write nice things about me,' he said.
A few media figures are giving him his due, if a little grudgingly. CNN's Jake Tapper was one: 'Take a step back. He is 78 years old, he is a Democratic socialist, he is a Jewish American, originally from Brooklyn " it is a stunning achievement by Senator Sanders and for his movement.'
Sanders, though, doesn't seem to mind. His ardent followers bond with him and with one another by despising the mainstream media, often enough with good reason.
It may well be that he doesn't need or want the help of cable pundits, columnists and other opinion-makers.
From Beto to Biden, their crushes, so far, have turned into heartbreaks.
Maybe media love " fickle and fleeting " is a valentine Bernie Sanders would rather do without.

'He's my best pal': De Pere veteran, her service dog star in Netflix documentary

Texto completo: DE PERE - Sylvia Bowersox didn't know how much one dog could change a life until Timothy came into hers.
A U.S. Army veteran who did three tours in Iraq as a broadcast journalist and press officer, she struggled in the years after she returned home in 2007 — 10 days after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was hanged.
Bowersox, suffering from traumatic brain injury, severe post-traumatic stress disorder and "a whole alphabet of other things," was misdiagnosed by Veterans Affairs with bipolar disorder and was put on lithium and a host of other drugs.
"They had me on just bizarre, bizarre medications. I was a zombie. I was an absolute zombie. I wasn't functioning," she said. "I was just beside myself, because I am not bipolar. They kept upping my doses, so I did not have a quality of life at all. I was desperate."
She was living in Columbus, Ohio, when the idea of a service dog to help with the PTSD first came up. She was referred to a local program in which jail inmates trained dogs, but when the door slammed behind her the first time she visited, she had a massive panic attack. She never went back. She wasn't well enough.
Then her husband Jon found Little Angels Service Dogs, which trains canines on a 10-acre ranch outside San Diego. That's where she would meet Timothy, a British Labrador puppy she first laid eyes on via Skype.
"The first thing he did is he walked up and he started cleaning my face," Bowersox said.
He was a year old when she took him home. They've been inseparable in the nearly nine years since.
"Timothy is my baby. He's my fur baby. He's my child," said Bowersox, a writer and painter who moved to De Pere in 2016. "He tells me when I've had enough and I have to go walk around the building. He paws at me when I'm freaking out. He sleeps with me. When I disassociate, he just sits at my feet and doesn't go anywhere and doesn't let me go anywhere until I come out of it. He is amazing. He's my guy."
Sharing her story on the big screen The two are co-stars in "To Be of Service," a documentary by Josh Aronson about war veterans with PTSD and the service dogs that have helped them regain their lives. The film opened in select U.S. cities in November and is streaming on Netflix.
The crew filmed Bowersox and Timothy in De Pere, including at Luna Cafe and Roastery, and also at Little Angels for one of Timothy's training refresher courses and during Bowersox's reading of her "This War Can't Be All Bad" in Venice, California.
"To Be of Service" was one of 159 documentary features submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Science for 2020 Oscar consideration. It received strong reviews from The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and others, but it did not make the cut as one of five nominees in its Oscar category.
The film also received national attention for "Unbroken," the song Bon Jovi wrote for the project. The band is donating all proceeds from downloads of the single to the Patriotic Service Dog Foundation, a nonprofit that provides service dogs to veterans in need.
There wasn't a red carpet premiere that allowed Bowersox the chance to rub elbows with Jon Bon Jovi — she'd tell him how much his lyrics captured the veterans experience, particularly "I'd do it all again" — but she was able to catch a screening in Chicago. She and Timothy appeared on NBC's "Today with Hoda & Jenna" on Veterans Day to talk about the importance of service dogs for veterans.
She was also in attendance when "To Be of Service" was screened for Congress. She spent two days in Washington, D.C. encouraging members to support the PAWS Act. The Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act was introduced in June to make service dogs more accessible to veterans looking for an alternative PTSD treatment. If passed, it would require the VA to provide a $25,000 voucher for a service dog to veterans diagnosed with PTSD.
The VA does not currently cover the expense of a service dog. One veteran in the film did a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money. Bowersox knows when Timothy retires in another year, she'll need to somehow come up with $30,000 for her next service dog.
"My thought is why do we as veterans have to go begging for a service dog? Why are we doing this? That's why I got behind the PAWS Act," she said.
Eating cat food: bad. Getting belly rubs: good. It's impossible for Bowersox to put a price on how valuable Timothy has been to her.
"He's my partner in crime," she says. "He's phenomenal. He settles me. He's my best pal."
It took the two about a year to get to know each other. He had to figure out what his job was, what her needs were and how that all fit into what he knows how to do. She had to learn how to deal with people who want to pet him when they're out in public, a no-no as it's a distraction from his job.
She also had to learn how to properly feed him. She overdid it at first and "he became a little sausage." He's closer to his ideal weight now, but it hasn't stopped him from trying to convince her he's starving.
They reached a mutual agreement that he couldn't eat the cat's food. Not good for the cat — or his digestive system. Belly rubs, however, are always good.
With the exception of a trip overseas that kept them apart for a couple weeks, Bowersox is never without him. Where she goes, he goes, including Chicago, where she's studying art. Calm and relaxed, Timothy can sense when Bowersox is feeling anxious. In the year when she was having frequent nightmares, he would wake her up.
"When I'm in a place and he decides I need to take a break, well, he's 80 pounds, so when he says, 'Nope, we're leaving,' we're going," she said.
"What happens to me, because of my brain injury and because of my PTSD, if I allow myself to get overstimulated, overly stressed, I shut down. I completely shut down. I either do one of two things. I either get really, really scared or the lights are on but nobody's home. ... We work together. He is my barometer."

Texto completo: There are two nights a year when I refuse to dine out: New Year's Eve is the second, Valentine's Day is the first.
The restaurants are packed. The waitstaff and cooks are away from their special someones, staring down order after order of surf-and-turf for a dining room packed with hopeful lovers.
It's a recipe for mediocrity.
I'd rather do anything else.
Romance, after all, takes many forms. And it shouldn't be contained only to Valentine's Day. If you waited too long to book your surf-and-turf reservation — or if you're looking for a different flavor of romance, I've got five places that could be just right.
Aji Limon While this locally owned chain of Peruvian restaurants has plenty of figurative heart, it also has actual heart — as in once-beating cow hearts — on the menu. Did I lose you? Was the "once-beating" thing too much? To the uninitiated this may sound kooky. But heart is delicious. I don't mean fancy-pants, ooh-I'm-the-food-critic delicious. I mean honestly, universally good. Especially at Aji Limon, which seasons, skewers and grills its hearts into traditional anticuchos de corazon. Think about it: All the funky stuff that can make liver, kidneys and other organ meats taste a bit icky (the urine, the bile, the etc.) — none of that comes in to play with heart. Think of this not as an organ but as a muscle, an incredibly lean and flavorful muscle that's surrounded by blood (like all other muscles). I've heard the taste of heart compared to filet mignon, and I don't disagree. Anyone can eat filet for V Day, but there's something darkly romantic about taking your adventurous Valentine out for heart.
(five locations from north Cape Coral to Naples; ajilimonperuviancuisine.com)
Island Seafood This Matlacha seafood market and lunch spot puts its money where my heart is — in Gulf seafood. Island Seafood contracts with a fleet of local fishermen to haul the very best catches our waters can yield right to its waterfront doors. Wild-caught snapper and grouper can be bought whole and glassy-eyed in the market, or filleted and cooked to simple perfection in the sandwiches and chowders available from Island Seafood's pastel-painted onsite restaurant. Either way, I am in love.

Fine Folk Pizza Plenty of places offer heart-shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day: Papa John's, Jet's, California Pizza Kitchen (just to name a few). But if you want a heart-shaped pizza with serious soul, Fine Folk is it. This Gateway pizza shop and craft-beer joint won back-to-back national pizza making championships in 2018 and 2019. How? Solid technique and a genius knack for creative flavors. Fine Folk is offering its lovable, heart-shaped pies all week. Just ask for a heart pizza when placing phone orders or write "heart pizza" under special instructions when ordering online.
(11300 Lindbergh Blvd. No. 114, Gateway; 239-313-5155; finefolkpizza.com)
Kreips & Juices If your Valentine has a serious sweet tooth, or a penchant for things that are comically enormous, get them to Kreips & Juices. This Cape Coral-born fast-casual restaurant crafts towering milkshakes layered with Love Boat Ice Cream, wedges of pound cake, strawberries, Nutella, Oreos, slices of pie, swirls of whipped cream (the list goes on). They're massive enough to share with a family — or to sip with that special someone you're especially sweet on.
(locations in Cape Coral and Fort Myers; kreipsandjuices.com)
Doug's Seafood This family-run seafood market and restaurant got its start as a roadside seafood shack in Port Clyde, Maine, where founder and lobsterman Doug Anderson grew up with saltwater coursing through his veins. Legend has it the New York Times named Doug's lobster rolls among the best in New England circa 1985. Doug's came to Bonita Springs as a one-man operation in 2008. In 2012 it debuted a brick-and-mortar market that also served chowders and lobster rolls. By 2017 it became a full-service restaurant offering everything from burgers to wraps to haddock tacos. Like the Times, it's Doug's lobster rolls — simple, buttery, perfect — I crave. The market will also steam any of its market lobsters for takeout, free of charge. A blushing red lobster, drawn butter and someone you love; what more could a Valentine's celebration need?

This proposal for Sunapee schools is better than the last

Texto completo: This proposal for Sunapee schools is better than the last
I’m worried by comments to the effect that the Sunapee School Board is bringing the same proposal to the town this year as it did last year, when the proposal was soundly defeated by the voters. I don’t believe it is.
My observation, having looked at and considered both last year’s and the current proposal, is that the only thing that is the same is the total cost: basically $26 million. In my opinion, this year’s proposal is much better thought out than last year’s, and deals with issues across the entire system instead of looking just at the elementary school. It is based on a rather thorough consideration of what we have in the way of buildings, what the education requirements for 2020 and beyond are, and the premise, supported eloquently by many at the meeting, that we want to continue to have a prekindergarten-12 school system in Sunapee.
Well-regarded experts — architects, contractors and cost estimators — worked hard with the School Committee and the Capital Improvement Committee to develop the program being proposed. I think what they have come up with gives us much better bang for the buck than what we would have gotten with last year’s proposal. I support this year’s proposal.
We have serious problems with the elementary school buildings. The problems have to be dealt with, and there are no cheap solutions. I hope all voters will take the time to understand the full scope of what is being proposed as they think about their votes. The cost is one thing to consider, for sure, but it is not the only thing.

Key information missing in Sunapee
There is an old proverb: “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.” That adage was on full display at the Feb. 3 Sunapee School District deliberative session in two distinct ways.
First, among the warrant articles proposed, the elephant in the room was Article 3, which asks Sunapee taxpayers to approve $25.6 million for new school construction and repairs to allow all 376 Sunapee resident students to be housed in a single school building, including $4 million for associated athletic fields. Financing would be from a 15-year bond issue. The estimated tax impact to town property owners, was 36 cents per $1,000 of assessed value.
Therein lies the problem. The tax effect includes only part of the first year’s interest payment, ignoring the remaining 14 years of interest payments and repayment of $25.6 million of bond principal, which increases the tax effect to over $2 per $1,000 of assessed value per year, six times the initial estimate. When queried, school representatives argued that the 36 cents per $1,000 estimate was all that was required under New Hampshire law.
Second, Article 8 asks voters to create a committee of “all stakeholders” to investigate alternatives to new school construction, such as moving grades K-5 to the current middle/high school building and offering students in grades 9-12 school choice “to attend the high school that best meets each student’s needs and interests.” School choice options were summarily dismissed when alternatives were presented to voters last year. After considerable discussion, this article was adopted with restrictive amendments, which state that it only be invoked if Article 3 is defeated, and is only “advisory,” meaning it can simply be ignored for any reason.
Thus, the one-eyed king still reigns, because failing to provide relevant information, and failing to seek it, renders us blind. It is the polar opposite to transparency, which is especially important when you’re asking voters to reach into their wallets for substantial money over a protracted period of time.

A dark day for our democracy
A casual pastime of mine is reading mottos on newspaper mastheads. I think everyone has heard of The New York Times’ motto, “All the News That’s Fit to Print.” Other examples range from the meteorological, “Covers Dixie Like the Dew,” on The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, to the self congratulatory, “Worlds Greatest Newspaper” on The Chicago Tribune.
For years, The Washington Post used “The Paper That Digs Deeper.” On Jan. 21, 2016, one day after another “day which will live in infamy,” the paper’s motto was changed to “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” How prescient.
During the impeachment trial, our democracy, as the framers of the Constitution imagined it, died in the darkness of a Republican majority Senate. The majority refused to hear testimony from material witnesses or to look at any documents relevant to the trial of President Donald Trump. In more than 200 years, no impeachment trial, whether of a president or a judge, had been conducted in this manner.
Following this dereliction of their duty to be impartial jurors, the senators voted to bring about the foreordained outcome of the trial. The implications of their verdict are to condone the influence of foreign actors in our elections and render moot the coequal status of the executive and legislative branches.
American elections, the heart and soul of our democracy, should be decided only by Americans. Congressional oversight of the executive is foundational to the conduct of government. Both concepts have been annihilated.
We don’t need historical perspective to recognize how dark a day this is for our democracy.

Sen. Romney voted his conscience
I have strong Utah Mormon roots dating back to pioneer covered wagon days. Although I personally moved away from Mormonism many decades ago, I retain a deep respect for that faith. And it makes me proud indeed to see Mormon Sen. Mitt Romney cross party lines to vote his conscience in the president’s recent impeachment trial.

History appears to be repeating
Allow me to quote a short passage from a book I am reading, Madam Fourcade’s Secret War, about the politics in France between the two world wars: “With France in the state of permanent political crisis, cabinet ministers focused their efforts on staying in office, which meant spending little time on substantive issues. The already deep cynicism of the French people toward government officials was further exacerbated by a string of financial scandals in the 1930s involving bribes paid to ministers and parliamentary deputies by businessmen and bankers seeking favorable government treatment.”
As it is said, the more things change the more they stay the same. Does history repeat itself?

One man’s mulleins are another’s ...
I write in regard to Jennifer Hauck’s fine front-page photograph “Hot Air” (Jan. 29), showing Dave Dempsey using a leaf blower to fan his brush fire. Dempsey is shown behind upright “bars” of withered mulleins, hinting at imprisonment.
The Valley News is indeed diligent in displaying and reporting on anything from hard-core iniquity to heedless tramping on people’s emotional bunions. Hauck’s photograph, however, reveals a total lack of feeling for those who are upset by mulleins, whose lives are demeaned and soured by knowing that they must share the planet with mulleins.
These people are determined in their self-defense, working hard to eliminate the dreaded weed, even at personal risk; I’ve seen them digging away in perilous places. The group is not well-known, perhaps owing to the absence of a suitable acronym, all available letters being in use in the acronyms of other groups fighting other evils.
My friends at AAARGH (Against Almost Anything that Really Grows Here) tell me that the mullein is somehow not on the list of invasive plants, but should be, and I’m inclined to agree as I watch the occasional specimen denying living space to sumac, sweet fern, and other shy, retiring noninvasives on the bank outside my window.
I have also learned that there’s a movement to rename the mullein “congress weed,” owing to the fact that it is a biennial, and thus, like the House of Representatives, has a two-year term. But here I am forced to come to the defense of the poor mullein. At least it does something: In its second year, it offers up a column of encouraging yellow flowers, an activity it indulges in without the presence of a photographer.
We all need to be more careful about giving offense, and the Valley News should realize that what is a flower to someone can be hurtful to someone else!

Texto completo: Democrats: The only thing you have to fear is Trump himself.
You should be quaking. Our unhinged monarch had a very good week and your party had a very bad week ‒ and that‘s no BS.
A lot of you told me, with expletives, that while you were watching President Donald Trump’s carnival-barking this past week, you were thinking, “We’re going to freaking lose.”
Trump hollowed out the hallowed, showing in the State of the Union how he has figured out how to use the levers of the presidency to amplify his flair for the dramatic.
What could be more flamboyantly offensive than the anti-bullying advocate, Melania, hanging a Medal of Freedom on one of the biggest bullies and hate preachers of all time, Rush Limbaugh? Talk about the bully pulpit.
The president even managed to send his classy nemesis, Nancy Pelosi, over the edge, as she became so agitated that she was driven to Trumpian tactics to rebut his lies.
The acquittal put an exclamation point on two facts: Trump has subsumed the Republican Party. And he has forged one of the most cynical and darkly productive alliances of all time with the poker-faced Mitch McConnell, sending his personal approval rating to an all-time high.
Iowa was a master class in Democratic dysfunction. By the time I got to New Hampshire, the Democratic hysteria was rising — and a faltering Joe Biden disappeared in a crisis cloud — while internecine class war was intensifying. Pete Buttigieg was predeclaring victory, spurring Bernie Sanders supporters to dub him “Mayor Cheat” on Twitter. Sanders spoke Friday morning, tying Buttigieg to Wall Street and urging Democrats to decide if they were on the side of the working class or greed, “where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.”
James Carville went on viral rants about being “scared to death” for his party as it lurched toward the far left. “Let’s get relevant here, people, for sure,” he said on MSNBC, adding, “Do we want to be an ideological cult?”
Democrats from Congress to Los Angeles began whispering hopefully about Michael Bloomberg.
“There seems to be a groundswell of support, mostly based on the fact that he’ll spend whatever it takes and fight just as dirty as Trump — with more resources,” said David Israel, a writer in Hollywood.
Just as when he made his very imperfect call to the Ukrainian president the day after Robert Mueller testified, Trump began acting out right after his acquittal.
Gordon Sondland, the bumbling ambassador to the European Union who tried to help Trump seal his dirty deal but gave oomph to the quid-pro-quo argument, was given the boot.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security official who testified against Trump, and his twin brother were perp-walked out of the White House complex Friday. (They needed to make sure they had their man.)
“The most powerful man in the world — buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit — has decided to exact revenge,” said David Pressman, Vindman’s lawyer.
Democrats should be scared to death watching the president reenacting the chilling final payback scenes of “The Godfather,” when Michael Corleone took out all his enemies.
It’s not business. It’s strictly personal.

Politico ignores attack on Florida Republicans but laments GOP ‘revenge’

Texto completo: An anti-Trump activist intentionally drove his van into a Republican voter-registration tent in Florida this weekend, nearly killing a half-dozen GOP volunteers. Yet amazingly, Politico did not touch the story of this near-fatal, politically motivated attack on Republicans until the state GOP promised to retaliate — at the polls.

“Republicans vow ‘revenge’ at ballot box after volunteers nearly hit by van,” reads the headline to a report published on Feb 10.

The report’s opening paragraphs read:
"Florida and Duval County Republican leaders on Monday vowed 'revenge' at the ballot box after a man drove his van into a tent of GOP volunteers who were registering voters over the weekend. "Party officials said Gregory Timm targeted the group because of their support for President Donald Trump. During a press conference in Jacksonville, they described how Timm nearly hit people, made an obscene gesture, and started recording the incident on his phone. They used the event to make a plea for donations to the party."
“The incident drew a tweet from Trump and became a Republican rallying cry,” the report adds.

It was only a matter of time. National media cannot help themselves.

If you can believe it, there are no prior mentions of the Feb. 8 incident on Politico’s website. Its Feb. 10 report really is the first time it went near the story. In other words, Politico did not cover the van episode until it could be made into something about the GOP reaction to a politically motivated attack on GOP aides.
You knew this would happen. It is the well-worn “Republicans pounce" gimmick. It never fails.
At the hearts of these cliched "right-wing reaction" pieces is the apparent belief that the real story is not the radical behavior of Democrats and Democratically aligned fanatics but rather the Right’s reaction to said radical behavior. Because the real story is never the thing that may reflect poorly on Democratic officials or their allies. The real story is always that the Right may be exploiting the moment. Look: The problem is not that news media are writing right-wing reaction stories. It is that the reactions stories often represent the news media's first-ever mentions of major news events. (See here and here.) In the case of the attack this weekend in Florida, Politico did not touch the story until it got its “revenge” headline from Republican officials.

I am not a big fan of the “if the motivations were flipped” game, but come on. If some MAGA-hatted psychotic attempted to run down Democratic volunteers with his truck, I guarantee you the attack, and the driver’s likely motivations, would be the lead story in every newsroom in the United States. It would be the lead story for at least three days. At least. But Timm attempted to run down Republican aides, so the story, apparently, is not all that interesting to some of the largest and most influential news organizations in the country. Speaking of which, and to Politico’s credit, it can at least say it eventually covered the story with its own original reporting. The New York Times cannot say even that much.

As for Timm, he has been charged on two counts of aggravated assault. He has also been charged with “criminal mischief” and driving with a suspended license.
"The suspect advised that he does not like President Trump," reads Timm’s arrest report, and that "someone had to take a stand."
"The suspect then showed another video to us of him driving toward the tent with the victims standing in front," it adds. "The suspect was upset that the video ended before 'the good part' as he described it."
Timm is still in jail on $500,000 bail. No word on whether the high bail amount is also Republican revenge.

Texto completo: A new analysis from Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre says the Afghanistan-based Taliban has surpassed the Islamic State to become the world’s deadliest nonstate armed group.
The group reported that while terrorist attacks decreased 10% to 14,009 in 2019, the lowest level since 2011, Taliban attacks increased by almost 90%, resulting in a 60% increase in deaths.
The data shows that the Taliban accounted for more deaths than the next nine deadliest groups combined.
The ignominious distinction comes as President Trump reportedly has given conditional approval to a peace deal with the Taliban that could mark the beginning of the end of America’s longest war, according to Afghan and U.S. officials.
“But the deal will only be signed if the Taliban prove their commitment to a durable reduction of violence over a test period of about seven days later this month,” reports the New York Times.
“If the Taliban do end hostilities and a deal is signed, the United States would then begin a gradual withdrawal of American troops, and direct negotiations would start between the Taliban and Afghan leaders over the future of their country,” the newspaper reports.
Meanwhile, Islamic State attacks and resultant fatalities both fell by around 20% in comparison to 2018.
“The decreases reflected a substantial downturn in activity in Iraq and Syria, although the group’s operations in West Africa and the Sahel underline the ongoing significant threat posed by the group,” said Matthew Henman, head of Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre.

Texto completo: Investigators in the Netherlands are searching for the culprit behind a spate of mail bombs attempting to extort businesses.
Two parcels exploded in the country Wednesday. The first was in Amsterdam, where a mailroom worker heard a hissing noise coming from a package and tossed it aside before it detonated. An hour later, another package exploded at a local business in Kerkrade. No one was injured in either attack, according to the New York Times.
The blasts are believed to be linked to a number of parcel bombs that have been sent to businesses across the country, accompanied by letters demanding the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, although they are the first that have exploded. Authorities said the size of the blasts was comparable to small fireworks.
“It’s fair to say that all of these are connected because the same demand was made,” said Lex van Liebergen, an Amsterdam police spokeswoman. “But we still don’t know who sent it. We are still investigating.”
Investigators have not elaborated on what the attached letters said or how much of the virtual currency the bomber or bombers demanded.

Obama White House was full of slighted women

Texto completo: The women of President Barack Obama's White House saw themselves as a team among themselves. There was a regular dinner of female Obama senior officials where they discussed issues specific to being women working at senior levels in the administration.
Alyssa Mastromonaco, deputy chief of staff, said the purpose of the dinners was “to support one another through the gender imbalance in the West Wing.” The senior staff women even had a gender-specific name for themselves: “the Vagiants.”
This gynocentric self-designation was off-putting to some of the pro-Obama but less senior aides not in the Vagiant club. As Obama stenographer Beck Dorey-Stein wrote: “Why does ‘Vagiant’ make me feel bad. ... I wouldn’t especially love it if the men in the West Wing nicknamed themselves the 10-Inch Senior Staffs.” The Vagiants also appeared to have certain privileges not granted to other aides. As Dorey-Stein observed, with more than a touch of envy regarding their leave to wear brighter colors than lower-level White House aides could, “Only the Vagiants can wear any shade from the J. Crew catalog.”
The “Vagiants” joined together in an alliance to advance the ideas of women in the administration. The tactic they adopted was named “amplification.” It called for the women to echo the views of other women, and specifically, to agree with comments other female aides made in meetings. The Washington Post’s Juliet Eilperin took note of the amplification stratagem and wrote that “it forced the men in the room to recognize the contribution—and denied them the chance to claim the idea as their own.” Eilperin also quoted Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett’s approving comment on these efforts: “It’s fair to say that there was a lot of testosterone flowing in those early days. Now we have a little more estrogen that provides a counterbalance.”
The Obama women would also occasionally pursue gender-specific crusades, often to the confusion of the men with whom they worked. Mastromonaco, for example, spends three pages of her memoir detailing her effort to get a tampon dispenser placed in the women’s bathroom in the West Wing. At the end of this successful effort, she announced it at the White House senior staff meeting. She admits that none of the male aides opposed the idea, and with her announcement, they offered no opinions on the matter. Yet, Mastromonaco was thrilled, saying, “No one said a word, but it felt really good.”
Gender-based concerns could elicit other clear violations of the Dan Pfeiffer rules for Obama aides: "no a--holes" and "no leaks." When a New York Times article noted that Mastromonaco had long managed Obama’s “logistical and travel arrangements” and described her quite senior position of deputy chief of staff as “responsible for overseeing scheduling, personnel and much more,” she interpreted it as a gender-based slight. The article also called her one of a number of “well-regarded women” in senior slots, although the coverage also noted that none of those women were being considered for the position of chief of staff at that time, during the beginning of Obama’s second term.
Mastromonaco was extremely unhappy with the article. By her admission, she “went apes---” and griped that if a male aide such as Jim Messina had received a similar appointment, “they would have said he ran the White House.” She blamed the New York Times slight on colleagues diminishing her position in conversations with the press and felt that it was an instance of not supporting team members. As she complained in her memoir, “You don’t talk about your colleagues on background, and you definitely don’t on-the-record them.”
Mastromonaco’s reaction to the perceived slight did not fit into the “no drama Obama” ethic. When she received the offending article in a group email that went to the entire White House senior staff, she “replied-all with a very cutting, infuriated response.” White House counsel Kathy Ruemmler “amplified” via reply-all as well, echoing Mastromonaco’s concerns. Mastromonaco was still angry, but she thought that was the end of the matter: “I was fuming but I didn’t think it was a big deal.”
The next day, Obama summoned her to his office. She was not sure why — the White House deputy chief of staff is typically in regular contact with the president, on a wide-ranging set of issues. Obama greeted her with, “So, I hear you sent quite an email.” Mastromonaco was surprised by this and “started going over that distribution list in my head to figure out who had narc’d on me,” with a thought toward who “deserves another irrational email.” Obama sensed what she was thinking and cut off that train of thought, saying, “It doesn’t matter who came to talk to me.” He then scolded her a bit over the email, telling her that “I could not send emails like that because they—I am paraphrasing—freak everyone out.” The message was clear: “When the president of the United States tells you your words are powerful, it can be pretty shocking.” She also admitted that she had miscalculated, recalling that “I honestly didn’t think anyone would give a s--- if I sent a snippy email.”
The story is revealing on a few levels. It shows that no drama Obama was a good theory, but it did not always work in practice. One of the ways it broke down was that burgeoning gender consciousness often magnified perceived slights. But also, to his credit, Obama was willing to confront officials directly to enforce the no drama Obama rules. He was always willing to make clear that he wanted to keep internal dissent to a minimum. When he fired Gen. Stanley McChrystal over disrespectful comments about senior administration members published in Rolling Stone, he called his national security team together to impose order. At the meeting, he made his desire to avoid backstabbing clear, telling the assembled staff: “If people can’t pull together as a team, then other people are going to go. I mean it.”

Iowa Democratic Party chairman resigns after caucus mess

Texto completo: Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price resigned following the caucus reporting disaster that delayed and muddled results from the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential nominating contest last week.
"While it is my desire to stay in this role and see this process through to completion, I do believe it is time for the Iowa Democratic Party to begin looking forward, and my presence in my current role makes that more difficult. Therefore, I will resign as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party effective upon the election of my replacement," Price said in a resignation letter Wednesday.
His resignation will be official after an election on Saturday.
The first voting results in the Democratic presidential field were derailed by glitches in an app intended to report results from Iowa precincts to headquarters, with partial results only released the next day. Later, a New York Times analysis revealed inconsistencies in the results in over 100 precincts, such as errors in allocating state delegate equivalents to results that should not have been possible under caucus rules.
On caucus night, the party was ill-prepared to handle the technical problems it faced. A phone line intended to be used as a backup to report results was allegedly clogged with prank calls from supporters of President Trump.
The delay was thought to stunt momentum of former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won the most delegates and the popular vote, respectively, and were unable to claim decisive victory on caucus night.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez last week called for a recanvass of results, but only the campaigns have the authority to request one. The campaigns for Sanders and Buttigieg on Sunday each requested a partial recanvass, which amounted to 85 precincts. It is unclear when the process will be complete.

‘He would arrest us tomorrow’: Joe Scarborough says Trump would strip freedom of press if he could

Texto completo: MSNBC host Joe Scarborough claimed President Trump would send in the authorities to haul him and other journalists away in handcuffs if he could.
On Wednesday morning, Trump congratulated Attorney General William Barr for announcing that the Justice Department would seek a more lenient sentence for the president’s longtime associate Roger Stone. During his show on Wednesday, Scarborough criticized Trump and Barr and questioned whether Sen. Susan Collins still believed that Trump “learned his lesson” after being impeached in the House.
“Susan Collins, I’m curious if you really still think that Donald Trump learned his lesson, or if the lesson that Donald Trump learned was, with senators like you giving him a blank check, he can do whatever the hell he wants,” Scarborough said. “[Lt. Col. Alexander] Vindman, that’s on you. [Ambassador to the European Union Gordon] Sondland, that’s on you. Roger Stone? Susan Collins, that’s on you.”
Scarborough claimed Trump’s encouragement related to the Stone case is one of several examples of lawlessness from the past few weeks. He added, “Our constitutional republic, literally, and the institutions in it, literally are being challenged every single day by this would-be dictator.”
He argued that Trump would abolish freedom of the press and round up reporters from MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post if he had the power.
“You tell me. Would Donald Trump not do whatever he could do if he could get away with it?” Scarborough asked. “Seriously. If he could arrest every journalist he didn’t like, if he could arrest us tomorrow, let me ask you a question, do you think he would arrest us tomorrow? Do you think he would arrest the editor of the New York Times, the editor of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, do you think he would arrest them tomorrow and throw them in jail to silence them.”
Scarborough claimed anyone who didn’t believe Trump would take such actions was “just lying to yourself.”iFrame ObjectTrump called Stone’s sentence of seven to nine years a “miscarriage of justice.” When the Department of Justice announced on Tuesday that they would be reconsidering the sentencing, three prosecutors tied to Robert Mueller’s investigation quit the case, including two who resigned as U.S. attorneys. Trump also withdrew the nomination of U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu for a Treasury Department post after she led the case against Stone.
Trump claimed that he did not speak to Barr or other officials in the department about Stone’s case, despite the changes on Tuesday.
Outside the Stone controversy, Trump has also been criticized for reassigning Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother from their posts on the National Security Council and reassigning them to posts within the Pentagon. On the same day, Trump also announced he was pulling Gordon Sondland from his position as U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Both Vindman and Sondland testified in the House impeachment hearings.

Trump's 'lies' are nothing compared to the media's

Texto completo: It never ceases to amaze that it wasn’t until Donald Trump came onto the scene that liberals in the national media discovered the concept of “lying.”
Thomas Edsall, typically the only columnist at the New York Times worth a damn, had an entire piece on Wednesday suggesting that — can you believe it? — politicians lie and voters know it!
What’s more, Trump as president has demonstrated that voters don’t care!
“A large segment of the American electorate has come to tolerate, and in many cases to willingly accept, politicians who lie,” wrote Edsall. “Double talk is key to Trump’s governing strategy.”
The idea that Trump lied his way into the White House and that he’s lying his way into a second term is a media fantasy.
If anything, Trump isn’t the reason millions of people are supposedly unbothered by lies. He’s the effect of years of the national media lying with impunity.
They’re always lying or instigating or inducing panic for no other reason than that it pays to keep readers and viewers in a constant state of anxiety.
Well, Trump was the relief to that sick cycle because though he does lie, nearly always about the most inconsequential things, he at least doesn’t screw everyone over by hobbling economic opportunity and snatching away their insurance under the guise of “expanding access to healthcare.”
When politicians do those things, the media react with a yawn. Yeah, too bad, but that’s how it goes!
But if Trump says something like “there’s a crisis at the border,” liberal journalists are horrified, absolutely horrified, that he would ever tell such a lie, though right up until that moment, they themselves had been calling it a crisis.
It’s as if they don’t think people can actually see for themselves that there really are hundreds of thousands of poor people from broken countries dumping themselves into the United States, where we’re expected to care for them.
No crisis there! Just Trump lying again!
The “Trump lies again” mantra is in itself an attempt by the media to mislead us. That ridiculous tally by the Washington Post and the New York Times purporting to track something like 1 billion lies told by the president every minute is simply a joke.
Edsall cited the Washington Post’s version in his column, so let’s take a look at it. Here’s an example of one of the “false or misleading claims” by Trump included in the list: “In many ways, this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America.”
The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler determined that to be a lie because, he said, “by just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton — or Ulysses S. Grant.”
My God, impeach! The president shared an opinion that I didn't agree with! (Never mind that gross domestic product is higher than it's ever been).
President Barack Obama in 2010 warned that we might be in a “new normal” in which unemployment remained high and companies simply refused to hire because “they’ve learned to do more with less.” New York Times liberal columnist Paul Krugman every week endorsed that mindset, championed Obama, and then said with complete certitude that Trump, if elected, would cause an irreparable global recession.
Krugman in August 2015: "Persistent global weakness is the new normal."
Now, Krugman is admitting that, well, the economy is actually doing very well under this president. There are more jobs, unemployment is stunningly low, and companies are expanding.
So, who “lied” to the public? Was it Trump when he said we have the “greatest economy in the HISTORY of America,” or was it Krugman, who told us to accept the “new normal” that Obama believed in?
If Edsall is concerned about Trump taking advantage of voters who now accept lying as a matter of everyday politics, he doesn’t need to look at the president to figure out why. He needs to look at his own industry.

Texto completo: A Republican congressman from Utah is a top contender to become President Trump’s next director of national intelligence.
National security adviser Robert O’Brien is advocating that the president tap GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah to head the U.S. Intelligence Community made up of 17 intelligence and national security agencies, according to the New York Times.
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire must step down in March after temporarily taking over the position following former Director Dan Coats's resignation in August. Maguire also is the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, an Intelligence Community agency.
Trump has yet to make a firm decision on Stewart. His last pick for director of national intelligence, Rep. John Ratcliffe, withdrew from consideration in August. Critics of the pick questioned Ratcliffe’s experience for the role and said the Texas Republican would be blindly loyal to Trump. The president slammed Democrats and media outlets after Ratcliffe pulled his name from consideration.
"Our great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media. Rather than going through months of slander and libel, I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people," Trump tweeted.
Stewart sits on the House Intelligence Committee and defended Trump during the chamber's impeachment investigation into his handling of military aid to Ukraine and his July 2019 phone call with the country's leader. Stewart has also criticized the Justice Department and FBI for their role in investigating the Trump campaign in 2016.

Texto completo: As a former soldier and FBI agent, we both risked our lives to fight Al Qaeda. But the enemy we currently face is not a jihadist threat. It’s white supremacists — in the United States and overseas.
One American group, The Base, peppered a recruitment video with footage of our faces, intercut with shots of masked men machine-gunning a spray-painted Star of David. The Scandinavia-based Nordic Resistance Movement called us out by name, referring to us in a recent statement as “the Jew Max Rose” and “Arab F.B.I. agent Ali Soufan.” Defenders of the Ukrainian Azov Battalion, which the FBI calls “a paramilitary unit” notorious for its “association with neo-Nazi ideology,” accuse us of being part of a Kremlin campaign to “demonize” the group.
Why the sudden attention? Because we, along with dedicated colleagues from across the political spectrum, are working to expose the truth about so-called domestic terrorism: There is nothing domestic about it.
Over the past several months — at congressional hearings, in a report by the Soufan Center, and in a letter to the State Department signed by 40 members of Congress — we have documented the existence of a global network of white supremacist extremists that stretches across North America, Europe and Australia. White supremacists today are organizing in a similar fashion to jihadist terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, in the 1980s and 1990s. They transcend national barriers with recruitment and dissemination of propaganda. And just as jihadists exploited conflicts in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Syria, so too are white supremacists using the conflict in Ukraine as a laboratory and training ground.
Yet despite these profound similarities, United States law has not caught up to the new threat we face. International white supremacist groups are still not designated as foreign terrorist organizations, which means our law enforcement and intelligence agencies cannot access the full suite of tools available to them in countering groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda.
A few examples lay bare the extent of this tangled, transnational web.
The Australian who in March last year murdered 51 worshipers at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, claimed in his manifesto that he had traveled to Ukraine; during the attacks he wore a symbol used by the Azov Battalion. The FBI director recently warned that American extremists, too, are traveling overseas for paramilitary training. Among those who have trained with Azov are several of the men responsible for fomenting violence at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. James Alex Fields Jr., who murdered a protester with his car, was a member of Vanguard America, a group with ties to the British network that celebrated Thomas Mair, the far-right extremist who assassinated the British legislator Jo Cox in 2016.
Mr. Mair, who is serving a life sentence, was himself closely connected with National Action, a British group that has sought to funnel fighters to Ukraine. This past June, two more British citizens were convicted of terrorism offenses for promoting, among other groups, the United States-based Atomwaffen Division, of which The Base is an offshoot. Recently, Atomwaffen has begun publishing ISIS-style recruitment videos featuring a masked man gesticulating with a hunting knife as he promises a wave of “ever-encroaching terror.” The effect of these far-reaching connections on our homeland is clear. Since 9/11, far-right terrorists have killed 110 people on American soil, while jihadists have killed 107. And the trend is worsening: 2018 was the worst year for far-right violence since Timothy McVeigh attacked Oklahoma City in 1995.
Almost twice as many foreign fighters have traveled to join the civil war in Ukraine than to Afghanistan in the ’80s — a conflict which birthed Al Qaeda. The government is aware of the threat: In 2018 the Trump administration warned of violent foreign neo-Nazi groups forging ties with organizations in the United States.
Yet no white supremacist group has ever been designated a foreign terrorist organization under federal law. This omission leaves American law enforcement hobbled in its efforts to combat these groups and the rising tide of violence they represent. The arrest of members of The Base in January, including a Canadian national, illustrates not only the FBI’s recognition of the threat and resolve to protect Americans, but also the international connections of American groups. But law enforcement cannot utilize the most effective tools to protect the country.
Designating these groups as foreign terrorist organizations would offer authorities three important advantages — ones they currently enjoy when dealing with jihadists. First, they could monitor communications between people connected to the designated groups. Second, they could share intelligence with our allies overseas, an important asset when dealing with international terrorism. And third, they could bring charges for providing material support to the designated groups, with appropriately severe penalties attached.
Terrorism is terrorism, however its perpetrators justify it inside their twisted minds. If these peddlers of hate hoped to silence us by attacking us online, they have failed. They’ve only hardened our resolve.

CJ Taylor: Why the urge to punish women who are pregnant?

Texto completo: An article in the Feb. 8 Salt Lake Tribune quoted state Sen. Dan McCay stating, “We tend to overvalue the people that are here and undervalue the people that aren’t here yet.”
This statement is not based on facts.
In the United States, according to the Census Bureau, 13.6 million children live with a single parent. Of these, 84% (about 11 million children) are living in homes with a single mother caring for one or more children. Only 48.7% of women receive legal or informal child support, leaving 5.7 million women with no financial support to raise their child/children.
According to Kids Count, children who grow up in a single-parent household do not have similar economic and human resources compared to children in a two-parent household. These children will also be more likely to drop out of school, have or cause a teenage pregnancy and experience a divorce in adulthood.
Do we really value people who are here? Where did the men go who contributed the sperm for these pregnancies?
The proposed bill to ban elective abortions in Utah is concerning for all women, especially those living on the financial edge with little to no access to affordable health care. If our country guaranteed that all women (and men) receive appropriate sex education during adolescence, all women have access to adequate health care and information about affordable, or free , methods of birth control, we would all benefit.
But, this is not the case in the U.S. Because we struggle to provide appropriate information and services, many women seek abortions for unplanned pregnancies.
On May 30, 2019, The New York Times published an op-ed by Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister. Schenck explained his previous efforts to ban abortion, his time spent in jail for his anti-abortion activities, and his eventual recognition that pro-life is more than abortion that grew from conversations with individuals who were deeply affected by anti-abortion activists, policies and laws.
I recommend those on both sides of the abortion debate read Schenck’s article. His approach to this decisive issue is critical and timely.
Personal Issue and Pro-Life: To seek an abortion is a personal, difficult decision for women and should be considered with the partner and physician. Society should not interfere or determine what is right. The couple’s, or the woman’s, decision should be based on accurate medical information. Being pro-life should not only include the fetal life, but should encompass what the needs are for the infant/child after birth. We lack a social and health care system that provides a safety net for those in need. One might think that adoption is an answer – but not all women who have an unplanned pregnancy want to give their child away after delivery. When children are not raised in a loving and protective environment, the society as a whole suffers.
Why are legislators so quick to punish women who become pregnant? Rarely discussed in the efforts to ban abortion are the roles men play in pregnancy. Sperm is required to fertilize an egg. The woman is required carrier of this embryo/fetus until delivery. Because it takes both an egg and sperm to create a human being, we must ask what other options might be possible that could prevent abortions?
Until we discuss the issues that are necessary for appropriate sex education during adolescents, access to affordable or free birth control for all women, and caring for all children in the US, the divide between pro-life and pro-choice will not change. And, until such time, government should not determine what is best for a woman when she discovers she is pregnant.

Texto completo: The Democratic race was messy going into New Hampshire. It’s even messier as it moves on.
Yes, Bernie Sanders won the state’s primary on Tuesday night. And that victory, coming on the heels of his functional tie with Pete Buttigieg in the dysfunctional Iowa caucuses last week, makes him the indisputable front-runner for the Democratic nomination.
But look at how closely behind him Buttigieg finished, despite furious attacks from Sanders and other rivals over recent days. Look at the sudden surge of Amy Klobuchar, whose strong third-place finish demonstrates not only how unsettled the contest is but also how many Democrats crave a moderate — or female — alternative to Sanders.
Note that while Sanders is hugely well known in New Hampshire and beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points in its Democratic primary in 2016, he squeaked by Buttigieg this time around, as many people who voted for him four years ago obviously didn’t do so on Tuesday night.
Finally, brace for the days ahead, during which Sanders’ strength will be seriously tested as he comes under brutal assault from Democrats who believe that his nomination would be suicidal for the party and guarantee President Donald Trump’s reelection. Sanders, a cranky 78-year-old who includes “socialist” in his description of his politics, is hardly in the clear.
You expected resolution from New Hampshire? What an optimist you are! And how impatient. Resolution was never likely to happen, not this year, not with Democratic voters’ near-crippling anxiety about the surest path to the far side of Trump, not with this many viable but flawed candidates, not when there’s so much noise in Washington and so much frustration in the air, not when so many voters have stopped taking cues from the institutions and traditions they frequently turned to in the past.
Elizabeth Warren was endorsed by respected media organizations. No matter. She finished fourth in New Hampshire, with less than 10% of the vote, though she had lavished hope, energy and resources on the state, next door to Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate.
Joe Biden has high-profile surrogates galore, is as conventionally prepared for the presidency as a human being could be, and basks in the vestigial good will that many Democratic voters feel toward President Barack Obama’s administration. None of that did him any good. He finished fifth, with less than 9%, and the dearth of confidence in him following his fourth-place showing in Iowa deepened, perhaps irreparably.
But add Biden’s, Buttigieg’s and Klobuchar’s votes in New Hampshire and they far exceed those for the two prominent progressives, Sanders and Warren. Democrats’ appetite for a nominee less liberal than Sanders is real.
But is there a moderate around whom voters can coalesce?
Buttigieg’s enormously impressive performance in the first two states would make him the natural choice, except that he’s 38, he still lags far behind Biden and Sanders in national polls, his highest office to date is mayor of a city of 100,000 people and he now moves on to two states, Nevada and then South Carolina, where his utter lack of traction with voters of color could undo his candidacy.
Klobuchar’s sudden surge may well be too little too late, even at this early stage of the contest. Besides, there’s little evidence that she will do significantly better with African-American and Latino voters than Buttigieg.
This uncertainty about the Sanders alternative is why you’ll be hearing even more about Mike Bloomberg over the next week than you did over the past one, when you heard plenty. This and the fact that he’ll continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to implant his name in your brain.
The premium on becoming the moderate answer to Sanders was obvious in the speeches by Klobuchar, Buttigieg and even Warren to their supporters on Tuesday night.
“Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is that the people in the middle — the people who have had enough of the name calling and the mud slinging — have someone to vote for in November,” Klobuchar said. She was presenting herself as that someone.
Buttigieg, aware that Klobuchar probably siphoned votes from him in New Hampshire and could do so again down the road, urged Democrats to support a newcomer like him over a longtime senator and Washington insider like her. “Election after election has shown us that putting forward a new perspective is how Democrats win the White House,” he said, returning again and again to the idea that his was a uniquely inclusive campaign with a singularly far-reaching appeal.
And Warren, who months ago competed with Sanders for progressive votes, continued her assiduous repositioning as a candidate able to bridge progressives and moderates. “We will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels like they can get behind,” she said, bemoaning “the fight between factions of our party.”
Now what? I keep hearing Democratic friends grouse that the party’s members need to get on the same page, as if they can be magically muscled there. I keep seeing references in the media to the Democratic establishment and to party leaders, as if those are meaningful forces with indisputable impact.
Maybe they once were, but Trump’s political ascent — which happened, remember, in defiance of the supposed Republican establishment and Republican leaders — demonstrated that the era of an external, elite authority being able to impose its will was over.
That era preceded the explosion of social media. That era was less pessimistic about the country’s trajectory, less cynical about politics and politicians, more faithful on various fronts. That era was less suited to a disruptive iconoclast like Trump — and to a disruptive iconoclast like Sanders.
Sanders will be a major force in the Democratic race until the end. He’s perhaps the only candidate about whom that can definitively be said. He seemed jubilant as he declared victory on Tuesday night, telling his supporters: “We have an unprecedented grass roots movement from coast to coast of millions of people. The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multigenerational, multiracial political movement.”
Not so fast. Younger voters are much more taken with him than older ones. His dominance in the primary at present hinges on the scattered affections of less progressive Democrats.
And this movement isn’t driving voters to the polls in the manner that he and his allies have vowed that it would. Democratic turnout in New Hampshire on Tuesday, like turnout in Iowa last week, wasn’t spectacularly robust.
That means that Sanders, so strong, has weaknesses, just as Buttigieg, so weak in a few ways, keeps flexing unexpected strengths. Mixed signals, a muddle of moderates and Biden on political life support: That’s the Democratic primary, which refuses to conform to predictions or follow any tidy script. Get comfortable with your discomfort. I suspect you’ll be feeling it for a while.

Texto completo: My fellow Americans, we face a national emergency. Never before have we had a president so utterly lacking in personal integrity, so able to lie and abuse his powers with such impunity and so blindly backed by an amoral party, an unscrupulous attorney general and a media-fundraising juggernaut. It is an engine of raw power that will cram anything the president says or does right down your throat.
James Carville had it exactly right when he noted on “Morning Joe” the other day that the only thing standing in the way of lasting damage by this machine to all that makes America unique and great is the Democrats’ nominating the right person to defeat Donald Trump.
We have to get this right. This is no ordinary time, no ordinary Republican Party, no ordinary incumbent, and it will require an extraordinary Democratic machine to triumph.
Because, without doubt, Russia and China also will be “voting” Trump 2020 — for three reasons: (1) Trump keeps America in turmoil and unable to focus on building the infrastructure we need to dominate the 21st century the way we did the 20th. (2) Both Beijing and Moscow know that Trump is so disliked by America’s key allies that he can never galvanize a global coalition against China or Russia. And (3) both Russia and China know that Trump is utterly transactional and will never challenge them on human rights abuses. Trump is their chump, and they will not let him go easily.
So who is the right Democratic candidate? Well, for starters I will tell you who it is not. It is not Bernie Sanders. On which planet in the Milky Way galaxy is an avowed “socialist” — who wants to take away the private health care coverage of some 150 million Americans and replace it with a gigantic, untested, Medicare-for-All program, which he’d also extend to immigrants in the country illegally — going to defeat the Trump machine this year? It will cast Sanders as Che Guevara — and it won’t even be that hard.
Yes, the failures of American capitalism to deliver inclusive growth, which have propelled the Sanders campaign and animated his followers, require urgent attention by our next president. But Sanders, in key cases, has the wrong solutions to the right problems. He’s the wrong candidate to take down Trump.
Please, Democrats, don’t tell me you need Sanders’ big, ill-thought-through revolutionary grand schemes to get inspired and mobilized for this election. You want a revolution? I’ll give you a revolution: four more years of Donald Trump, unencumbered by the need to get reelected. That will be a revolution! And it will do permanent damage to the institutions and norms that have sustained this country since its founding, not to mention our environment, which Trump has been selling off to oil, gas and mining companies at an alarming pace.
So, who is the right candidate and what is the right strategy?
On strategy, we know the formula that works, because it already has: Appeal to independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women. These are the constituencies that did not like Hillary Clinton and were ready to give Trump a chance in 2016 — but abandoned him in 2018 and delivered the House of Representatives to the Democrats, and then also two governorships in red states.
If Democrats can choose a candidate who can hold the core Democratic base and also appeal to these same independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women in the key swing states, they can absolutely defeat Trump.
How do you do that as a candidate?
For starters, by stressing national unity, personal integrity and a willingness to pursue bipartisanship whenever the other side is ready. A lot of Americans are worried sick that Trump is tearing the country in half.
As Larry Diamond, editor of The Journal of Democracy, pointed out to me, several studies he’s been publishing show that the best way to defeat illiberal populism is not by trying to out-polarize the polarizer in chief but rather through broad, inclusive electoral strategies that pragmatically address the economic and social concerns of voters, including those who had previously voted for the populist.
That was the approach that enabled the secular opposition to defeat the party of Turkey’s autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in municipal elections last year in Istanbul and other cities. A similar depolarizing approach powered the victory of Greece’s liberal-centrist New Democracy party over the ruling left-wing populist Syriza in national elections last year.
You also do it by repeating every hour every day — with evidence — that Trump is out to destroy Obamacare through the courts, which means eliminating its coverage for preexisting conditions, and only the Democrats will save it and improve it.
You do it by not only talking about how to redivide the pie — which we need to do — but by also talking about how to grow the pie, how to create more taxpayers and how to inspire more innovators. Ours is a capitalist country. Americans admire successful entrepreneurs. Let’s praise job creators and risk-takers — as long as they and their companies pay their taxes. You want more and better jobs, you need more Steve Jobs.
You do it by celebrating the growing economy that Barack Obama reignited and Trump continued, while making clear that it still needs work. Too much of the Trump tax cuts have gone to companies and the most wealthy, with virtually nothing invested in infrastructure — roads, ports, schools, bandwidth, scientific research — or affordable housing, which we must have for inclusive prosperity.
You do it by hitting Trump hard on the environment, but not focusing just on “climate change,” which is an abstraction for most people. Trump is unfit to serve four more years because of how he has removed so many protections for the water and air America’s kids drink and breathe every day.
And you do it by supporting a balanced approach to immigration reform — a high wall, with a big gate.
I was glad to see candidates with this kind of message, like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, trending better in Iowa and New Hampshire. It showed that lots of Democrats are searching in this direction.
But there is one candidate on the Democratic side who not only has a track record of supporting all those issues but also has the resources to build a machine big enough to take on the Trump machine.
This candidate also has the toughness to take on Trump, because while Trump was pretending to be a CEO on the show “The Apprentice,” this candidate was actually building one of the most admired global companies as a real CEO.
This candidate is not cuddly, he is not always politically correct, and he will not always tell you what you want to hear — or try to outbid you on how many free services he’ll give away. He’s made mistakes, especially around stop-and-frisk policing in New York City, which disproportionately targeted black and brown men and for which he recently apologized.
His mistakes, though, have to be weighed against a record of courageously speaking out and devoting enormous personal resources to virtually every progressive cause — gun control, abortion rights, climate change, Planned Parenthood, education reform for predominantly minority schools, affordable housing, income inequality and tax reform. And he has vowed as president to focus on building black wealth, not just ending poverty.
And this candidate knows how to get stuff done — he can fight this fire at the scale of the fire. His team has for years used social networks to promote progressive issues to centrist and conservative audiences. He won’t cede the internet/Facebook/Twitter battlefield to Trump’s team, who are killers in that space.
And this candidate is now rising steadily in the polls. This candidate is Michael Bloomberg. This candidate has Trump very worried.
Yes, Sanders is also polling well against Trump, but the Trump machine has not begun to focus on him yet — it hasn’t begun bombing Facebook with ads about how Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
Sitting here today, Bloomberg — paired with a progressive vice-presidential candidate who can appeal to Sanders’ voters — has the best chance to carry the day.
In an age when political extremists go all the way, and moderates tend to just go away, Bloomberg has the right stuff — a moderate progressive with a heart of gold but the toughness of a rattlesnake — for what is going to be an incredibly big, brutal task: making Donald Trump a one-term president.

‘The Hunt,’ a film turned lightning rod, will arrive in theaters in March

Texto completo: Universal City, Calif. • “The Hunt” is back on. Only this time Universal Pictures has designed a radically different marketing campaign for the violent film, which is ostensibly about liberal elites who kill conservative “rednecks” for sport.
Before “The Hunt” was shelved last year in the face of criticism, Universal had started to market the film as something it was not: a relatively straightforward horror flick. Now the studio is hoping that an unusual marketing tactic — forthrightness — will protect “The Hunt” from blowback before its release on March 13.
A new trailer, released Tuesday, does not try to boil down “The Hunt” to a single, salable genre, which is the way Hollywood usually approaches films. Instead it presents “The Hunt” as it is — an absurdist satire that leaves no side of the political divide unscathed and is equal parts comedy, horror and thriller.
“Not one frame was changed,” Jason Blum, who produced the film with Damon Lindelof (“Lost,” “Watchmen”), said in an interview. “This is exactly the same movie.”
“The Hunt,” starring Emmy-nominated Betty Gilpin (Netflix’s “Glow”) and two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank, was supposed to arrive in theaters in September. Trailers in July veiled the political aspect of the $15 million film and made it resemble an entry in the Universal’s dystopian “Purge” horror series. Universal had not yet screened “The Hunt” for film reporters or critics.
Then 31 people were killed in back-to-back shootings in Texas and Ohio. The Hollywood Reporter published an article saying Universal had pulled ads for “The Hunt” as a result. The article, based on a copy of the script, also disclosed that the movie revolved “around third-rail political themes” — notably elites stalking “deplorables.”
An outcry followed, with conservative pundits criticizing the film’s premise as “sick” and “awful.” Before long, President Donald Trump alluded to “The Hunt” on Twitter, saying it was made by liberal Hollywood “to inflame and cause chaos.”
Caught in a maelstrom, Universal canceled the release, leading to accusations of censorship.
Universal, a division of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast, said Tuesday that it would give the film a wide release in theaters. It also invited a handful of reporters to its campus in the San Fernando Valley to watch “The Hunt” in the Alfred Hitchcock Building and discuss it afterward with Blum and Lindelof.
“We didn’t want to just pretend that nothing had ever happened,” Blum said.
Lindelof, who wrote the screenplay with Nick Cuse, said “The Hunt” had been inspired by “Get Out,” the blockbuster comedic mystery, social satire and horror film directed and written by Jordan Peele. (Blum was a producer.) It may be hard to believe, but Lindelof insisted that he had never expected “The Hunt” to prompt political blowback, certainly not on a presidential level.
“It didn’t strike me as third rail,” Lindelof said of the film. He added of Trump: “I wish that he had seen it. The movie he was talking about was not the movie I feel that we made.”
“The Hunt” begins (spoiler warning) with a close-up shot of text messages on a phone. One reads, “Promise you won’t judge me?” The conversation is about killing “deplorables” for sport. The discussion seems serious. Or is it in jest, albeit in very poor taste?
The film, directed by Craig Zobel, whose credits include the well-reviewed 2015 thriller “Z for Zachariah,” then introduces the unlikable elites. One snootily rejects the caviar offered to him by an attendant on a private jet. He would prefer figs. There aren’t any? Sigh . Champagne will have to suffice.
A dozen strangers then wake up in a clearing in the woods. All are overt stereotypes. A woman from Wyoming rocks a spectacular mullet. One older man wears a beige fishing shirt and a military cap.
The liberal elites then begin the slaughter. “For the record, climate change is real!” one shrieks before blowing up a victim.
Then one of the people being hunted turns the tables, picking off the killers one by one until only the ringleader remains. Slaying the liberals is not terribly difficult: They are easily distracted — bickering with one another over politically correct language, squealing in delight when progressive filmmaker Ava DuVernay likes a social media post about their volunteer work in Haiti.
By the end of the R-rated film, the story has included a paramilitary unit in Croatia, a dark internet conspiracy theory, a killing by stiletto pump and a pig wearing a T-shirt.
“As anyone who has seen the movie can attest, it’s all so over the top and absurd,” Lindelof said. “It’s possible that people will see this movie and say it’s irresponsible or is a call to violence. But the morality of the movie” — who is left standing at the end — “has always felt very clean to us.”
As any Hollywood marketer will tell you, it is exceeding difficult to burnish a film once an unfavorable narrative has formed around it. So part of Universal’s new marketing strategy involves embracing the ugliness. “The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one’s actually seen,” Universal’s new poster says. “Decide for yourself.”
But the new trailer also marks “a big tonal shift,” as Lindelof said. Rather than a horror movie with some social commentary, à la “The Purge,” “The Hunt” is shown as a comedic social satire with some horror elements. In particular, the new trailer plays up the absurdity of the premise.
“You wanted it to be real, so you decided it was,” Swank’s character says sternly.
Which leads to a question: Why didn’t Universal take this approach to begin with?
Michael Moses, Universal’s marketing chief, declined to discuss the studio’s initial strategy or the shift revealed on Tuesday except to say in an email: “To simply restart the previous campaign felt like it ignores what transpired. We thought it appropriate to acknowledge the film’s history and also the potential curiosity around it.”
The initial strategy probably boiled down to Movie Marketing 101. Satires are hard to explain to a mass audience. Horror films are easier.

David Leonhardt: America’s left and center need to get along

Texto completo: It’s been a rough week for Democrats. President Donald Trump is preening over his acquittal, his poll numbers and the economy, while the Democratic nomination race looks like a divided mess. Many Democratic voters are anxious that they have no great candidates, only those guaranteed to alienate one half of the party or the other.
Moderates worry that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren aren’t just wrong on big issues, but too left wing to get elected. Progressives worry that Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bloomberg are uninspiring centrists who resemble recent presidential losers and wouldn’t solve America’s problems even if they won.
My message to panicking Democrats is: Take a deep breath, and don’t make your job harder. Neither side of the party can ensure that its preferred candidate will win the nomination. But both can help avoid the outcome they fear most — Trump’s reelection.
The current moment, when everybody is wearing a veil of ignorance about the nomination, is a good time for Democrats to ask themselves a question: If the primaries don’t turn out as you hope, will you still do everything in your power to deny Trump a second term?
Or will you instead exaggerate your differences with the nominee — say, complain about Sanders or Warren as a Trump-style radical; or buy into the caricature of Buttigieg as a corporate tool; or retweet, with outrage added, the least enlightened things Biden or Bloomberg has ever said?
Yes, the candidates have their differences. But they have much bigger similarities. If elected, every single Democratic presidential candidate would act to slow climate change, raise taxes on the rich, reduce gun deaths, expand voting rights, lower health care and education costs, protect abortion access, enforce civil-rights laws, appoint progressive judges, rebuild overseas alliances and stop treating the Justice Department as a personal enforcer. The moderates are running to the left of Barack Obama, and the progressives would be constrained by Congress.
The alternative, of course, is truly radical. Many Democrats know all this, yet they still get so caught up in the passions of the primary campaign that they risk helping Trump.
Whether progressives and moderates can find common ground is likely to be a defining political question not just of 2020 but of this decade. As E.J. Dionne asks in the first sentence of “Code Red,” his new book, “Will progressives and moderates feud while America burns?”
Dionne, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and Washington Post columnist, tells a story about American politics that I find clarifying. In the past, thorny policy debates typically took place between the two parties. Examples include the best way to expand health insurance (through the private sector or government), control pollution (through taxes or regulations) and reduce the deficit (through spending cuts or tax increases).
Today the Republican Party has become so radicalized that it opposes almost any government action to solve problems. Its domestic agenda consists largely of cutting taxes for the rich and freeing companies from oversight. The substantive part of many policy debates now happens within the Democratic Party — which means that tensions are only natural.
And yet progressives and moderate Democrats still agree on far more than they disagree. Each side would be more effective if it were open to learning from the other, Dionne writes, rather than lapsing into “an unseemly moralism that feeds political superiority complexes.”
Progressives are right that over the past half century, Democratic moderates have often allowed conservatives to dictate the terms of political conversation, on economic growth, criminal justice, family values and more. I’d add that moderates have also spent too much time designing technocratically elegant policies (like tax credits) rather than creating easily understandable, popular programs.
Moderates, for their part, are right that every great progressive victory in American history — abolition, women’s suffrage, the income tax, labor rights, Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, marriage equality and more — has required compromise in the service of persuading allies who disagree with progressives on other issues. It’s not enough to state your case purely and wait for a silent progressive majority to emerge as never before.
In the long run, each side is likely to accomplish much more if it can recognize that the other isn’t the enemy. In the short run, obviously, there is an inescapable dilemma: The party can nominate only one person.
Before that choice is made — while both sides are fighting hard for their preferred nominees, as they should — they should pause to reflect on the strengths of the other side. For progressives, that means recognizing that moderate congressional candidates really did fare better in swing districts in 2018. It also means celebrating (quietly, for now, I realize) the progressivism of, say, Buttigieg’s agenda.
For moderates, it means acknowledging that Sanders’ pugnacious authenticity appeals to some swing voters more than wonkish centrism does. And it means pushing back against the false notion that Sanders and Warren are somehow un-American. A Sanders or Warren presidency would have more in common with Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency than a second Trump term would have with either of them.
The 2020 campaign still has a long way to go. Democrats should remember which parts of it they can’t control and which they can.

MORE TRUMP TAX CUTS WILL RUN THE U.S. DEEPER INTO THE RED

Texto completo: Donald Trump wants another tax cut. Apparently running up a trillion-dollar-a-year deficit isn't enough.
This time, though, he promises that it won't all go to the big boys - the multi-millionaires and billionaires and the country's largest corporations.
That would be good, since his much-ballyhooed tax cut in 2017 didn't come close to doing what Americans were promised, even though it's portrayed as Trump's signature legislative achievement.
What wouldn't be good is if it adds even more to an already 50% growth in budget red ink.
The 2017 law's biggest beneficiary was corporate America. It cut the corporate rate from 35% to 21% and was aimed primarily at bringing money that corporations like Apple and FedEx had parked overseas back to the U.S., where it ostensibly would be used to reinvest in capital improvements and workers' wages.
As a result, the Trump administration and its colleagues in Congress claimed that American households would see their incomes rise by $4,000 to $9,000 a year.
But, as many had predicted, that didn't happen. Companies did bring lots of their money back, but it wasn't used for wages or investment. Instead, most of it went to buy back stocks and increase shareholder dividends.
Today, U.S. corporations are contributing the smallest share of federal tax revenue in a generation. That means that the overall tax burden is increasingly falling on individuals who now account for 57% of the country's total revenue. Some 33% comes from employment taxes - Social Security and Medicare, for instance - and the corporate share has dropped to 7.6%, the lowest it has been since 1960, according to the IRS.
The new law did make small reductions in individual tax rates and hiked the standard deduction, but for millions of Americans in high-tax states, that was significantly offset by limiting deductions for their state taxes and interest payments on mortgages.
Now, it turns out that the tax breaks for big corporations weren't enough. Not long after the bill became law in December 2017, a New York Times business story revealed, the administration began transforming the tax package into a greater windfall for the largest corporations.
Laws like the 2017 cuts are carried out by federal agencies that first must formalize them with rules and regulations, the paper pointed out. How these rules are written can determine winners and losers.
In early 2018, Trump's treasury department was swarmed by lobbyists seeking the best language for their clients - corporations like Anheuser-Busch, Credit Suisse, General Electric, Barclays, Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Kimberly-Clark and dozens of others.
The lobbyists were wildly successful and some of their clients were able to avoid paying any taxes at all. Even the much trumpeted "Opportunity Zone" provision, aimed at encouraging investments in poor communities, was finagled to allow high-end developments in affluent neighborhoods to receive the tax breaks.
That's why many laugh when Trump's acolytes claim that he's draining Washington's swamp.
Meanwhile, the national debt continues on a steep upward climb. As many economists point out, this would be acceptable during periods of recession, when the economy, and particularly working Americans, need a boost from government spending.
But, to do so in a period of economic prosperity, high corporate profits and low unemployment, is foolhardy.
What, pray tell, will the government be able to do when another recession hits, as it surely will someday soon?
This administration will have taken away all options.

Texto completo: KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE - In what seemed like an arcane exchange in the last debate before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Amy Klobuchar reminded Bernie Sanders that some newspaper editorial boards actually like him.
Klobuchar had just concluded an argument that she would be the more electable Democratic nominee for president: "I have a way of working with people, that I think should be valued here as we look at these candidates, and it's one of the reasons that I got the New York Times endorsement, along with Elizabeth (Warren), and that I got the endorsements of the three major papers here in New Hampshire, which is the Union Leader, the Seacoast papers and The Keene Sentinel. I think that matters. Read those editorials, and you will get a sense of what I'm about."
The moderator turned to Sanders, who said, "I must confess, I don't get too many newspapers' editorial support. Must confess that."
It's not often these days that newspaper endorsements are topics for discussion in presidential debates. But Klobuchar goes there.
Of all the contenders for the Democratic nomination, the Minnesota senator takes newspapers especially seriously. Newspapering is in her blood. Her father, Jim Klobuchar, was a popular columnist for the Minneapolis Star Tribune. She grew up around daily papers and continues to talk them up - even as others speculate about the fading influence of so-called "legacy media" in an age of presidential tweets and 24/7 cable commentary.
Klobuchar's affection for daily papers appears to be serving her well in a 2020 campaign where polls suggest her fortunes are rising. After securing a credible finish in last week's Iowa caucuses, where she came close to elbowing former vice president Joe Biden out of fourth place, the Minnesota senator surged in the polls as Tuesday's New Hampshire primary approached.
Speaking for her state and others on a Democratic primary schedule that will get to Wisconsin on April 7, former New Hampshire Democratic gubernatorial nominee Arnie Arnesen said,"It's clear that people are taking another look at Amy."
Like President Trump and her fellow Democratic contenders, Klobuchar is comfortable communicating on social media platforms and jumps at the chance to do TV and radio interviews. But she goes out of her way to reach out to and talk with the editorial boards of newspapers that still make endorsements. Not just The New York Times, which made a convoluted endorsement of both Klobuchar and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but the smaller papers that still serve as vital voices across the country.
Klobuchar's Iowa campaign highlighted warm endorsements from a pair of daily papers in the eastern part of the state - the Quad-City Times in Davenport and the Iowa City Press-Citizen. Those of us who have written newspaper endorsements know they are just one way to capture voters' attention. But it's not unreasonable to suggest that kind words from Iowa papers boosted Klobuchar's prospects, as The Des Moines Register's endorsement undoubtedly helped Elizabeth Warren.
As Klobuchar noted in that last debate before New Hampshire's primary, the state's largest daily - the traditionally conservative Manchester Union Leader - endorsed her, identifying the Minnesotan as the candidate with "the strength and stamina to go toe-to-toe with the Tweeter-in-Chief."
She also got support from daily and weekly newspapers associated with southeast New Hampshire's Seacoast Media Group. And one of the state's more progressive daily papers, The Keene Sentinel, gave Klobuchar a well-argued endorsement that identified her as the candidate best suited to unite the country and defeat Trump.
"Whip-smart and knowledgeable, she's set on progress, but tempered by the political realities a new president would face," the paper's editors wrote. "Her record in Washington is one of getting things done, even when that requires reaching out to her GOP counterparts. Most candidates say they can 'reach across the aisle' and 'bring people to the table.' She's done it."
That was convincing for Maureen O'Brien, a longtime Sentinel reader from nearby Fitzwilliam. "I was deciding between Pete (Buttigieg) and Amy Klobuchar," she said Sunday. "The Sentinel endorsement was well done; it helped convince me to go with Amy."
Even when I talked with people who were backing other candidates, the Sentinel editorial came up. It may not have convinced them to switch allegiances, but it inspired the second looks Arnesen talks about.
While all of the major candidates have swept through Keene, a college town that tends to favor Democrats and often backs liberal contenders, Klobuchar went out of her way to visit the Sentinel's office, where she talked for more than an hour with the editorial board about everything from climate change to income inequality. Andrew Yang visited, as well; as did Sanders, who told the editors in a December conversation, "We've gotta change the culture, I think, in this country, and that culture is one of greed."
The Vermonter didn't get the Keene endorsement, but he did earn an embrace from eastern New Hampshire's Conway Daily Sun, which said:
"Despite resistance from mainstream Democrats and the media, he sits on or near the top of polls, attracts the biggest crowds and has raised the most money to date - mainly from small donors. So instead of fearing Sanders as a candidate on the fringe, we encourage voters to embrace the notion that he is the standard-bearer of today's progressive movement and to join us in supporting him to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party."
That's the Sanders endorsement Klobuchar highlighted in the debate - a reference that served as a reminder of just how seriously she keeps track of what all the papers are writing. CREDIT: By John Nichols

Cafe no longer fits in Whole Foods' future

Texto completo: Maybe because supermarkets are such a quintessential suburban form, they've always had trouble fitting into the city. Even when they are designed with windows facing the street, the management usually ends up covering up the view with advertisements or stacks of boxes. So when Whole Foods' Fairmount store adopted a more congenial stance in 2016, Philadelphians applauded.
Not only did the megastore feature a 200-foot wall of windows along Pennsylvania Avenue, it filled that sunny ground-floor space with a sleek coffee bar. The cafe served as a warm-up area for shoppers, giving them a place to rest and refuel before hitting the grocery-aisle obstacle course on the mezzanine. It wasn't long before the coffee bar became one of those beloved and buzzy "Third Places" (after home and work), where customers and locals could serendipitously bump into familiar faces.
But Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, is no longer interested in having you hang out in that cafe. Two weeks ago, the company ripped out the Allegro Coffee Company's long white counter, tossed the stylish midcentury lounge chairs, and packed the space with as many refrigerators and shelving units as it could hold. Whole Foods' high-ceilinged ground floor is now a storage area for the chain's growing delivery business, and the big windows are obscured by brown bags of groceries.
Cafes come and go all the time, of course. And you can still find a small cafe and places to relax at the cluster of eateries on the Whole Foods grocery floor. Yet the reallocation of the store's valuable ground-floor space - from people-centered retail to a product-centered distribution area - is a harbinger in the supermarket business. It may be that the brief moment of quality urbanism represented by the Whole Foods cafe is already over.
The change in priorities isn't limited to Whole Foods. After decades of bemoaning its food deserts, Philadelphia, like many big cities, now finds itself flooded with new supermarkets. Giant, the Carlisle, Pa.-based food chain, is busy ringing Center City with megastores. Aldi, Sprouts, Save-a-lot, along with Giant's neighborhood-scaled Heirloom Market, are grabbing whatever real estate they can find, joining Philadelphia stalwarts like Acme and Thriftway. It looks as if a supermarket war is underway.
These are not supermarkets as we once knew them. The survivors will end up as hybrids, part retail, part distribution center, according to Brittain Ladd, a supply-chain consultant who previously helped Amazon craft its grocery-delivery strategy.
Giant already is setting up the perfect distribution network for deliveries, with new stores coming to key locations on the fringes of Center City: Columbus Boulevard in Pennsport, Broad and Washington, and the Schuylkill waterfront in the Logan Square neighborhood. According to a housing developer who asked not to be identified, Giant has been in talks for a fourth downtown location.
We should have seen this coming. We now have everything else delivered, why not food?
Initially, people resisted the idea of buying groceries online, Ladd told me, because they still like to "inspect and select" their food, especially perishable items like fruit, vegetables, and meat. But the comfort level has been growing, particularly as supermarkets reduce their delivery times.
Two years ago, only 1.5% of all supermarket customers ordered groceries online. Today, it's 5%. By 2025, Ladd predicts that 20% of customers will have their food delivered to their homes.
By turning its Fairmount cafe into a staging area for deliveries, Whole Foods is positioning itself for the coming competition. Both the Wynnewood and Cherry Hill stores also have removed tables in their cafes to create room to store prepacked groceries. Amazon promises to get your groceries to your door in under two hours, at no cost for Prime members.
What could those increased deliveries mean for cities?
Until now, most food distribution warehouses have been outside of urban areas, usually close to highways. But as competition among the supermarket chains heats up, Ladd says that chains will start to move their supply networks closer to their customers.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment, but that strategy would explain why the company turned a handsome former factory in a residential area at 41st and Chestnut into a distribution center. Ladd predicts that some of its smaller stores, such as the Whole Foods at 10th and South (what I call the "bodega Whole Foods" because it's so small), could end up being used exclusively as warehouses. If that happens, it would leave a dead zone in the middle of a pedestrian-friendly city block.
Right now, we're in a transitional period. Even though most customers still go to the store for their groceries, supermarkets have become crowded with hired pickers, who roam the aisles to fill online orders.
"It's the absolute worst idea," Ladd says. "People hate going to the stores because they block the aisles."
Ultimately, Ladd believes, supermarkets will stop selling anything besides perishable items. You might go to the grocery for a bag of greens or a fresh chicken, but things like canned goods, snacks, and paper products will be delivered. To make room for storing those items, supermarkets will start jettisoning more than just cafes.
We can already guess what the increase in deliveries will mean to Philadelphia's already congested streets: more traffic, more blocked buses, and interrupted bike lanes. One possible compensation: Fewer people will need to drive to the supermarket.
It's not too soon to start planning for a time when nearly all our goods are brought to us, instead of the other way around. Many new supermarkets are being designed with massive parking structures. The garage attached to the new Giant on 23rd Street is a five-story-high fortress sheathed in blank walls. There should be a way to design such spaces so they can be repurposed later as housing when that parking becomes unnecessary. (Of course, there are probably too many spaces now.)
But maybe the biggest concern is the way an all-delivery economy will change the way we interact with one another. In a recent essay, New York Times columnist Ginia Bellafante bemoaned the decline in small talk at her local Starbucks that has accompanied the introduction of an app that lets customers order remotely.
Honeygrow, Philadelphia's homegrown fast-casual restaurant, recently started installing ordering kiosks in local offices around the city. Place your lunch request by 11 a.m., it will be brought to your lobby by noon. That's one less reason to venture into the world.
By the way, Ladd also predicts a big shakeout in the number of fast-casual restaurants as more chains establish remote "cloud kitchens," where food is prepared off-site for deliveries. Those fast-casual chains have been giving life to the empty space left by retailers, who were done in by e-commerce.
There is no doubt that delivery services are a huge time-saver in our busy lives. But when we have fewer reasons to venture among people we don't know, or who are different from us, what will keep us from hunkering down in our silos even more than we do now? A small cafe may be more than a place to buy coffee. It could be the lifeline of our democratic society.

Panicked Dems flock to Bloomberg

Texto completo: When former Vice President Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential race last spring, he surged to the top of the Democratic polls with support from voters like Gina Seklecki, a corporate executive assistant from central Bucks County. She said she liked the 77-year-old's experience and thought "he would be the best to guide us out of this nightmare and begin repairing the massive damage being done every single day" by President Donald Trump.
But now Seklecki feels that Biden's been weakened by failing to respond forcefully to months of attacks from Team Trump about the business dealings of his son Hunter. Yet plans from his rivals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for All and universal college are too far left for her. Increasingly, Seklecki told me by email on Monday, she's moving toward a candidate who didn't show up in either Iowa or New Hampshire.
"Lately I find myself drawn to Mike Bloomberg," she said. "His policies are aligned enough with policies I support, especially on gun safety. His ads are scathing, yet dignified. His campaign brutally trolled Trump during the Oscars and it was perfectly executed. He's got the right temperament and experience to take Trump on and win. He is everything Trump wants to be, but will never be."
Improbably, incredibly, Michael Bloomberg - America's eighth-richest man, a former Republican who twice supported George W. Bush, running in a party thought to be moving left in income inequality - is surging out of nowhere toward the top of the 2020 Democratic field, emerging as the centrist rival to the new left-leaning front-runner, Sanders.
The 78-year-old Bloomberg seems to have "won" the Iowa caucuses and Tuesday night's New Hampshire primary with his unconventional strategy of sitting them out: By anticipating Biden's implosion before almost any of the cable-TV pundits did, and then by carpet-bombing March 3 Super Tuesday states like North Carolina and Virginia with ads while all the journalists were distracted by Iowa and the Democrats' tech meltdown, and while Biden, Sanders, and inexperienced newcomer Pete Buttigieg tear each other apart and the media erase Warren.
Why is this happening so suddenly? The Democrats' Iowa disaster came at the same time as Trump's impeachment acquittal, a Gallup poll (perhaps an outlier) showing surging approval for the president, and economic data that will give voters who don't care about the president's corruption, crudeness, or bigotry a rationale to vote Republican. Suddenly, an oligarch seems the only way to oust a dictator.
Affluent suburban voters - the ones who drove the Democratic takeback of the House in 2018 - are only part of the story. A Quinnipiac poll that showed Bloomberg spiking to 15% and third place, behind only Sanders (25%) and the fast-fading Biden (17%), also revealed that the New Yorker's heavy advertising on African American media and his backing from some prominent city leaders is winning major support from black voters.
Bloomberg's mind-boggling, Pentagon-size ad budget - $344 million and counting, or more than 10 times what Sanders has spent - might not work if he weren't selling a brand of cereal that a lot of Democrats are suddenly craving. Sure, he checks off the right boxes for the party faithful on climate and guns, but what voters seem to really like is his ruthless efficiency and his ability to take it to Trump as an in-your-face New Yorker who's an actual billionaire, not a fake one.
But here's what else the "I only care about winning" Bloomberg voters ought to consider: He might not be your best shot at winning.
If the party elites coalesce to hand the nomination to Bloomberg, or if - heaven forbid - the convention goes to a second ballot and so-called superdelegates put the billionaire past Sanders, Milwaukee might give Chicago 1968 a run for its money in the chaos-and-dysfunction department. And a lot of young or left-leaning voters will stay home Nov. 3.
But let's suppose Bloomberg gets the nomination without a Milwaukee brouhaha. The Trump campaign will have a field day rallying the president's Rust Belt, white, working-class base against a coastal elitist who wants to take away your gun and your Big Gulp.
And the ink hadn't dried yet on the Quinnipiac poll before black political thought leaders on Twitter like New York Times columnist Charles Blow began melting down over Bloomberg's reactionary record on racial issues - his unbroken support for occupation-style "stop-and-frisk" in black and brown neighborhoods, his fighting the lawsuit by the wrongly convicted Central Park Five, etc.
No, voters might trudge to their polling place in nine months forced to choose between a full-on authoritarian determined to keep the American presidency by cheating and demagoguery, or a billionaire who's buying the office, holding himself out as a benevolent philosopher-king. If it comes down to Bloomberg vs. Trump, I will hold my nose and vote for the man who won't let my grandchildren drown from climate change. But no matter who wins, the impossible mission of saving the American Experiment would begin on Nov. 4.

Texto completo: WHEN FORMER Vice President Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential race last spring, he surged to the top of the Democratic polls with support from voters like Gina Seklecki, a corporate executive assistant from central Bucks County. She said she liked the 77-year-old's experience and thought "he would be the best to guide us out of this nightmare and begin repairing the massive damage being done every single day" by President Trump.
But now Seklecki feels that Biden's been weakened by failing to respond forcefully to months of attacks from Team Trump about the business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden. Yet plans from his rivals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for All and universal college are too far left for her. Increasingly, Seklecki told me by email on Monday, she's moving toward a candidate who didn't show up in either Iowa or New Hampshire.
"Lately I find myself drawn to Mike Bloomberg," she said. "His policies are aligned enough with policies I support, especially on gun safety. His ads are scathing, yet dignified. His campaign brutally trolled Trump during the Oscars and it was perfectly executed. He's got the right temperament and experience to take Trump on and win. He is everything Trump wants to be, but will never be."
Improbably, incredibly, Michael Bloomberg - a former Republican who twice supported George W. Bush, America's eighth richest man, running in a party thought to be moving left in income inequality - is surging out of nowhere toward the top of the 2020 Democratic field, emerging as the centrist rival to the new left-leaning front-runner, Sanders.
The 78-year-old Bloomberg seems to have "won" the Iowa caucuses and Tuesday night's New Hampshire primary with his unconventional strategy of sitting them out. By anticipating Biden's implosion before almost any of the cable-TV pundits did, and then by carpet-bombing March 3 Super Tuesday states like North Carolina and Virginia with ads while all the journalists were distracted by Iowa and the Democrats' tech meltdown, and while Biden, Sanders, and inexperienced newcomer Pete Buttigieg tear each other apart and the media erases Warren.
Why is this happening so suddenly? The Democrats' Iowa disaster came at the same time as Trump's impeachment acquittal, a Gallup poll (perhaps an outlier) showing surging approval for the president, and economic data that will give voters who don't care about the president's corruption, crudeness, or bigotry a rationale to vote Republican. Suddenly, an oligarch seems the only way to oust a dictator.
Affluent suburban voters - the ones who drove the Democratic takeback of the House in 2018 - are only part of the story. A Quinnipiac poll that showed Bloomberg spiking to 15% and third place, behind only Sanders (25%) and the fast-fading Biden (17%) also revealed that the New Yorker's heavy advertising on African American media and his backing from some prominent city leaders is winning major support from black voters.
Bloomberg's mind-boggling Pentagon-sized ad budget - $344 million and counting, or more than 10 times what Sanders has spent - might not work if he weren't selling a brand of cereal that a lot of Democrats are suddenly craving. Sure, he checks off the right boxes for the party faithful on climate and guns, but what voters seem to really like is his ruthless efficiency and his ability to take it to Trump as an in-your-face New Yorker who's an actual billionaire, not a fake one.
But here's what else the "I only care about winning" Bloomberg voters ought to consider: He may not be your best shot at winning.
If the party elites coalesce to hand the nomination to Bloomberg, or if - heaven forbid - the convention goes to a second ballot and so-called superdelegates put the billionaire past Sanders, Milwaukee might give Chicago 1968 a run for its money in the chaos-and-dysfunction department. And a lot of young or left-leaning voters will stay home Nov. 3.
But let's suppose Bloomberg gets the nomination without a Milwaukee brouhaha. The Trump campaign will have a field day rallying the president's Rust Belt, white, working-class base against a coastal elitist who wants to take away your gun and your Big Gulp.
And the ink hadn't dried yet on the Quinnipiac poll before black political thought leaders on Twitter like New York Times columnist Charles Blow began melting down over Bloomberg's reactionary record on racial issues - his unbroken support for occupation-style "stop-and-frisk" in black and brown neighborhoods, his fighting the lawsuit by the wrongly convicted Central Park Five, etc.
No, voters might trudge to their polling place in nine months forced to choose between a full-on authoritarian determined to keep the American presidency by cheating and demagoguery, or a billionaire who's buying the office, holding himself out as a benevolent philosopher-king. If it comes down to Bloomberg vs. Trump, I will hold my nose and vote for the man who won't let my grandchildren drown from climate change. But no matter who wins, the impossible mission of saving the American Experiment would begin on Nov. 4.

Texto completo: After what was essentially another split decision in the quest for delegates, the Democratic presidential campaign appears headed for a long, drawn-out fight that could stretch into the summer.
A battle between the progressive and moderate wings of the party, as well as a newly flaring fight among the moderates themselves, has combined with changes to the Democratic nomination process to provide little hope a nominee will be determined any time soon.
“I think you might have a situation where there's a winner in May or June," said Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania who also served as chairman of the national Democratic Party.
That leaves candidates fighting among themselves — pointing out each other's flaws — while President Trump already is running a general election campaign focused on the flaws of his opponents.
Democrats are desperate to find the strongest candidate to defeat Trump, but if they hoped for clear answers out of New Hampshire's primary, they're out of luck. Muddled is the word many have used to describe this primary battle as it heads into the next phase with hardly more clarity than before voting began in Iowa on Feb. 3.
“For all intents and purposes you had a repeat of Iowa," Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist who advises progressive and labor groups, said of the New Hampshire results.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, won New Hampshire with 25.7 percent of the vote, trailed closely by former South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg with 24.4 percent, providing Sanders with the smallest margin of victory in the history of that state's Democratic primary.
Four years ago, he won that primary with 60 percent of the vote.
The outcome left one-time presumed front-runners, namely former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, struggling but vowing to soldier on. And underdog third-place finisher Amy Klobuchar suddenly has a chance.
“It's not so much a negative in itself; it's the absence of a positive," lamented Barney Frank, the former Democratic congressman from Newton, about the state of the effort to defeat Trump in November.
Frank, who supported Hillary Clinton four years ago, said the combined vote totals for Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Biden show that a majority of Democratic voters so far favor a more moderate candidate.
“[Sanders] represents what's clearly a minority faction among the Democrats, but because the others are doing more of a three-way, he has more of an advantage," Frank said.
Another looming factor is Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, who is targeting the contests that begin on Super Tuesday and has been blanketing those states with ads.
“Bloomberg is not going away. Bloomberg will do well enough on Super Tuesday to remain a strong factor," said Rendell, who has endorsed Biden.
The raw numbers of all important convention delegates tell the story of a race far from settled.
Sanders and Buttigieg each earned nine delegates from the New Hampshire primary, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar got six. That made the total after two contests Buttigieg, 22, Sanders, 21, Warren, 8, Klobuchar, 7, and Biden 6.
To put that in context, a candidate needs 1,990 pledged delegates to secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention. So the race has just begun. But voters typically look to the first two voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire for a sign of which candidate is the most viable.
More clarity could come on Super Tuesday, March 3, when 14 states, including Massachusetts, hold primaries and 1,357 delegates will be awarded.
The lack of a clear front-runner does nothing to solve the ideological tug-of-war in the Democratic Party between the progressive and moderate wings. While Sanders has taken the lead as the strongest progressive candidate at the moment, the race among the moderates appears to only be starting.
Bannon, who is not backing a candidate, said the only clarity so far is that Sanders will likely carry the progressive wing into the next phase of the nomination fight. Warren, who ran on a similar platform and surged over the summer and fall, underperformed in the first two contests.
Her campaign this week sought to minimize expectations, as did that of Biden, who has no plans of dropping out, his advisers said.
“No candidate has come close yet to receiving majority support among the Democratic primary electorate, and there is no candidate that has yet shown the ability to consolidate support," Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo to supporters on Tuesday, foreshadowing a long race.
Bannon said that could be problematic if no candidate has secured enough delegates for the nomination before the Democrats hold their convention this summer in Milwaukee.
“That means a lot of backroom infighting, a lot of deals cut in Milwaukee, and in the age of transparency, backroom deals are a bad thing," he said.
The Democrats' way of allocating the delegates is different from the Republicans' and draws out the process.
While Republicans allow states to allocate delegates on a winner-take-all basis, Democrats require delegates to be awarded proportionally to any candidate that earns more than 15 percent of the vote in a state primary or caucuses. So it takes longer for a Democratic candidate to earn the majority of delegates needed to secure the nomination.
On top of that, the Democratic National Committee made changes for 2020 that would further lengthen a close race, after complaints from Sanders and his supporters that the 2016 nominating process was tilted against his upstart candidacy.
In addition to the 3,979 delegates pledged to candidates based on how they do in primaries and caucuses, there are another approximately 770 superdelegates who can back whichever candidate they want. They are Democratic governors and members of Congress along with DNC members and some other party insiders.
Normally, those superdelegates can help swing the nomination to a candidate who is short of a majority of pledged delegates. But this year, those superdelegates have lost a lot of power.
A rule change prevents them from voting on the crucial first ballot in a convention where the nomination is contested. Some DNC members reportedly want to reverse the rule change and allow superdelegates to vote on a first ballot if no Democratic candidate has secured a majority of pledged delegates heading into the convention.
Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, said allowing the nomination process to play out slowly is healthy.
“I think the media is trying to anoint a nominee at this point when it's really still pretty early. And there's some really good candidates out there, there's still some viability for them, the moderate voices are strong, " he said Wednesday.
But Frank thinks all the division will ultimately help Bloomberg, who has set his sights on Trump, not other Democrats.
“This one guy who is acting as if 'let's worry about the final' is winning support and that's what you lose as long as the candidates have to differentiate themselves from each other. They have less energy and less attention from the voters to go after Trump," Frank said.
Trump, meanwhile, appears to be reveling in the Democrats' plight.
“They are all fighting each other, they are all going after each other, you have got them all over the place," he said at a raucous rally in Manchester, N.H., on Monday. “They don't know what the hell they're doing"

Texto completo: Who needs cheering up?
I do, apparently.
Some of you wrote after Sunday's column to urge me to get a handle on my despair. In the course of a piece on Elizabeth Warren — and the notion of electability, an issue that seems to hobble only her candidacy — I suggested that nobody could beat the corrupt autocrat in the Oval Office in November.
I agree, I was too certain in my dark thoughts. Even given the resilience of President Trump's cultish base, the GOP's structural electoral advantages, and their willingness to cheat their way to reelection, the vote is nine months away, for heaven's sake — a political lifetime.
Besides, defeatism is super unhelpful, and very possibly vote-discouraging.
And so, as tempting as it is to lament Warren's awful showing in New Hampshire, or more urgently, to freak out about the fact that the Department of Justice appears to be the lapdog of a lawless White House, today will not be about despair.
Instead, it will be about some possible antidotes, and some hardy souls still somehow wedded to hope.
The heartening fact is that not everybody who is horrified at our current predicament is curled up in the fetal position. A bunch of groups have sprung up to marshal volunteers and donations for candidates in close contests, to make sure every vote counts equally, to beat back gerrymandering, and to hold politicians' feet to the fire on issues like climate change.
A few such groups have started work in Massachusetts, this blue state where progressives don't have much to fight about close to home, but want to swing back the national tide. We may have more liberal angst per square mile than in any other state. It needs an outlet.
“I totally get the need for comforting," said Tom Mendelsohn, donor organizer for the Movement Voter Project, a national activist group headquartered in Northampton. “We're all feeling it. We try not to get caught up in the incessant noise around the very real and depressing news, but instead to think about the long arc bending towards justice."
More bending of that arc, please. And less long would be peachy.
The group raises money for local organizers to build engagement in their own communities and grow voting habits in places where turnout has been less reliable. They focus especially on those working in communities of color and with younger voters, particularly in five crucial states up for grabs this year: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona.
This cycle, MVP is hoping to raise and move $50 million into those communities, in hopes of fostering new groups of progressive voters who will be as devoted to casting ballots as, say, the denizens of a Florida retirement community.
And they'll do it with donations from all over the country, from people who seem grateful to have something to do with their frustration.
“We are letting people live their values," said Julie Gordon, one of the leaders of another group, Force Multiplier, based in Brookline, which raises money for MVP, Stacey Abrams's Fair Fight, and other groups, as well as for Democratic candidates in close contests.
“We're telling people, 'Yes you can do something,"' Gordon said. A former psychiatric social worker, she knows a little something about despair. Volunteering, or donating a few bucks, can really help a dejected voter feel less powerless, she said.
This country is sliding away from democratic values not just because of a reality TV star whose bigoted rants captured the hearts of less than half the nation, but because of years of grass-roots efforts by conservatives to capture electoral and legislative power at every level. Many of those efforts were years-long, and operated under the radar.
What MVP, Force Multiplier, and other progressive groups are doing is trying to catch up. Mendelsohn sees that effort going way beyond November.
“We're going to build a progressive decade, and hopefully our institutions don't take forever to rebuild," he said.
Will they at least be able to swing us back to sanity by November?
The likely truth is, sadly ... Oh right, I'm not doing despair today.

Climate Change Taking Blame For ‘really Worrying’ Population Slide

Texto completo: Behold the humble bumblebee.
Hot temperatures linked to climate change, especially extremes like heat waves, are contributing to the decline of these fuzzy and portly creatures, according to a new study in the journal Science.
Researchers found that bumblebee populations had recently declined by 46% in North America and by 17% across Europe when compared to a base period of 1901 to 1974. The biggest declines were in areas where temperatures spiked well beyond the historical range, which raises concerns that climate change could increase the risk of extinction for bees, which are already threatened by pesticide use and habitat loss.
“The scale of this decline is really worrying,” said Peter Soroye, a doctoral student in biology at the University of Ottawa and lead author of the study. “This group of organisms is such a critical pollinator in wild landscapes and agricultural regions.”
The common eastern bumblebee, or Bombus impatiens, for example, is an important pollinator in eastern North America. It’s also the species you’re most likely to encounter in your garden.
Researchers found that observations of the bee had declined significantly over the past century. Their conclusions are based on samples gathered from unique locations by museums. (One “observation” can represent a single bee in a location, or multiple bees; either way, a sign that a colony is present.)
An earlier study by Cornell University researchers found that Bombus impatiens were twice as effective at pollinating pumpkin patches as were European honeybees.
Another North American species, the yellow-banded bumblebee, or Bombus terricola, saw a much larger decline over the same time period.
The research built on the work of Jeremy T. Kerr, a biology professor at the University of Ottawa and a co-author on the study. He had previously amassed a bee database with more than 500,000 observations of 66 species across North America and Europe.
The counts provide rough evidence for the magnitude of decline among bumblebee species. In their final analysis, the researchers used statistical methods to account for sampling and detection variation.
Having more than a century of data also allowed them to look for signals of climate change in the bumblebee declines.
“We predicted that it would have to do with these extremes in temperatures - not just average temperatures from climate change, gradually increasing, or making things hotter, but kind of the wild swings in temperatures and heat waves,” Soroye said.
The bees were, indeed, hardest hit in places that had experienced these temperature spikes.
Bumblebees are one piece of the ecological networks threatened by climate change. “Bumblebees contribute to pollination services for a bunch of different plants - among them are things like tomatoes in greenhouses - but also a whole lot of other species in open-air agriculture,” Kerr said.
The bumblebees’ extra fuzz allows them to carry a lot of pollen on their bodies as they move from plant to plant in search of nectar. And, in North America, bumblebees are native pollinators, unlike honeybees, which were introduced mainly from Europe. Their tongue length (they can come in short, medium or long) and rapidly vibrating wings, which give bumblebees their characteristic buzzing sound, make them better than honeybees at pollinating certain plants, like sweet peppers and tomatoes, that are native to the Americas.
“These species used to be much more common,” Kerr said. “They are the ghosts from the childhoods of baby boomers in Europe and North America.”

Texto completo: POTTSVILLE - For many students, bullying is something that they have to deal with in addition to the normal curriculum of the school day and outside world, many times with pain and loneliness.
The cafeteria at Nativity BVM High School had many people attending a one-hour talk on the important subject of bullying on Tuesday evening from Jodee Blanco, one of the country’s pre-eminent voices on the subject, something that she speaks not only as an expert, but also as a survivor of bullying.
She is the author of The New York Times bestselling memoir “Please Stop Laughing At Me… One Woman’s Inspirational Story,” which chronicles her years as the student outcast and has inspired a movement among bullying victims everywhere of all ages - in middle and high schools, on college campuses, at the workplace and at home.
Blanco has been giving a series of presentations for parents and children at Catholic schools around the Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown. All programs are free and open to the public.
During her presentation, Blanco said parents must approach their children about bullying in ways that can be best understood to them, not necessarily as an adult would understand, referring to her own experiences.
“Every time a well-meaning grownup would say that to me, I would scream inside my head, ‘Who cares about why I don’t fit in? Who cares the reason why? I don’t want anymore dumb grownup explanations. All adults ever do is think and explain. I don’t want explanations, I want actions. Just tell me what to do so I can get invited to that party on Friday,’ ” Blanco said.
She added that the victims are told that they need to be better than the bullies, that they should rise above them and be better without expecting better behavior from the bullies.
“How come nobody ever expects the mean kids to rise above anything,” Blanco said. “Isn’t it bad enough we’re under all this pressure just going to have to go to school and hope we’re not going to get humiliated. Now on top of it, we have to rise above what is happening to us or at least pretend to, and if we don’t, we’re going to disappoint the adults on top of the kids not liking us. Why is all of that pressure on us and not them?”
According to the National Bullying Prevention Center:
-- More than one out of every five (20.8%) students report being bullied (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2016).
-- The federal government began collecting data on school bullying in 2005, when the prevalence of bullying was around 28% (U.S. Department of Education, 2015).
-- Rates of bullying vary across studies (from 9% to 98%). A meta-analysis of 80 studies analyzing bullying involvement rates (for both bullying others and being bullied) for 12-18-year-old students reported a mean prevalence rate of 35% for traditional bullying involvement and 15% for cyberbullying involvement.
-- Studies show that 33% of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that they were bullied at least once or twice a month during the school year.
-- Of those students who reported being bullied, 13% were made fun of, called names or insulted; 12% were the subject of rumors; 5% were pushed, shoved, tripped or spit on; and 5% were excluded from activities on purpose.
According to the Center for Disease Control, students who are bullied are more likely to experience low self-esteem and isolation, perform poorly in school, have few friends in school, have a negative view of school, experience physical symptoms, such as headaches, stomach aches or problems sleeping and to experience mental health issues, such as depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.
The CDC also reports that youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance use, academic problems and experiencing violence later in adolescence and adulthood. Youth who bully others and are bullied themselves suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for mental health and behavioral problems.
Blanco said that compassion and understanding must also expand to the bullies who may be acting out from the problems and situations they may be facing in their own lives.
“Work in partnership with the school to answer your child’s bully’s cry for help,” Blanco said. “You’re setting an example for your child of what compassion and forgiveness and tolerance is, and you may be saving the life of that bully, too.”
Nativity Principal Lynn Sabol said after the program that earlier in the day, Blanco spoke to the student body, and afterward to the faculty. On Monday, Blanco spoke to the students at Assumption BVM School in Pottsville.

Texto completo: Behold the humble bumblebee.
Hot temperatures linked to climate change, especially extremes like heat waves, are contributing to the decline of these fuzzy and portly creatures, according to a new study in the journal Science.
Researchers found that bumblebee populations had recently declined by 46% in North America and by 17% across Europe when compared to a base period of 1901 to 1974. The biggest declines were in areas where temperatures spiked well beyond the historical range, which raises concerns that climate change could increase the risk of extinction for bees, which are already threatened by pesticide use and habitat loss.
“The scale of this decline is really worrying,” said Peter Soroye, a doctoral student in biology at the University of Ottawa and lead author of the study. “This group of organisms is such a critical pollinator in wild landscapes and agricultural regions.”
The common eastern bumblebee, or Bombus impatiens, for example, is an important pollinator in eastern North America. It’s also the species you’re most likely to encounter in your garden.
Researchers found that observations of the bee had declined significantly over the past century. Their conclusions are based on samples gathered from unique locations by museums. (One “observation” can represent a single bee in a location, or multiple bees; either way, a sign that a colony is present.)
An earlier study by Cornell University researchers found that Bombus impatiens were twice as effective at pollinating pumpkin patches as were European honeybees.
Another North American species, the yellow-banded bumblebee, or Bombus terricola, saw a much larger decline over the same time period.
The research built on the work of Jeremy T. Kerr, a biology professor at the University of Ottawa and a co-author on the study. He had previously amassed a bee database with more than 500,000 observations of 66 species across North America and Europe.
The counts provide rough evidence for the magnitude of decline among bumblebee species. In their final analysis, the researchers used statistical methods to account for sampling and detection variation.
Having more than a century of data also allowed them to look for signals of climate change in the bumblebee declines.
“We predicted that it would have to do with these extremes in temperatures - not just average temperatures from climate change, gradually increasing, or making things hotter, but kind of the wild swings in temperatures and heat waves,” Soroye said.
The bees were, indeed, hardest hit in places that had experienced these temperature spikes.
Bumblebees are one piece of the ecological networks threatened by climate change. “Bumblebees contribute to pollination services for a bunch of different plants - among them are things like tomatoes in greenhouses - but also a whole lot of other species in open-air agriculture,” Kerr said.
The bumblebees’ extra fuzz allows them to carry a lot of pollen on their bodies as they move from plant to plant in search of nectar. And, in North America, bumblebees are native pollinators, unlike honeybees, which were introduced mainly from Europe. Their tongue length (they can come in short, medium or long) and rapidly vibrating wings, which give bumblebees their characteristic buzzing sound, make them better than honeybees at pollinating certain plants, like sweet peppers and tomatoes, that are native to the Americas.
“These species used to be much more common,” Kerr said. “They are the ghosts from the childhoods of baby boomers in Europe and North America.”

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, N.H. — Andrew Yang, a Democratic businessman who campaigned on giving every adult American a monthly check for $1,000, will end his campaign for president after a disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary.
"I am a numbers guy," Yang said in an interview before addressing supporters at Manchester’s Puritan Backroom. "In most of these [upcoming] states, I’m not going to be at a threshold where I get delegates, which makes sticking around not necessarily helpful or productive in terms of furthering the goals of this campaign."
Yang said he had not decided whether to endorse another candidate, though campaigns have reached out.
Meanwhile, Michael Bennet, the Colorado senator and former public school superintendent, is ending his campaign for the presidency, he said.
Bennet’s exit comes on the night of the New Hampshire primary, after he said he needed to finish in the top three or four to continue.
"I’ve got to do well here," Bennet said on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" on Monday. "I bet it all on New Hampshire."
Andrew Yang "If I become persuaded that there’s a particular candidate that gives us a superior chance of beating Donald Trump, and I think it’s important to make that opinion known, then I would consider it for sure," Yang said.
He also said he would be open to becoming another candidate’s running mate or joining a presidential Cabinet.
Yang launched his campaign in November 2017 and was soon dubbed a "longer-than-long-shot" by the New York Times. Yang would often invoke that same phrase with glee on the campaign trail, and on his merchandise, as he polled higher and raised more money than many better-known candidates.
Michael Bennet Bennet’s final push through New Hampshire included 50 town halls in the last 10 weeks leading up to the primary, a tour in which he touted himself, a moderate Democrat, as someone who could defeat President Donald Trump.
Bennet, 55, entered the race last May, a decision he made after successfully undergoing surgery for prostate cancer. First elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008, he touted his track record of working with Republicans and winning elections in Colorado, a "purple state."

How Trump got trickled down

Texto completo: One thing many people forget about the 2016 election is that as a candidate, Donald Trump promised to be a different kind of Republican. Unlike the mainstream of his party, he declared, he would raise taxes on the rich and wouldn't cut programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that ordinary Americans rely on. At the same time, he would invest large sums in rebuilding America's infrastructure.
He was lying.
Trump's only major legislative achievement, the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, was absolutely standard modern Republicanism: huge tax cuts for corporations, plus tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy. The only unconventional aspect of the legislation was the variety of new tax scams it made possible, like the benefits for investors in "opportunity zones," which were supposed to help poor communities but have actually enriched billionaire real estate developers.
Trump also came very close to passing a health care "reform" that would have imposed savage cuts on Medicaid, eliminated protections for those with preexisting conditions and taken away health insurance from more than 30 million Americans.
And there has, of course, been no infrastructure bill; in fact, the Trump administration's repeated proclamations of "Infrastructure Week" have become a running joke.
Policy wonks are still poring over the latest Trump budget, released on Monday, but there was no hiding the same reverse Robin-Hoodism as in previous budgets: taking from the poor and middle class while giving to the rich.
In other words, Trump in practice, as opposed to Trump in pretense, has turned out to be every bit as committed to trickle-down economics as Republicans in Congress have been for decades.
People often say that Trump has captured the GOP, which is true as far as things like rule of law and support for democracy are concerned. But it's equally true that the GOP has captured Trump when it comes to domestic policy.
The only difference between Trumpism and the proposals of Paul Ryan in his heyday is that the Trump administration - having blown up the budget deficit from less than $600 billion to more than $1 trillion - has pretty much given up even claiming to care about government debt. Back in the day, Ryan called debt an "existential threat"; a few days ago Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that rising deficits aren't a concern as long as they help boost the economy.
The economic good news of recent years - not as good as Trump claims, but the economy has indeed been strong - largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under Barack Obama, Republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under Trump.
But while Trump is willing to run trillion-dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, he's as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate. The grand plan to repeal Obamacare fell just short, but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in Medicaid compared with current law.
But why has Trump turned out to be such a conventional Republican? My sense is that he doesn't really care about policy, aside from protectionism, which I'll get to in a minute. And he certainly doesn't feel any empathy for less fortunate Americans, or actually anyone. So he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the Republican establishment: You get to implement your usual policy agenda, and I get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power.
The one place where Trump has deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war. But why is he a self-proclaimed Tariff Man?
The supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back U.S. manufacturing. If that were really his motivation, he failed: Amid a generally strong economy, we're experiencing a manufacturing recession, and estimates from the Federal Reserve suggest that Trump's tariffs, which have raised business costs, have actually reduced manufacturing employment.
My guess, however, is that Trump's trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy. And while establishment Republicans headed off any important changes in NAFTA, which would have been really bad for business - Trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it - they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other, less critical fronts.
The question now is whether Trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises. Democrats took the House in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy Obamacare. But there's a real danger that Democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious ideas like so-called Medicare for All that are unlikely to become reality, rather than on Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy programs Americans love.

Texto completo: One of the nation's magazine giants is doubling down on its Hollywood ambitions, part of a growing effort by publishers to convert print stories into documentaries, movies or TV shows.
Condé Nast Entertainment, the production and video arm of Condé Nast, said it is launching five branded studios built around Condé Nast's best-known magazines: Vanity Fair, Wired, GQ, Vogue and the New Yorker.
The move comes as entertainment companies including Walt Disney Co., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. are racing to develop new shows for their recently launched or coming streaming services. Collectively, streaming platforms are expected to spend $30 billion annually on content in the U.S. alone by 2024, according to GroupM's Brian Wieser—an explosion of new offerings that will keep fueling demand for original content.
For Condé Nast Entertainment, the goal is to create a pipeline of material to feed that demand. "Studios can't get enough intellectual property for the streaming wars," said Oren Katzeff, the head of Condé Nast Entertainment.
Other media companies including New York Times Co., Vox Media Inc., Meredith Corp. and BuzzFeed Inc., are also producing video content. Vox is making shows for Netflix, the Times launched a documentary series on Hulu and FX, while Meredith is leveraging its biggest brand, People magazine, into a half-hour show that will air in prime-time on the company's roster of TV stations starting this fall.
Condé Nast Entertainment's most recent feature film, "City of a Million Soldiers," is set to come out in theaters in June. The project started with "The Desperate Battle to Destroy ISIS," a 2017 New Yorker article about the battle for Mosul.
"We read it when it came out at the time of publication and were impressed by how cinematic and humanistic the story was," said Mike Larocca, president of AGBO Films, a Los Angeles-based entertainment company that served as the movie's lead production entity and financier. "Even though it's set in a part of the world that the audience may not know that much about, we felt it was accessible."

What do you think publishers like Condé Nast could do to be successful in the production space? Join the conversation below.
He expects the movie's association with the New Yorker Studio to give it a greater cachet and recognition. "It's a prestige brand and speaks to a level of quality," Mr. Larocca said.
Mr. Katzeff said the decision to launch five studios tied directly to five of Condé Nast's best-known magazines is meant to generate greater involvement by each magazine's senior editors who know those stories best, which should help Condé Nast create more content at a faster rate.
Mr. Katzeff, who took over Condé Nast Entertainment in late 2018, has struck deals with Whalerock Industries, a Los Angeles-based TV production and digital media company, and talent agency WME, a unit of Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. that will provide access to deal makers and package CNE's stories.
CNE's five new studios already have a slate of projects under way, including two potential films based on Vanity Fair stories. One focuses on Thomas Gilbert Sr., a hedge-fund founder murdered by his son; the other a story about fake antique furniture.
"This is a brand famous for longform narrative storytelling, one that naturally embraces the stories we're seeing in scripted series, limited series, and documentaries," said Radhika Jones, editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair. "We haven't had the keys to unlock the chest. This is an effort to arm us with those keys."
CNE previously sold two series to Netflix, including "Fastest Car," about quarter-mile racing, and the football docuseries "Last Chance U."
Condé Nast Entertainment already generates about $200 million in annual revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman declined to comment. Condé Nast is owned by closely held Advance Publications Inc.
Roger Lynch, Condé Nast's chief executive who earlier in his career ran Dish Network Corp.'s internet-based SlingTV, said he expects Condé Nast Entertainment to become a $1 billion business, although he hasn't set a target date.
Mr. Lynch said Condé Nast has 1,800 journalists in 31 markets producing content, which should give it an edge with streaming services that need local content for local audiences as they expand internationally. "We can provide that," he said.
Condé Nast's diversification effort comes as publishers are looking for new revenue streams at a time when print advertising and newsstand revenue continues to deteriorate, while new digital advertising spending is dominated by such tech giants as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Disney, AT&T, Apple Inc. and Comcast are among the companies that have recently launched or are about to launch new streaming services, competing with more established players such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video.
"The stakes are much higher," media consultant David J. Fishman said. "This is about publishers placing their content in the premiere position it should have been in all along."
Some media companies have invested significantly in developing their own production facilities, while others have in-house capabilities for short-form video but typically need to join with production companies or Hollywood studios for larger projects.
Vox Media Studios, a division of Vox Media Inc. which has sold several series to Netflix, including Vox's "Explained," has invested in production facilities in New York and Los Angeles, enabling it to hire line producers, rent trucks and edit in its offices.
The New York Times last year partnered with an outside production company when it launched the video documentary series "The Weekly." "We didn't want to reinvent the wheel," said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor responsible for audio, film, TV projects and other digital initiatives.
Meredith, the country's largest magazine publisher, is focusing on creating original TV programming from some of its biggest brands, including People and Southern Living, and is rolling those shows out across its own group of 17 TV stations. The media company is using its own in-house facilities to produce that programming.
"PeopleTV" will debut this fall Monday through Friday in prime time, with Meredith actively trying to syndicate it to other TV station groups. "We've got our own platform to create content," said a Meredith spokesman. Selling content from its magazines to streaming services is a lesser priority, he said.

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - The relentless whir of machines echoing across a cavernous French factory floor is an unexpected result of the deadly virus that has nearly paralyzed cities in China and other parts of Asia.
The company, Kolmi Hopen, makes an item that is suddenly one of the world's hottest commodities: the medical face mask.
The factory typically makes around 170 million masks a year, but in the last week orders arrived for a staggering half-billion, flooding the sales department's inboxes at the rate of one every two minutes. Kolmi Hopen is racing to hire more workers to keep the machines running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
"We're making masks as fast as we can," said Guillaume Laverdure, chief operating officer of Kolmi Hopen's parent company, Canada-based Medicom, as forklift drivers moved boxes of freshly finished masks into trucks.
"But demand is still rising," he added.
The coronavirus outbreak has set off a run on protective masks across China and in major cities. To curb the spread of the virus, the Chinese government has ordered citizens to don masks every time they go outside. Medical professionals said once used, a mask must be replaced with a fresh one, driving an explosion in demand. Grim scenes of people lined up for hours to get a protective face covering, only to be turned away when pharmacies run out, have become familiar.
"I can't find a single mask to buy," said Sandy Lo, 60, in Hong Kong. "I don't know what stores have stock anymore." She said she reuses old masks "because what else could I do?"
Most of the world's face masks are made in China and Taiwan. But factories there, including ones run by Medicom, have been forced to temporarily halt exports to comply with government demands to reserve them for frantic residents.
Last week, the Chinese government, conceding it was in urgent need of medical masks and other protective gear, said it would begin importing them from Europe, Japan and the United States to help make up for the shortfall.
It has made the Kolmi Hopen outpost in western France an unlikely hot spot. Phones at the factory have been ringing off the hook as medical supply buyers scour the globe for mask-makers.
Demand is especially strong for high-filtration respiratory masks, which can be more effective against the spread of virus-laden droplets than surgical masks, Laverdure said. Laverdure declined to discuss financial details, including the cost of the masks.
Scientists said there isn't much evidence that masks actually protect healthy people - hand washing may be more important.
Still, as the coronavirus spreads, with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths, experts fear that supplies of face masks and other sanitary protection items will run low in other countries - even for routine medical use. Pharmacies in the United States have begun reporting shortages.
The frenzy of orders at Kolmi Hopen shows the large-scale disruption China can create in the global supply chain for even the most specialized products, if factories there fail to operate at full strength.
China produces about half the world's sanitary face masks - around 20 million a day, supplying hospitals and medical workers in numerous countries. Taiwan makes up another 20% of the global supply.

Savages' Jehnny Beth enters ring

Texto completo: For the past nine years, Jehnny Beth has been known as the frontwoman of the ferocious post-punk band Savages. She's a live wire with a slick pixie cut and arresting onstage persona.
And when she made the decision to make a solo album in 2016, she was warned it was "a big mistake." It proved to be exactly the encouragement she needed.
"When people are telling you that you're making a mistake, it's usually because you're seeing something that they haven't seen yet," she said over coffee on a crisp December afternoon, following her workout at a boxing club in West Hollywood, California.
Minutes earlier, sweat poured from her short, black hair as she cursed a final set of burpees. Although she's based in her native France, Jehnny Beth discovered boxing in 2018 while working in Los Angeles on what turned into her solo debut, "To Love Is to Live," due May 8, and toying with a role in an action movie, which she eventually turned down.
"Boxing is the closest thing I have to the stage," she said as she slid a collection of spiky silver rings back on her fingers. "It's the closest I am to the physical intensity, the adrenaline, the fear."
Jehnny Beth (real name: Camille Berthomier), 35, has performed live only twice since July 2017, when Savages concluded a world tour in support of their second album, "Adore Life." As the band's lead singer, she was as tender and angry as a bruise, delivering songs with an alluring intensity that earned comparisons to Ian Curtis and P.J. Harvey.
She called Savages, which features guitarist Gemma Thompson, bassist Ayse Hassan and drummer Fay Milton, "a gang against the world."
A close friend, Romy Madley Croft of the English indie-pop trio the xx, recalled the power of seeing Savages for the first time at Coachella in 2013. "Jehnny transported me," Madley Croft said in a phone interview. "I was in the desert in the middle of the afternoon, but I felt like I was in a dark club."
Jehnny Beth said: "I never really wanted to give a statement about Savages and if we're coming back. If I feel like I want to do a punk record again, I'll probably do it with Savages. It's a great band with a soul, and that's quite rare."
Jehnny Beth hadn't planned to branch out on her own. She was startled into action in January 2016, when she woke up in the middle of the night and learned that David Bowie had died. She stirred her longtime partner and producer, Johnny Hostile, and the two stayed up until morning listening to Bowie's final studio album, "Blackstar."
" 'Blackstar' had a huge influence in terms of reminding me how an album can be a testament, an imprint of your vision of the world, and it will last longer than you will," she said. It inspired her to work on the solo album "as if I was going to die."
"To Love Is to Live" is an eerie, almost cinematic experience, partially inspired by Spike Lee's "25th Hour" and French noir films, and helped along by Johnny Hostile, who projected scenes from movies, including "Dunkirk," on the walls of the studio as they wrote, a technique he employed while helming both Savages albums.
Jehnny Beth also tapped producer Flood (U2, New Order) and Nine Inch Nails' Atticus Ross to give the album an intriguing sonic dissonance.
Its first single, "I'm the Man," opens with a gentle recitation of Jehnny Beth's poem "A Place Above" by "Peaky Blinders" star Cillian Murphy ("See the most powerful man raise his hand to tell us a lie/ No, no, not another lie") before exploding into a full-blown electronic assault.
Madley Croft, who helped write two of the album's songs and served as a sounding board, praised Jehnny Beth's genre experiments, which include android vocal stylings, melancholic saxophones and a piano ballad. "You get to know her a lot more on this album," Madley Croft said. "I'm really glad she's harnessed that energy from Savages, but I could see that there was so much stuff in her mind that she wanted to get out."
The night after her boxing workout, Jehnny Beth drove us in her rented black Mustang to join her friend and sometimes-collaborator Nick Zinner, of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, at their favorite haunt, Jumbo's Clown Room, a no-nudity bikini bar in Hollywood where a pre-stardom Courtney Love used to pole dance.
The two musicians frowned at a group of guys flicking balled-up dollar bills at one of the women, and over a glass of seltzer (she no longer drinks alcohol), Jehnny Beth explained that the album's centerpiece "Flower" was written for one of the bar's regular performers. The track's lyrical agony is worthy of Anne Sexton, and the sultry thrum of the chorus -- "She loves me and I love her/ I'm not sure how to please her" -- recalls Portishead's 1994 masterpiece "Dummy."
"I really wanted to do a love song for a woman," said Jehnny Beth, who is bisexual and said she had difficulty expressing her desires when she was younger. "To me, women were in the distance," she added, "so it's been liberating to write about them."
Growing up in Poitiers, a city in western France, Jehnny Beth learned English by singing jazz standards performed by Billie Holiday and Jane Baker. At 10, she introduced more contemporary music into the household, becoming an ardent fan of the band Placebo. Once, at a concert, she threw a treasured copy of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" at its frontman, Brian Molko, accidentally hitting his guitar. He chastised her from the stage, a detail that made it into several newspaper articles, all of which she saved.
Jehnny Beth met Johnny Hostile in her early 20s, through mutual friends. The unorthodox "h" in Jehnny is intended as a mirror reflection of Johnny (real name: Nicolas Conge). She moved to London with him, despite her parents' warning that she was making a mistake, and the pair have been writing music together ever since, beginning in 2006 with their lo-fi indie collaboration John & Jehn.
"It's not easy," she said of their fertile creative partnership, "but that doesn't mean it's hard." While at Jumbo's, she got a text from him saying he thought she would dig one of the evening's dancers, who mesmerized the crowd by gyrating while using sign language for the chorus to Aerosmith's "Dream On."
Jehnny Beth even came to Savages via Johnny Hostile, who had been invited to start a band by Gemma Thompson. With the group on an unspecified hiatus, she has continued to evolve into a multihyphenate talent. "I was Jehnny Beth before Savages," she added. "I always knew I was going to do other things."
In February, she will host a TV talk show called "Echoes With Jehnny Beth" for a European channel that will expand the idea of her Beats 1 radio program, "Start Making Sense," by prompting conversations between musical guests. In June, she will release a book of erotic short stories that began as a poetry collection before she made the rare decision to heed a critic. "Polly Jean Harvey told me my poetry was awful," she said and laughed.
"I like doing things that are scary," she added, and credited boxing for helping her make brave career choices. "Once you take a step, in spite of your fear, you realize: This is not how I imagined it would be, but it's exactly how I want it to be."

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
"I was not doing well emotionally," she recalled. "Physically, I didn't have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn't getting to work."
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn't seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, "Mommy needs an intervention."
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician -- a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels "full of spirit" and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. "She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don't do anymore," Poskanzer said. "And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of."
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what's most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can't easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation's older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. "It's basically stagnation," said Aldis Petriceks, the study's lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
"These are smart people looking at economic reality," said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. "Having patience, having good communication skills, it's a different personality than being a surgeon," Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true "when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85," said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
"She's had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another," said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. "I thought, 'Let's see if there's a way to make her life easier.' "
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
"It's less of 'Let's order this med, let's order that procedure,' more of a holistic approach," Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, "we're not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians," Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they're also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as "a small, elite workforce" who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
"The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues" understand these patients' needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.

Texto completo: "Cheating is baseball's oldest profession. No other game is so rich in skulduggery, so suited to it or so proud of it," longtime Washington Post sports writer Thomas Boswell once wrote. A new baseball season begins this week with spring training, and the top story will undoubtedly be the recent cheating scandal that has roiled the sport.
This winter it was revealed that the Houston Astros, who won the 2017 World Series and nearly won the 2019 World Series, employed high-resolution cameras and monitors to capture signs. The Astros frequently used players banging on a garbage can in the dugout to notify batters (no bang -- fastball, bang -- off-speed pitch), and there is a suggestion that some Astro hitters wore buzzers to receive in-game pitch communications. The Boston Red Sox, winners of the 2018 World Series, were also implicated along with several other teams.
An early, low-tech version of the same sign-stealing technique may have accounted for what is arguably the most dramatic home run in baseball history. In the 1951 playoffs, New York Giants third baseman Bobby Thomson launched a come-from-behind, ninth-inning line drive homer to win the National League pennant off a fastball thrown by Brooklyn Dodgers relief pitcher Ralph Branca. The episode was memorably captured by Giants radio announcer Russ Hodges with his legendary call, "The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!"
Four decades later, it was revealed that the Giants had been stealing opposing catchers' signs during the 1951 season. The signs were captured by a spy with a telescope in center field, who then relayed them via a buzzer system to the team's dugout. Late in life, Thomson denied receiving a sign on the home run pitch he hit that fateful October afternoon; Branca insisted that Thomson knew a fastball was coming. Before they both died, the two men became fast friends, but their disagreement over the home run was never resolved. No one was ever disciplined.
Stealing a pitcher's signs, when done by players or coaches on the field, is not only legitimate, it is expected, occasionally admired. What's changed is the emergence of electronic communication with high-tech devices, most of which are being banned from the dugout. But extremely high-resolution cameras can't be banned from the stands and remain available for cheating. And as Boswell observed, cheating is part of baseball.
And cheating works, if only for getting into the head of the opposition. Arizona Diamondbacks catcher Stephen Vogt told The New York Times, "As a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn't even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team."
In the current scandal, punishments were meted out -- but not for players. The general manager and field manager of the Astros were suspended for a season by Major League Baseball and then fired by the team. The field manager of the Red Sox -- a bench coach for the 2017 Astros who helped mastermind their scheme -- was let go by Boston.
Is there a solution? Major League Baseball can rewrite the rules and tighten surveillance, but the cat-and-mouse games with resourceful teams will continue. The best chance of preventing electronic cheating is to hand out severe punishment for teams and players who are caught: a minimum five-year ban from baseball for any players, coaches or front office personnel engaged in electronic cheating. Long enough to ruin a career.
To realize how important stiff penalties are to prevent cheating, consider gambling in baseball. The deterrence of lifetime suspensions for the eight players involved in the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal was quite effective. After that, baseball had no major gambling issues for more than 60 years until Pete Rose started betting on games.
At the next collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the Players Association, after the 2021 season, the requisite levels of evidence, appeals and due process for electronic cheating should be part of the negotiations so that guilty players can be disciplined. Like the prohibition on gambling posted in every clubhouse, the rules outlining what is not permitted in terms of sign stealing should be as well.
The ethos of baseball was once explained by former Milwaukee Brewers manager George Bamberger, who told The Washington Post, "We do not play baseball. We play professional baseball. Amateurs play games. We are paid to win games. There are rules, and there are consequences if you break them. If you are a pro, then you often don't decide whether to cheat based on if it's 'right or wrong.' You base it on whether or not you can get away with it, and what the penalty might be."
In baseball, that risk-reward has generally been on the side of breaking the rules; to change that equation, the consequences must be stiff, career-threatening penalties. Undoing past damage may be impossible, but going forward there is a way to deter cheaters. Hit them where they live.

20 reds under $20: Good value, for now

Texto completo: The wine world looks a little different now than it did in September, when the last 20 Under $20 column was published, and further radical changes may be on the way.
That's why this winter edition of 20 great values in red wine, all under $20 a bottle, may be a mural in watercolors, fated to fade quickly should an ill rain blow in.
The source of the volatility is tariffs placed by the United States on certain European wines. As of Oct. 18, the Trump administration put a 25% tax on wines under 14% alcohol from France, Spain and Germany, excluding sparkling wine. The tariff is a result of a dispute with the European Union over subsidies it gives to Airbus, its largest airplane manufacturer.
The administration has further threatened a 100% tariff on all wines from the European Union, as well as certain cheeses, spirits and other consumer goods, if the Airbus dispute is not resolved. Because of a French tax on big technology companies, a similar tariff has been threatened solely on Champagne. Though that one has been set aside, the wider tariff threat still looms.
The effects of the 25% tariff are already apparent, particularly on French wines. The value of wine imported from France dropped steeply after the tariff took effect, to roughly $57 million in November from about $130 million in October, according to the American Association of Wine Economists.
Producers, importers, distributors and retailers absorbed much of the price difference at first, and consumers did not see prices rise noticeably in the last quarter of 2019, the busiest time of the year for the wine trade.
In January, however, prices began to increase. What's more, some importers have held off on new orders of wines, both in hopes that the first tariff would be resolved and out of fear that the next round might come midshipment.
I have long argued that the best values are found in the historic wine cultures of Europe. The astounding diversity of choices far exceeds what's available in the United States, where a handful of grapes dominate. But this list includes only two wines from France, ordinarily a prime source for distinctive wine values.
Italy is still in the game with six bottles; that will change if the new tariff comes to pass. It will also affect selections from Spain, Portugal, Austria and Greece, which account for another six wines on the list.
Luckily, I found good bottles from Chile, Argentina and South Africa, all of which consumers may soon be exploring in greater depth. And I found three terrific wines from the United States.
The potential reduction in choices is a serious concern for consumers, but it pales next to the grievous harm such a tariff would do to jobs and businesses, including importers, distributors, retailers and restaurants, along with affiliated support workers, not to mention the wine producers themselves. If these companies that do so much to provide choices were to disappear, I'm not sure we would ever again see the wines they once procured.
Right now, however, the market is still full of options. These 20 bottles represent just a snapshot of what's out there. If you don't see these precise bottles, ask your merchant for similar choices, or you can consult previous 20 Under $20 columns.
You might see that prices for previous selections have risen. Nonetheless, they all remain pretty good values.

Coronavirus: Is China giving us all the facts?

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2.5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I.
Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: "Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1% every day since Jan. 30. 'This magical virus is very good at math!' I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime's rule. ... I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line."
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials lying, but perhaps they're telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what's going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what's really happening, as opposed to what underlings are reporting to their superiors.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
It's a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities' position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there's no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there's no way for the people at the top to know whether they're being told the truth.
Healthy systems of organization ensure that bad news can always flow from the bottom to the top. Systems that don't do this become increasingly disconnected from reality and unstable.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I'd be worried.
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get. Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can't always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they're doing, it looks like they're pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China's already sluggish economy, suggests something serious. At the same time though, China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don't need the help, or because they have secrets they'd rather keep? For now, there's no way to know.
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we'll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let's hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won't be too expensive.

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - The relentless whir of machines echoing across a cavernous French factory floor is an unexpected result of the deadly virus that has nearly paralyzed cities in China and other parts of Asia.
The company, Kolmi Hopen, makes an item that is suddenly one of the world's hottest commodities: the medical face mask.
The factory typically makes around 170 million masks a year, but in the last week orders arrived for a staggering half-billion, flooding the sales department's inboxes at the rate of one every two minutes. Kolmi Hopen is racing to hire more workers to keep the machines running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
"We're making masks as fast as we can," said Guillaume Laverdure, chief operating officer of Kolmi Hopen's parent company, Canada-based Medicom, as forklift drivers moved boxes of freshly finished masks into trucks.
"But demand is still rising," he added.
The coronavirus outbreak has set off a run on protective masks across China and in major cities. To curb the spread of the virus, the Chinese government has ordered citizens to don masks every time they go outside. Medical professionals said once used, a mask must be replaced with a fresh one, driving an explosion in demand. Grim scenes of people lined up for hours to get a protective face covering, only to be turned away when pharmacies run out, have become familiar.
"I can't find a single mask to buy," said Sandy Lo, 60, in Hong Kong. "I don't know what stores have stock anymore." She said she reuses old masks "because what else could I do?"
Most of the world's face masks are made in China and Taiwan. But factories there, including ones run by Medicom, have been forced to temporarily halt exports to comply with government demands to reserve them for frantic residents.
Last week, the Chinese government, conceding it was in urgent need of medical masks and other protective gear, said it would begin importing them from Europe, Japan and the United States to help make up for the shortfall.
It has made the Kolmi Hopen outpost in western France an unlikely hot spot. Phones at the factory have been ringing off the hook as medical supply buyers scour the globe for mask-makers.
Demand is especially strong for high-filtration respiratory masks, which can be more effective against the spread of virus-laden droplets than surgical masks, Laverdure said. Laverdure declined to discuss financial details, including the cost of the masks.
Scientists said there isn't much evidence that masks actually protect healthy people - hand washing may be more important.
Still, as the coronavirus spreads, with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths, experts fear that supplies of face masks and other sanitary protection items will run low in other countries - even for routine medical use. Pharmacies in the United States have begun reporting shortages.
The frenzy of orders at Kolmi Hopen shows the large-scale disruption China can create in the global supply chain for even the most specialized products, if factories there fail to operate at full strength.
China produces about half the world's sanitary face masks - around 20 million a day, supplying hospitals and medical workers in numerous countries. Taiwan makes up another 20% of the global supply.

Coronavirus: Is China giving us all the facts?

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2.5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I.
Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: "Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1% every day since Jan. 30. 'This magical virus is very good at math!' I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime's rule. ... I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line."
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials lying, but perhaps they're telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what's going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what's really happening, as opposed to what underlings are reporting to their superiors.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
It's a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities' position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there's no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there's no way for the people at the top to know whether they're being told the truth.
Healthy systems of organization ensure that bad news can always flow from the bottom to the top. Systems that don't do this become increasingly disconnected from reality and unstable.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I'd be worried.
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get. Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can't always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they're doing, it looks like they're pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China's already sluggish economy, suggests something serious. At the same time though, China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don't need the help, or because they have secrets they'd rather keep? For now, there's no way to know.
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we'll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let's hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won't be too expensive.

Texto completo: HADDONFIELD – When Stephanie and Stephen Scibal were approached about appearing on HGTV's "Beachfront Bargain Hunt," they had one caveat for producers: An extra house hunter could arrive at any moment.
Stephanie was 38 weeks pregnant with the Stratford couple's first child when they filmed their episode in Ocean City last September.
"We were like, 'Should we do it? Are we going to be able to do it? Am I going to have this baby by then?' So we scheduled it tentatively," Stephanie said.
As it turned out, little Savanna Scibal — now nearly 5 months old — didn't upstage her parents' TV debut, which is set to air on Feb. 25.
But she was mentioned quite a bit as her parents looked for a vacation house that they also could use as a rental property.
"I would say, 'This would be nice for Savanna,' or 'Savanna would like this,' " Stephanie Scibal said during a recent interview in the conference room of her family's Haddonfield real estate office.
Scibal, 30, works with her parents, Bill and Jackie Souders, and brother, Will Souders, in the family business. So Scibal and her husband had no need for a real-estate agent as they checked out three homes on the episode titled "Ocean City Bound with a Baby."
HGTV producers connected with the Scibals on the recommendation of an Ocean City listings broker. But Stephanie took it from there.
"That's why this episode is a little different," Scibal said. "Stephen was essentially my buyer. We were both my buyer ... but I would take him to the listings and open the door just like he would be a buyer, and do the negotiating for us."
Stephen, 33, was a satisfied customer, telling his wife, "I want to buy more houses. That was great, having you as the negotiator."
Couple has many ties to Ocean City Ocean City has a sentimental attachment for the Scibals: It's the first place they met.
Stephen, a medical-device salesman who grew up in Northfield, was a member of the Ocean City Beach Patrol. He and Stephanie met at a lifeguard party when he was 18 and she was 16.
But that was all there was to it, until years later when the two reconnected while both were living in Philly.
After they were married, they returned every weekend to Ocean City, where Stephen's family has a beach house.
"His sisters both have babies, we just had our first baby. We were like, 'It's getting crowded over there,' so that's when we decided to start looking for our own place."
HGTV viewers will likely see Stephen commenting that one of the houses they check out looks familiar.
"When we got there, he realized he had rented it during senior week" back in his lifeguard days, Stephanie said. "That was funny, for him to walk in and have all these memories of having a high school party there."
In a reverse of the typical order, the Scibals shopped for a vacation home before buying a primary residence. They currently rent their Stratford home from Stephanie's parents.
But as a real estate agent who watches trends, Stephanie noted that the New York Times reported on couples buying a second home first in vacation spots such as the Hamptons or the Catskills while continuing to rent in the city.
The Scibals bought their Ocean City home as an investment, so they'll rent it during the peak summer months and stay there before and after the season.
It won't be easy to hand over the keys, Stephanie acknowledged.
"We're falling more and more in love with the house."
All the homes the Scibals looked at for the episode were in Ocean City's north end. Their other home-buying criteria included two to three bedrooms, and at least two bathrooms. They were open to a duplex or a single-family home.
Baby kept crew on tight schedule There were long days of filming the HGTV show, especially for a very pregnant Stephanie.
"It was four days of filming, eight- to 10-hour days in the summer heat, end of September, middle of September," she said.
But Stephanie felt fine as the couple took part in activities around Ocean City, including riding on a Ferris wheel. And she enjoyed a little leisure time on the beach as Stephen surfed.
The fun-in-the-sun vibe is part of what drew the Scibals to buy in Ocean City.
"Something unique about it is that it's a dry town, which makes it a really nice family area," Stephanie said. "You have the boardwalk and really good surfing ... hopefully we show Ocean City in a good light and people will want to visit or buy their own vacation home."
The pregnancy was never far from producers' minds during filming.
"Some of them were like, 'Should we do that scene first?' " Stephanie said, explaining the crew wanted to make sure they had crucial scenes shot in case she went into labor.
Stephanie said the couple didn't have any hesitation about being on camera.
"I guess we're both outgoing people," she said. "It was fun."
Since the Scibals purchased their beachfront bargain, they have been busy with renovations. They even made the property homey for the holidays by putting up a Christmas tree.
They plan to have a watch party when "Beachfront Bargain Hunt" airs on HGTV. But there will be an unavoidable spoiler alert for party guests: The event will be at the Scibals' new Ocean City home, so everyone will know the ending.
Stephanie said she's also eager to someday show the episode to Savanna — who was on board for the episode even if she wasn't on camera.
"I'm excited for her to watch this eventually."

Texto completo: During a trip to China in 2018, we were watching BBC News in our hotel room. When the anchorman started to talk about something going on in the country's western provinces, the screen went blank. After a minute or so, the picture returned. The newscaster had moved on to the next story.
The next day, we mentioned the interruption to one of our tour guides. "The government wants us to be happy," the guide said with a wry, tight-lipped smile. "So they try not to show us things that would make us unhappy."
I recalled that exchange last week when I heard about the fate of Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who tried to sound the alarm about the new virus now spreading around the world. Li was a 34-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. On Dec. 30, he took to WeChat to warn fellow doctors that several patients from a local market had come down with an illness resembling SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
Local Chinese officials initially sought to keep the lid on Li's information. Security police forced him to sign a letter that accused him of "making false comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order."
After returning to work at Wuhan Central Hospital, Li contracted the coronavirus from a patient who saw him for glaucoma on Jan. 10.
"If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better," he texted The New York Times from his hospital bed. "There should be more openness and transparency."
Dr. Li died last Friday, one of more than 1,000 victims of the coronavirus so far.
Li's tragic story isn't just a faraway tale of the damage that can be done when communist authorities try to suppress bad news, imperiling their own citizens and those of other nations. It's also a warning to Americans about the consequences of discrediting people who try to call out wrongdoing or danger.

Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can't always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they're doing, it looks like they're pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China's already sluggish economy, suggests something serious. At the same time though, China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don't need the help, or because they have secrets they'd rather keep? For now, there's no way to know.
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we'll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let's hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won't be too expensive.

Texto completo: TOMS RIVER - A Toms River social studies teacher is being investigated for allegedly teaching a "degrading" history lesson on slavery in which a complaining student said classmates were forced to "pick cotton and lay" on a dirty floor while "pretending we were slaves."
During the lesson, teacher Lawrence Cuneo would also make "cracking" whip noises and kick students' feet while making them pretend to pick cotton, one student said in a social media post.
"It's good to be informed about slavery but making us clean and pick cotton and pretending to wip (sic) us? Are you nuts it's 2020 not 1800 get it right," the student posted.
The Asbury Park Press received screenshots of the Instagram posts by the student's mother. She did not return requests seeking comment.
Cuneo, 59, is also in his third term as the mayor of the small town of Pine Beach. The Toms River school district website lists him as an eighth-grade social studies teacher at Toms River Intermediate School East.
In a statement, Toms River school district spokesman Michael Kenny said a "thorough investigation" was underway.
"As we comb through and further investigate the details of the alleged incident, we are keeping in mind that our curriculum has evolved to include more hands-on, authentic activities," Kenny said. "It seems initially clear that there was no ill intent but that better judgment should have been used with regard to the alleged instructional methods, particularly as it pertains to recognizing the sensitivities of all students."
According to public pension records, Cuneo has been a teacher for 18 years. He collected a salary of just under $73,000 last year.
He also collects a $2,500 salary as mayor of Pine Beach, where he's in his third term. Cuneo did not return calls seeking comment Tuesday.
Teachers' slavery lessons have come under fire across the country in recent years.
Last week, a student-teacher in Tennessee was fired after she asked fourth-grade students to read and answer non-age-appropriate questions about "The Making of a Slave," a 1700s speech advocating for slavery.
And in Connecticut, a teacher last month was suspended after casting black students as slaves in a play. Last year, a New York private school history teacher organized a mock slave auction where white students bid on black students.
At the same time, schools have been criticized for sugar-coating the horrors of slavery and its continuing impact on the nation, as chronicled in The New York Times' 1619 Project last year, marking the "400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery."
Some schools announced after the Times project that they would bolster their teachings about slavery.

Texto completo: DE PERE - Sylvia Bowersox didn't know how much one dog could change a life until Timothy came into hers.
A U.S. Army veteran who did three tours in Iraq as a broadcast journalist and press officer, she struggled in the years after she returned home in 2007 — 10 days after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was hanged.
Bowersox, suffering from traumatic brain injury, severe post-traumatic stress disorder and "a whole alphabet of other things," was misdiagnosed by Veterans Affairs with bipolar disorder and was put on lithium and a host of other drugs.
"They had me on just bizarre, bizarre medications. I was a zombie. I was an absolute zombie. I wasn't functioning," she said. "I was just beside myself, because I am not bipolar. They kept upping my doses, so I did not have a quality of life at all. I was desperate."
She was living in Columbus, Ohio, when the idea of a service dog to help with the PTSD first came up. She was referred to a local program in which jail inmates trained dogs, but when the door slammed behind her the first time she visited, she had a massive panic attack. She never went back. She wasn't well enough.
Then her husband Jon found Little Angels Service Dogs, which trains canines on a 10-acre ranch outside San Diego. That's where she would meet Timothy, a British Labrador puppy she first laid eyes on via Skype.
"The first thing he did is he walked up and he started cleaning my face," Bowersox said.
He was a year old when she took him home. They've been inseparable in the nearly nine years since.
"Timothy is my baby. He's my fur baby. He's my child," said Bowersox, a writer and painter who moved to De Pere in 2016. "He tells me when I've had enough and I have to go walk around the building. He paws at me when I'm freaking out. He sleeps with me. When I disassociate, he just sits at my feet and doesn't go anywhere and doesn't let me go anywhere until I come out of it. He is amazing. He's my guy."
Sharing her story on the big screen The two are co-stars in "To Be of Service," a documentary by Josh Aronson about war veterans with PTSD and the service dogs that have helped them regain their lives. The film opened in select U.S. cities in November and is streaming on Netflix.
The crew filmed Bowersox and Timothy in De Pere, including at Luna Cafe and Roastery, and also at Little Angels for one of Timothy's training refresher courses and during Bowersox's reading of her "This War Can't Be All Bad" in Venice, California.
"To Be of Service" was one of 159 documentary features submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Science for 2020 Oscar consideration. It received strong reviews from The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and others, but it did not make the cut as one of five nominees in its Oscar category.
The film also received national attention for "Unbroken," the song Bon Jovi wrote for the project. The band is donating all proceeds from downloads of the single to the Patriotic Service Dog Foundation, a nonprofit that provides service dogs to veterans in need.
There wasn't a red carpet premiere that allowed Bowersox the chance to rub elbows with Jon Bon Jovi — she'd tell him how much his lyrics captured the veterans experience, particularly "I'd do it all again" — but she was able to catch a screening in Chicago. She and Timothy appeared on NBC's "Today with Hoda & Jenna" on Veterans Day to talk about the importance of service dogs for veterans.
She was also in attendance when "To Be of Service" was screened for Congress. She spent two days in Washington, D.C. encouraging members to support the PAWS Act. The Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act was introduced in June to make service dogs more accessible to veterans looking for an alternative PTSD treatment. If passed, it would require the VA to provide a $25,000 voucher for a service dog to veterans diagnosed with PTSD.
The VA does not currently cover the expense of a service dog. One veteran in the film did a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money. Bowersox knows when Timothy retires in another year, she'll need to somehow come up with $30,000 for her next service dog.
"My thought is why do we as veterans have to go begging for a service dog? Why are we doing this? That's why I got behind the PAWS Act," she said.
Eating cat food: bad. Getting belly rubs: good. It's impossible for Bowersox to put a price on how valuable Timothy has been to her.
"He's my partner in crime," she says. "He's phenomenal. He settles me. He's my best pal."
It took the two about a year to get to know each other. He had to figure out what his job was, what her needs were and how that all fit into what he knows how to do. She had to learn how to deal with people who want to pet him when they're out in public, a no-no as it's a distraction from his job.
She also had to learn how to properly feed him. She overdid it at first and "he became a little sausage." He's closer to his ideal weight now, but it hasn't stopped him from trying to convince her he's starving.
They reached a mutual agreement that he couldn't eat the cat's food. Not good for the cat — or his digestive system. Belly rubs, however, are always good.
With the exception of a trip overseas that kept them apart for a couple weeks, Bowersox is never without him. Where she goes, he goes, including Chicago, where she's studying art. Calm and relaxed, Timothy can sense when Bowersox is feeling anxious. In the year when she was having frequent nightmares, he would wake her up.
"When I'm in a place and he decides I need to take a break, well, he's 80 pounds, so when he says, 'Nope, we're leaving,' we're going," she said.
"What happens to me, because of my brain injury and because of my PTSD, if I allow myself to get overstimulated, overly stressed, I shut down. I completely shut down. I either do one of two things. I either get really, really scared or the lights are on but nobody's home. ... We work together. He is my barometer."

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2.5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I.
Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: "Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1% every day since Jan. 30. 'This magical virus is very good at math!' I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime's rule. ... I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line."
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials lying, but perhaps they're telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what's going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what's really happening, as opposed to what underlings are reporting to their superiors.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
It's a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities' position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there's no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there's no way for the people at the top to know whether they're being told the truth.
Healthy systems of organization ensure that bad news can always flow from the bottom to the top. Systems that don't do this become increasingly disconnected from reality and unstable.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I'd be worried.
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get. Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can't always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they're doing, it looks like they're pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China's already sluggish economy, suggests something serious.

Xi's communist malfeasance and misrule fueled China's coronavirus disaster: Sen. Ben Sasse

Texto completo: The coronavirus outbreak sweeping across China, and now threatening dozens of other countries, including the United States, is not just a natural disaster. It is the deadly consequence of the Chinese Communist Party’s malfeasance and misrule. And, as has been the case for so much of the CCP’s seven-decade hegemony, the cruel irony is that the people of China are its main victims.
More than 42,000 Chinese people have been diagnosed with coronavirus since the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan in December — many times the number who contracted SARS in 2002-03 worldwide.
More than 1,000 people have died, and nearly 60 million people are in lockdown. In Wuhan and surrounding areas, undersupplied doctors are wearing rain jackets for want of biohazard gear, citizens fear imminent food shortages and local crematoria are working around the clock to dispose of bodies.
It did not have to be this way. As The New York Times reported, the first case of coronavirus appeared in early December. But Chinese officials did not act for more than a month. When a Wuhan doctor, Li Wenliang, tried to warn his medical school classmates that an unfamiliar illness was ravaging Wuhan Central Hospital, he and his classmates were silenced by local authorities, who threatened to punish anyone “spreading rumors" and "disrupting social order. ”
By the time authorities finally acknowledged what was happening, a full blown epidemic was underway. "At critical turning points,” wrote The Times, “Chinese authorities put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis. ”
In an additional tragic turn: Dr. Li contracted coronavirus while treating patients. The ophthalmologist died last Friday at the age of 34.
Dr. Li’s courage and commitment to human life made him a hero to the Chinese people and an enemy of the Chinese Communist Party.
'Clean,' 'adaptive,' and 'responsive' are only CCP's lies
Secrecy, denial, and coercion are not bugs in Xi Jinping’s regime. They are core features. The CCP, concerned first and foremost in its own survival, has had to renegotiate a fragile social contract in recent years, staking its continued right to rule on ensuring that the lives of Chinese citizens are safe, healthy and prosperous.
Xi, the party overlords in Beijing and their apparatchiks in China’s provincial and municipal governments have promised that the Chinese government can be “clean,” or free of corruption. They promised to be “adaptive” to crises and changing societywide conditions. They promised to be “responsive” to the demands of the citizenry, especially China’s rapidly expanding professional class — its millions of attorneys, journalists, scientists, doctors and more, who are increasingly part of a global exchange, and whose demands for efficient social services (good schools, reliable clinics, etc. ) resemble the demands of the Western upper-middle class.
Trapped in Wuhan: I won't evacuate without my wife and son
What has happened instead? Literal plagues have laid waste to the population. Toxic environmental conditions prevail across the country, especially in China’s major cities, where air pollution is so bad that it obscures sunlight.
The government’s efforts to silence increasingly vocal political dissidents and religious minorities have exposed a cross-country network of internment camps, a government-sponsored slave labor industry and a horrifying black market in organ harvesting that serves wealthy party members and their family and friends.
And the government’s attacks on Hong Kong’s semiautonomous status have spurred prolonged, intense protests that have startled party leadership.
Chinese citizens deserve real transparency, accountability
These episodes, and others that have flown under the radar of international news media, have brought sharply into question whether the Chinese system, as it is constituted, can really be “clean,” “adaptive” and “responsive. ” And rightly so.
When “east, west, south, north and center, the party leads everything,” as the CCP declared in 2017, it cannot simply slough off responsibility for fatal mistakes and grave mismanagement. But it also can’t cop to its failures. If the tyrants in Beijing acknowledge their mistakes, they chip away at their own right to rule. Inevitably, their response is to sweep problems under the rug and demand even greater control over the lives of 1. 4 billion Chinese citizens — evermore invasive surveillance, evermore complete submission to CCP ideological propaganda. This is a risky game.
Editorial Board: Coronavirus offers reasons for concern but not for panic
There is a better way, of course. Real transparency and democratic accountability help to prevent these sorts of nightmares. Truly clean, adaptive and responsive government is most likely where information can flow freely, where governments are honest and where the people can hold their leaders responsible — and replace them with genuine alternatives. A system that prioritizes and protects the inviolable dignity of its citizens, rather than the perpetuation of its ruling cabal, is the only one where real civic health is possible.
Communism is the perfect incubator for the coronavirus. China’s predatory system preys on its own people. Trials become tragedies, crises become catastrophes, and the bosses in Beijing exploit their own failures as cover for new and worse abuses.
America and her allies should be clear about what is happening. China’s people are sick because the Chinese system is.

Letter: Might Palm Springs' arena sport plastic 'ice'?

Texto completo: Kudos to Douglas Hodge, who received the harshest sentence so far of any parent caught up in the admission bribery scandal ("Ex-financier gets 9 months in college admissions scandal," Feb. 8 story) when he expressed "deepest remorse" and accepted that what he did was wrong.
However, he destroyed his credibility when he said "that his children did not participate in his misdeeds."
What? They are all students at USC and Georgetown as "fake athletic recruits" and they did not participate? Of course, they participated when they filled the slot on an athletic team that could have gone to an athlete who was qualified to receive a college education based on high school grades, admission tests, and prowess on the athletic field.
Gary Nash, Palm Desert
Is plastic 'ice' in our future? A recent New York Times article on synthetic ice for skating rinks caught my eye. The "Glice" rinks require no cold weather, special skating blades, electricity or water, other than for cleaning.
Glice (essentially plastic) is in use in over 1,800 rinks worldwide and has rinks in Morocco, Mexico City, 22 retail centers in the U.S., and in over 300 private homes stateside.
Could the Palm Springs Arena be a leader in conservation of water and electricity while promoting ice hockey in the desert? Some 21 NFL teams now use artificial turf that provide varying playing surfaces versus real grass.
"Synthetic rinks, have been part of the infrastructure of ice hockey for at least 40 years," said a spokesman for USA Hockey.
The right time for the right product? Good question!
Garth Gilpin, Palm Springs
Drawing Asian Americans to the desert I just moved into this region. I notice that there is an under-representation of Asian Americans living in Palm Springs and the surrounding regions.
Maybe we should encourage them to move out here.
Older Asian Americans likely would stick to the San Gabriel Valley areas where they can have easy access to restaurants and familiar medical and health facilities. The younger ones would prefer to have jobs so that they can support a family and earn a decent living. In fact, Asian Americans are over-represented in the medical and health professions and the Palm Springs region should provide ample opportunities for these professionals.
I look forward that the region can develop these potential areas of growth in the near future.

Listen to the lyrics "Oh what a circus, oh what a show!"
Tim Rice's lyrics characterize the slick production that was the 2020 State of the Union address very well.
But we would do well to heed Rice's more prophetic lyric: "Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants."

What we owe to the bearers of bad news

Texto completo: During a trip to China in 2018, we were watching BBC News in our hotel room. When the anchorman started to talk about something going on in the country's western provinces, the screen went blank. After a minute or so, the picture returned. The newscaster had moved on to the next story.
The next day, we mentioned the interruption to one of our tour guides. "The government wants us to be happy," the guide said with a wry, tight-lipped smile. "So they try not to show us things that would make us unhappy."
I recalled that exchange last week when I heard about the fate of Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who tried to sound the alarm about the new virus now spreading around the world.
Li was a 34-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. On Dec. 30, he took to WeChat to warn fellow doctors that several patients from a local market had come down with an illness resembling SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
Like the Soviet authorities who downplayed the severity of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, local Chinese officials initially sought to keep the lid on Li's information. The doctor was accused of rumor-mongering. Security police forced him to sign a letter that accused him of "making false comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order."
After returning to work at Wuhan Central Hospital, Li contracted the coronavirus from a patient who saw him for glaucoma on Jan. 10.
"If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better," he texted The New York Times from his hospital bed. "There should be more openness and transparency."
Dr. Li died last Friday, one of more than 1,000 victims of the coronavirus so far. He left behind a pregnant wife and child.
Li's tragic story isn't just a faraway tale of the damage that can be done when communist authorities try to suppress bad news, imperiling their own citizens and those of other nations. It's also a warning to Americans about the consequences of discrediting people who try to call out wrongdoing or danger. Think such a thing couldn't happen here in the USA, where laws protect whistleblowers from retribution? Don't be so certain.
Last summer, after an unidentified National Security Council aide raised alarms through proper channels on President Donald Trump's arms-for-dirt deal with Ukraine, the administration tried to suppress the complaint. Failing that, it assailed the whistleblower. Never mind that subsequent testimony thoroughly confirmed the whistleblower's allegations. And never mind that Republican members of Congress used to be big champions of whistleblower protections.
Trump attacked the whistleblower on Twitter and retweeted articles that purported to reveal the person's identity. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tried to expose the identity during the question-and-answer portion of the impeachment trial. Wisely thwarted by Chief Justice John Roberts, Paul went ahead later and publicly disclosed the name anyway.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans an investigation -- not of Paul's actions, but those of the whistleblower.
"If they carry out this threat of state-sponsored retaliation, whistleblowing as we know it may be over," Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, warned in The Washington Post. "That would be a disastrous blow to government integrity."
As the sad case of Dr. Li shows, it would also be a threat to your health and safety.
Contrary to what certain leaders here and abroad might want you to believe, ignorance is not bliss.

Mask maker faces high demand French factory works to meet demand after coronavirus outbreak

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - The relentless whir of machines echoing across a cavernous French factory floor is an unexpected result of the deadly virus that has nearly paralyzed cities in China and other parts of Asia.
The company, Kolmi Hopen, makes an item that is suddenly one of the world's hottest commodities: the medical face mask.
The factory typically makes around 170 million masks a year, but in the last week orders arrived for a staggering half-billion, flooding the sales department's inboxes at the rate of one every two minutes. Kolmi Hopen is racing to hire more workers to keep the machines running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
"We're making masks as fast as we can," said Guillaume Laverdure, chief operating officer of Kolmi Hopen's parent company, Canada-based Medicom, as forklift drivers moved boxes of freshly finished masks into trucks.
"But demand is still rising," he added.
The coronavirus outbreak has set off a run on protective masks across China and in major cities. To curb the spread of the virus, the Chinese government has ordered citizens to don masks every time they go outside. Medical professionals said once used, a mask must be replaced with a fresh one, driving an explosion in demand. Grim scenes of people lined up for hours to get a protective face covering, only to be turned away when pharmacies run out, have become familiar.
"I can't find a single mask to buy," said Sandy Lo, 60, in Hong Kong. "I don't know what stores have stock anymore." She said she reuses old masks "because what else could I do?"
Most of the world's face masks are made in China and Taiwan. But factories there, including ones run by Medicom, have been forced to temporarily halt exports to comply with government demands to reserve them for frantic residents.
Last week, the Chinese government, conceding it was in urgent need of medical masks and other protective gear, said it would begin importing them from Europe, Japan and the United States to help make up for the shortfall.
It has made the Kolmi Hopen outpost in western France an unlikely hot spot. Phones at the factory have been ringing off the hook as medical supply buyers scour the globe for mask-makers.
Demand is especially strong for high-filtration respiratory masks, which can be more effective against the spread of virus-laden droplets than surgical masks, Laverdure said. Laverdure declined to discuss financial details, including the cost of the masks.
Scientists said there isn't much evidence that masks actually protect healthy people - hand washing may be more important.
Still, as the coronavirus spreads, with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths, experts fear that supplies of face masks and other sanitary protection items will run low in other countries - even for routine medical use. Pharmacies in the United States have begun reporting shortages.
The frenzy of orders at Kolmi Hopen shows the large-scale disruption China can create in the global supply chain for even the most specialized products, if factories there fail to operate at full strength.
China produces about half the world's sanitary face masks - around 20 million a day, supplying hospitals and medical workers in numerous countries. Taiwan makes up another 20% of the global supply.

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - The relentless whir of machines echoing across a cavernous French factory floor is an unexpected result of the deadly virus that has nearly paralyzed cities in China and other parts of Asia.
The company, Kolmi Hopen, makes an item that is suddenly one of the world's hottest commodities: the medical face mask.
The factory typically makes around 170 million masks a year, but in the last week orders arrived for a staggering half-billion, flooding the sales department's inboxes at the rate of one every two minutes. Kolmi Hopen is racing to hire more workers to keep the machines running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
"We're making masks as fast as we can," said Guillaume Laverdure, chief operating officer of Kolmi Hopen's parent company, Canada-based Medicom, as forklift drivers moved boxes of freshly finished masks into trucks.
"But demand is still rising," he added.
The coronavirus outbreak has set off a run on protective masks across China and in major cities. To curb the spread of the virus, the Chinese government has ordered citizens to don masks every time they go outside. Medical professionals said once used, a mask must be replaced with a fresh one, driving an explosion in demand. Grim scenes of people lined up for hours to get a protective face covering, only to be turned away when pharmacies run out, have become familiar.
"I can't find a single mask to buy," said Sandy Lo, 60, in Hong Kong. "I don't know what stores have stock anymore." She said she reuses old masks "because what else could I do?"
Most of the world's face masks are made in China and Taiwan. But factories there, including ones run by Medicom, have been forced to temporarily halt exports to comply with government demands to reserve them for frantic residents.
Last week, the Chinese government, conceding it was in urgent need of medical masks and other protective gear, said it would begin importing them from Europe, Japan and the United States to help make up for the shortfall.
It has made the Kolmi Hopen outpost in western France an unlikely hot spot. Phones at the factory have been ringing off the hook as medical supply buyers scour the globe for mask-makers.
Demand is especially strong for high-filtration respiratory masks, which can be more effective against the spread of virus-laden droplets than surgical masks, Laverdure said. Laverdure declined to discuss financial details, including the cost of the masks.
Scientists said there isn't much evidence that masks actually protect healthy people - hand washing may be more important.
Still, as the coronavirus spreads, with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths, experts fear that supplies of face masks and other sanitary protection items will run low in other countries - even for routine medical use. Pharmacies in the United States have begun reporting shortages.
The frenzy of orders at Kolmi Hopen shows the large-scale disruption China can create in the global supply chain for even the most specialized products, if factories there fail to operate at full strength.
China produces about half the world's sanitary face masks - around 20 million a day, supplying hospitals and medical workers in numerous countries. Taiwan makes up another 20% of the global supply.

Texto completo: From dramatic cuts to safety net programs to building fewer submarines, President Trump's proposed $4.8 trillion budget for the 2021 fiscal year could have a significant, detrimental impact on Connecticut, state leaders and advocates say.
"The cuts President Trump is proposing to Medicaid, nutrition assistance and affordable housing are cruel, almost as if they're designed to hurt the most vulnerable people in our state," Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Tuesday, vowing to fight against the reductions.
Trump's budget proposes about $300 billion in cuts to Medicaid, federal housing assistance, and food stamp programs, in addition to slashing spending on federal disability insurance benefits by $70 billion. The proposal would cut $170 billion from student loan programs, partly by eliminating subsidized federal student loans and ending the public service loan forgiveness program (both of which appeared in last year's budget but were not adopted by Congress).
"Connecticut is certainly paying out its fair share of taxes federally and we need to get that money back it to Connecticut to make people's lives better," said Deb Polun, the executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action, a state association of Connecticut's nine antipoverty Community Action Agencies, which serve 250,000 residents annually.
Slashes to Medicaid, tweaks to Medicare
Trump's budget would cut a trillion dollars from Medicaid and subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, partly by instituting work requirements, asset tests and more frequent verification of eligibility.
"At a time when so many hardworking Americans are one medical emergency away from bankruptcy, it is disturbing that the President is so brazenly cutting the healthcare that millions of families rely on," Juan Hernandez, Vice-President of 32BJ SEIU, the country's largest property services union, with 5,000 members in Connecticut, said in a statement Tuesday.
Though the budget includes a small expansion of Medicaid coverage by allowing states to cover inpatient care for psychiatric care or drug addiction treatment, it would reduce the federal share of spending for all Medicaid patients.
"The pain from these cuts would hurt communities on all ends of the economic spectrum. Not only are millions of children reliant on the Children's Health Insurance Program, 65% of all nursing home residents are supported by Medicaid," Hernandez said.
Housing assistance programs would take a hit
The Trump administration's proposed budget threatens to eliminate a number of crucial antipoverty programs in Connecticut. The Weatherization Assistance Program, which reduces energy costs for low-income households, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (known in-state as the CT Energy Assistance Program), which provides assistance with home energy bills to 80,000 households annually, would both be cut if the budget passes.
The weatherization program, which provides upgrades to more than 2,000 Connecticut homes annually, "helps people stay in a warmer home and makes sure tax dollars are used most effectively," Polun said. Connecticut receives roughly $2 million in weatherization funding annually and $82 million in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), which provides funding to Community Action Agencies that can be used to support a wide range of programs, would also be eliminated under Trump's budget. The grant - which provides Connecticut with $6.9 million in funding annually - supports a wide range of programs and services for low-income individuals.
One program is the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, which provides free tax preparation help to Connecticut residents who make under $50,000. The program operates in community centers, libraries, schools, shopping malls and other locations across the state.
Nationally, the proposed budget also includes the elimination of the Choice Neighborhoods Program - which awards grants to neighborhoods with deteriorating public and federally assisted housing - and reductions in rental assistance programs like Housing Choice Vouchers, among other cuts.
Reductions in SNAP benefits
Trump's proposed budget would reduce Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding by $180 billion between 2021 and 2030, through tightening eligibility requirements and providing the benefit partly through food shipments rather than cash.
The administration has long targeted SNAP for spending cuts. A new rule revising work requirements for SNAP eligibility, which goes into effect on April 1, is estimated to eliminate food assistance benefits for roughly 26,000 Connecticut residents, according to the state Department of Social Services. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the cuts will save the government almost $8 billion over five years.
The administration has also previously presented two additional proposals which political leaders and antipoverty advocates in Connecticut have warned could eliminate SNAP eligibility for tens of thousands of state residents.
Threat to state's submarine production
The proposed budget would also cut Virginia-class submarine production from two a year to one, a plan which has drawn swift condemnation from state leaders. Gov. Ned Lamont blasted President Donald Trump on Tuesday for the proposed reduction, which he called "inexcusable." In recent years, the Pentagon's budget has called for two submarines per year - leading to a sharp increase in employment at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton.
"When they make the pledge of two submarines, I think they have the ability to keep to it," he said. "They should keep to it. It is, by far, in the best interest of the taxpayers because it brings down the cost to have that consistency."
During a recent trip to the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C., Lamont met personally with the U.S. Navy Secretary to talk about the submarines - before Trump's budget was announced. Lamont said the state cannot be whipsawed into changing its workforce with a major change in the number of submarines.
"If you tell me we're going to have two Virginia class subs over the foreseeable future, then we line up personnel and workforce to do that. We put in place the pipeline to do that. We gear up to do that," Lamont said. "Then in politics, all of a sudden, you pull the rug, and say we're going from two to one. That really screws up your production process."

Upward Mobility: Trump's Smart Play for African-Americans

Texto completo: If his State of the Union address and Super Bowl commercial are any indication, President Trump is serious about increasing his support among black voters in November. He may or may not succeed, but we're a long way from his cynical "What the hell do you have to lose?" pitch to blacks in 2016.
Mr. Trump outperformed John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 among black voters, as administration officials never tire of reminding us. But that had less to do with Mr. Trump's personal appeal and more to do with Barack Obama's absence on the ballot in 2016. In recent decades, GOP presidential nominees have averaged around 12% of the black vote. Mr. Trump won only 8%, which is the worst performance of any Republican presidential candidate since 1976, except for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.
The best black outreach is strong economic growth, and the president is right to highlight the low unemployment rates and steady pay increases that have redounded to black workers' benefit during his administration. Last year, median wage growth among blacks was higher than it was for whites. There is no denying that black Americans on balance are better off economically today than they were four years ago or at any point under the previous administration. If presidents deserve credit for such developments, give Mr. Trump his due.
Among other things, the president's pitch to blacks includes touting his bipartisan criminal-justice reform and support for school choice. My guess is that the former won't hurt him but that the latter could pay higher dividends at the ballot box. On Twitter and MSNBC, blacks might obsess over the defects of our criminal-justice system. But outside those progressive bubbles, most black voters understand that the underlying problem in poor black communities is crime, not policing or the length of sentences handed down to lawbreakers. Black families care far more about safe neighborhoods and functional schools, and Mr. Trump's push for more education choices is very much in line with those priorities.
According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 67% of charter students are nonwhite and 58% come from low-income families. Nationwide, five million students are on waiting liststo attend charter schools, which had strong backing from the Clinton and Obama administrations. Yet Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and other leading Democratic presidential candidates seeking the endorsement of teachers unions have vowed to curb the growth of charters. Richard Buery, an executive at the nation's largest charter network, KIPP, told the New York Times last year that this new Democratic opposition to charters is "a reflection more broadly of the lack of respect for black voters" in the party. "These are folks that should be champions of black children and allies of black educators," said Mr. Buery, who is black and described himself as a Democrat.
Nor is education the only area where Mr. Trump could exploit the disconnect between black voters and the Democratic candidates who claim to represent them. Polling has shown, for example, that a majority of blacks oppose Medicare for All, which would eliminate private health insurance for millions who are happy with their coverage. And you would be hard-pressed to find a critical mass of blacks who want to decriminalize illegal border crossing and pay higher taxes to cover the cost of providing free health care to poor immigrants.
If the president is serious about courting blacks, the changing demographics of black America might also aid his efforts. Black people of a certain age, by which I mean anyone who still takes organizations like the NAACP seriously, are probably lost to Republicans. But the black population is younger than the white population, and black millennials have proved to be more persuadable than their elders. While black seniors will likely vote Democrat or stay home, there has been a weakening of black attachment to the Democratic Party among younger blacks and black men. Exit polls showed Trump winning 13% of black men in 2016, and the most heavily black neighborhoods in the country voted more Republican than in 2012.
Black newcomers from Africa and the Caribbean provide yet another opening for the president. The black immigrant population has more than quadrupled since 1980, according to research by Sharon Austin, a political scientist at the University of Florida who has studied black voting patterns in several major U.S. cities. Many of the new arrivals are Haitians and Jamaicans. Both groups are far less likely than blacks in general to vote Democrat.
Does any of this amount to Donald Trump running away with the black vote on Election Day? Of course not. But the president has already shown that he can win without much black support, and Democrats are deluding themselves if they don't think he's capable of improving on his 2016 performance. Black voters have far more to lose today than they did four years ago.

Work permits for asylum applicants? Slow down

Texto completo: As more asylum seekers arrive in Portland, members of Maine’s congressional delegation want to accelerate work permits, pointing to labor shortages and taxpayer costs. But on a closer look, good reasons exist for continuing to require applicants to wait for work permits.
Before 1994, we gave asylum seekers work permits on arrival, which led to an explosion of asylum applications and overwhelmed our courts. The Clinton administration established a six-month waiting period to discourage frivolous claims and address a growing backlog. Following the implementation of the waiting period, asylum claims plummeted 57%, freeing up resources to focus on bonafide refugees.
Denise N. Slavin, then-vice president of the National Association of Immigration Lawyers, told The New York Times in 2011, “Fraud in immigration asylum is a huge issue and a major problem.” In 2012, the Obama administration indicted 10 New York law firms and dozens of immigration lawyers and others who helped asylum applicants fake their stories.
Since 2009 asylum claims have skyrocketed, swamping our courts again. In response, the Trump administration, taking a cue from Clinton, proposed a longer waiting period for work authorization. A more effective response would be to increase the number of immigration judges to process applications more rapidly, focusing on serious claims and expeditiously deporting those with frivolous claims.
I believe that the labor benefit of employing asylum applicants is exaggerated, as court denial rates for West African applicants range from 40% to 50%, which suggests that almost half of Portland’s asylum seekers will eventually be denied and become potentially deportable. And of those who achieve refugee status, there are substantial costs.
An internal study rejected by the Trump administration and leaked to The New York Times, “The Fiscal Costs of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and Local Levels from 2005-2014,” provides important data for Maine’s representatives in Washington. The authors estimate that refugees and their dependents generated a $52.8 billion federal surplus but caused a net deficit at the state and local levels of $35.9 billion. Since the federal surplus would be shared nationwide, but the state and local deficits fall entirely on state and local governments, increasing the number of refugees in Maine would cost Maine taxpayers.
And the federal benefit? I imagine that the study’s computed federal benefit is inflated, as the impact of refugees on the high cost of national defense or federal debt was not included in this study — a surprising omission.
Refugee costs shouldn’t surprise us. Moving to a new country, learning the language and making enough money to support your family is difficult. The Maine Department of Labor looked at the employment data five years after Somali immigrants arrived in Lewiston-Auburn in 2001. By 2006, only half of working-age Somalis had worked at all. Many of those jobs were seasonal and low wage.
Before providing work permits to a new population of asylees, we need more data. How long does it take most refugees to make enough in wages to support their families without taxpayer programs? Will Portland’s applicants remain when they get refugee status? Or will they move to cities with better wages and larger populations of their compatriots? Do they have the skills our employers need?
The New Mainers Resource Center, providing language instruction, case management and links to employers for Maine’s nearly 20,000 immigrants and refugees, reports that 398 people contacted the center for services in 2018; 73% had a college degree, and 95% of this population found jobs. But we don’t know how this number compares to the total refugee population. How many asylum applicants who already have work permits are employed? And at what wages? The center also reports that one of the greatest challenges is finding employment that pays a livable wage.
When politicians provide foreign workers to employers that don’t pay a livable wage, then taxpayers will eventually subsidize the employee with public programs. It would be better to require employers to recruit Americans.
And we might ponder the future. A recent McKinsey study is projecting that automation will replace nearly half of the American workforce by 2055. Walmart already uses robots to stock shelves, and McKinsey predicts that automation will sweep the economy. Let’s slow down, and think this one through.

Texto completo: As more asylum seekers arrive in Portland, members of Maine’s congressional delegation want to accelerate work permits, pointing to labor shortages and taxpayer costs. But on a closer look, good reasons exist for continuing to require applicants to wait for work permits.
Before 1994, we gave asylum seekers work permits on arrival, which led to an explosion of asylum applications and overwhelmed our courts. The Clinton administration established a six-month waiting period to discourage frivolous claims and address a growing backlog. Following the implementation of the waiting period, asylum claims plummeted 57%, freeing up resources to focus on bonafide refugees.
Denise N. Slavin, then-vice president of the National Association of Immigration Lawyers, told The New York Times in 2011, “Fraud in immigration asylum is a huge issue and a major problem.” In 2012, the Obama administration indicted 10 New York law firms and dozens of immigration lawyers and others who helped asylum applicants fake their stories.
Since 2009 asylum claims have skyrocketed, swamping our courts again. In response, the Trump administration, taking a cue from Clinton, proposed a longer waiting period for work authorization. A more effective response would be to increase the number of immigration judges to process applications more rapidly, focusing on serious claims and expeditiously deporting those with frivolous claims.
I believe that the labor benefit of employing asylum applicants is exaggerated, as court denial rates for West African applicants range from 40% to 50%, which suggests that almost half of Portland’s asylum seekers will eventually be denied and become potentially deportable. And of those who achieve refugee status, there are substantial costs.
An internal study rejected by the Trump administration and leaked to The New York Times, “The Fiscal Costs of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and Local Levels from 2005-2014,” provides important data for Maine’s representatives in Washington. The authors estimate that refugees and their dependents generated a $52.8 billion federal surplus but caused a net deficit at the state and local levels of $35.9 billion. Since the federal surplus would be shared nationwide, but the state and local deficits fall entirely on state and local governments, increasing the number of refugees in Maine would cost Maine taxpayers.
And the federal benefit? I imagine that the study’s computed federal benefit is inflated, as the impact of refugees on the high cost of national defense or federal debt was not included in this study — a surprising omission.
Refugee costs shouldn’t surprise us. Moving to a new country, learning the language and making enough money to support your family is difficult. The Maine Department of Labor looked at the employment data five years after Somali immigrants arrived in Lewiston-Auburn in 2001. By 2006, only half of working-age Somalis had worked at all. Many of those jobs were seasonal and low wage.
Before providing work permits to a new population of asylees, we need more data. How long does it take most refugees to make enough in wages to support their families without taxpayer programs? Will Portland’s applicants remain when they get refugee status? Or will they move to cities with better wages and larger populations of their compatriots? Do they have the skills our employers need?
The New Mainers Resource Center, providing language instruction, case management and links to employers for Maine’s nearly 20,000 immigrants and refugees, reports that 398 people contacted the center for services in 2018; 73% had a college degree, and 95% of this population found jobs. But we don’t know how this number compares to the total refugee population. How many asylum applicants who already have work permits are employed? And at what wages? The center also reports that one of the greatest challenges is finding employment that pays a livable wage.
When politicians provide foreign workers to employers that don’t pay a livable wage, then taxpayers will eventually subsidize the employee with public programs. It would be better to require employers to recruit Americans.
And we might ponder the future. A recent McKinsey study is projecting that automation will replace nearly half of the American workforce by 2055. Walmart already uses robots to stock shelves, and McKinsey predicts that automation will sweep the economy. Let’s slow down, and think this one through.

15 drown as Rohingya boat capsizes

Texto completo: At least 15 Rohingya refugees, including four children, drowned when the overcrowded boat they were in capsized off the coast of Bangladesh on Tuesday, according to the Bangladesh Coast Guard.
A Bangladesh Coast Guard official, Hamidul Islam, told Reuters that the boat was filled with people trying to leave camps near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have been living since a scorched-earth ethnic cleansing campaign by Myanmar's military in 2017.
“It was inhumane," he said. “The boat was carrying roughly 130 people, while it had a capacity of 50."
Coast Guard officials said that at least 40 people were still listed as missing.
More than 730,000 Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, have fled Myanmar to Bangladesh since a campaign of killing, rape, and arson began against them in 2017. Though both governments have promised the refugees would imminently return to Myanmar, the promise has not been kept.
Instead, the Rohingya live in miserable conditions near the Myanmar border at the world's largest refugee camp. Human trafficking runs rampant, with women sold into sex slavery and men sent away for indentured servitude.
In January, the International Court of Justice at The Hague ruled that Myanmar must take action to protect the Rohingya, the first time an international court has ruled against the country over its treatment of the minority population. But the court has no enforcement power, and Myanmar rejected the ruling.

Unexpected third for Klobuchar

Texto completo: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar defied expectations Tuesday night with a strong third-place showing in the New Hampshire presidential primary that catapulted her into contention for the Democratic nomination and made her, for the first time in the race, the woman to watch in 2020.
“She's truly our comeback kid, isn't she?" said Debora Pignatelli, a New Hampshire executive councilor who introduced Klobuchar at her primary night party at the Grappone Conference Center in Concord.
Klobuchar reveled in the surprise surge, telling a wildly cheering crowd, “Hello, America. I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I will beat Donald Trump."
“While there are still ballots left to count," she said, “we have beaten the odds every step of the way."
Early returns showed Klobuchar placing third in New Hampshire, behind Senator Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. She vaulted into the top tier after a particularly strong debate performance Friday night, just as many wavering New Hampshire voters were forcing themselves to settle on a candidate. A tidal wave of more than $3 million in small online donations had poured in by Monday.
“Watching her performance in the debate on Friday night changed my perception of her," said Melissa Walters, a supporter from Bow, N.H. “I just thought Amy on Friday night had the best answers and seems like she could beat Donald Trump."
Women like Walters — who brought her 12-year-old daughter, Hannah Pawlowski, to Klobuchar's election night party — also appear to have helped her over the finish line.
ABC News reported preliminary exit polls showing Klobuchar leading among women voters and benefiting from a substantial gender gap. Sanders was doing 9 points better with men than women; Klobuchar was doing 9 points better with women than men. Klobuchar also claimed college-educated women voters — winning 32 percent, followed by 22 percent for Buttigieg, 19 percent for Sanders, and just 13 percent for Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, ABC News reported.
“Pete's too young. Biden and Bernie are too old. Elizabeth Warren, I think, just has more negative a message," said Margaret Mitchell, 42, a physician assistant from Concord, of her down-to-the-wire decision to vote for Klobuchar. “I thought she did really well in the debates."
Klobuchar focused her closing argument on her centrist appeal, which she argued would make her a viable alternative to President Trump.
“Donald Trump's worst nightmare is that the people in the middle — the people who have had enough of the name-calling and the mudslinging — have someone to vote for in November," Klobuchar told her cheering supporters as they waved American flags and her green “Amy for America" signs.
The New Hampshire results seemed to indicate the pitch worked for many who find her pragmatic politics more palatable than the notion of a more progressive Democratic candidate. Some of her supporters touted her potential crossover appeal as a nominee.
“I have so many people in my family who are Trump supporters who said if it was her, they'd think about it," said Jenna Breitbarth-Guidi, a Salem, Mass., evangelical who is sold on Klobuchar.
“I'm from the Midwest so she really resonates with me," she said.
Breitbarth-Guidi brought her 5-year-old daughter, Lucy Guidi, to Klobuchar's primary night party, to satisfy the girl's burgeoning interest in politics. But she said that, come the general election, she will not be able to let her daughter watch the debates that include Trump.
“Because of the way he speaks to other people," she said. "We teach her, even if you don't like someone, you don't speak that way."
Klobuchar often says that the election will be a “patriotism check" and a “decency check" on Trump.
Klobuchar targeted Trump directly in her remarks Tuesday night, telling supporters that the president always blames others for his misfortunes.
“When I am behind that desk, I will take responsibility instead of passing it on," she said. “I will bring this country together instead of tearing it apart."
A sturdy, unflashy candidate who had announced her candidacy amid a Minnesota snowstorm a year and a day earlier, Klobuchar said she had been counted out many times over the past year.
“Tonight is about grit, and my story like so many of yours is one of resilience," she said. “America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people."
For much of the run-up to the New Hampshire primary, Klobuchar was polling low but steady, lagging behind four top rivals: Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren, and former vice president Joe Biden. Outpaced Tuesday night, Warren offered congratulations "to my friend and colleague Amy Klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out." The crowd watching the remarks at Klobuchar's party hooted in approval.
The two women represented the opposite poles of the Democratic field — Warren the progressive, to Klobuchar's Midwestern moderation — and shared a split endorsement from The New York Times that recognized the appeal of each approach to Democrats torn over the best strategy to counter Trump. But polls showed the other moderate candidates — Buttigieg and Biden — outpacing Klobuchar until recent days.
But by Tuesday, Biden was so far gone that he surrendered early, leaving the state well before the polls closed.
“I just don't feel like his heart is in it," said Deborah Goodwin, a 63-year-old retiree from Concord who voted for Sanders.
But like many Democrats on Tuesday, she expressed such deep disenchantment with Trump that she vowed to accept whichever Democrat prevailed as nominee.
“I would take Mickey Mouse. I would vote for anyone. I would vote for me," Goodwin said. “It could be anybody on the ballot, I would vote for them against Trump."

CELEBRATING HAIR FRIENDSHIP NATIVE WENDY WILLIS INVOLVED IN OSCAR-WINNING 'HAIR LOVE' ANIMATED SHORT

Texto completo: Watching the Oscars telecast Sunday at home with her husband and dog, there was a moment when Wendy Willis became, well, completely animated.
"And the Oscar goes to ."
"I screamed," said Ms. Willis, 42, who grew up in Friendship and graduated from North Catholic High School.
Ms. Willis is head of development at Six Point Harness, the Los Angeles animation company that produced all of the animation for "Hair Love."
The seven-minute Sony Pictures Animation film, a Kickstarter-funded project that became a viral sensation, won the Academy Award for animated short. Its victory, she said, was a victory for all involved.
"Hair Love" was written and directed by former NFL wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry, who wrote a New York Times bestselling children's book of the same name.
Zuri, a young African-American girl, is trying to style her abundance of natural curls. Even with the help of an online beauty guru, she cannot tame her hair.
Her father, Stephen, is clearly out of his depth as he gives it a shot.
It's a touching film that celebrates hair love among people of color. In addition, Stephen is a strong figure of black parenthood as he and Zuri work together to create a new style for an important occasion. He also wears his hair in dreads.
Mr. Cherry brought as his guest to the Dolby Theatre a young African-American high school student, DeAndre Arnold. Mr. Arnold was told by his Texas school district that, following a dress policy change, he would not be permitted to walk in his graduation ceremony if he didn't cut his dreadlocks.
"We wanted to normalize black hair," said Mr. Cherry after he and Karen Rupert Toliver accepted the statuettes. Ms. Toliver is a senior vice president of development for Sony animation.
An executive at Monkeypaw, Jordan Peele's production company, Mr. Cherry turned to Kickstarter in the summer of 2017 to raise funds for what he hoped would be a 3D animated film. He is also a director of outside projects, including ABC's "black-ish."
Although the original goal was to raise $75,000, by the end of the campaign $284,000 was in the coffers.
"They raised a lot of money, but not a whole lot," Ms. Willis said. Her job as one of the project managers involved keeping tabs on financing. "We convinced them that 2D was the way to do it," she added.
Six Point Harness kept track of production and quality control, among other challenges. Ms. Willis said, "Everyone worked incredibly hard, and we are really proud of ['Hair Love']. It was a labor of love. People would work their day jobs and come to 6 Point at night.
"It was so cool to see how people rallied to get it all done."
Ms. Willis' company has a long list of clients in film, television ("Adventure Time," "black-ish") and commercials (KIA automobiles). She more recently worked with her husband, Brendan Burch, on an original animation series called "Apollo Gauntlet," which airs on Adult Swim.
Ms. Willis, 42, said she hasn't spent much time back in Pittsburgh since leaving, but she does miss it. After trying classes at the University of Pittsburgh, she decided to move out to California in 1997, where she worked as an assistant to Castle Shannon native Jimmy Miller, an agent, a producer and a principal of the Mosaic Media Group.
From there it was New York City and a job at "Saturday Night Live."
"But that was right around the [2007-08] writers strike," Ms. Willis said, "and when that happened, the show shut down and I lost my job."
She returned to Los Angeles and Mosaic, where she met Mr. Burch. "It was mostly live action [film] there, but I was always the person at Mosaic who was most interested in animation."
Although the Oscars are over, there is still a celebration in the works: "I think we're doing a big party soon."

Texto completo: An editorial from
The Washington Post
Americans have lately been learning that the apps they use to check whether they need an umbrella, or follow their favorite sports team, or hurl one animated animal at another for points, are sucking up their location data and selling it. Now it turns out that it's not only advertising companies and other private entities that end up buying this information en masse from brokers. The U.S. government is doing it, too.
The Wall Street Journal wrote last week that federal agencies have purchased access to a virtual trove that charts the movements of millions of citizens' cellphones from a company called Venntel. The Department of Homeland Security and its components are reportedly harnessing this data for immigration enforcement: searching for activity in unexpected places to pin down smuggling rings, or detecting individuals who may have entered the country illegally.
Customs and Border Protection says it accesses only small quantities of the data on a case-by-case basis rather than examining the entire cache in bulk, and that the data is anonymized. But anonymity is a laughable concept when every individual's day can be turned into a traveling dot that follows a path only they take. A New York Times investigation in 2018 revealed how simple it is to connect a dot to the person it represents - whether that person is a NASA scientist or an undocumented mother recently arrived from Mexico.
Authorities may hope to pre-empt some concerns about civil liberties by alleging that they're training their eyes only on suspected noncitizens, but it's impossible to avoid roping in citizens, too, when information is requisitioned at so massive a volume. It's also impossible not to imagine what else, and who else, officials might seek to track, once they've come up with the legal rationale for doing so. Americans shouldn't have to rely on the good graces of the bureaucracy to protect them from overreach.
The rationale for warrantless surveillance in this case sidesteps Fourth Amendment law - or tries to. The Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v. United States that the government couldn't subpoena geographic data directly from cellphone companies without going through the courts, precisely because of that data's "depth, breadth and comprehensive reach." So the government started buying the exact same data from brokers on the open market instead, arguing that the purchases were fair game because any old company could make them.
This strategy is awfully cynical. Congress has failed to pass a comprehensive privacy statute that shields people from having their every move logged in a database such as the one in question today. Now this lack of privacy from corporate actors has become an excuse for government to bypass the right to privacy from the state that the Constitution is supposed to enshrine. The DHS insists this is legal. But should it be?

Texto completo: I'm not sure that Roger Ailes and Kim Kardashian have much in common, but I will say this: The two of them helped foist an extreme feminine aesthetic on women that lately has become a parody of itself.
I'm talking about false eyelashes.
Thanks to the hyper-primped women of Fox News, and the overexposed Kardashian clan, fake eyelashes are not just for women who make a living appearing on camera anymore. They are disturbingly ubiquitous.

Regular Josephines used to don the things for special occasions -- if at all. But fake eyelashes have burst out of their traditional habitat of red carpets, wedding aisles and proms and into regular life.
A few examples of where I have spotted them recently:
On my middle-aged checker at Gelson's Market. On a thirtysomething woman in yoga pants leaning against a wall on Speedway in Venice. On a twentysomething customer in ripped jeans buying cigarettes at 10 a.m. at the corner store by my house. On numerous women in line to pick up passports at the Federal Building in Westwood.
Sometimes, I see subtle but expensive lash extensions, small clumps individually glued on -- either on top of the lash line, or below it.
But usually the women I see are wearing very obvious strip lashes, affixed by adhesive to the top of their natural lash line.
I'm not the only observer disturbed by the trend.
"It's crazy," said makeup artist Vivian Baker. "Strip lashes are everywhere. I do think people are misusing them."
I called Baker on Monday at her home in Sherman Oaks to discuss the proliferation of this look because she is an expert on the topic. A makeup artist with more than three decades of experience, on Sunday she won an Oscar for "Bombshell," the film about the Fox News women who exposed Ailes' rampant sexual harassment. (Baker shared the makeup and hairstyling Oscar with hairstylist Anne Morgan and prosthetics wizard Kazu Hiro.)
The makeup in "Bombshell" is a striking metaphor for how the women of Fox News -- particularly the up-and-comers striving to fit the Barbie doll mold -- surrender themselves to a contrived aesthetic that is forced and not particularly beautiful, but is meant to convey the idea of beauty.
"The whole Fox look was created to deal with those cameras and lights," Baker said. "It was very technical: This is how we look glamorous." Also, she told the New York Times last year: "It has to fit a predetermined idea of what men think is pretty, more specifically what Roger Ailes thinks is pretty."
The idea that women felt they had to contort themselves to be presentable for a man who resembled nothing so much as a toad is tragic.
Gabriel Sherman, in his Ailes biography, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," interviewed a former Fox makeup artist, Karem Alsina, who said she grew suspicious when Fox anchors came to have their makeup done before private meetings with Ailes. "They would say, 'I'm going to see Roger, gotta look beautiful!'" Some would return with their makeup smudged.
Margot Robbie plays the fictional character Kayla Pospisil, a naive young woman -- religious, conservative and apparently gay -- who finds that the price of success at Fox is to pile on the lashes and submit to sexual predation.
As Kayla descends deeper and deeper into this hellish but potentially remunerative world, her makeup gets heavier and darker, her false eyelashes thicker and longer, until finally, as Morgan put it: "She took the bait and became that [Fox ideal]. I wanted her makeup to be the mask that the real girl was hiding behind." Her artificial lashes are at their densest during her moment of moral clarity, when she suddenly realizes that other Fox women not only knew about pervasive sexual harassment at the network, but failed to protect each other.
In fact, said Baker, she and Robbie agreed that Robbie's makeup would not be designed to enhance her natural beauty; it would be designed to "fit within what people at Fox expect someone to look like," i.e. fake lashes and glossy lips.
Certainly, without fake lashes, there would be no female Fox News aesthetic, no signature sultry Kardashian eye.
But why is everyone else trying to look like they're ready for their close-up?
Well, said Baker, because they are.
"It has to do with social media," she said. "Our faces are constantly on camera. We've created our own monster. Is this pressure coming from women or men? I'm not so sure we can just blame men."
Still, she said, the proliferation of false eyelashes "is jarring and misleading."
"As a makeup artist and a woman, I want us to embrace all types of our beauty, to get up in the morning and have no makeup on and know there is something really beautiful about that really raw look. I want there to be freedom for women. How can we have dignity and love and appreciation, and not this stamp of 'This is what I must look like to be accepted?'"
Save the lashes for the red carpet, ladies. You are beautiful just as you are.

CULTURE MONSTER; MUSIC REVIEW; 'Art of Fugue' now and then; Bach and John Cage? Yes, there's a connection

Texto completo: The news Sunday afternoon was a prodigious live performance of arguably the least performable and unarguably greatest contrapuntal exercise in the history of music, Bach's "The Art of the Fugue," by Daniil Trifonov at Soka Performing Arts Center in Aliso Viejo. Only 28, he is already one of the world's most remarkable pianists. The legend grows.
The news Sunday night was that not every Hollywood star was an Oscar ceremony parasite. At the Hollywood gallery LAXart, exactly one mile from the Oscars' Dolby Theatre, Julian Sands read the news as part of a performance of John Cage's "Speech." Sands was once a quite believable Liszt in the unjustly neglected 1991 George Sand biopic, "Impromptu." Here he did Cage justice.
Yes, that was an amusing Sand/Sands coincidence. But it doesn't come anywhere close to the extraordinary other news Sunday.

It just so happens that LAXart, at Santa Monica Boulevard and Orange Drive, is on the site of a legendary RCA Victor studio where Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Stravinsky, Nat King Cole -- you name 'em -- famously recorded. The studio, which burned down in 2012, was presumably where 85 years ago, pianists Richard Buhlig and Wesley Kuhnle made the first recording of "The Art of the Fugue."
Buhlig, furthermore, was Cage's first composition teacher, and Cage was asked to turn pages for one of the recording sessions. It was a disaster. As Cage recalled, he became so fascinated looking at Bach's counterpoint, he forgot to listen.
All of this remarkably relates, because "The Art of the Fugue" is an example of what the Germans call Augenmusik, or eye music. The term became a pejorative for the graphic scores of the 1950s avant-garde by the likes of Cage.
Bach wrote "The Art of the Fugue" during his last decade as simply (not that anything is simple about this work) four separate musical staves without indication of instrumentation. He completed 13 fugues, each more mind-bogglingly complicated than the last, all based on the same subject. That subject goes through the contrapuntal wringer, played normally and turned upside down, slowed down and sped up (sometimes at the same time), embellished, chromatically altered, and so on.
The lines of counterpoint pile up mercilessly. Unraveling it all is a mon- umental analytic task, one more for the intellect than the ear. But the score does pretty much fit the hands, making it the province of keyboard players (although it has also been taken up by string quartets and ensembles of all sorts). Plus, playing it has a mystique. The 14th and most elaborate fugue was never finished, and although not all historians buy the theory, the lore is that Bach died at that moment writing it. There is no easier way to break a listener's heart than to stop a performance, as is usually done, in midphrase.
The actual playing of "The Art of the Fugue" is then nothing Bach would have ever imagined, and it becomes an act of creative interpretation. There are those who are cool and crisp, as were Buhlig and Kuhnle. (Although Victor never released the recording, the shellacs from the sessions survived and were assembled for a CD on a British boutique label, Pearl, now out of print and rare.)
There are those who treat it as Bach's last testament, to be played with slow spiritual ardor, as can be found in recordings by Russian pianist Tatiana Nikolayeva and German organist Helmut Walcha. Glenn Gould sought out curiosities. Harpsichordist Bob van Asperen decorates his new recording with playful ornamentations. Pianists Charles Rosen and Pierre-Laurent Aimard made recordings of a structural strength and contrapuntal transparency that are ideal for studying.
Also a composer, Trifonov turns "The Art of the Fugue" into a genuine concert work in ways no one before seems to have. He doesn't give equal length to contrapuntal lines. He doesn't bog a listener down with trying to pick out all three or four or five or six musical things flying by at the same time.
He instead puts emphasis on the theme coming and going as if it were a character in a novel having a host of adventures. The counterpoint flies by in the background. But you know it's there, a thicket full of wonders.
Trifonov was often fast. He exhibited the fluidity and flair of a Romantic pianist and of a modern pianist. He could be somber. He could be extravagant. He could be clever. He could be epic. He couldn't stop being dramatic. And, most of all, he was stunningly in command. It was all ear music.
Although not so credited in the program, Trifonov completed the final fugue to provide a triumphant ending. His is not the first folly to sound like Bach. But he got away with it.
The momentum for the 90-minute performance, broken up by an intermission, was such that the train had left the station, and if Bach couldn't keep it going, Trifonov had no choice other than to pilot. One cheered him on without second thoughts. Having heroically arrived, he gave thanks with Myra Hess' arrangement of Bach's "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" and encores by three Bach sons, who were the ones who put "The Art of the Fugue" together after their father died.
Nothing could have seemed more different than being in a Hollywood gallery three hours later for a special free Sunday night concert by the Monday Evening Concerts series. Cage's "Speech" was the second half. First the Echoi Ensemble performed French artist Yves Klein's "Symphonie Monoton-Silence," which is nothing more than 20 minutes of a drone in D followed by 20 minutes of silence. That is to say, it is one note out of the thousands in "The Art of the Fugue" and one rest extravagantly slowed down.
And yet, the crowd sat in exactly the same enthralled silence as had Bach aficionados at Soka, with nary a flu-season cough at either concert. Instrumentalists and singers lined the back of the gallery. The drone was its own sonic forest, one of small sounds with overtones and different timbres subtly in play. The silence that followed was then rather a meditation, an occasion for alertness to unexpected faint sounds always around us but seldom discoverable.
Cage's "Speech," which is for reader and five radios, is a series of time-based instructions for turning on and off the radios at chance-determined times and for reciting the news in the same way. The radio stations can be whatever. The reader makes his own selections. Twenty years after his page-turning fiasco, Cage made a piece free of turning but not timing.
Sitting at table with sections from The Times, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, a deadpan Sands, putting his faith in the material, read about goings-on in Washington, of visual art reports and an amusingly snarky review of "Birds of Prey." With the background of opera, rap, rants and religion coming out of the radios, the world seemed as upside down and turned around as the score of a Bach fugue that doesn't tell you how to go about making it music.

Texto completo: Wednesday: Last week, hundreds of volunteers around California fanned out to count homeless populations. Also: The latest on Kobe Bryant's death.
Good morning.
(Don't get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up .)
It felt a bit like driver's ed, with the harsh fluorescent lights overhead and the disposable cups of industrial-grade coffee in our hands.
In a video playing at the front of the room, a pleasant voice explained how to identify a person experiencing homelessness: You simply remember, "A, B, C," for appearance (layered clothing and disheveled hair, for instance), behavior (sleeping on the ground), and condition (refers to a vehicle, perhaps with its windows covered).
Around me, dozens of volunteers listened, just closely enough to get the idea.
It was Thursday night, in the basement of Echo Park United Methodist Church, and we were waiting to go out, clipboards in hand, to help perform the annual count of Los Angeles's homeless population.
Last week, similar point-in-time counts of homeless populations took place around the state.
Like the census, the counts are federally mandated and imperfect, and the results help determine how and where money flows.
Gov. Gavin Newsom participated in the count in San Diego, where he lauded volunteers for "stepping up and being part of the solution."
This year, the counts took place against the backdrop of a housing emergency that has reshaped life across the Golden State and dominated the attention of policymakers at every level.
In the Echo Park neighborhood of L.A., near where I live, tensions had been rising over an encampment in a grassy clearing on the northern edge of Echo Park Lake. Though city officials have said the area needs to be cleaned, residents and activists have said unpredictable sweeps and citations are really meant to push the unhoused out of a public space.
Some of the volunteers said they were planning to join residents of the encampment in a protest the next morning. The count, they said, was an important way of ensuring officials confront the full scope of homelessness in their communities.
More broadly, volunteers told me it was the magnitude of the crisis they saw every day that moved them to spend four hours of their evenings looking for people sleeping in alleys or doorways and counting tents.
Ceraun Loggins, 29, told me they moved from Washington, D.C., in April. They bike to work, and seeing the number of people living on the streets, they said, "was a punch to the gut."
Joining the count seemed like a simple way to help.
"It's like one of these invisible mechanisms," they said. "You don't think about how it has to happen."
After the short video, there was a mildly chaotic shuffle as the volunteers broke into groups of two to four. Each team was assigned a census tract. Some were walkable. Some, tucked higher into the hills, required a car.
The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority gathers more specific demographic information about who is experiencing homelessness in a separate survey.
This time, though, we were told to count visually -- not to engage.
I tagged along with a group of four, all in our 20s or 30s. We walked to our narrow rectangle tract, which was lined by quiet apartment buildings set back above the street.
We saw a woman rifle through a trash can before continuing down the sidewalk. She nodded at us and said something quietly as she passed. We nodded back but didn't ask where she was headed.
A member of our group, Chloe English, 29, made a mark on the form.
"Well, we got a grand total of one," she said at the end of our route. She paused. "It's a nice thing we only encountered one."
Of course, in another tract, that most likely would have been different.
Still, I was struck by how the task felt mundane, and enormous at the same time: There aren't people living in their cars or sleeping outside on every block in L.A. County. But someone has to check every block to know.
On Sunday morning, I visited the encampment by the lake at the center of the protest. Residents sat outside their tents and chatted.
I asked Jasmine Martinez, a 33-year-old Angeleno who said she's lived in the camp for about four months, whether she'd heard anything about the point-in-time count. She hadn't.
Ms. Martinez said she had been spending her time struggling to navigate the labyrinth of services available to people experiencing homelessness. She was seeking therapy and trying to access housing vouchers.
In the meantime, she said, she felt safe in the park -- safer than she did on Skid Row or in shelters.
"Here, we have a family," she said. "A lot of us are growing up on our own."

Texto completo: Lulu Wang's indie hit is streaming on Amazon. And a new nature series debuts on the Smithsonian Channel.
What's Streaming
THE FAREWELL (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. While it may not have garnered any Academy Award nominations, this comedic drama from Lulu Wang netted a Golden Globe for its star, Awkwafina, and was among the highest-grossing indie movies of 2019. Based on an experience from Wang's own life (or, as the film puts it, "based on an actual lie"), "The Farewell" casts Awkwafina as Billi, a young, creative New Yorker who learns that her overseas grandmother (played by Zhao Shuzhen) has a terminal illness. Billi travels with her parents to the northern Chinese city of Changchun, where her grandmother lives, but not before reluctantly agreeing to terms set by the rest of the family: Nobody is permitted to tell the matriarch about her illness. What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film "has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Much of the charm and power of this story -- about events leading up to a wedding that's also a fake funeral of sorts -- come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone."
TOY STORY 4 (2019) Stream on Disney Plus; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. On Sunday, "Toy Story 4" became the second movie in the series to win an Academy Award for best animated feature. ("Toy Story 3" won in 2010; the first two were released before the category existed.) Like its predecessors, "Toy Story 4" assembles Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and their plastic cronies for an adventure -- this time one that involves a road trip and a spork with a death wish (Forky, voiced by Tony Hale). "The animation is striking, the jokes amusing and the story sweet," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, "though this being Pixar, the tale is also melancholic enough that the whole thing feels deeper than it is." She deemed the movie "great-ish."
What's on TV
BIG CAT COUNTRY 8 p.m. on Smithsonian Channel. This new nature series centers on two prides of lions along the Luangwa River in Zambia, dramatically narrating their hunts and power struggles. (An example: "A herd of buffalo is coming to drink. The herbivores don't see the lions ... Until it's too late.") In other words: "Cats" this is not.
WATCHMEN (2009) 6:30 p.m. on IFC. Those who watched HBO's recent, radically reimagined TV riff on Alan Moore's "Watchmen" graphic novel can see a very different take on the material in this film adaptation, which was directed by Zack Snyder. With a cast that includes Billy Crudup and Carla Gugino, this version adheres more closely to the graphic novel than HBO's version -- but wasn't nearly as well received by critics.

Texto completo: If the Taliban fulfill a promise to reduce violence, the United States would then sign a deal that would begin the gradual withdrawal of American troops.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- More than 18 years after the United States invaded Afghanistan, President Trump has conditionally approved a peace deal with the Taliban that would withdraw the last American troops from the country, potentially beginning the end of America's longest war, according to Afghan and American officials.
But the deal will only be signed if the Taliban prove their commitment to a durable reduction of violence over a test period of about seven days later this month. If the Taliban do end hostilities and a deal is signed, the United States would then begin a gradual withdrawal of American troops, and direct negotiations would start between the Taliban and Afghan leaders over the future of their country.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed Afghanistan's top leaders in separate phone calls on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had given tentative approval to this approach, according to a senior Afghan official briefed on one of the calls.
A senior American official aware of the developments also confirmed Mr. Trump had given his preliminary approval for a deal on Monday, dependent on a cessation of violence, the same day he visited Dover Air Force Base to receive the remains of the latest American fatalities in the war, which has killed tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 3,500 American and coalition troops since the United States drove the Taliban from power in 2001.
A senior diplomat in Washington described the deal as 95 percent agreed to in principle, but that the possibility of a final agreement will become clearer in a matter of couple weeks.
A senior Taliban official informed of the negotiations said there were now "positive movements," but declined to discuss details because the group's internal deliberations were continuing.
While the move could mark a significant moment in Mr. Trump's pledge to end what he has described as "endless wars," the talks have long remained fragile and previously broke down just as a signing was near.
After nearly a year of negotiations, the two sides were on verge of a similar deal last September. Mr. Trump suddenly called off the talks, citing a Taliban attack that killed an American and NATO soldier and nearly a dozen Afghans. But officials said it was largely because Mr. Trump's grand gesture of inviting the Taliban to Camp David to finalize the deal fell apart.
After that, it took months of trust-building work, including a prisoner swap, to get back to the negotiating table.
The deal's details -- including the timeline of the troop withdrawal and how much of the agreement had changed since the two sides were on verge of a signing last September -- remained tightly guarded.
"This is a welcoming development and I am pleased that our principal position on peace thus far has begun to yield fruitful results," President Ashraf Ghani said in a statement announcing his call with Secretary Pompeo. "Our primary objective is to end the senseless bloodshed."
Mr. Ghani said Mr. Pompeo had informed him of "notable progress made in the ongoing peace talks" and of the "Taliban's proposal with regards to bringing a significant and enduring reduction in violence."
Abdullah Abdullah, the Afghan government's chief executive who had also received a call, said Mr. Pompeo had "expressed optimism that a reduction in violence and progress with current talks could lead to an agreement."
For the past month, American negotiators, led by the veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad, have been camped out in the Gulf state of Qatar, trying to persuade the Taliban to come to terms.
The most recent sticking point had been an American demand for the Taliban to significantly reduce their attacks across the country during the signing and after -- when the peace process moves to its next stage. The Taliban have signaled their willingness to sit down with the Afghan government and other leaders to discuss the political future of the country -- but only after the Americans agree to leave the country.
Aboard Air Force One on the way to the ceremony on Monday at Dover Air Force Base, Mr. Trump discussed his Afghanistan strategy with a small group of aides and supporters, including Ivanka Trump, his daughter, and Senator Rand Paul, a Republican of Kentucky who is among the Senate's most staunch voices against keeping American troops in Afghanistan.
"I absolutely believe his sentiment is an overall desire not to be involved in a war," Mr. Paul said in an interview in his office on Tuesday, adding that the president had witnessed a "very emotional" event in Dover the evening before.
Mr. Paul added that while he believed the president wanted to ultimately issue a green light for troop withdrawal, he was skeptical about the amount of support he would receive from his other close allies in Congress.
"We're dominated by people who want unlimited checks to the military and never-ending intervention," Mr. Paul said.

Texto completo: Mr. Bennet, a senator from Colorado, took a middle path in the race for the Democratic nomination. He failed to make gains in the polls and with donors.
Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who campaigned for president on a promise to fix a broken Washington, ended his bid for the Democratic nomination on Tuesday after a dismal showing in the New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Bennet had staked all his hopes on New Hampshire, holding 50 town hall events there in the 10 weeks leading up to the primary and campaigning exclusively there in the final stretch, even on the night of the Iowa caucuses.
But early results showed him with only 0.3 percent of the vote. Write-in candidates had more.
"I feel nothing but joy tonight as we conclude this campaign and this chapter," Mr. Bennet tweeted after announcing his departure. "Tonight wasn't our night. But New Hampshire, you may see me once again."
Mr. Bennet, 55, a former school superintendent, managed to raise his national profile during his bid, but he paddled along while others sped ahead. His bet was that a grass-roots campaign could lift him: dozens of town hall events, unscreened audience questions, direct contact with voters.
But he failed to register in polls, which kept him out of every debate after July, and he crisscrossed primary states with a staff far smaller than some of his opponents.
He was also hampered by his late entry: He joined a Democratic field that had already swelled to 20 candidates. Just as he was set to declare his candidacy, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and paused to undergo surgery before announcing a run for the White House.
Mr. Bennet took a middle path in the race, and often warned that the Democratic Party was at risk of moving too far to the left. On health care, he touted his Medicare-X health plan, which would build on the Affordable Care Act but not upend the current system, a contrast to more progressive proposals. On immigration, he opposed decriminalizing illegal border crossings, while candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Julián Castro, the former housing secretary who has since left the race, said they supported such a move.
He argued that his "Real Deal" agenda was more broadly appealing than other candidates' platforms, and leaned hard on an endorsement from James Carville, the lead strategist behind Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, who said he was scared that the other Democratic candidates could not defeat President Trump.
Mr. Bennet's pitch was, more than anything, a return to normalcy. "If you elect me president, I promise you won't have to think about me for two weeks at a time," he tweeted in August.
He had a small breakout moment in early January, before his campaign announcement, when he gave a fiery speech on the Senate floor, excoriating his Republican colleague Ted Cruz and shouting repeatedly as he accused Mr. Cruz of shedding "crocodile tears" over unpaid government workers. The speech was viewed millions of times online, but it failed to gain him the support he needed.
Mr. Bennet's maternal grandparents were immigrants who fled the Warsaw Ghetto, eventually moving to New York. As a senator, he was best known for helping to craft a sweeping immigration reform bill in 2013. The legislation, which would have provided more than $ 46 billion to bolster border security while also carving a path to citizenship, passed in the Senate but never made it to the House.
Mr. Bennet's younger brother, James, is the editorial page editor of The New York Times. Last year, The Times said in a statement that James Bennet would recuse himself "from any work generated by the opinion desk related to the 2020 presidential election." The arrangement was expected to last for as long as Michael Bennet was a candidate in the race.

Re "The Lesson of Our Rescue Dog" (Op-Ed, Feb. 4):
Bravo to Margaret Renkl! Her poetic writing, compassion and courage brought tears to my eyes and hope to my soul.
Using the pain and terror of her traumatized, wounded rescue dog is indeed an apt metaphor for all of us trying to live and cope in these traumatic days when compassion, kindness and justice seem to have flown the coop for all species.
Nurturing the arc of the moral universe toward justice will take standing up to the bullies who continue to use their power to beat, starve and wound. Dispensing kindness and fairness whenever and wherever we can is both our hope and our moral duty.

Texto completo: Is modern architecture a "hideous cultural atrocity"? Is insisting on classical buildings the hallmark of a dictatorship? Readers engage in an aesthetic and philosophical debate.
To the Editor:
Re "What's So Great About Fake Roman Temples?" (editorial, Feb. 9), criticizing a proposed executive order that would make classical architecture the default style for new federal buildings:
Everyone can admire the historical legacy of classical architecture, but its time is past. It's as absurd to insist that every building wear classical dress as it would be to require public officials to don knee breeches and wigs. America is a country that has long embraced progress and freedom; conformity and a single official style are the hallmarks of dictatorships.
Inventive, socially responsible architects flourished in Germany and the Soviet Union in the 1920s, enriching lives and creating buildings that are now acclaimed as classics. Hitler and Stalin suppressed modernism as an alien assault on traditional values and required that all but a handful of buildings follow traditional models. Talent was suffocated or driven into exile.
In the United States as in Europe, most people like what they know and are challenged by the new. But they can be won over by the experience of public buildings that are transparent and infused with natural light -- as in the federal courthouses commissioned under the Design Excellence Program. We need more such programs and more challenges to conformity, not a dull repetition of colonnades and pediments.

To the Editor:
Re "Decreeing Classical Buildings for U.S." (Arts pages, Feb. 6):
I passionately applaud the proposed policy of restoring Greco-Roman architecture to its rightful place as the standard for public buildings in America. "Modern architecture" is not architecture. It is a hideous cultural atrocity; it is the negation of beauty and goodness; it has crushed the human soul beneath the weight of its Brutalist concrete.
Ever since the tragic rise to influence of Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and their kindred cabal, modern architects have blighted cities around the world with ugliness. Boston City Hall and Empire State Plaza in Albany are only two of many egregious examples.
The last architects in America who knew how to get it right were McKim, Mead and White, and they were working over a century ago. One of their masterpieces was the old Penn Station, the demolition of which was a crime. Does anyone really think that the new Penn Station is an improvement?
For two and a half millenniums, Greco-Roman architecture has been synonymous with the dignity of democracies and republics. It is being true to our roots to maintain this style of public architecture in our nation today.

To the Editor:
I recall the comment of Prince Charles about the plans for the modernist addition to the National Gallery in London: "What is proposed is like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend."
At the same time, I have been to enough Soviet-era "people's palaces" to shudder at the prospect of official style. I agree wholeheartedly with those who are pushing back against any "official" architectural style, but at the same time I get that we can do better when designing our public buildings.
Enough of the starchitects? Form may follow function, but form also communicates a message. Buildings that resemble fortresses are not welcoming. Those that turn their backs to the street deaden the surrounding neighborhood. A courthouse designed to convey equal justice under the law and transparency might be preferred over one that looks Kafkaesque.
I say, let a hundred flowers bloom, and resist dogma (architectural and otherwise), but avoid buildings that to the public appear to be more towers of ego and arrogance than places that reflect what goes on inside or that convey the openness of our society.
Donald F. Billings

To the Editor:
There's now hard science to support President Trump's draft executive order. Today we know that modern architecture stresses the human brain. It's actually harder for people to look at, take in or even make a memory of any modern building compared with a classical or traditional one. We also know that it is harder for people to walk down a modern street lined with glassy skyscrapers than a traditional one lined with four-story brownstones.
Today we can use biometric tools like eye trackers, following eye movements, and galvanic skin responders, following electrical charges, to monitor our physical responses to built environments, recording in milliseconds how stressful or soothing they are. These tools show why banning modern architecture actually makes some sense and could promote a healthier public and civic realm.
Steve Jobs once said, "The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have." That kind of thinking drove his company to stratospheric success; imagine applying it to creating the human habitat.
Is working to transform modern architecture really "un-American," as your editorial implies? Or is it actually revolutionary, what America is all about?
I'll go with the latter.

To the Editor:
Perhaps Americans should be grateful that the draft executive order "Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again" does not require (at least so far) that new federal buildings be emblazoned with "TRUMP" in gilt lettering.

Texto completo: Mr. Yang, an entrepreneur with no previous political experience, mounted a long-shot presidential campaign that promoted a universal basic income and persisted well beyond expectations.
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur with no previous political experience who evangelized a universal basic income and warned of the perils of automation, ended his longer-than-long-shot bid for president on Tuesday night after a yearslong campaign that endured even as those of members of Congress and governors dropped out.
Speaking to supporters inside a ballroom as New Hampshire's primary results were coming in, Mr. Yang said "endings are hard" and that he had intended to stay in the race until the end.
"I am the math guy, and it's clear from the numbers we're not going to win this campaign," he said. "So tonight I'm announcing that I am suspending my campaign."
Mr. Yang had spent considerable time and resources in the state and was banking on the support of its many independent voters. He had signaled in recent interviews and emails to supporters that he would need to vastly outperform expectations in the Granite State for his campaign to continue.
The end came a week after Mr. Yang, 45, failed to win any pledged delegates in the Iowa caucuses despite spending a significant share of his war chest on ads there.
Mr. Yang's decision to exit the race closes out one of the Democratic primary's most surprising story lines, removing a candidate who developed a fiercely loyal following of disaffected voters from across the ideological spectrum and intrigued even skeptics with his wit, levity and relentless positivity.
As Mr. Yang announced his decision Tuesday night -- noting that he did not want to continue to accept donations "in a race we will not win" -- there were audible groans.
But a moment later, a supporter yelled: "We still love you, Andrew!" The crowd immediately broke into cheers and began chanting his name.
"Thank you so much, New Hampshire -- I love you, too," he said. "Being your candidate has been the privilege of my life."
As he approached the end of his speech, the crowd began a different chant: "2024! 2024!"
The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Mr. Yang was one of about a half-dozen viable Asian-American candidates to ever run for president. He became something of an involuntary torchbearer for Asian-Americans as he grappled with how to discuss his identity on the trail and how to address and confront racism.
It was Mr. Yang's plan to give every American adult $ 1,000 a month, though, that formed the foundation and rationale for his run.
Aware that a candidate beginning with essentially no name recognition and few traditional credentials would face stiff odds, Mr. Yang often told audiences that he had not initially wanted to run for president, because he was not "crazy."
But he would add that during a trip to Washington, he was told that if he wanted the government to do anything about job loss caused by automation, he would need to bring a "wave" crashing down on the heads of bureaucrats. His run for president, he said, amounted to that wave.
Mr. Yang enjoyed steady growth from under the radar as higher-profile candidates absorbed the media scrutiny and attacks from rivals that came with that status.
But two days after Mr. Yang's underwhelming performance in Iowa, his campaign laid off dozens of staff members from a team that had ballooned from fewer than a dozen people to over 200.
Despite having raised more than $ 30 million over the course of his presidential campaign -- a remarkable sum for a political outsider -- Mr. Yang's team had only $ 3.7 million in cash on hand at the start of this year, according to federal filings.
In an email to supporters last week, he suggested he would need to finish in the top four in the New Hampshire primary for the campaign to get "the boost" it needed -- a goal he failed to achieve.
Mr. Yang's base of political support consisted mostly of young and male voters -- some progressive, some who previously supported President Trump, and many in between. His departure from the race could aid Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whom many of Mr. Yang's most loyal fans said they had voted for in 2016.
But given that Mr. Yang's support in the polls never exceeded the mid-single-digits, no candidate is likely to be significantly helped by his exit. Indeed, at rallies and town halls throughout the primary, many members of the so-called Yang Gang said they had never been involved in politics before encountering Mr. Yang.
His plans moving forward were not immediately clear, though senior campaign officials would not rule out a return to politics. "We are just getting started," Zach Graumann, Mr. Yang's campaign manager, said Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters later in the evening, Mr. Yang was asked if he would consider running for mayor of New York City. "I wouldn't rule anything out," he said.
Early in his campaign -- sometimes in front of audiences of a few dozen people or less -- Mr. Yang, the Schenectady, N.Y.-born former head of a test-prep company and a nonprofit organization, often sounded the alarm about what he called the "fourth industrial revolution."
Automation, he warned, would bring mass unemployment, chaos and even violence if no remedy were pursued; free money combined with a more humane economic system, he argued, would buffer American society against its worst effects and help restore people's dignity.
The candidate and a small campaign staff labored in relative obscurity for about a year until last February, when Mr. Yang went on a popular podcast and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight. From there, he began a slow but steady rise, raising millions of dollars each quarter and moving from less than 1 percent in the polls to 4 and 5 percent early this year. His political operation grew and formalized.
Unlike several more experienced candidates, Mr. Yang qualified for all of the 2019 Democratic debates, and he appeared to grow more comfortable on the trail and the debate stages.
By the time the Iowa caucuses arrived, Mr. Yang was one of just 11 candidates in the Democratic field, which had at one point ballooned to two dozen.
But Mr. Yang's modest rise also coincided with increased scrutiny of his policy proposals, his past treatment of employees and his handling of topics like race and gender. The news media began digging into the cost of his universal basic income proposal; he was criticized for saying at a debate, "I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors"; and he faced claims of gender discrimination from campaign volunteers and past employees.
Still, when Mr. Yang ostensibly kicked off his campaign in February 2018 by announcing it in an article in The New York Times, few would have expected him to make a run so deep into the primary.
Mr. Yang seemed self-aware enough to comprehend this. At a debate in December that had been winnowed down to seven candidates, Mr. Yang earned laughs when he remarked, "I know what you're thinking, America: How am I still on this stage with them?"
In an interview last week, he reflected on his two years on the trail.
"Supporters come up to me just about every day and say, 'Thank you, this campaign lifted me out of a depression,' or 'Thank you, this campaign made me feel so much better about my future,"' he said. "It's really incredible."
"And while you're running, you don't really reflect on these things because you're trying to get to the next benchmark," he continued. "But it's very touching that this campaign has touched other people. It is something that I had hoped for, but I didn't realize what it would feel like to actually see it."

Texto completo: In a wave of merger mania, the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers moved closer to becoming a significant rival to AT&T and Verizon.
A bigger-is-better mentality has swept the tech and media industries over the past 18 months, as companies have spent $ 200 billion on a series of megamergers that have reshaped the American business landscape.
The Trump administration has mostly been a cheerleader for the corporate supersizing. And on Tuesday a federal judge ruled in favor of T-Mobile's planned takeover of Sprint.
The long-in-the-works merger would combine the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, creating a telecommunications giant to take on AT&T and Verizon. The new company, to be called T-Mobile, would have about 100 million customers.
The deal has come about as digital technology has woven itself into the fabric of daily life, changing how people use their phones and forcing wireless carriers, television networks and movie studios to move away from the analog systems that once dominated the entertainment and communications industries.
In the ruling on Tuesday, Judge Victor Marrero of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected an unorthodox challenge to the deal led by attorneys general from 13 states and the District of Columbia.
The suit was brought in June after regulators at the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission approved the merger plan. The states argued that the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint would reduce competition, lead to higher cellphone bills and place a financial burden on lower-income customers.
Their arguments did not sway the judge. He praised T-Mobile in his ruling, calling it "a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes" and describing its business strategy as "undeniably successful."
The merger, which T-Mobile and Sprint hope to close by April 1, would be the latest in a wave of corporate deals. In June 2018, AT&T's bid to buy Time Warner was approved, giving the phone giant control of CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. film and TV studios. Shortly afterward, the Walt Disney Company beat out Comcast to buy the majority of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox empire. Late last year, Shari Redstone combined her family's two businesses, CBS and Viacom.
The new T-Mobile would be a formidable rival to AT&T and Verizon, the two largest wireless carriers in the country.
"Today was a huge victory for this merger," John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Known for his exuberant and often pugnacious leadership style, Mr. Legere made use of the court decision to take aim at AT&T and Verizon, using a special sobriquet for each: "Look out, Dumb and Dumber and Big Cable -- we are coming for you ... and you haven't seen anything yet!"
Marcelo Claure, the executive chairman of Sprint, said the court decision "validates our view that this merger is in the best interests of the U.S. economy and American consumers."
Letitia James, the New York attorney general and a key plaintiff in the case, warned on Tuesday that the deal would harm consumers.
Ms. James, who has argued that the merger would cost subscribers at least $ 4.5 billion annually, called the ruling "a loss for every American who relies on their cellphone for work, to care for a family member and to communicate with friends." She added that the deal was always about "massive corporate profits over all else."
T-Mobile and Sprint have said they do not plan to raise prices for at least three years.
Ms. James left open the possibility of an appeal, adding that her office "will continue to fight the kind of consumer-harming megamergers."
One potential snag remains: The California Public Utilities Commission, which governs telecommunications services in the state, has yet to sign off on the merger plan. Consumer groups in California have argued that T-Mobile's pledge to deliver faster service at affordable prices is unrealistic.
The commission is likely to issue a provisional decision within a few weeks and make a final call after a 30-day comment period. It could block the move, but a more likely outcome, based on recent rulings, would be for it to allow the companies to combine if they agreed to certain conditions. Those could include worker protections, price freezes and service guarantees for California residents.
The Communications Workers of America, a labor group, warned that the merger would put 30,000 jobs at risk. Regulators have "ignored clear evidence that this merger would result in significant job loss for wireless workers," Chris Shelton, the president of the organization, said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that T-Mobile workers "have become more determined than ever to join together and win union representation."
If the merger goes through, the majority of Sprint customers would end up having T-Mobile plans. Customers of Sprint's prepaid brands, including Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid, would become customers of Dish Network, a satellite TV company that has plans to move into telecommunications.
The original merger terms called for T-Mobile, the larger of the two companies, to effectively buy Sprint in an all-stock transaction that was earlier valued at $ 26.5 billion. Because of the lawsuit, the original deadline to complete the deal has passed, and T-Mobile has pushed to renegotiate the terms.
Both companies have portrayed the merger as crucial to their futures in an industry challenged by pricing wars that have undercut profits and stalled growth. By combining with Sprint, T-Mobile has said, it would be able to accelerate its development of 5G, the next generation of cellular networks.
AT&T and Verizon have also hailed the development of their own 5G networks, which bring faster-than-broadband speeds through the air. 5G is not a set technology standard, and each company offers its own version of the service.
The planned merger is also important to Sprint, which has bled cash and subscribers in recent years. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that controls the company, has been looking to raise cash for its newest tech investing fund.
The new T-Mobile would be led by Mike Sievert, the T-Mobile chief operating officer who is set to take over from Mr. Legere, the face of the company since 2012. Mr. Legere has said he will leave the company after his contract expires in April.
"Now we're laser-focused on finishing the few open items that remain, but our eye is on the prize: finally bringing this long-awaited merger and all the goodness it will deliver," Mr. Sievert said in the statement.
Mr. Legere and his Sprint counterpart, Mr. Claure, were once rivals whose companies needled each other in advertising campaigns and social-media posts. All was forgotten by April 2018, when the companies announced their intention to join forces.
The two executives made personal appeals to officials in Washington as they worked to secure approval for the merger. To get the nod from the government, T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to sell off significant portions of their businesses to Dish Network.
Mr. Legere made numerous visits to the F.C.C. and the Justice Department, and Mr. Claure was a host of a fund-raiser for Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is now a senator. Several lawmakers expressed misgivings over Mr. Legere's Washington visits, noting the dozens of times that he and other T-Mobile executives stayed at the Trump International Hotel. The companies have denied doing anything inappropriate.
Another key figure who stands to benefit from the deal is Masayoshi Son, the outspoken chairman of SoftBank. Mr. Son has been trying to offload the wireless carrier, a debt-laden business, for years.
In December 2016, Mr. Son met with Donald J. Trump, who was then the president-elect, at Trump Tower and pledged to invest some $ 50 billion in the United States in an initiative that would create 50,000 jobs.
Recently, Mr. Son has come under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management. SoftBank's investments in start-ups, including WeWork, have failed to deliver on some efforts, and Mr. Son has struggled to raise more cash for a new investment fund. Other investments, including SoftBank's bet on Uber, have been successful.
By the close of trading on Tuesday, Sprint shares jumped more than 77 percent, while T-Mobile shares rose more than 11 percent.

Expanding a Policy Before Curtailing It

Texto completo: The former New York City mayor claimed to have "inherited" the policing policy and cherry-picked data to claim a 95 percent reduction.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013 and now a Democratic presidential candidate, sought on Tuesday to explain comments he made in 2015 aggressively defending the policing tactic known as stop-and-frisk. Here's a fact check of his statement.
"I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95 percent, but I should've done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized -- and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and Latino communities."
This is misleading. Mr. Bloomberg's statement, while technically accurate, omits the role he played in expanding stop-and-frisk in New York City. His 95 percent reduction figure -- which the Bloomberg campaign said referred to his last two years in office -- papers over data showing that use of the technique initially expanded rapidly during his time in office and remained at a high level before declining. And it ignores that the decline he cited was at least in part the result of litigation and political pressure.
It's true that Mr. Bloomberg did not pioneer the tactic, which allowed police officers to stop people for questioning -- in practice, often young black and Latino men -- and to pat down their clothing. Stop-and-frisk has existed in cities across the country since at least the 1960s and was adopted in New York in the 1990s under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Data from before 2002 is limited because stops were not regularly reported under Mr. Giuliani. But New York Police Department reports obtained by the state attorney general's office as part of an investigation into the city's stop-and-frisk policy showed more than 130,000 recorded stops in 1998 and about or fewer than 100,000 in 1999, 2000 and 2001.
After Mr. Bloomberg took office, the number of recorded stops increased sevenfold to a high of 685,724 in 2011 from 97,296 in 2002, according to data from the Police Department compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union. In Mr. Bloomberg's last year as mayor in 2013, the police recorded 191,851 stops, a decline of about 72 percent from the 2011 peak or an increase of 97 percent from his first year in office. In all these years, more than 80 percent of those stopped were black or Latino.
Julie Wood, a campaign spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg, said his 95 percent figure refers to the decline from 203,500 stops in the first quarter of 2012 to 12,497 stops in the last quarter of 2013. That period accounts for two of Mr. Bloomberg's 12 years in office.
So Mr. Bloomberg is being "more than a bit disingenuous when he says he 'inherited' it," said Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist at Columbia University. "It would be more accurate to say that he took a policy in place and vastly and enthusiastically expanded it" during his time in office.
"What the statement fails to capture," said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, "is the magnitude of stop-and-frisk and the several yearslong period during which stop-and-frisk was through the roof."
Activists and minority communities repeatedly protested stop-and-frisk during Mr. Bloomberg's three terms as mayor. But he continued to defend the practice publicly until his foray into the presidential campaign.
During a 2009 mayoral debate, Mr. Bloomberg called stop-and-frisk "an effective tool to keep bringing crime down" and said the Police Department "has struck the right balance."
"We are not going to walk away from a strategy that we know saves lives," he said in the summer of 2012, adding that stop-and-frisk needed to be "mended, not ended."
Stops began to decline that year and more so in 2013, during a trial over stop-and-frisk in United States District Court in Manhattan. That August, a federal judge ruled that the practice was unconstitutional and "a form of racial profiling," calling for reforms that stopped short of ending its use.
"Throughout the case, we didn't believe that we were getting a fair trial," Mr. Bloomberg said in response to the ruling, accusing the judge of ignoring "the real-world realities of crime" and conveying "disturbing disregard for the good intentions of our police officers."
Mr. Bloomberg's administration went to great lengths to "prevent the injunction taking effect and extraordinary efforts to get it before the court of appeals before the city government changed hands," Ms. Lieberman said. For example, lawyers for the city requested and were granted a stay of the ruling, and later tried unsuccessfully to have the ruling vacated.
After leaving office, Mr. Bloomberg continued to defend stop-and-frisk. He told The New York Times in 2018 that the searches were effective at preventing crime and that "the courts found that there were not" civil rights problems with the tactics. In January 2019, he again attributed a decline in New York's murder rate to the policy, though the number of murders continued to decline despite the reduction in stops.
In November, Mr. Bloomberg reversed his position, declaring, "I was wrong."

Texto completo: As the former New York City mayor starts to rise in the polls as a Democratic presidential candidate, an audio recording of him defending the policy in 2015 is circulating widely on social media.
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- A recording of Michael R. Bloomberg in 2015 offering an unflinching defense of stop-and-frisk policing circulated widely on social media Tuesday, signaling that the former New York City mayor is about to face more intensive scrutiny as he rises in the polls as a Democratic presidential candidate.
While Mr. Bloomberg apologized for his administration's law-enforcement tactics in November just before he entered the race, he had previously spent years insisting that the policy was justified and effective, showing no indication that he had developed serious misgivings about stop and frisk. The policing tactic was used disproportionately against black and Latino people across New York City for years.
He offered a particularly blunt defense at the Aspen Institute in 2015: The Aspen Times reported then that Mr. Bloomberg said that crimes were committed overwhelmingly by young, male minorities, and that it made sense to deploy police in minority neighborhoods to "throw them up against the wall and frisk them" as a deterrent against carrying firearms.
An audio clip of those comments was posted on Twitter Monday by Benjamin Dixon, a progressive podcaster, who highlighted it with the hashtag #BloombergIsARacist.
"Ninety-five percent of your murders -- murderers and murder victims -- fit one M.O.," Mr. Bloomberg said in the recording. "You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York, that's true in virtually every city."
He went on, describing policing tactics and saying, "We put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes. That's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is."
A few minutes later, Mr. Bloomberg said the goal was to remove guns from the streets. "And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them," he said.
Mr. Bloomberg, in a statement Tuesday morning, argued that he had "inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk," and acknowledged that it was overused. "By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95%, but I should've done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized -- and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on Black and Latino communities," he said.
While stop-and-frisk policing began under Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudy Giuliani, it expanded dramatically under Mr. Bloomberg's administration. In 2013, a federal judge ruled that the policy represented "indirect racial profiling" and violated civil rights.
President Trump, who has supported the stop-and-frisk policing tactic and who has been criticized for statements widely criticized as racist, on Tuesday tweeted the audio recording of Mr. Bloomberg's remarks. In a Twitter post that he pinned to the top of his feed, Mr. Trump wrote, "Wow, Bloomberg is a total racist!" He deleted the post a short time later, but his campaign manager and his son, Donald Trump Jr., aggressively pushed the recording on social media.
In Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign for president, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's past use of stop-and-frisk and said it was an effective tool.
Mr. Bloomberg, in his statement, called Mr. Trump's deleted tweet "the latest example of his endless efforts to divide Americans."
"President Trump inherited a country marching towards greater equality and divided us with racist appeals and hateful rhetoric," Mr. Bloomberg said. "The President's attack on me clearly reflects his fear over the growing strength of my campaign. Make no mistake Mr. President: I am not afraid of you and I will not let you bully me or anyone else in America."
The highlighting of Mr. Bloomberg signals a change in approach for the broader Trump apparatus, which has mostly ignored Mr. Bloomberg even as the president has fretted about the billionaire's profligate spending. Mr. Bloomberg rose to third place in a national poll of the Democratic primary released Monday by Quinnipiac University.
Material like the audio recording is certain to continue surfacing as the campaign advances: Mr. Bloomberg has not been shy about expressing his views since leaving office in 2013, often at elite conferences before friendly audiences.
But he is seeking to win over a different audience now, making significant inroads among Democratic primary voters thanks to a massive and largely unanswered blitz of television advertising. It remains to be seen whether the appeal he has demonstrated so far can survive a more searching examination of his record.
Mr. Bloomberg's 2015 remarks were far from the most recent occasion when he stood foursquare behind stop-and-frisk: As late as the fall of 2018, when he was laying the groundwork to run for president as a Democrat, Mr. Bloomberg told The New York Times that the policy had deterred crime without violating anyone's civil rights, ignoring a court ruling to the contrary.

Texto completo: The former United States and Germany manager had pledged to save Hertha Berlin and transform it into a big city club. Ten games later, he is giving up.
BERLIN -- Jürgen Klinsmann, the former United States men's national soccer team coach, resigned as manager of the Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin on Tuesday, abruptly abandoning his project to transform the German club into a powerhouse after only 76 days in charge.
Klinsmann, 55, was hired in November, his first job since he was fired as the United States coach in 2017 amid an ultimately failed bid to qualify for the World Cup. In returning to club coaching, he all but promised to turn Hertha Berlin into a European power within years.
But 10 weeks later, and with only three wins in his 10 games, he shocked both Hertha's fans and the club by resigning months before the end of the season. Hertha Berlin lost, 3-1, to lowly Mainz on Saturday, and the prospect of the club's facing a humiliating -- and potentially financially ruinous -- relegation out of the Bundesliga, Germany's top division, is now a distinct possibility.
In both a personal Facebook post announcing his departure and in an interview later in the day with the tabloid newspaper Bild Zeitung, Klinsmann implied that he did not feel he had enough support from the club's leadership to continue in his post.
"There were simply different ways of thinking and, above all, different cultures," Klinsmann told Bild. In particular, he lamented not having more control over player transfers.
"Too much energy is spent on things that happen off the field," he said in the interview.
Hertha was 3-3-3 in league play under Klinsmann, leaving it marginally higher on the league table but still in danger of demotion to a lower league. Hertha currently sits in 14th place in the 18-team division, but it is only six points -- two wins -- out of the relegation zone.
The team's recent results are far from the turnaround Klinsmann had predicted when he took charge. Hertha spent a record $ 83 million on four new young players in the short winter transfer window, and Klinsmann's reputation as a former star striker for Germany and a host of top clubs, not to mention his unwavering optimism, produced plenty of positive headlines for a club not used to being noticed.
In an interview with The New York Times in January, he laid out a timeline that would have quickly returned Hertha to the top half of the standings and into European competitions.
"This season we want to avoid relegation," Klinsmann said then. "Next season we want to be in the upper half of the table, with the goal of making the Europa league. And then, who knows."
A couple of hours after Klinsmann resigned, the club confirmed that one of his assistants, Alexander Nouri, would take over in the short term. It was clear Klinsmann's resignation had come as a surprise to the club, its fans and its investors.
"I deeply regret the decision made by Jürgen Klinsmann," Lars Windhorst, a German businessman who made a major investment in the team last summer, wrote to The Times. Windhorst was credited with helping to bring Klinsmann aboard and supplying him with the funds to restructure the lagging team. Windhorst made an initial investment of $ 244 million and an implicit promise of more to come.
Although it has remained in the Bundesliga since 2013, Hertha, nicknamed the Old Lady, has long fought a reputation as a stale underachiever, especially for a capital city of its size.
"The city has become a global brand," Windhorst said. "And one would expect such a city to have a soccer club that is leading in Europe or at least Germany."
But Hertha Berlin has been far from that. Its home games, in drafty Olympic Stadium in Berlin, reach capacity only when more prominent teams visit, as was the case on Jan. 19 when Bayern Munich was in town (and beat Hertha handily, 4-0).
"In some parts of the city you can find more Dortmund Borussia pubs than Hertha fans," said Lucas Vogelsang, a Hertha fan and host of the popular podcast Fussball MML.
While exaggerated, the point is verifiable: In no other German city are the local clubs so underrepresented in daily city life as the two Berlin clubs -- Hertha and Union Berlin -- despite Berlin's dominant position in German society in nearly every other domain.
Klinsmann had hoped to take Hertha to prominence. But the fact that he announced his resignation with a Facebook post and not a more official channel underscored the tension he felt with the club's leadership, though he said he would return to Hertha's supervisory board, a post he held before agreeing to coach.
"Unity, cohesion and focus on the essentials are important elements, especially in a relegation battle," Klinsmann wrote. "If that is not guaranteed, I cannot exploit my potential as a trainer and therefore cannot live up to my responsibility."
As Klinsmann was attempting to turn the team around aggressively, Michael Preetz, the team's sporting director, suggested he had to rein in the manager's ambitions a bit.
"Perhaps my job is to step on the brakes from time to time," Preetz told Bild last month. "But that doesn't mean we are not rowing in the same direction."
But the club continued to see mixed results. After an extra-time loss to Schalke in the German Cup a week ago, Hertha lost on Saturday to Mainz, one of its main rivals in the battle to avoid relegation.
"It wasn't Bavaria, it wasn't Schalke, it wasn't Leverkusen," said Philipp Köster, the editor of the soccer magazine 11 Freunde, referring to the league's top teams. "It was a team that they should have been able to master."
That defeat, in particular, Köster said, undercut Klinsmann's invigorating message and presence.
"Jürgen Klinsmann likes to go all out in situations like this," Köster said. "But for that to work, you need support from everyone around you."
It was widely reported that Klinsmann wanted to negotiate a contract extension for next season and was disappointed when club management set those discussions aside.
"Management wanted to have a different kind of coach by the beginning of next season, and Klinsmann didn't just want to fill the gap," Vogelsang said.
Although Klinsmann was not available for comment on Tuesday, he is expected to return to his home in Southern California, where he has lived for more than two decades.
"I like to surprise myself," he said in January. "Somehow that is part of life."

Texto completo: The agency ordered Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft to turn over a decade's worth of information on small acquisitions.
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had ordered Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google's parent company and Microsoft to turn over information about past acquisitions, broadening its review of the power of big tech companies.
The F.T.C. said it had requested information about hundreds of smaller deals made by the five tech companies over the past decade that weren't required to be reported to regulators by law and could provide insights into antitrust abuses. Facebook, Google (whose parent company is Alphabet) and others have scooped up dozens of smaller tech firms over the years, many of them for less than $ 100 million.
"If during this study we see transactions that were problematic, all our options are on the table and it is conceivable we can initiate enforcement action with those deals," Joseph J. Simons, the F.T.C. chairman, said in a call with reporters. He added that the orders for information were separate from the F.T.C.'s continuing antitrust investigations into big tech companies but could inform the inquiries.
The actions escalate the scrutiny in Washington of the nation's largest technology companies. The Justice Department, Congress and state attorneys general are also examining whether Apple, Amazon and others acted in an anticompetitive manner in many different areas. Lawmakers have united around the issue, in a rare show of bipartisanship.
In examining the smaller deals, the F.T.C. signaled it was looking specifically into a tech industry practice known as "killer acquisitions," which smaller rivals have said was used to choke off competition. Under that strategy, the large tech companies buy a nascent competitor to protect their dominance and prevent the smaller company from growing into a bigger threat.
"The concern is that there were hundreds of acquisitions by big companies like Facebook and Google that were intended to nip in the bud the firms that might have ended up being important competitors and innovators that could have changed the paradigm," said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School and former antitrust official at the Justice Department.
The F.T.C. has made similar demands for information from the pharmaceutical and retail industries to explore how companies used pricing and ad strategies, for example, to harm consumers. But the request for information about past tech mergers was the first by the agency for Silicon Valley giants.
Notably, the F.T.C. mentioned in its announcement that it had asked for information from Microsoft. While Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have been under scrutiny by regulators since last year, Microsoft -- which battled and settled an antitrust case in the late 1990s -- had appeared to escape most of the current backlash.
Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google declined to comment. A spokesman for Microsoft said the company looked forward to "working with the F.T.C. to answer their questions." The companies could file motions to quash the F.T.C.'s requests.
"Google didn't invent YouTube. Facebook didn't invent Instagram. And the list goes on and on," Rohit Chopra, an F.T.C. commissioner and a Democrat, said in a tweet that referred to past acquisitions by Google and Facebook. "That's why I voted to order @Google, @Facebook, @Amazon, @Apple, & @Microsoft to hand over a decade of records about their buying binge."
The F.T.C.'s requests could generate a voluminous quantity of information.
In a sample order posted by the agency, it asked for internal documents related to the deals -- including analyses presented to top executives and the minutes of board meetings where the acquisitions were discussed. It asked questions about whether certain purchases were a "data acquisition" and about which venture capitalists and angel investors had stakes in the smaller companies.
The F.T.C. also said in its announcement that it would look at "agreements to hire key personnel from other companies." Silicon Valley companies are known to buy other, smaller firms as a way of bringing in key talent -- a practice known as "acqui-hiring."
The announcement immediately cast a pall over the stocks of the large tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite curtailed its gains on Tuesday, though it remained in positive territory. Facebook and Microsoft were particularly hard hit.
In a statement, Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is leading the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry into the tech giants, said the F.T.C.'s order was an "important step in correcting the decades of inaction by antitrust enforcement agencies that have led to consolidation in the digital marketplace."
Last month, executives of small companies like Sonos and PopSockets told members of the House committee that tech behemoths like Google and Amazon had harmed their businesses.
The Justice Department plans to hold a series of public discussions in Silicon Valley this week with venture capitalists. Panels at the event will focus on so-called kill zones -- when the dominance of one company renders attempts to start a competing firm useless -- and on investing in markets dominated by major internet platforms.
The broad range of interests by regulators highlights the issues facing the technology companies, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a progressive think tank.
"Other than the massive trusts of the late 1900s, I don't think antitrust enforcers have had to deal with the kind of strategic motivation for M&A that the tech platforms appear to have," she said.

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - The relentless whir of machines echoing across a cavernous French factory floor is an unexpected result of the deadly virus that has nearly paralyzed cities in China and other parts of Asia.
The company, Kolmi Hopen, makes an item that is suddenly one of the world's hottest commodities: the medical face mask.
The factory typically makes around 170 million masks a year, but in the last week orders arrived for a staggering half-billion, flooding the sales department's inboxes at the rate of one every two minutes. Kolmi Hopen is racing to hire more workers to keep the machines running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
"We're making masks as fast as we can," said Guillaume Laverdure, chief operating officer of Kolmi Hopen's parent company, Canada-based Medicom, as forklift drivers moved boxes of freshly finished masks into trucks.
"But demand is still rising," he added.
The coronavirus outbreak has set off a run on protective masks across China and in major cities. To curb the spread of the virus, the Chinese government has ordered citizens to don masks every time they go outside. Medical professionals said once used, a mask must be replaced with a fresh one, driving an explosion in demand. Grim scenes of people lined up for hours to get a protective face covering, only to be turned away when pharmacies run out, have become familiar.
"I can't find a single mask to buy," said Sandy Lo, 60, in Hong Kong. "I don't know what stores have stock anymore." She said she reuses old masks "because what else could I do?"
Most of the world's face masks are made in China and Taiwan. But factories there, including ones run by Medicom, have been forced to temporarily halt exports to comply with government demands to reserve them for frantic residents.
Last week, the Chinese government, conceding it was in urgent need of medical masks and other protective gear, said it would begin importing them from Europe, Japan and the United States to help make up for the shortfall.
It has made the Kolmi Hopen outpost in western France an unlikely hot spot. Phones at the factory have been ringing off the hook as medical supply buyers scour the globe for mask-makers.
Demand is especially strong for high-filtration respiratory masks, which can be more effective against the spread of virus-laden droplets than surgical masks, Laverdure said. Laverdure declined to discuss financial details, including the cost of the masks.
Scientists said there isn't much evidence that masks actually protect healthy people - hand washing may be more important.
Still, as the coronavirus spreads, with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths, experts fear that supplies of face masks and other sanitary protection items will run low in other countries - even for routine medical use. Pharmacies in the United States have begun reporting shortages.
The frenzy of orders at Kolmi Hopen shows the large-scale disruption China can create in the global supply chain for even the most specialized products, if factories there fail to operate at full strength.
China produces about half the world's sanitary face masks - around 20 million a day, supplying hospitals and medical workers in numerous countries. Taiwan makes up another 20% of the global supply.

Texto completo: My favorite rendering by the nonpareil cartoonist Julius Feiffer depicts a circa 1960s radio show host interviewing a spokesman for "the radical middle."
Asked to explain his views, the guest responds, "The radical middle thinks it's time we took the initiative in world affairs, while deploring the idea of change for change's sake. We oppose concessions to the Soviets. However, we favor negotiations and strongly support the U.N. We favor arms control and a continued buildup, a strong civil rights program without the undue haste which creates deep scars."
When the show's host urges the guest to sum up his philosophy, the latter fires back: "Bold times call for bold answers, within reason, in a manner of speaking. More or less."
Which brings us to the battle underway for the Democratic presidential nomination: a classic quandary only months from determining whether the current occupant remains in the White House for another four years. The choice seems to hinge on the question of whether a progressive or a moderate has a better chance of attracting sufficient undecided voters to defeat President Donald Trump.
Democrats are torn between candidates espousing sweeping social change - single-payer universal health insurance, forgiveness of college debt, free higher education - such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, or others offering little more than a post-Trump reversion to some semblance of normality, like Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar.
At virtually every critical juncture in United States history, the electorate rejects back-tracking to the way things were in favor of risking the unknowable.
In 1860, with Civil War looming as a probable consequence, the nation elected anti-slavery President Abraham Lincoln. In 1932, amid the Great Depression, voters chose Franklin D. Roosevelt over the opposition's fear that his New Deal programs would usher in the apocalypse. Democrats of all stripes today regard Trump's re-election bid as yet another precarious epochal crossroads.
Their dilemma is reflected in The New York Times' refusal to take sides in what its editorial board acknowledges is a battle for the party's soul. The Times staked out its own middle ground by pronouncing Klobuchar as the best moderate presidential candidate and Warren as its preferred progressive hopeful. "May the best woman win," the Old Gray Lady's non-endorsement editorial concluded.
No discussion of revolutionary centrism can overlook the fluidity of the middle, exemplified by the presidential candidacy of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. His very existence on the campaign trail - a gay Afghanistan war veteran and mayor of the fourth largest city in the 38th largest state - belies the notion that he represents the same old, same old in American politics.
Mayor Pete favors diminishing the probability of a conservative-leaning Supreme Court for a generation or more by increasing its membership. Never mind that, despite the aforementioned Roosevelt's overwhelming popularity, the electorate drew the line at the latter's similar effort to pack the Court. Buttigieg also calls for terminating the constitutionally mandated electoral college, the rigid anachronism that has given us two recent presidents - George W. Bush and Trump - who lost the popular vote.
When a presidential candidate seeking to overturn two 200-year precedents, one requiring a Constitutional amendment, is labeled as moderate - which Buttigieg has been - those viewing "radical middle" and "extreme moderate" as cheeky satire need to think again.

Texto completo: The Virginia legislature passed bills Tuesday that would make it harder to pursue frivolous lawsuits designed to chill free speech, a response to a string of splashy defamation cases filed in state courts by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), actor Johnny Depp and others.
Free speech advocates cheered the legislation in the House and Senate, saying the state's weak anti-defamation law has made Virginia a magnet for dubious litigation aimed at punishing critics and blunting aggressive media coverage on topics of public concern.
Nunes, Depp and other litigants have filed defamation cases seeking nearly $1 billion in damages in courts in Virginia over the past year. Their targets include CNN, the New York Times, Twitter, the actress Amber Heard, the Fresno Bee and a parody Twitter account in the voice of an imaginary cow.
Nunes and Depp both claim they have been wrongly smeared and say they have good reasons to pursue litigation in Virginia. But defendants and critics say the suits are without merit and the venues were chosen to take advantage of Virginia law.
They say the state does not have an effective mechanism for getting frivolous defamation suits dismissed quickly, meaning someone with deep pockets can harass a defendant with expensive and protracted litigation. Such cases are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP.
Virginia's new anti-SLAPP bills would afford defendants stronger protections. Provisions in the House and Senate bills would allow defendants to file a special motion to dismiss a lawsuit after it has been served, if the defendant believes the goal of the lawsuit is to stifle free speech on a topic of civic interest.
The move would pause discovery in cases, which is expensive and time-consuming, and trigger a hearing before a judge. If the defendant prevails on the motion to dismiss, the defendant would automatically be awarded attorneys' fees under the House bill or could be awarded them in the Senate version.
Del. Schuyler T. VanValkenburg (D-Henrico) said he sponsored the House bill because as a civics teacher, he was concerned about First Amendment rights being thwarted through litigation.
'Shutting down speech, I found that offensive,' VanValkenburg said. 'Suing someone and getting them into court kind of cuts against everything I stand for.'
In March, Nunes filed a $250-million defamation suit in Henrico County, accusing Twitter of censoring him and allowing users " including one parody account in the voice of an imaginary cow " to defame him.
'Devin's boots are full of manure,' read one of the offending tweets by the cow account cited in the lawsuit. 'He's udder-ly worthless and its pasture time to move him to prison.'
Other defamation suits followed against the Fresno Bee, CNN and others over reporting in stories and online commentary about the pieces.
Nunes and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.
In April, Depp sued Heard, his ex-wife, in a $50 million defamation case in Fairfax County. Depp claimed the actress falsely implied he had abused her in an op-ed in The Washington Post about domestic abuse.
'Johnny Depp brought his defamation case in Virginia because Virginia is where that Washington Post was printed, Virginia is where the online version of that Washington Post was created, and Virginia is where the servers that routed that Washington Post to the rest of the world are located,' Adam Waldman, an attorney for the actor, wrote in a statement.
While the bills are broadly similar, they differ on key details. The House and Senate measures will move to the opposite chamber for consideration and the hammering out of any differences before possibly heading to the governor for signing.
Alison Friedman, of the Protect the Protest task force that is backing the bills, said she is guardedly optimistic about passage.
'Substantively, all the parts for a strong anti-SLAPP bill are there, but half are in the House bill and half are in the Senate bill so it's really going to come down to conference,' Friedman said.

A structurally unsound guidelines proposal

Texto completo: A little-known architectural design group is advocating new guidelines that could radically change the look and feel of federal buildings in the nation's capital. The proposed executive order, circulating in draft form, mandates that new federal buildings, especially those in and around the District of Columbia, be built in 'classical architectural style.'
The White House declined to comment on the document, which the New York Times reported has been spearheaded by the National Civic Art Society, an educational nonprofit group that appears to be aligning its agenda with that of the Trump administration. The proposed guidelines have roiled architectural circles in Washington, drawn a rebuke from the American Institute of Architects ('The AIA strongly opposes uniform style mandates for federal architecture,' the group said) and introduced the NCAS to a much wider public than it has enjoyed in the past.
When the society was beginning to get attention about a decade ago, it often seemed to be a one- or two-man operation. Justin Shubow, one of the group's leaders, would show up at public hearings and other events and inveigh angrily, if not always coherently, against modern and postmodern architecture. The Frank Gehry-designed memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower, which opens in May, was a favorite target of his ire.

Now Shubow, who is not an architect or professional designer, has a presidentially appointed seat on the Commission of Fine Arts, the independent federal agency that oversees the design of the nation's capital. And the National Civic Art Society, which has attracted a powerful and wealthy board, is proposing an enormous change not just to the design of federal buildings but also to an oversight process that has largely succeeded, for more than a century, in holding architects to a high level of professionalism when creating new structures in the capital. If adopted, the executive order would be the most significant attempt yet to insert the new politics of populism into the world of art, aesthetics and design.
Shubow, now the NCAS president, didn't return messages seeking comment.
The executive order, first reported by Architectural Record, is a seven-page document " part ode to the beauty and dignity of the buildings created under the discriminating eye of the CFA more than a century ago, part tirade against more recent styles labeled 'brutalism' and 'deconstructivism.'
The White House declined to comment on the document.
Like the early rhetorical efforts of the NCAS, the proposed guidelines are full of holes and confusion, and the draft document, obtained by The Washington Post, doesn't look terribly professional. It is printed on plain paper, includes colloquial phrases such as 'just plain ugly' and offers broad and clumsy definitions of architectural styles. But there are details that read as though someone is attempting to get President Trump to endorse an order that would undo decades of professional design oversight.

It would, for example, be directed at all federal courthouses and agency headquarters, all federal buildings in the D.C. area, and all federal buildings expected to cost 'more than $50-million,' while excluding infrastructure (postmodern highway bridges and pipelines are apparently okay) and 'land ports of entry' (visitors and immigrants don't deserve a 'dignified' and inspiring doorway when they come to the United States).
More troubling is the document's creation of a new 'President's Committee for the Re-Beautification of Federal Architecture,' which would effectively override the independent CFA and might allow the White House to intervene in major architectural decisions. And it's clear from the language of the proposed order that the president is the draft order's target audience, from its title ('Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again') to explicit language endorsing 'Spanish colonial and other Mediterranean styles generally found in Florida,' thus including Trump's privately owned Mar-a-Lago resort in the fold of acceptable 'traditional' styles.
This is a document carefully tailored to a particular grievance-ridden form of populism. Another provision could effectively exclude any artists, architects, designers, critics or engineers 'directly affected by the construction or remodeling' of federal buildings from participating in public panels about federal design projects. That is a breathtaking assault on freedom of expression, packaged as sop to members of the public who feel they aren't regularly heard or given deference in public discourse. Most sane people who attend public architecture panels will roll their eyes at least occasionally at the pomposity or vaporous pretension of some panelist or other, but that is hardly grounds for blanket exclusion of professional opinion.
Today's Trump-driven populism is turning out to be enormously expensive, and this executive order would only add to the tab. Although it has a few clauses allowing the General Services Administration " the federal government's landlord, which would implement these changes " to consider the costs of implementing the guidelines, the executive order would create a situation in which costs would inevitably balloon. The guidelines would apply not only to new construction but also to remodeling and rebuilding projects. They could effectively limit the number of architects who would compete for federal projects, giving the government fewer options when it considers proposals.
And they would limit the flexibility of architects to find efficient solutions to basic problems. When news of the proposed order first leaked last week, it seemed like an Ozzie-and-Harriet document, a nostalgia-propelled diktat meant to make America look like every building was a bank or library built in 1920. But this isn't the architectural equivalent of requiring federal workers to wear knee breeches and a tricorn hats. It is the architectural equivalent of making every federal contractor use a hammer and nails, exclusively; no other tools allowed. It is an attempt to mandate (with only a few exceptions) a single solution to all architectural problems.
Consider the range of those issues, especially today, when architects who design for the federal government must not only produce buildings with the requisite office space and other functions but also buildings that are secure from terrorist threats; buildings that create a healthy, livable environment for their users; buildings that are sensitive to their context and minimize the costs and other impacts of energy use. Retrofitting Washington to deal with terroristic threats has effectively subverted the symbolism of classical buildings like the U.S. Supreme Court, where visitors no longer use the main porticoed entrance " a symbol of openness, dignity and access " and must enter through the sides, where they can be screened.
Energy-efficient buildings use an array of design elements that were never a part of the architectural vocabulary of Michelangelo and Palladio, two of the architects mentioned as representative of the preferred classical style. It isn't clear that the public considers these green elements, including access to outdoor spaces and the incorporation of natural elements and materials, to be dehumanizing.

But this isn't about giving the public what it wants. It's about sending everyone to their default battle lines, making it seem as if there is no middle ground between liking traditional architecture and liking contemporary architecture. And that's what makes the new document almost as risible as the old fulminating style of the National Civic Art Society partisans a decade ago. It is so old-fashioned .
Contemporary architecture is in a pretty good place right now, with old ideological arguments about classicism, modernism and postmodernism mostly dead issues. The focus among professional architects is the creation of effective buildings, buildings that don't solve every problem with hammer and nails, buildings that finesse elegant solutions to a growing list of architectural needs and necessities. Reading this proposed order will give anyone who grew up in the supercharged academic climate of the 1980s or '90s a little PTSD " it's that over-the-top angry about issues most people simply don't argue about anymore.
But we've learned the hard way that we can't expect things that are patently ridiculous to go away of their own accord. We've seen how people with thin résumés and overweening ambition can insert themselves into institutional chaos and prevail by turning up the volume until all the quiet, sober, serious professionals leave in disgust. We've seen how people who would not ordinarily disagree can be brought to rancorous conflict simply by resurrecting old grievances, irrelevant but not forgotten.
Does anyone really think that Washington would be a more beautiful city if the National Gallery's East Wing (designed by I.M. Pei) had never been built? Does anyone think the hangar-size National Air and Space Museum would look better with giant Corinthian columns plastered on the front? Whether these buildings would be affected, does anyone really want to pay an unknown but probably ruinous extra cost to retrofit federal buildings to look as though they were designed in 1750?
Dress it up in language about making American beautiful again, and you will find some takers. Unfortunately, it may only take one man to make this change, and this document is tailored to him.

Wine fiends need to help cut through the snobbery of restaurant lists

Texto completo: The language of wine can be intimidating. Wine lovers have our own vocabulary, complete with foreign words that can be difficult to pronounce. We boast of tasting a cornucopia of flavors that seem mystical and obscure to normal drinkers. And we can spot a wine noob if they hold their glass by the bowl instead of the stem, say 'RISE-ling' instead of 'REEZ-ling,' or describe a wine merely as 'smooth.' Most of us want to share our enthusiasm and love of wine; others, unfortunately, judge.
All this leads to the stereotype of the wine snob lording knowledge over the rest of the world. And of course there's the snooty sommelier who intimidates diners with an impenetrable wine list and an imposing demeanor. Most sommeliers I've met here in Washington and elsewhere take great pains to dispel that stereotype, but the negative image seems to be alive and well.
In a recent Twitter rant, Helen Rosner, food writer for the New Yorker, excoriated a restaurant for its head-scratching wine list. 'I am an actual professional restaurant eater and I still have no . . . clue which of the many many words on a wine list is the one word I'm supposed to say to indicate that this is the wine I want a glass of,' she wrote.
She posted a photo of part of a list offering white wines from France's Loire Valley, Burgundy and Alsace. The first two listed were 'Didier Chaffardon 'Chnaploïd' ' and 'Le Haut Planty 'Gwin Evan' ' " not very helpful if you aren't familiar with those producers and their wines. Most of the others were similarly opaque. I did not recognize any of the wines. A few Google searches confirmed that the list featured small-production natural wines. So even knowing that the burgundies would be chardonnay may not tell me much of what the wines would be like.
Rosner did not identify the restaurant, nor did she respond to an email requesting further comment. But her tweet unleashed a maelstrom of comment and criticism, and her replies over the next two days provided lots of fodder for discussion. Plenty of people agreed with her take, but others accused her of anti-intellectualism as well as plain old ignorance about wine.
'This isn't about knowledge, it's about communication,' she replied, barely able to contain her exasperation at the 'word soup' of a typical wine list.
Alice Feiring, a writer and champion of natural wines, chimed in, agreeing that the list was opaque and 'grossly overpriced.'
'They just tell you the name of the wine, or its vineyard or specific appellation,' Feiring said. 'You'd need to be post-doctoral wine to get through this one.'
New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells described the restaurant list in question as 'a nice one' and 'a prelude to a conversation.' He acknowledged, however, 'there ought to be a better way to strike up a conversation with customers.'
Many of Rosner's tweets focused on the discomfort of diners when faced with a wine list.
'I am absolutely thrilled not to recognize a single . . . word on your wine list, I just want to know WHICH OF THE MANY WORDS IS THE ONE TO CALL THE WINE so that we can have a conversation wherein you, a genius wine person, tell me, a humble moron, what the words mean,' Rosner wrote.
The back and forth included several suggestions for improving wine lists, such as using bold font for key words, adding bin numbers or other clues that would help customers avoid the 'mumble and point' approach to ordering wine. Rosner seemed eager for any approach that might offer a diner a clue.
'Virtually every time I ask about a bottle, at virtually any restaurant, I take a shot in the dark about whether to refer to it by its varietal, appellation, cuvee, color " and almost always I'm corrected by the server to whatever the staff uses as shorthand,' she tweeted.
As some restaurant professionals pointed out, servers might repeat a diner's order to ensure they understood it. If they come across as correcting the diner, is that a reflection of the server's demeanor or the diner's insecurity?
On the other hand, if Rosner, a 'professional restaurant eater,' feels intimidated by wine lists and her interactions with sommeliers, she most likely represents a large proportion of restaurant customers who do not eat out nearly as often. And that means wine professionals " including sommeliers and wine columnists " have not done a good job of breaking through wine's language barrier.
Rosner's rant is a warning. We wine fiends need to cut through the snobbery rather than reinforcing it. All too often, we are speaking into an echo chamber.

Texto completo: Adam Pendleton, a young conceptual artist who has rocketed onto the scene within the past couple of years, is going to be a big part of the Museum of Modern Art‘s upcoming programming. Following the institution’s recently-completed multi-million dollar renovation, this summer, Pendleton will be responsible for a multimedia installation entitled Who Is Queen? that will completely transform the Museum of Modern Art’s atrium into a theatrical stage set from July 25 to October 4, according to a new report from the New York Times . The exhibition will build on themes explored in Pendleton’s Black Dada Reader , a 350-page tome of essays and texts that lay out the artist’s intellectual fascination with Dadaism and American blackness.
Pendleton, who wrote his initial Black Dada text in 2008, often combines his obsession with language with a sculptural sensibility to create uniquely poetic verse. In 2012, Observer excerpted some of it: “it’s a matter of fact/a full moon hanging in a low sky irradiates the day with a milky glow/now i am older and wiser/going in a taxi from the train station.”
Who Is Queen? will explore the artist’s intellectual interests with live daily events featuring contributors such as poet Susan Howe and the theorist Judith Butler, as well as via a rotating display of Pendleton’s paintings, portraits and sound pieces. These sound pieces will be comprised of audio from MoMA’s archives, audio from protests and different kinds of music. “It’s looking at blackness as an open-ended idea, not just related to race but in relationship to politics, to art, specifically to the avant-garde,” Pendleton told the Times .
Regarding the exhibition’s title, Pendleton also told the paper of record that it stems from his once being called a queen, and his not really knowing how to accept or metabolize the moniker. “‘Queen’ could be a derogatory or loving name for a gay man,” Pendleton explained to the New York Times . “That’s at the heart of ‘Queen’—this idea of who we are, in personal but also collective terms.”

Texto completo: Headnote OUR RIGHT TO VOTE
Despite near unanimous Republican opposition, legislation restores landmark civil rights statute to guard against racial discrimination in elections
WASHINGTON - The House voted in December to reinstate federal oversight of state election law, moving to bolster protections against racial discrimination enshrined in the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the landmark civil rights statute whose central provision was struck down by the Supreme Court.
It passed by a vote of 228-187 nearly along party lines, with all but one Republican opposed.
The bill has little chance of becoming law given opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate and by President Donald Trump, whose aides issued a veto threat against it this week.
The measure is a direct response to the 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder, in which the justices invalidated a key portion of the law. They asserted the federal oversight of elections was no longer necessary in nine states, mostly in the South, because of strides made in advancing voting rights since passage of the 1965 law.
The original Voting Rights Act, signed by President Lyndon Johnson, was meant to bar states from imposing poll taxes, literacy tests and other methods to keep Black people from voting. Democrats argued that while such overt barriers are gone, they have been replaced by stricter voting laws adopted by 25 states since the Shelby decision.
Republicans argued that the bill would trample on states' ability to dictate their own election rules by abusing measures in place to prevent voter disenfranchisement.
In 2006, the last time the Voting Rights Act was updated, the measure passed overwhelmingly in the House, where large majorities of both parties supported it, unanimously passed the Senate, and was signed into law by a Republican president, George W. Bush.
In the Shelby case, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Congress remained free to try to impose federal oversight on states where voting rights were at risk but must do so based on contemporary data. The measure passed Friday would update the parameters used to determine which states and territories need to seek approval for electoral procedures, requiring public notice for voting changes and expanding access for Native American and Alaska Native voters.
But it is unlikely to come to a vote in the Senate, where Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has refused to take up most legislation championed by House Democrats.
"No right is more precious to our citizenship than the right of all Americans to be able to vote," said Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., the bill's chief sponsor. "When Americans are not able to cast their ballots, their votes are silenced.0
Sewell said the 2013 Supreme Court ruling in Shelby v. Holder has led to renewed discrimination against minority voters in her state and throughout the South. Some of the laws were passed in the name of combating voter fraud, but Sewell said the real issue was voter suppression - not fraud.
The laws passed by Republican-leaning states were aimed at "suppressing the voice of certain Americans, and that's un-American,S Sewell said on the House floor. Whether African Americans in Georgia or Native Americans in North Dakota, members of minority groups have continually faced barriers to voting, she said.
"This is a seminal piece of legislation that will restore, for the people, the right to vote, Sewell said, adding that Republicans and Democrats alike "should be making sure it's easier to vote, not harder to vote.
Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Illinois, said he agreed with that sentiment. "Every eligible American who wants to vote should be able to cast a ballot," he said, calling the Voting Rights Act "a great example of a bipartisan solution that is working today to protect Americans from voter discrimination.
But Davis said Sewell's bill would do more than reauthorize the voting rights law. "Instead, it would require the Department of Justice to clear every election law in this country, taking that power away from states."
Democrats have approved four bills addressing voting rights or election security since taking the majority this year, "and all of them have one common theme: federalizing elections, Davis said. The bill approved Friday "is simply more of the same."

Texto completo: Daniel arap Moi, the autocratic president of Kenya from 1978 to 2002, who ruled his East African nation in a postcolonial era of political repression, economic stagnation and notorious corruption, but in the end gave up power peacefully, died on Tuesday, Feb. 4,2020, at Nairobi Hospital in the capital. He was 95.
President Uhuru Kenyatta, who announced the death, declared a period of national mourning and said Moi would receive a state funeral. His statement did not specify a cause of death.
Fifteen years after Kenya won independence from Britain in 1963, Moi became president on the death of Jomo Kenyatta, the country's founding father. Moi, a former schoolteacher and national legislator, had been a hand-picked vice president and served in Kenyatta's long shadow.
Unlike the imperial Kenyatta, who governed behind closed doors, Moi traveled the country, courting its ethnic and tribal groups and gaining wide popularity. He introduced free milk for children, and pledged to do away with endemic graft and elevate Kenya's struggling tourism-and-agriculture economy. He won Western support with anti-communist policies during the Cold War.
But after suppressing opposition and consolidating power in a single-party state, he began a 24-year dictatorial reign. Moi-with his nimbus of silver hair, buttonhole rose and ivory walking stick - dominated life in Kenya. He put his face on bank notes, ordered his portrait hung in offices and shops, enriched his family and tribal cronies and, as investigations showed, stashed billions in overseas banks. For much of his tenure, it was illegal even to speak ill of him.
As the head of state and government, he exercised absolute power. The post-independence constitution vested legislative authority in a National Assembly and provided for an independent judiciary. But Moi had the right to dismiss judges and other officials, and he and his party controlled legislation and the courts, overriding decisions and suppressing democratic reforms.
Opposition led by intellectuals arose. But Moi, who also controlled the news media and the police and military services, and whose pronouncements had the force of law, closed the universit.es anc suppressed his opponents with detentions, torture and killings, according to United Nations investigators anc human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Africa Watch.
Constitutionally barred from running in the 2002 electizns, he agreed to give up po wer in a smooth transfer that was lhen still rare in Africe. He supported a son of Jorco Kenyatta, but Mwai Kibak., who had lost to Moi in 1992 and 1997, and who was nearly killed in a traffic accident during the campaign, won the presidency by a 2-1 margin. Moi later supported his old opponent's reelection.
As Moi retired, his successors found even more corruption and human rights abuses than had been suspected. A 2003 inquiry exposed torture cells at Nyayo House in Nairobi, a government building where dungeons yielded evidence supporting the accounts of victims.
Moi was never prosecuted, though corruption inquiries implicated him and his family. Kenya in 2003 found $1 billion in stolen funds in overseas accounts. Others in his administration were pursued, but Moi was treated as an elder statesman.
"We recognize that former President Daniel arap Moi is an important democratic commodity, not only for us, but for Africa," Kibaki's anti-corruption chief, John Githongo, told The New York Times in 2003. "He is treated special. He is different. He's just not any other guy."
He was born Toroitich arap (son of) Moi on Sept. 2, 1924, in Kuriengwo, a Rift Valley village in western Kenya. His father, a herdsman, died when the boy was 4. In a nation dominated by the Kikuyu tribe and its chief rival, the Luo, the Moi family belonged to the Kalenjin minority, one of 70 tribal groups.
At the African Mission School at Kabartonjo, Moi became a Christian and adopted the name Daniel. He graduated from Kapsabet Teacher Training College; from 1945 to 1947, he taught classes, and he was later the headmaster of a government school.
He married Helena Bommet in 1950. They had five sons and two daughters, and adopted a daughter. The couple separated in 1974. His wife, known as Lena, died in 2004.
He did not join the Kikuyu-led Mau Mau rebellion against British rule in the 1950s, but sympathized with the movement and once harbored five fugitives at his home. He entered politics in 1955, appointed by the British to the colonial Legislative Council. Two years later, when Black Kenyans were allowed to vote, he was elected to the council.
In 1960, he joined a London conference that drew up a Kenyan constitution authorizing African political parties. He was elected assistant treasurer of the new Kenya African National Union (KANU), the political instrument of independence, which later merged with the rival Kenya African Democratic Union he helped found and became the sole political party.
In the new government, Kenyatta appointed Moi minister of home affairs in 1964 and vice president in 1967. He handled day-to-day government affairs and represented Kenya at the Organization of African Unity, the first continent-wide association of independent states, and other international forums.
Moi lacked the Kenyatta magnetism and was little known abroad until he became president, but was moderately popular at home. Many Kenyans regarded Moi as puritanical because he did not drink alcohol or smoke, denounced hippies and miniskirts, led Kenya's Boy Scouts and recited aphorisms against materialism and acquisitiveness.
After leaving the presidency, he lived quietly, largely shunned by Kenya's political establishment, but drew crowds in public. In 2005, he opposed a new constitution, which was defeated in a referendum. In 2007, he was named a special envoy to Sudan.

Texto completo: Willie Wood, who was overlooked in the NFL draft but forged a Hall of Fame career as one of pro football's greatest defensive backs, playing on five Green Bay Packers championship teams of the 1960s, died Monday, Feb. 3, 2020, at an assisted living facility in Washington. He was 83.
His death was announced by the Packers.
Wood was found to have dementia in 2006 and had received financial assistance from a joint NFL-players union fund aiding former players with that condition. He had also undergone several orthopedic operations. In March 2012, when his native Washington named a block of N Street where he once lived as "Willie Wood Way," he attended the ceremony in a wheelchair.
Playing for the Packers from 1960 to 1971, Wood did not have much speed and he was only 5 feet, 10 inches and 180 pounds at best. But he was an outstanding tackier, often hitting opponents around the ankles when he was not intercepting passes or batting them down. Roaming the secondary at free safety, he was quick to dissect plays and get to the ball. He was also a league-leading punt returner.
A key figure in the Packers' dynasty built by coach Vince Lombardi, Wood was a firstteam All-Pro five times and was selected for eight Pro Bowl games. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989 and selected to its all-decade team of the 1960s.
Wood made a game-turning play in the first Super Bowl, in January 1967, when the Packers, champions of the NFL, met the Kansas City Chiefs, winners of the American Football League title.
With the Packers leading by only 14-10 in the third quarter, Wood intercepted a pass from Lenny Dawson and ran it back 50 yards to the Chiefs' 5-yard-line, setting up a touchdown that sent the Packers on their way to a 35-10 rout.
"That play seemingly changed the personality of the game," the Chiefs' coach Hank Stram said. "After that we just broke down."
Wood played in a Packer defense that included his fellow Hall of Fa mers Herb Adderley at cornerback, Ray Nitschke at mi ddle linebacker and Willie Davis and Henry Jordanen the line.
Although Nitschke called the defensive signals, Wood could seemingly intimidate him.
"I hate to miss a tackle," Packers' offensive guard Jerry Kramer quoted Nitschke as having said in "Distant Replay' (1985), written with Dick Schaap. 'I know if I do, I'm gonna get a dirty look from Willie. He 'll kill you with that loox."
At the University of Southern California, Wood was a run-or:ented quarterback who also played in the secondary at times. No team selected him in the 1960 draft. He was short and not particularly impressive as a passer, and as a Black quarterback he played a position that, at the time, was reserved for whites. Wood th ought he could make the pros as a safety, and he wrote to several NFL teams seeking a tryout. Only Lombardi was interested, and the Packers signed him.
"Lombardi knew I was small," Wood remembered, "but I had large shoulders and a 17-inch neck. Lombardi liked that."
Wood became a starter in his second season, replacing Emlen Tunnell, one of the early Black stars in the NFL, who was soon to retire as a Packer after forging a Hall of Fame career with the Giants.
"I used to sit around and quiz Em all the time," Wood told David Maraniss for his Lombardi biography, "When Pride Still Mattered" (1999). "He taught me to anticipate what would happen."
William Verrell Wood was born on Dec. 23, 1936, in Washington and became a high school football star. He was recruited for USC by A1 Davis, the future owner and coach of the Oakland Raiders, who was an assistant with the Trojans at the time. He played at USC for three seasons and was a co-captain as a senior.
Wood played on Packer teams that won NFL championships in 1961, '62 and '65, defeating the Giants twice and the Cleveland Browns, and then captured the first two Super Bowls, beating the Chiefs and then defeating the Oakland Raiders, 33-14.
He had 48 career interceptions, including a league-leading nine in 1962. He was the NFL's leading punt returner in 1961, with an average of 16.1 yards per return, and ran back two punts for touchdowns that season.

Here's a solution to the DNC's Iowa problem

Texto completo: After the debacle last week in Iowa and the reporting of the results there, even more people began to speak openly about how anachronistic and antiquated it is for Iowa and its problematic caucuses to continue to have such an outsize influence on the Democratic nominating process.
When CNN's Jake Tapper grilled the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, about whether Iowa should remain the first contest, Perez said, "That's the conversation that will absolutely happen after this election cycle."
It's about time. And, it needs to be far more than a conversation. Action must be taken.
First, caucuses are undemocratic anyway, because anyone who can't afford to or is unable to spend hours on one specific day in a gym or hall - the elderly, the infirm, the poor, the struggling - is frozen out of the process. And those who can participate are divested of anonymity, so peer pressure and shaming can play an inappropriate role.
Second, Iowa is simply not representative of the Democratic Party in a way that should have so much importance. The Democratic Party is becoming more urban and coastal. Iowa is a relatively rural Midwestern state. The party is also becoming increasingly diverse. Iowa is over 90% white.
In addition, as The Des Moines Register has pointed out, "The Iowa caucuses have a poor record of picking presidents," noting that:
"Since 1972, the top voter-getter in the Democratic caucuses has gone on to win the nomination in seven of 10 contested races, but just Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008 won the presidency. Among Republicans since 1980, the winner of the Iowa caucuses has gained the nomination in three of eight contested races, but the presidency just once: George W. Bush in 2000."
That is not the kind of track record that warrants special, outsize treatment.
And yet, Iowa still retains its power as a campaign killer or kingmaker. As The Register put it, "In only one instance in the history of the modern Iowa caucuses has someone finished lower than third and gone on to win a party's nomination."
Pete Buttigieg got a huge boost from his strong performance in Iowa, while people began to consider an obituary for Joe Biden's campaign thanks to his poor showing.
And, on the heels of Iowa comes New Hampshire, another relatively rural, overwhelmingly white state. If Buttigieg and Biden repeat their results in New Hampshire, there will most likely be a severe adjustment of expectations and a realignment of donors.
This says nothing of the campaigns that never even made it to Iowa, including the Black and Latino ones, in part because they never polled particularly well there, no matter how much effort they expended.
In the closing weeks of Kamala Harris' campaign, she focused almost entirely on Iowa as a make-orbreak proposition. But her dreams crashed in Iowa. Whereas she had once polled at 12% in the state, that plummeted to 3% weeks before she was forced to suspend her campaign.
This is not the way the modern Democratic Party should choose its nominee. As an alternative, I make this proposal: Have the first four contests - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - on the same day. In the spirit of Super Tuesday, you could call them the pacesetter primaries.
The benefits are multiple.
These states represent each quadrant of the country: Midwest, Northeast, West and South. They also, together, would introduce more diversity into the beginning of the process. About 1 in 5 Democratic primary voters in Nevada are Hispanics, and together with Black voters represent a third of all Democratic primary voters in the state. A majority of South Carolina primary voters are Black.
Nevada and South Carolina also happen to be among the fastest-growing states in the country. That's the energy Democrats need to tap into.
Lastly, it wouldn't require Iowa to fully relinquish its "first in the nation" status, but simply to share it.
Imagine a world in which Harris was able to concentrate her efforts in Nevada or South Carolina - both states in which her polling nearly hit 15% during the campaign - rather than Iowa.
Imagine a world in which the first contests were a mix of caucuses and primaries, because different campaigns respond better to different formats.
Imagine a world in which the Democrats' first contests gave them a fuller, more nuanced portrait of whom the full Democratic base supports.
As it stands, the process puts too much power into the hands of an unrepresentative few voters, a fickle few donors, and a careening media focus. Win Iowa and you get the headlines, you raise money and you influence later voters who simply want to be on the winning team.

Texto completo: Of all the lessons the mainstream media should have learned over the past four years, one of them is inexcusably obvious: We’re bad at predictions.
Who can forget poll analyses, the infographic needles, the endless columns and pundit panels that confidently projected that Hillary Clinton would be the next president?
In fact, it was that very certainty that drove much of the damaging and excessive coverage of her email practices. (Since she was all-but-certainly the next president, went the flawed thinking, we should get started now on showing we’ll be tough on her.)
Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank was so sure, in late 2015, that Donald Trump would fail to get the Republican nomination that he promised to eat his printed column if he was wrong. (An honorable man, he followed through.)
But my colleague was far from alone. And the following year, most media people were stunned by Trump’s winning the presidency.
And yet, we roll on today, with very little having changed.
The Iowa caucuses, according to many a commentator, surely would come down to a fight between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. As we know now, it didn’t work out that way: Biden finished a lackluster fourth and the photo finish with Sanders involved Pete Buttigieg.
Oh, and surely, we heard many times, voter turnout at the caucuses would be high, signaling the voters’ intense desire to replace President Trump with a Democrat. Well, that didn’t happen either. Turnout was flat.
Journalists - reporters and opinionators alike - just aren’t very good at this. Yet, they go on doing it, in part because there’s so little accountability in political journalism.
“There’s no penalty for being wrong. You can just blithely go on making another evidence-free prediction with no consequences,” Columbia University journalism professor William Grueskin said.
He added that it wouldn’t work that way in, say, business reporting: If you predicted that “XYZ Corp will lose $100 million” and then XYZ reported a $250 million profit, “much of your audience would have a hard time taking you seriously again.”
Part of the problem is our endless desire to frame politics as a horserace. Rather than focus on what’s most important to the public interest, political coverage focuses far too heavily on who’s up and who’s down - an elusive metric that requires data like polls and fundraising.
But these things are far from a reliable basis for prediction. What’s worse, many journalists don’t understand basic notions underlying polling, as data-oriented journalist Nate Silver has emphasized over the years: “Media understanding about probability, margin of error and uncertainty is very poor.”
If a candidate has an 80 percent chance of winning a race, no one should be surprised if he or she loses. The use of predictive phrases like “all but inevitable” should be confined to instances where the chances of a candidate’s election are more like 98 percent, he says. (Silver has become more careful since he infamously stated during the 2016 presidential primary season that Donald Trump’s candidacy shouldn’t be taken seriously. When proved wrong, he followed up by publishing a mea culpa about what went wrong in his thinking, and he was more accurate than most about Trump’s chances in the general election.)
Silver’s organization, FiveThirtyEight, remains solidly in the horserace business but with a greater effort now to explain probability and to resist the urge to walk out onto flimsy limbs.
As for me, I’m officially done with making predictions, after flubbing one in mid-2017. New York magazine asked me, along with 12 others - journalists, academics, and political types - to predict whether President Trump would make it through his first term.
Some respondents posited that he’d be gone by now, for various reasons; others were convinced that he would survive and thrive. I managed to get one thing right: that Trump would make it through his first term, but I predicted that he would choose not to run again — and that New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand would become the first female president. (I’ll note in my own defense that this was before she led the charge that brought about Al Franken’s resignation as the junior senator from Minnesota.)
Since then, I refuse to predict — not in print, not in interviews, and not even in informal conversations with friends and family members.
In a recent MSNBC appearance, the author Anand Giridharadas suggested that, given their generally lousy records, media people should quit the prognosticating game. He put it simply and correctly: “I don’t think it is our job as journalists to predict.”
As we head deeper into the presidential primary season, with all of its temptations, it’s high time to heed that advice.

Pressure builds to reinvestigate the 1965 killing of Malcolm X

Texto completo: -- For more than half a century, scholars have maintained that prosecutors convicted the wrong men in the assassination of Malcolm X.
Now, 55 years after that bloody afternoon in February 1965, the Manhattan district attorney's office is reviewing whether to reinvestigate the murder.
Some new evidence comes from a six-part documentary called "Who Killed Malcolm X?," which began streaming Friday on Netflix. It posits that two of the men convicted could not have been at the scene that day.
Instead it points the finger at four members of a Nation of Islam mosque in Newark, New Jersey, depicting their involvement as an open secret in their city. One even appeared in a 2010 campaign ad for then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker.
"What got us hooked," said Rachel Dretzin, a director of the documentary along with Phil Bertelsen, "was the notion that the likely shotgun assassin of Malcolm X was living in plain sight in Newark and that many people knew of his involvement, and he was uninvestigated, unprosecuted, unquestioned."
The case has long tempted scholars, who see a conspiracy hidden in unreleased government documents. A detective in the case, Anthony V. Bouza, wrote flatly a few years ago, "The investigation was botched."
Yet it has never sparked the widespread obsessive interest of the John F. Kennedy assassination or the equally brazen killing of Tupac Shakur. Attempts to reopen the case -- to uncover the possible roles of the FBI, New York Police Department and the Nation of Islam leadership, including Louis Farrakhan -- have gotten nowhere.
"The vast majority of white opinion at that time was that this was black-on-black crime, and maybe black-extremist-on-black-extremist crime," said David Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian. "And there was for decades a consensus in black communities that we are not going to pick up that rock to see what's underneath it."
At the time Malcolm spoke at the Audubon Ballroom on Feb. 21, 1965, he was a marked man -- spied on by the FBI and the police, denounced as a traitor by the Nation leadership, viscerally hated and beloved. Farrakhan declared him "worthy of death." A week before his assassination, his home in Queens was firebombed while he and his wife and four daughters slept inside.
Seconds after Malcolm stepped to the lectern, gunfire rang out, then pandemonium.
Talmadge Hayer, a member of the Nation of Islam from a New Jersey mosque, was arrested fleeing the ballroom, with a clip from a handgun used in the killing. Later the police arrested two men from Malcolm's former Harlem mosque, Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, both known as enforcers.
At trial, Hayer, who later became Mujahid Abdul Halim, admitted his guilt but said the other two men were innocent. All three men were convicted and received life sentences. Johnson, who became Khalil Islam, died in 2009; Butler, who is now Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was granted parole in 1985 and still maintains his innocence.
In the late 1970s, Hayer filed affidavits naming four members of the Newark mosque as his partners in the crime. Civil rights lawyer William Kunstler moved to reopen the case but was denied.
Since then, the legwork has fallen to biographers and independent researchers, including a Washington tour guide named Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, the central figure in the new documentary series.
"It bothered me that no one cared about it," Muhammad said. "I didn't get paid to do any of this. I've sold cars. I'm just a working-class guy."
In 2010 Muhammad uncovered the identity of one of the supposed assassins named in Hayer's affidavit, William Bradley, who had changed his name to Almustafa Shabazz and was married to a prominent Newark activist. It was Bradley's shotgun blast, researchers contend, that killed Malcolm.
Shabazz, who died in 2018, denied any involvement in the murder and lived in plain sight. "I knew him well," Cory Booker says in the documentary, adding that he was not aware of Shabazz's past identity.
Muhammad published Shabazz's name and photograph on his blog in 2010, and then shared his research with Manning Marable, who was working on his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention." Muhammad thinks the other three men named in Hayer's affidavits are dead.<

Casper's IPO met with a yawn

Texto completo: -- Casper Sleep, a startup that sells mattresses online, has become the latest money-losing outfit to get a cold shoulder from Wall Street investors.
The company's stock began trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $14.50 a share, slipped below $14 in the afternoon and closed at $13.50. The lackluster first day of trading did not come close to fulfilling what Casper's venture-capital investors thought it was worth a few months ago.
The 5-year-old startup, based in New York, had been valued at $1.1 billion by private investors last year. But that was before it disclosed in January that it lost $67 million on $312 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2019, thanks in part to spending $114 million on marketing.
Casper reduced its proposed share price, valuing the company at less than $500 million. It raised $100 million in the offering.
While investors continue to enthusiastically buy shares in the tech industry's biggest companies, they have been skeptical of young companies that are losing money.
Last year, Uber and Lyft, ride-hailing competitors that are both losing huge amounts of money, had disappointing public offerings. WeWork, the commercial real estate company, dropped its IPO plans and experienced a management shake-up after investors recoiled from its poor financial performance.
In an interview, Philip Krim, chief executive and co-founder of Casper, was still enthusiastic about his company's first day of trading. "Getting out to public investors has gone great," he said. "I've enjoyed telling people what we're trying to build and helping people understand it at a level of depth that the headlines might mislead you from."
Krim said his company's model of selling goods directly to customers, rather than exclusively through retail chains, is a new concept to public market investors. "Our business is not what investors are used to seeing at this scale," he said.
Before it went public, Casper had been the toast of the startup world. The company shook up a stodgy mattress industry by selling beds online, delivering them to peoples' doorsteps in boxes the size of mini fridges.
To lure customers from traditional department stores and mattress chains, Casper advertised heavily on subways, podcasts, television and through quirky marketing campaigns.
"They transformed the way people buy mattresses, sort of forever," said Ben Lerer, an early investor in Casper through the investment firm Lerer Hippeau. "People didn't buy mattresses online before Casper existed and now they do."
Venture investors poured more than $340 million into the company, according to Crunchbase, and Casper began calling itself the "Nike of sleep," selling pillows, sheets, dog beds and other accessories to what it termed the "sleep economy."
The company opened 60 of its own stores. In 2017, Casper turned down a $1 billion acquisition offer from Target, which sells Casper products. The chain invested in the company instead.
But as Casper grew, competitors saw an easy opportunity and rushed in, with an average of one new "bed-in-a-box" company launching per week between 2015 and 2018. There are now 175 competitors in the market, according to mattress comparison site GoodBed.<

Geneva Polsfuss, WWII code breaker

Texto completo: Geneva Polsfuss would never talk about her work as a World War II code breaker. All her family could ferret out was that she worked deciphering encrypted Japanese military messages and lived in a Washington, D.C., boardinghouse.
"We tried to get her to talk about it," said her son Mark of Chicago, "but she would always say, 'I took an oath not to talk about it.' She said, 'I know one of the things I discovered had a big impact,' but she would not say what it was."
Polsfuss, then Geneva Langert, was one of more than 10,000 women who flocked to the capital during the war to serve as code breakers, an era chronicled in the 2017 New York Times bestseller "Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II."
The rest of his mother's life was an open book, Mark said, brimming with family, friends and a deep Christian faith.
Polsfuss died Jan. 9 at the Little Hospice in Edina following a fall. She was 96.
Ethel Geneva Langert was born in 1923 in Glendale, Calif. When she was an infant, the family moved to Minneapolis. Her father was a traveling salesman. Mark said his mother, who always went by the name Geneva, liked to accompany her father on his trips around the Upper Midwest.
Her mother took in sewing to pay for her daughter's dance lessons, and she danced for years and had a stint as a professional.
As a student at Roosevelt High School, Langert met a handsome, gentle Macalester College student named Lyle Polsfuss. When Lyle was stationed in Newport News, Va., as a captain in the U.S. Army, she found a job in Washington to be near him.
The couple returned to Minnesota after the war, married and settled in Le Sueur, the home of vegetable canner Green Giant Co. Lyle worked in the company's marketing and advertising department. Geneva liked to call herself "the household executive." They raised four children.
Mark recalled a loving, small-town childhood with the family active in the Lutheran Church. His charismatic mother was always taking them to tour a factory or museum or see a play. She followed sports and bowled in a league, did calligraphy and loved to cook and entertain.
For a few years she ran a dance studio for children in the basement of the house.
The famous cook James Beard once came to the house for a party in the 1960s, he said, when Beard was under contract with Green Giant to create some recipes. "She brought him into the kitchen and said: 'I can never get my bread to rise properly. Tell me what corner to put it in.' He walked around the kitchen and he said, 'Right here.' "
The family later moved to Edina after Green Giant moved its executive offices to Minneapolis.
In 1967 came a life-changing moment, the family said. Polsfuss became a born-again Christian after becoming inspired during a luncheon hosted by the Christian Women's Clubs of America.
Not long after Lyle died of leukemia in 1974, Polsfuss split her time between Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and the family cabin on Clearwater Lake near Brainerd. She remarried in 1980 to Roy Cannon, who died just 18 months later.
Eventually, Polsfuss moved to a condo in Bloomington until she moved last year to Augustana Assisted Care Living in Apple Valley.
Along with her son Mark, Polsfuss is survived by her brother, Eddie Langert of Kansas City and Tampa; her children, Craig Polsfuss of Apple Valley, Barbara Lee Polsfuss of Mesquite, Nev., and Stephen Polsfuss of Bloomington; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
Services have been held.

Texto completo: Just as Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen” is not a traditional book of poetry, though it won several important poetry awards, her play “The White Card” is not a traditional play. If four out of five characters in a traditional play consistently said clueless, self-righteous, tone-deaf things, it would probably be a comedy about buffoons.
“The White Card” is not a comedy. It’s a serious look at racism and the lack of understanding among people who think they know better, who see themselves firmly on the right side of social justice. Directed by Talvin Wilks, it takes place on a transformed stage at the Penumbra. Some seats have been removed, the stage has been extended and the walls have been lengthened to embrace as much of the audience as possible. We’re all in this together.
As the play begins, it takes a minute to remember you’re in St. Paul’s historic black theater. The set is all white – floors, walls, furniture, accessories. So are the three people on stage: wealthy art collector Charles (Bill McCallum), his wife, Virginia (Michelle O’Neill), and art dealer Eric (John Catron). They await the arrival of the evening’s guest, Charlotte (Lynnette R. Freeman), an important black artist whose work Charles is eager to start collecting.
Charles’ collection focuses on what Charlotte will bluntly call “black death.” We see Robert Longo’s charcoal drawing of Ferguson police holding back protesters in the days after Michael Brown was shot. And Jean-Michel Basquiat’s “The Death of Michael Stewart,” a graffiti artist killed by police. And Glenn Ligon’s “Hands” from the 1995 Million Man March. Among them is a Rauschenberg “White Painting.” Panels of white.
Charlotte arrives and the conversation begins. When Virginia insists that she and Charlotte have met before, at a gallery, Eric says “That wasn’t Charlotte.” The audience groans. There will be a lot of groaning and gasping during “The White Card.” As when Virginia says, “Charles takes his stable of artists seriously.” And tells Charlotte, who has risen to help clear the dinner plates, to “Sit down. You’re not the maid.” (The maid, who is black, has been given the night off.)
Before dinner, a fifth character enters: Charles and Virginia’s son Alex, fresh from an anti-Trump protest. A member of Black Lives Matter, he’s a wealth of knowledge about injustices past and present, eager to show how informed he is and one-up his parents.
Charlotte’s art at first seems like a good fit for Charles’ collection. She restages and photographs moments and aggressions that would otherwise be forgotten. Lately, her work has taken a darker turn. She’s staging the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting. This is the work Charles wants.
The evening unravels. Charlotte keeps her cool but also has doubts about Charles and his choices. As Alex helpfully points out, part of Charles’ wealth comes from building private prisons. When the first act ends, Charlotte is questioning her own choices about her art. The second act, which takes place a year later, reveals her new direction. It’s a shock to Charles.
We don’t want to spill all the twists because so much of the play is discussion. Voices rise, and the white characters hold tight to their own ideas and perceptions. As Rankine said in an opening night post-play talk with Wilks, author Junauda Petrus and writer Erin Sharkey, “There’s nothing in the play that has not actually happened in real life.” All of the dumb things the white characters say have been said in her presence or reported to her. “That they happen at the same time is fictional,” Rankine continued, “but there’s no fiction in the play.”
Sometimes “The White Card” seems stuck on a single note, played at the same volume. It’s impossible to become emotionally involved with any of the characters, except for Charlotte. But entertaining us or indulging our feelings is not what “The White Card” is for. Rankine is a MacArthur Fellow, respected scholar and cultural force who speaks and writes with candor. (In the post-play talk, when Petrus asked her, “How do you take care of yourself?” Rankine replied, “I have trained myself to say what I think in public.”)
“The White Card” brings us face-to-face with issues of race and racism. It’s not a comfortable place to be. Go, get uncomfortable, then think about what you see and hear. Talk with other people about it. Post-play discussions will be held on three Thursdays: Feb. 13, 20 and 27. If you can’t decide which night to attend, maybe pick one of those.
Performance dates are Wednesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m., with student matinees on Wednesdays and matinees on the weekends. FMI and tickets ($40/$35 seniors/$15 students). Closes March 1.

Texto completo: Americans have lately been learning that the apps they use to check whether they need an umbrella, or follow their favorite sports team, or hurl one animated animal at another for points, are sucking up their location data and selling it. Now it turns out that it’s not only advertising companies and other private entities who end up buying this information en masse from brokers. The U.S. government is doing it, too.
The Wall Street Journal wrote last week that federal agencies have purchased access to a virtual trove that charts the movements of millions of citizens’ cellphones from a company called Venntel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its components are reportedly harnessing this data for immigration enforcement: searching for activity in unexpected places to pin down smuggling rings, or detecting individuals who may have entered the country illegally. (Spending records indicate that the Drug Enforcement Administration paid $25,000 to Venntel in 2018. The Justice Department told us the DEA does not “comment on contracting matters.”)
Customs and Border Protection says it accesses only small quantities of the data on a case-by-case basis rather than examining the entire cache in bulk, and that the data is anonymized. But anonymity is a laughable concept when every individual’s day can be turned into a traveling dot that follows a path only they take. A New York Times investigation in 2018 revealed how simple it is to connect a dot to the person it represents — whether that person is a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory or an undocumented mother recently arrived from Mexico.
Authorities may hope to preempt some concerns about civil liberties by alleging that they’re training their eyes only on suspected non-citizens, but it’s impossible to avoid roping in citizens, too, when information is requisitioned at so massive a volume. It’s also impossible not to imagine what else, and who else, officials might seek to track, once they’ve come up with the legal rationale for doing so. Americans shouldn’t have to rely on the good graces of the bureaucracy to protect them from overreach.
The rationale for warrantless surveillance in this case sidesteps Fourth Amendment law — or tries to. The Supreme Court ruled in Carpenter v. United States that the government couldn’t subpoena geographic data directly from cellphone companies without going through the courts, precisely because of that data’s “depth, breadth, and comprehensive reach.” So the government started buying the exact same data from brokers on the open market instead, arguing that the purchases were fair game because any old company could make them.
This strategy is awfully cynical. Congress has failed to pass a comprehensive privacy statute that shields people from having their every move logged in a database such as the one in question today. Now, this lack of privacy from corporate actors has become an excuse for government to bypass the right to privacy from the state that the Constitution is supposed to enshrine. The DHS insists this is legal. But should it be?

Texto completo: Two years and one day ago, the New York Times branded a virtually unknown businessman a "longer-than-long-shot" hopeful for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Today, Andrew Yang confirmed the New York Times's fatalism, with some half a million donors and a million more inspired by the #YangGang.
Yang was a unique candidate from the start, an entrepreneur who jumped into the race after witnessing the disparity of economic opportunity across the country and running for the Oval Office on the distinct proposal of issuing a monthly $1,000 universal basic income to every adult in the country. But while Yang's signature issue and meticulously detailed plans helped him stand out from a pack of candidates blindly racing each other to the left, it was his heart, not his policies, that defined his campaign as evidence of what makes America great.
Yang was a technocrat who married utopianism and realism in a race devoid of both. But Yang differentiated himself by broadcasting as wide a net as possible, drawing supporters spanning from those formerly of President Trump to Bernie Sanders. Yang was happy to appear on right-wing shows such as Ben Shapiro's while running for the Democratic nomination. He would tout contemporary feminism while also noting that full-time mothers such as his own wife deserved a seat at the table in our political debates too.
The media heavily kneecapped Yang, with liberal outlets manufacturing outrage over his penchant for mocking stereotypes about his East Asian ethnicity and cable networks omitting him or misidentifying him outright. At debates, moderators consistently gave him half the speaking time of other candidates, yet he routinely managed to become the most tweeted-about candidate after the fact.
Sure, Yang would have fit in as easily in your frat house as he would in your church pews. But it was more than his effortless way with the masses and the internet. He simply cut through the smoke and mirrors of politics, proving his authenticity and earnestness with every interaction he had in his two years of campaigning.
This is not the last we've seen of Yang, who now is a celebrity in his own right. He has an ample fundraising base and platform to run in nearly any race in his home state of New York that he wishes to. And everyone, conservative and liberal alike, ought to hope he will. Politics need more men such as Yang, those with razor-sharp knowledge to back their proposals, but those who even so, put humanity first.

Pete Buttigieg’s grand plan to decriminalize drugs failed miserably in Seattle

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg is defending his proposal to decriminalize all drugs, saying it’s more effective to keep addicts out of jail and offer them treatment. While treatment is certainly better than jail time in some cases, an all-out decriminalization of drugs would devastate our cities.
How do I know? I live in Seattle, a city in Washington that has decriminalized personal possession of illicit drugs to disastrous results.
At Friday’s New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate and again on Fox News Sunday, Buttigieg was put on the spot to defend his support for decriminalizing all illicit drug possession.Tweet
“Possession should not be dealt with through incarceration,” Buttigieg argued, saying he’d still punish drug dealers.
In Seattle and King County (the state’s most populous county), the city attorney and prosecutor decriminalized the “personal possession” amounts of illicit drugs. Much like Buttigieg, local officials believe jail time doesn’t treat addiction.
The policy has been met with national acclaim from liberal journalists in the New York Times and Washington Post, who portray the move as a win for social justice against the evil and failed war on drugs.
But the biggest problem with decriminalization is simply that it doesn’t work. In fact, it makes the problems worse. And despite the glowing reviews of the Seattle policy, it’s been an unmitigated disaster.
Over the last decade, we’ve seen an alarming uptick in overdose deaths. In the years since King County prosecutor Dan Satterberg first stopped charging people with possession, we’ve seen a skyrocketing increase in meth overdoses, going from 18 deaths in 2008 to a staggering 197 in 2019. In the same time period, heroin overdose deaths climbed from 45 to 147. Fentanyl-related deaths jumped from 9 to 106. It’s only February, and we’re already on pace to exceed the deaths we saw at this time last year.
This is a health crisis, not a social justice success story. It doesn’t have to be this way. When you actually talk to law enforcement officers, it becomes pretty clear why this problem is getting worse, not better.
Drug dealers have adapted to the new rules, and they carry less product on them to sell. While it’s slightly more inconvenient to return to their stash to stock up on product, it’s preferable to jail time. Carrying small amounts of illicit drugs, they know if a cop does search them, they won’t face a harsh punishment. They’ll be back on the street selling drugs in no time.
Consequently, there’s a large open-air drug market in downtown Seattle. Is that Buttigieg’s vision for every city in the United States?
While there have certainly been arrests, the police pressure is never consistent. Officers aren’t allowed to police proactively, and drug dealers are taking advantage, preying on homeless addicts who break into cars and homes, sell stolen property, then buy their drug of choice. It’s keeping them addicted and homeless.
I certainly agree with Buttigieg and others who say throwing an addict in jail won’t treat their addiction. I favor treatment on demand.
But since these addicts know they won’t see meaningful jail time, they have less of an incentive to take up offers of treatment. They’re not thinking rationally due to the very nature of their addiction. Without a consequence that they care about, they don’t get the treatment. But it gets worse.
Seattle cops have long complained that they have no leverage to use over an addict to get them to turn on their dealers. If prosecution is a serious threat, an officer can tell the addict that they’ll avoid prosecution but only if they give up info on their drug dealers. Cops could then use that intelligence to arrest drug dealers. Now, no such leverage exists — and it wouldn’t exist anywhere if Buttigieg had his way.
Of course, decriminalization also signals to people that if they’re curious about trying an illicit drug, there won’t be any legal consequences.
Perhaps that’s what made it easier for local Seattle-area high school students to make the deadly decision to purchase what they thought were Oxycodone pills. No legal consequences, right? Well, the pills were counterfeit, and the teens died of an overdose.
Buttigieg and others are blinded so deeply by their political beliefs that they can’t (or won’t) see the consequences of their positions. Unfortunately, while they celebrate their liberal outlook on the war on drugs, we’re losing innocent lives ravaged by an addiction like-minded politicians enable.

Klobuchar surge: Is it too little, too late?

Texto completo: EXETER, New Hampshire — Amy Klobuchar is about to find out how far her late surge in Iowa and New Hampshire can propel her through the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
Klobuchar, 59, exceeded relatively low expectations in Iowa, finishing fifth closely behind Joe Biden, 77, a two-term vice president with significantly greater name recognition.
Now, two tracking polls released in recent days have the Minnesota senator on the precipice of taking third place in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, behind Bernie Sanders, 78, and Pete Buttigieg, 38, but ahead of Elizabeth Warren, 70, and Biden.
The White House hopeful has also raised $3 million and drawn bigger crowds since last Friday's debate, where the more center-left candidate distinguished herself from the field by being the only contender to confidently raise their hand to indicate they didn't want Sanders, a socialist, at the top of the ticket in November.
"A lot of people did not think that I was going to make it through the summer or make it to that debate stage. But I more than made it to the debate stage," she said during a local Rotary Club address Monday in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Klobuchar's pragmatic, no-nonsense worldview and Midwestern good humor have won her a slither of the Democratic electorate, whether through old-fashioned retail politics or via her stronger debate performances, particularly when she's confronted Sanders and Warren, for example, over "Medicare for all" and free college, as well as Buttigieg over his lack of experience. It's earned her endorsements from the New York Times and the New Hampshire Union Leader too.
"I believe that we need a leader, and I think that is me, that will unite our country instead of the infighting," she said at a more boisterous rally later Monday in Exeter. "I think when you think of the three words that best describe Donald Trump's political playbook, it is to 'divide and demoralize.' Mine is 'unite and lead.'"
Allan Alec, 70, understands Klobuchar's appeal. The registered Republican, who doesn't want to vote for Trump, told the Washington Examiner in Exeter he was considering changing his party affiliation so he could cast a ballot for Klobuchar, but he wouldn't do the same for Buttigieg or Biden.
"I thought she was very mature, adult, calm, collected, nice sense of humor, but she wasn't volatile. She wasn't excited. I thought she was very good the way she handled herself and her questions," Alec, a local who is in commercial real estate, said after seeing her for the first time at the debate.
Her dark horse status has served as an advantage in that she's avoided microscopic scrutiny of her record as a corporate lawyer, as the chief prosecutor for Minnesota's most populous county, her 13 years in the Senate, and whether she can connect with minority Democrats.
But she's far behind rivals, such as Sanders and Buttigieg, in terms of fundraising and building an effective organizing network, which are both crucial ahead of "Super Tuesday" on March 3, when the candidates are expected to contest 14 states at the same time.
Independent Ted Leffel's No. 1 voting issue is booting Trump from the White House, and though still undecided, he'll back the person he believes is best positioned to do that, including Sanders. The Newfields child psychiatrist, 65, noted that Klobuchar's campaign could have done a better job of advertising her newspaper endorsements.
"I think there are financial issues," he said at the same Exeter event of her team's less active ground game. "I think the problem is I don't know how much time she's been able to spend in Nevada and South Carolina. I have no idea. That may be just too much of a reach."
Klobuchar averages 11.7% support in New Hampshire, according to RealClearPolitics, trailing Sanders's 28.7% and Buttigieg's 21.3%.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren performed abysmally in the New Hampshire primary, but you can’t blame sexism. Amy Klobuchar, never a front-runner in the 2020 race, came in a tight third place, outperforming both Warren and Joe Biden by 9 p.m. Tuesday night, with 31% of precincts reporting.
While the Warren campaign has frequently relied on the feminist card, especially against Bernie Sanders, it’s clear that the reason for her eventual failure won’t be sexism. It will be her own unpopularity with voters.
At least she can admit that there’s space for another woman in the 2020 race besides her. Warren took to the stage in New Hampshire on Tuesday night to congratulate “my friend and colleague Amy Klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out.”
Klobuchar’s centrist rhetoric has won her fans who might’ve found Warren too left-wing and even too beloved by the establishment.
Klobuchar, on the other hand, has relied heavily on her Midwestern background — she’s a senator from Minnesota — and campaigned off her ability to reach voters across the aisle. Defying her peers, she said this week that she does believe the Democratic Party makes room for pro-life voters, in a marked shift from the rhetoric of candidates such as Pete Buttigieg.
When it comes to the economy, Klobuchar has been one of the only candidates to admit, “I am troubled by having a socialist lead our ticket.” Klobuchar attracts voters who are intimidated by the "Medicare for all," student loan forgiveness, and other radical, big government policies supported by Warren.
Warren announced Tuesday night, “We will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels that they can get behind.” It's clearly not her. (Good thing the New York Times covered its bases by endorsing both Warren and Klobuchar.)
Voters are ready to elect a female president. They’re just not that into Elizabeth Warren.

Texto completo: MSNBC decided to make weekend host Joy Reid one of the stars of its Tuesday night election coverage. But the liberal television network’s decision to trot out Reid during its coverage of the Democratic New Hampshire primary reminds us of its gross hypocrisy.
She ran a virulently, viciously, anti-gay blog throughout the 2000s, lied about it, and has never been held accountable. As Vox summarized:
[Reid’s] posts made derogatory remarks about gay people, claiming that "most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing" and that "adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young, post-pubescent types." One post acknowledged, "Does that make me homophobic? Probably."
It would be one thing if Reid had owned up to these mistakes, apologized, and moved on. I could live with that — I don’t believe in cancel culture. But instead, the host shamelessly denied it all, peddling conspiracy theories about a “hacker” infiltrating her blog. Even the New York Times wasn't going to fall for that one. She hasn’t apologized. She hasn’t even admitted she did it, despite all the evidence to the contrary. It’s blatant dishonesty, to the point of disqualification.
This shreds Reid's ability to cover a pivotal event such as the New Hampshire primary credibly. Reid lied, over and over again, and MSNBC let her get away with it. Why should anyone watching tonight believe anything she has to say?

Klobuchar steps over Biden and Warren for delegates in New Hampshire

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — Amy Klobuchar had a surprisingly good night in New Hampshire.
Klobuchar, 59, heads to Nevada for the Feb. 22 caucuses having received 19.7% of the vote in Tuesday night's New Hampshire 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with 53% of precincts reporting.

"Hello, America. I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I'll beat Donald Trump," she said in Concord. "My heart is full tonight. While there are ballots still to count, we have beaten odds every step of the way. We have done it on the merits, we have done it with ideas, and we have done it with hard work."

On a campaign high after finishing a close fifth behind former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa, the Minnesota senator this week described herself as "unleashed" following the wrap-up of President Trump's impeachment trial, which had her tied up in Washington, D.C., and unable to concentrate on her White House bid.
A strong debate performance last Friday, timed just as New Hampshire's large bloc of undecided likely primary voters were tuning into the race, piqued interest in her candidacy, boosted her crowd numbers at events over the weekend, attracted some much-needed donations, and helped her place third in two separate tracking polls.
On the trail, she touted how she was the only presidential hopeful on the stage to confidently raise her hand, indicating she disagreed with the idea of having a socialist, such as Bernie Sanders, on the top of the Democratic ticket for the general election.

Building on her message that voters disenchanted with partisan politics had a "home" with her, Klobuchar's closing pitch was a mashup of reassuring New Hampshire she understood their struggles and calling for party unity before November.
"There is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now, and I will bring that to you. If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent, I know you, and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you’re going to pay for your childcare or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you," she said in her final ad buy in the state.
Klobuchar's delegate count on Tuesday night can be added to the one delegate she picked up in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation contest where she slowly but steadily grew support since a sluggish summer via old-fashioned retail politics based on her Midwestern commonsense and sense of humor. Those assets earned her endorsements from both the New York Times and a slew of New Hampshire newspapers.
For Becky Tise, 62, Klobuchar's best characteristic is that she "doesn't waste words like the guy that's occupying the White House."
"Amy's economy of words, it's all about an issue every time she opens her mouth except for the occasional humor, which people love. It's a really good way to deliver a message and get points across," the Portsmouth leadership consultant told the Washington Examiner after a Klobuchar town hall in Exeter.
Amy Teas, 41, believes Klobuchar speaks to people like her who are "undeclared" and "turned off" by "diehard" Democrats and Republicans.
"I like how she has worked across the aisle already, so she's not saying what she's going to do, she's saying, 'This is what I've done,'" the Nashua stay-at-home mother said after a Klobuchar event in her home town. "And she's reasonable. She's not extreme, and wild, and outrageous. She's also not accusatory and offensive. She's just what every level-headed person would want.
However, her success in New Hampshire isn't unencumbered. She's likely to face greater scrutiny ahead of Nevada's first-in-the-West round, particularly regarding her tenure as Minnesota's most populous county's chief prosecutor. The attacks were previewed during an appearance on The View earlier Tuesday.
"Are we prosecuting Amy Klobuchar today?" host Joy Behar asked Sunny Hostin after she spent most of the segment tearing into the senator.
She will also need to bridge an organizing gap between her and rivals with greater financial and staffing resources, especially ahead of Super Tuesday on March 3, when delegates in 14 states, including her home state of Minnesota, will be up for grabs.

Four major journalistic errors in just 10 hours

Texto completo: If you think the news industry’s credibility problem is bad now, you haven’t seen anything yet.

It is going to get much, much worse the closer we get to Election Day, if Tuesday’s slipshod news reporting and commentary is any indication.

The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman, for example, tweeted the following falsehood at around 5:30 p.m. Monday evening: “Republican voter registration in NH is down roughly 20k voters from 2016 to now. It’s a reminder that Trump’s increased GOP popularity is in part because in some places, the GOP registration rolls have shrunk.”

This is not only false, but it has been debunked several times. At some point, repeating the lie becomes a choice.

Earlier than that, MSNBC’s Katy Tur, who hosts a politics news show, sought to throw cold water on the strong economic numbers touted by the Trump White House, arguing that the economy is not working for the individual who spends up to 360 months paying off his car loan.

“When I ask people if they’re voting for Donald Trump, I hear about their 401(k)s a lot,” she said during a live broadcast from New Hampshire, “but there are those out there who don't have a 401(k), and there are those out there who this economy is not really working for them.”

Tur added, “They might have a job, but it's not a job that pays their bills. They can get a car, but it's a loan that will take 30 years.”

I have no idea what she is talking about. I don’t think even she knows. (What else is new?) Car loans can take anywhere between 12 and 84 months to pay off. Who are these people agreeing to 30-year car loans? (Follow up question: Are they looking to finance a new car? No reason.)

Earlier that morning, CNN’s Cristina Alesci warned viewers to be wary of recently surfaced audio of 2020 Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg proudly promoting the stop-and-frisk policies he championed as mayor of New York City. After all, the CNN reporter claimed, as we don’t have the full audio of the former mayor’s remarks, we don’t have the full context. But this is not true. The full audio of Bloomberg’s comments has been available online since 2015.

“So, here's the thing, important context here," she said. "We don't have the full tape."

Alesci, who, by the way, is an alumna of the Bloomberg News empire, continued, “So, this is obviously snippets that have been released, the podcaster and the writer that released this sound is clearly a Bernie supporter, if you look at his twitter feed, he's very anti-Bloomberg. He's promoting a hashtag ‘#BloombergIsARacist.'"

A simple Google search brings up the full audio, which was posted shortly after Bloomberg delivered his address in 2015 at the Aspen Institute. Also, all that stuff about the alleged political affiliations of the person who posted the audio online Monday evening is irrelevant to the content of the surging 2020 candidate's past remarks.

Lastly, and relatedly, there is NBC News’s Heidi Przybyla. She shared a conspiracy theory at around 7:30 a.m. alleging that the Kremlin is responsible for making the hashtag “#BloombergIsRacist” a top-trending news topic on social media. The hashtag, which is definitely organic, cropped up Tuesday morning following the release of the Bloomberg audio. Przybyla later deleted her tweet promoting the conspiracy theory, which she had not even bothered to double-check before sharing with her 145,000 Twitter followers.

These are four major reporting errors in the span of just 10 hours.

For many in this industry, the lesson of the 2016 election does not appear to be “Do better.” It appears to be “Resist harder, by any means necessary.”

We're living in Camelot on our grandchildren's dime

Texto completo: As President Trump recited an impressive list of his economic accomplishments in his State of the Union address, Republican members of congress cheered with abandon. Even Trump’s detractors, though reluctantly and without smiles, might have felt deep down inside that our nation’s economy is experiencing a really good time. Growth has leveled off a bit, but it’s left us in a place with noteworthy improvements in employment, earnings, labor force participation, and reducing the count of people living below the poverty line.
There’s a very compelling (though not always popular) case for optimism these days. Yet nearly everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, seems to be forgetting about one oft-ignored warning.
The Census Bureau reports that 2018 was the fourth year in a row to experience a reduction in the poverty count. And there is more good news. Construction, driven partly by warmer winters but also by low interest rates, continues apace. Even manufacturing employment, though buffeted by trade wars, is holding its own. To top it all off, consumer confidence is high, and retail sales show it.
And get this: It’s not just here in the United States under Trump’s leadership. In his end-of-year summary of world progress, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof telegraphed amazingly good news for the world. As he put it, “In the long arc of human history, 2019 has been the best year ever.”
Explaining such a bold claim, Kristoff points out that “Since modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago, 2019 was probably the year in which children were least likely to die, adults were least likely to be illiterate and people were least likely to suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases.” Every single day in 2019, he continued, 325,000 people somewhere got electricity for the first time, another 200,000 got running water, and each day, about 650,000 were able to go online.
Yet evolutionary forces leave us with an irrational bias that favors bad news. For many, unfortunately, that means a cynical outlook on life. So much so, it seems, that Trump’s positive recitation of the economy’s performance and Kristof’s summary of the good news for mankind still leave many preferring to be mournful about the problems that remain — some real and some imagined.
Many worry about a middle class they see as caught in a world that produces too many billionaires and not enough ordinary earners. A look at data, however, tells us that the middle class is shrinking as more people move to the upper class and fewer are caught in poverty.
Yet while we may be living in the best of times, especially in America, not many people seem to worry about deficits and debt. Even though we now spend $1.28 on federal programs for every dollar we take in taxes, it’s a worry that seemingly keeps no one awake at night.
Indeed, some liberals argue that we should just print more money if we want more goodies, and that reservations about such behavior are, in their view, unfounded. But according to the good number crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office, deficits are growing, and the crimson ink is getting darker. Deficits will hit the highest levels since World War II across the next 10 years, and we aren’t fighting an all-out, live-or-die world war.
Indeed, by Trump’s and others’ reckonings, we are living in a veritable Camelot. They aren’t wrong, but they omit that we are assisted by a federal government credit card. Let’s hope our creditors don’t suddenly pull the plug and decide it should be a debit card.
CBO Director Phillip Swagel warns that not since World War II has the country seen deficits during times of low unemployment that are as large as what's been projected. And that is the key point we should consider.
These are indeed the best of times. So what will deficits look like when times are not so good? And how will we look our grandchildren in the eyes when we, and they, realize that we have been enjoying a 21st-century Camelot and leaving the bill for them to pay?
How long can we kick the deficit can down the road?

Texto completo: It's the latest fad: Say that President Trump's economic record is actually less impressive than President Barack Obama's. Say that Trump is only benefiting from the policies that Obama spent eight years constructing.
Unfortunately, for its proponents, the fad is false. Trump's economic record is manifestly superior to Obama's, and it's not even close.
True, this doesn't seem so obvious at first glance.
As an array of media outlets and pundits are pointing out, the last three years of Obama's presidency saw more new jobs created than the first three years of Trump's presidency. Trump's critics say that this is proof of Obama's superior economic stewardship.
But not so fast. There are three major problems with this thesis.
First off, as any serious economist will point out, it is far harder to create jobs in an economy with ever reducing slack. This is to say, an economy in which means of human and capital production are more fully engaged. It's one thing to create jobs right after a recession, but it's a very different thing to keep creating jobs when the economy is doing well.
Still, that's exactly what Trump is doing. The unemployment rate is at lows not seen for 50 years, and minorities are benefiting greatly. Wages continue to rise, and those seeking work continue to find it. Productivity is also growing at the fastest pace in nine years.
This is not to say that Trump's trade wars haven't negatively affected manufacturing and the economy at large. Nevertheless, the economy at large is thriving.
Another problem with the Obama-is-responsible-for-Trump's-economy mantra is that it flies in the face of what was being said just before the election. Assessing a June 2016 Moody Analytics report (written by a Democratic Obama ally), which predicted economic calamity under Trump, the New York Times observed that "[the report's] underlying assumptions about what Mr. Trump would do as president and how the effects of those policies would ripple through the economy are plausible, and squarely within the mainstream consensus view among economic forecasters about how the economy works."
Similarly, an October 2016 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco predicted that "once the economy recovers fully from the Great Recession, GDP growth is likely to be well below historical norms, plausibly in the range of 1.5% to 1.75% per year. The preferred point estimate in Fernald (2016), who examines these issues in even more detail, is for 1.6% GDP growth."
That's a whole percentage point lower than the economy's actual growth under Trump.
But there's another factor to consider here. Namely, that whatever we think about Trump, the statistics strongly indicate that Obama's economic stewardship was a failure. As was noted by CNN and others back in 2016, Obama's economic recovery following the 2009 recession was the slowest on record. CNN's report suggested this was partly due to the retirement of baby boomers. But if that's true, why has the economy kept adding jobs under Trump? After all, we still have a lot of baby boomers retiring!
Where does this leave us?
Well, the data should send Trump's critics back to the drawing board. Considering Obama's economic record in November 2016, Derek Thompson saluted an economy made "steady and boring."
Fine. But I'll take Trump's dynamic and exciting economy any day of the week. I suspect many others agree with me.

Texto completo: Writing in The New York Times, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, reported that “In private, Republicans admit they acquitted Trump out of fear.” Apparently, the report that Republican senators were warned, “Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike,” was true, because Sen. Mitt Romney is being attacked mercilessly.
Dishonesty, corruption, fraud and being a bully are not core Utah values, yet we have our own lawmakers jumping into the fray to “censure” Mitt. This unethical behavior is no different than when our governor tried to intimidate Harmon executives to “rethink their ill-advised decision” on opposing the now-tabled tax reform bill.
When there are no consequences for bad behavior, it provides opportunity for others to see how much bad behavior they can get away with. Consequences are important in raising children.
How have we let ourselves become so comfortable with lies, dishonesty, corruption and fraud that we no longer care about our country and the future of our democracy? Do we have integrity if we condone or ignore illegal behavior in our leaders?
Majority public opinion does count, but only if it is vocalized.
Truth, honesty and justice are Utah core values. How did we lose them?

Should college athletes profit from their fame? Here’s where the debate stands.

Texto completo: Washington — The National Collegiate Athletic Association and its sprawling membership of schools are mired in fights — behind closed doors, in statehouses and on Capitol Hill — over whether and how student-athletes should be allowed to profit off their renown.
Here are answers to some questions surrounding the debate, which is virtually certain to last for many more months.
What are the rules right now?
The NCAA’s Division I manual is a thick anthology of guidelines, but Article 12, which covers amateurism and athletic eligibility, is under the greatest scrutiny by elected officials across the country.
Part of that article bars a student-athlete from accepting compensation in exchange for allowing “his or her name or picture to advertise, recommend or promote directly the sale or use of a commercial product or service of any kind.”
The bylaws forbid sponsorships, but also activities like taking cash for autographs or monetizing social media channels. The NCAA also has a rule — with some exceptions — that players cannot participate in a college sport if they have agreed to be represented by an agent.
[ Read more: Sen. Mitt Romney gathers state’s college ADs, expects to work ‘hand in hand’ with them on athlete compensation issue ]
Didn’t California do something about this?
Yes, but with a long windup.
Back in September, California approved legislation that challenged the NCAA’s bans on agents and endorsement deals. It was, however, something of a time-delayed assault: The measure is not scheduled to take effect until 2023.
Still, it has already encouraged lawmakers in dozens of other states to consider bills of their own, and many have drawn bipartisan backing. Some of those proposals would take hold far faster than the California law. In Florida, for instance, one proposal was written to go into effect this summer if it passes.
What does the NCAA think?
No state has passed a measure like California’s just yet, and politicians across the country are approaching the subject with varying levels of intensity. But the NCAA, which opposed the California legislation, has worried publicly about the prospect of a “patchwork” of laws that it fears could undermine rules that apply to colleges nationwide, with conferences and national championship contenders coming from many different states.
In response to the mounting pressure from California and other states, the NCAA has conceded that it must modernize its bylaws, but its working groups and committees have not released any proposals for changes. And the NCAA, which has repeatedly signaled that any revisions would only go so far, is unlikely to give final approval to any rewrites of its rules before January 2021, when it will next hold an annual convention.
“The member schools are working really hard to try to figure out where they want to be on this particular topic,” Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA, said in January at the group’s convention in Anaheim, California. “We’ve been talking with and exploring whether or not it makes sense to have a congressional solution so that there’s some kind of nationwide resolution to it, and we’re going to have to work our way through that.”
‘A congressional solution’?
Perhaps so.
A Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold a hearing Tuesday in Washington, where Emmert is expected to be among the witnesses. The Senate panel will not vote on any proposals, but some members of Congress have already introduced bills related to college sports.
Although Emmert spoke carefully last month about whether Congress should play a role in settling the debate, the NCAA has stepped back from lobbying in the states, and some of the most influential figures in college sports have said they want the federal government to intervene, in part to give legal cover to a multibillion-dollar industry where antitrust issues are a chronic concern.
“It’s important for the working group to look for solutions, but most of those solutions are going to raise issues that will lead to another round of lawsuits without some protection by Congress,” Jere Morehead, Georgia’s president and a lawyer by training, said last month.
So when might Congress actually do anything?
Probably not anytime soon. The situation could change quickly, but final action at the federal level may be far away, especially in a year with a presidential election.
Still, the Senate hearing Tuesday is a signal of the rising interest on Capitol Hill, and lawmakers in both parties have voiced concerns about the NCAA’s existing rules. Some of those legislators are among the most prominent members of Congress, including Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah. But top legislative leaders have not openly thrown their weight behind any legislation, and the White House has not committed to supporting any specific proposal, either.
Given the tensions around the subject, a proposal that shows signs of advancing could still provoke fearsome opposition from the NCAA or its critics. Indeed, some NCAA skeptics already fear that it will use Congress to put a stop to the most potentially consequential changes to the business model of college sports.
“The NCAA is hoping that Congress will wipe away what the states are pursuing at this point,” said Ramogi Huma, the executive director of the National College Players Association, an advocacy group for athletes, and another witness at Tuesday’s hearing. “Congress can either expand these rights and freedoms nationwide, or they can eliminate them.”

Paul Krugman: How Trump got tricked down

Texto completo: One thing many people forget about the 2016 election is that as a candidate, Donald Trump promised to be a different kind of Republican. Unlike the mainstream of his party, he declared, he would raise taxes on the rich and wouldn’t cut programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that ordinary Americans rely on. At the same time, he would invest large sums in rebuilding America’s infrastructure.
He was lying.
Trump’s only major legislative achievement, the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, was absolutely standard modern Republicanism: huge tax cuts for corporations, plus tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy. The only unconventional aspect of the legislation was the variety of new tax scams it made possible, like the benefits for investors in “opportunity zones,” which were supposed to help poor communities but have actually enriched billionaire real estate developers.
Trump also came very close to passing a health care “reform” that would have imposed savage cuts on Medicaid, eliminated protections for those with preexisting conditions and taken away health insurance from more than 30 million Americans.
And there has, of course, been no infrastructure bill; in fact, the Trump administration’s repeated proclamations of “Infrastructure Week” have become a running joke.
Policy wonks are still poring over the latest Trump budget, released on Monday, but there was no hiding the same reverse Robin-Hoodism as in previous budgets: taking from the poor and middle class while giving to the rich.
In other words, Trump in practice, as opposed to Trump in pretense, has turned out to be every bit as committed to trickle-down economics as Republicans in Congress have been for decades.
People often say that Trump has captured the GOP, which is true as far as things like rule of law and support for democracy are concerned. But it’s equally true that the GOP has captured Trump when it comes to domestic policy.
The only difference between Trumpism and the proposals of Paul Ryan in his heyday is that the Trump administration — having blown up the budget deficit from less than $600 billion to more than $1 trillion — has pretty much given up even claiming to care about government debt. Back in the day, Ryan called debt an “existential threat”; a few days ago Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that rising deficits aren’t a concern as long as they help boost the economy.
And as I wrote last week, the economic good news of recent years — not as good as Trump claims, but the economy has indeed been strong — largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under Barack Obama, Republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under Trump.
But while Trump is willing to run trillion-dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, he’s as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate. The grand plan to repeal Obamacare fell just short, but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in Medicaid compared with current law.
But why has Trump turned out to be such a conventional Republican? My sense is that he doesn’t really care about policy, aside from protectionism, which I’ll get to in a minute. And he certainly doesn’t feel any empathy for less fortunate Americans, or actually anyone. So he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the Republican establishment: You get to implement your usual policy agenda, and I get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power.
The one place where Trump has deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war. But why is he a self-proclaimed Tariff Man?
The supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back U.S. manufacturing. If that were really his motivation, he failed: Amid a generally strong economy, we’re experiencing a manufacturing recession, and estimates from the Federal Reserve suggest that Trump’s tariffs, which have raised business costs, have actually reduced manufacturing employment.
My guess, however, is that Trump’s trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy. And while establishment Republicans headed off any important changes in NAFTA, which would have been really bad for business — Trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it — they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other, less critical fronts.
The question now is whether Trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises. Democrats took the House in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy Obamacare. But there’s a real danger that Democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious ideas like so-called Medicare for All that are unlikely to become reality, rather than on Trump’s ongoing efforts to destroy programs Americans love.

Michelle Goldberg: With ‘Parasite,’ class war comes to the Oscars

Texto completo: On Sunday night, Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” morphed from a merely great film into a history-making phenomenon, becoming the first foreign-language film to win the Oscar for best picture. It also won best director, best original screenplay and best international feature. Additionally, this South Korean horror-comedy, a radical parable of inequality, won the Golden Globe for best foreign film, the Writers Guild Award for best original screenplay and the best-ensemble prize from the Screen Actors Guild.
No foreign film has ever been so honored in this country. Besides the excellence of the filmmaking, there’s clearly something resonant about its bleak social vision, so different from anything coming out of Hollywood. Its reception is evidence of the same crisis of faith in capitalism that’s making Bernie Sanders into a front-runner for the Democratic nomination.
“Parasite” depicts a world where a chasm divides the rich, who live in airy minimalist splendor, and the poor, who exist — to a degree that becomes increasingly macabre as the film progresses — literally underground. American viewers might get the impression that South Korea is an extremely stratified society, and while they’d be right, it’s by some measures less unequal than our own. That makes the film’s fatalism about social mobility, so foreign to traditional American sensibilities, particularly bracing.
Americans tend to think of class as being about behavior, at least in part — if you can master the mores of the rich, you can get ahead in the world. Consider the much-loved recent film “Knives Out,” a slightly woke version of an Agatha Christie-style whodunit. (Beware, spoilers are coming.) Its protagonist, a saintly nurse with an undocumented mother, triumphs because she understands and outsmarts the venal rich family conspiring against her. By the end of “Hustlers,” last year’s class-war crime thriller about strippers ripping off plutocrats, the central character played by Constance Wu has hustled her way into what looks like the middle class.
Bong’s world, by contrast, tends to be one in which there is no moving up. “Parasite” isn’t even his most Marxist-seeming film. That would be the 2013 dystopian thriller “Snowpiercer,” in which a failed attempt to stop global warming has turned the planet into a frozen wasteland, and the remnants of humanity are stuck on an ever-moving train. The poor live in cannibalistic squalor in the rear, their children fueling — again, literally — the hothouse luxury of the rich. Salvation comes only through blowing up the whole system and starting anew.
The politics of “Parasite” are only marginally more subtle. It tells the story of a poor family, the Kims, who insinuate themselves into the home and lives of a rich family, the Parks. First the Kims’ son, Ki-woo, fakes university papers to become a tutor to the Parks’ daughter. He manipulates them into hiring his sister as a high-end art therapist for the Parks’ hyperactive son. The siblings then get the Parks to replace the family chauffeur with their father and the meticulous housekeeper with their mother.
None of the Kims, who never let on that they’re related, have a problem fitting into their new milieu or doing the jobs they’ve conned their way into. If they lived in destitution before the Parks, it has nothing to do with their abilities. Nor do their new positions seem to raise their station much; they remain in the same dirty, verminous basement flat.
It’s the stink of that flat that comes close to giving Ki-taek, the Kim patriarch, away. The Parks smell it on him. His place in the economic hierarchy is a material reality that has nothing to do with skill or competence; it sticks to him.
Again and again, “Parasite” shows class as a steel trap. The film spins from comedy to grotesquerie when it’s revealed that the original housekeeper’s husband has been hiding in the Parks’ basement for four years, pursued by debt collectors after his small business went bust. That couple discovers the Kims’ scam, leading to a zero-sum struggle for the scraps of the Parks’ lives.
At the film’s end, after a spasm of murderous violence, infamy and grief, the Kims’ son makes a “fundamental plan” to grow rich enough to save his father. There’s a gauzy sequence where this seems to be actually playing out, and “Parasite” briefly dangles the prospect of a Hollywood ending. Only in the last shot is it clear that it’s a fantasy and that he’s stuck right where he began.
According to the OECD, American social mobility is no more robust than South Korea’s. But with a few exceptions like Boots Riley’s surrealist 2018 indie film “Sorry to Bother You,” American popular culture hasn’t caught up to a world where brains and gumption are no match for larger material forces. At least, it hasn’t caught up consciously: “Parasite’s” feting at the Academy Awards — where nominees received gift bags worth more than $225,000 that included gold-plated vape pens — could itself be seen as a decadent satire about inequality.
Recently, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez elicited spasms of outraged mockery from the right-wing media when she called the idea of lifting oneself up by one’s bootstraps “a joke.” But maybe “Parasite” has struck such a chord because for too many people, inequality is turning modern capitalism into not just a joke but a nightmare.

SPENDING SPREE INTEREST ON FEDERAL DEBT EXPECTED TO SOAR IN NEXT DECADE

Texto completo: The Congressional Budget Office's recent projection that soaring federal red ink will hit $31.4 trillion by 2030 is an issue deserving attention this election year. That figure will be 98% of the national economy, the largest percentage of the U.S. gross national product since just after World War II.
Presidential and congressional candidates should be asked what they will do to avoid the average $1.3 trillion deficits per year in the CBO forecast. If they say spending cuts, they should provide specifics. Tax increase proposals also should be specific and tied to reasonable expectations of what they'd raise.
Budget deficits, which peaked at $1.4 trillion in 2009 before falling to $585 billion at the end of President Barack Obama's second term, are climbing again amid a strong economy. Tax cuts - which did not, as promised, pay for themselves - and an 18% increase in spending during President Donald Trump's first three years in office are partly to blame. So is an aging population and increased spending on Social Security and Medicare.
The other fast-rising cost identified by CBO as driving future deficits is outrageous and pathetic: Interest on the federal debt, which is projected to grow more than 50% as a percentage of GDP over the same period. Those payments will cut into future spending while giving those doing the paying nothing in return. Should interest rates rise, that debt could drive them higher and harm the nation's economy and further cut into spending needed elsewhere.
Our leaders must stop crying about waste they either never identify or never find a way to eliminate. They also must stop promising to raise taxes on someone else to raisethe money for the government services we're getting. There's a reason President Bill Clinton's 1993 tax hike included the middle class: That's where the money is, especially when talking about reliable streams of revenue such as income taxes.
Amid a booming economy, it's time for citizens and elected officials to consider how much government they want, and at what price.
Can we afford our existing military commitments? Defense spending is, after all, more than $600 billion, 15% of the federal budget overall and nearly half of discretionary spending.
Those running for office this year should be pressed to tell the truth, acknowledging the costs of both their big ideas and of the government we've got. And they need to tell us what it's going to cost us, not the future generations already facing $31.4 trillion in government debt put on the national credit card.

Avanza proyecto multimillonario de estadio para New York City Football Club en El Bronx

Texto completo: Parece que el New York City Football Club (NYCFC) finalmente está en camino de tener un estadio al que llamar hogar.
Después de pasar cinco temporadas jugando en un escenario de fútbol improvisado en el Yankee Stadium, los propietarios de NYCFC están cerca de cerrar un acuerdo con la ciudad y con los desarrolladores locales para construir un estadio allí mismo en El Bronx , según The New York Times.
El estadio de 25 mil asientos sería financiado de forma privada y sería parte de un proyecto de desarrollo más grande por un valor de más de $1 mil millones de dólares.
Sería financiado por el dueño del club, el jeque Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahayan, quien también posee el Manchester City , dos veces campeón defensor de la Premier League inglesa, acotó WFAN Sports Radio.
El nuevo terreno propuesto se construiría en viejos estacionamientos que actualmente se utilizan para los juegos de los Yankees. Dos terrenos, en los que se construirá el estadio, deberán conectarse en la calle 153 East.
Es un plan complicado y el Times afirma que la construcción no comenzaría hasta 2022 a más tardar. Eso significa que, incluso si el plan se aprueba, NYCFC todavía tendrá algunos años más para jugar sin casa.
Aún así, esto sería un alivio para los fanáticos de NYCFC, que se han frustrado con la situación de su estadio. Un campo de fútbol dentro de una arena diseñada para el béisbol es menos que ideal, y el club también siempre ha tenido adaptarse al calendario de juegos y eventos en el estadio de los Yankees.
De hecho, NYCFC tuvo que jugar su único juego de seminifales la temporada pasada en otro campo de beisbol, el Citi Field de los Mets (Queens), después de una lucha para encontrar un terreno apropiado.
Según los informes, el acuerdo está cerrado, pero no es oficial. “Hemos tenido el honor de llamar a El Bronx nuestro hogar durante los últimos cinco años jugando en el Yankee Stadium, y mantendremos informados a nuestros vecinos y nuestros fanáticos dedicados mientras participamos con MADDD y otros en cualquier consulta relacionada y el proceso de aprobación pública”, el equipo le dijo al Times.
MADDD Equities es un desarrollador que construye viviendas asequibles. El plan propuesto también incluye unidades de residencia asequible, una escuela, un hotel y tiendas minoristas.

Sargentos de NYPD se cuadran con Trump y “declaran la guerra” al alcalde de Nueva York

Texto completo: Viejas rencillas revivieron tras el ataque a dos policías en El Bronx este fin de semana, generando fuertes reacciones contra el alcalde Bill de Blasio desde la Asociación Benevolente de Sargentos (SBA) y hasta la Casa Blanca .
El mandatario Donald Trump fue el primero en encender la llama, recurriendo a Twitter el domingo para acusar al gobernador de NY, Andrew Cuomo, y a De Blasio de tener un “liderazgo débil” y de ser blandos con el crimen, además de dejar a los agentes de NYPD “bajo asalto”, resumió The New York Times.
El sindicato policial SBA lo secundó diciendo que Trump estaba “100 por ciento correcto”. Agregaron que la ciudad estaba “asediada” y que “los miembros de la policía de Nueva York están declarando la guerra al alcalde” por fomentar un ambiente anti-policial.
“¡Alcalde De Blasio, los miembros de la policía de Nueva York están declarando la guerra contra usted!”, dijo el sindicato en su cuenta Twitter. “No lo respetamos, NO nos visite en los hospitales”.
“Usted vendió la policía de Nueva York a las criaturas viles, el 1% que odia a los policías, pero vota por usted” , continuó el sindicato en su descarga verbal.
SBA también le dijo al alcalde que “los policías de Nueva York han sido asesinados por su culpa”, antes de agregar: “¡Esto no ha terminado!”
Horas después, ayer lunes De Blasio contraatacó, diciendo que el jefe del sindicato SBA debería enfrentar “consecuencias” por esos comentarios donde le “declaran la guerra”.
“Tengo que decir que es triste cuando alguien siente que puede ser abiertamente divisivo y salirse con la suya”, dijo de Blasio a los periodistas en Albany, donde estaba de visita para la audiencia del presupuesto legislativo estatal.
“Creo que debería haber consecuencias para ese tipo de discurso”, agregó, citado por New York Post.
En respuesta vía Twitter esta mañana, SBA dijo que el comentario del alcalde era “risible” y que él “apoya a los criminales”.
Es un nuevo capítulo de tensiones entre NYPD y el alcalde, el gobernador de Nueva York y hasta Trump, quien ha opinado en varias oportunidades a favor de los policías y en contra de los líderes Demócratas regionales.
Laughable! People can commit crimes, vandalize & not pay subway fares all without fear of arrest & he now supports the 1st amendment for everyone but cops? Consequences’ thanks but NO thanks. Ill pay for my own cellphone, subway fare & Mets tickets, while he supports criminals. https://t.co/UyiJoI7zF6

* Trump y De Blasio en nueva batalla por caso de policías que se dejaron mojar en Nueva York
President Trump is 100% correct. NYS & NYC need the support of the Department of Justice. Criminals are being released, it’s time we prosecute in Federal Court. The Mayor is ruining NYC, cops have been stopped from doing their jobs. NYC is under siege. Send in the Feds https://t.co/OuOtwG5h7H

Texto completo: Viejas rencillas revivieron tras el ataque a dos policías en El Bronx este fin de semana, generando fuertes reacciones contra el alcalde Bill de Blasio desde la Asociación Benevolente de Sargentos (SBA) y hasta la Casa Blanca .
El mandatario Donald Trump fue el primero en encender la llama, recurriendo a Twitter el domingo para acusar al gobernador de NY, Andrew Cuomo, y a De Blasio de tener un “liderazgo débil” y de ser blandos con el crimen, además de dejar a los agentes de NYPD “bajo asalto”, resumió The New York Times.
El sindicato policial SBA lo secundó diciendo que Trump estaba “100 por ciento correcto”. Agregaron que la ciudad estaba “asediada” y que “los miembros de la policía de Nueva York están declarando la guerra al alcalde” por fomentar un ambiente anti-policial.
“¡Alcalde De Blasio, los miembros de la policía de Nueva York están declarando la guerra contra usted!”, dijo el sindicato en su cuenta Twitter. “No lo respetamos, NO nos visite en los hospitales”.
“Usted vendió la policía de Nueva York a las criaturas viles, el 1% que odia a los policías, pero vota por usted” , continuó el sindicato en su descarga verbal.
SBA también le dijo al alcalde que “los policías de Nueva York han sido asesinados por su culpa”, antes de agregar: “¡Esto no ha terminado!”
Horas después, ayer lunes De Blasio contraatacó, diciendo que el jefe del sindicato SBA debería enfrentar “consecuencias” por esos comentarios donde le “declaran la guerra”.
“Tengo que decir que es triste cuando alguien siente que puede ser abiertamente divisivo y salirse con la suya”, dijo de Blasio a los periodistas en Albany, donde estaba de visita para la audiencia del presupuesto legislativo estatal.
“Creo que debería haber consecuencias para ese tipo de discurso”, agregó, citado por New York Post.
En respuesta vía Twitter esta mañana, SBA dijo que el comentario del alcalde era “risible” y que él “apoya a los criminales”.
Es un nuevo capítulo de tensiones entre NYPD y el alcalde, el gobernador de Nueva York y hasta Trump, quien ha opinado en varias oportunidades a favor de los policías y en contra de los líderes Demócratas regionales.
Laughable! People can commit crimes, vandalize & not pay subway fares all without fear of arrest & he now supports the 1st amendment for everyone but cops? Consequences’ thanks but NO thanks.

Avanza proyecto multimillonario de estadio para New York City Football Club en El Bronx

Texto completo: Parece que el New York City Football Club (NYCFC) finalmente está en camino de tener un estadio al que llamar hogar.
Después de pasar cinco temporadas jugando en un escenario de fútbol improvisado en el Yankee Stadium, los propietarios de NYCFC están cerca de cerrar un acuerdo con la ciudad y con los desarrolladores locales para construir un estadio allí mismo en El Bronx , según The New York Times.
El estadio de 25 mil asientos sería financiado de forma privada y sería parte de un proyecto de desarrollo más grande por un valor de más de $1 mil millones de dólares.
Sería financiado por el dueño del club, el jeque Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahayan, quien también posee el Manchester City , dos veces campeón defensor de la Premier League inglesa, acotó WFAN Sports Radio.
El nuevo terreno propuesto se construiría en viejos estacionamientos que actualmente se utilizan para los juegos de los Yankees. Dos terrenos, en los que se construirá el estadio, deberán conectarse en la calle 153 East.
Es un plan complicado y el Times afirma que la construcción no comenzaría hasta 2022 a más tardar. Eso significa que, incluso si el plan se aprueba, NYCFC todavía tendrá algunos años más para jugar sin casa.
Aún así, esto sería un alivio para los fanáticos de NYCFC, que se han frustrado con la situación de su estadio. Un campo de fútbol dentro de una arena diseñada para el béisbol es menos que ideal, y el club también siempre ha tenido adaptarse al calendario de juegos y eventos en el estadio de los Yankees.
De hecho, NYCFC tuvo que jugar su único juego de seminifales la temporada pasada en otro campo de beisbol, el Citi Field de los Mets (Queens), después de una lucha para encontrar un terreno apropiado.
Según los informes, el acuerdo está cerrado, pero no es oficial. “Hemos tenido el honor de llamar a El Bronx nuestro hogar durante los últimos cinco años jugando en el Yankee Stadium, y mantendremos informados a nuestros vecinos y nuestros fanáticos dedicados mientras participamos con MADDD y otros en cualquier consulta relacionada y el proceso de aprobación pública”, el equipo le dijo al Times.
MADDD Equities es un desarrollador que construye viviendas asequibles. El plan propuesto también incluye unidades de residencia asequible, una escuela, un hotel y tiendas minoristas.

Amy Klobuchar shakes up New Hampshire primary

Texto completo: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar defied expectations Tuesday night with a strong third-place showing in the New Hampshire presidential primary that catapulted her into contention for the Democratic nomination and made her, for the first time in the race, the woman to watch in 2020.
“She's truly our comeback kid, isn't she?" said Debora Pignatelli, a New Hampshire executive councilor who introduced Klobuchar at her primary night party at the Grappone Conference Center in Concord.
Klobuchar reveled in the surprise surge, telling a wildly cheering crowd, “Hello, America. I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I will beat Donald Trump."
“While there are still ballots left to count," she said, "we have beaten the odds every step of the way."
Early returns showed Klobuchar placing third in New Hampshire, behind Senator Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. She vaulted into the top tier after a particularly strong debate performance Friday night, just as many wavering New Hampshire voters were forcing themselves to settle on a candidate. A tidal wave of more than $3 million in small online donations had poured in by Monday.
“Watching her performance in the debate on Friday night changed my perception of her," said Melissa Walters, a supporter from Bow, N.H. “I just thought Amy on Friday night had the best answers and seems like she could beat Donald Trump."
Women like Walters — who brought her 12-year-old daughter, Hannah Pawlowski, to Klobuchar's election night party — also appear to have helped her over the finish line.
ABC News reported preliminary exit polls showing Klobuchar leading among women voters and benefiting from a substantial gender gap. Sanderswas doing 9 points better with men than women; Klobuchar was doing 9 points better with women than men. Klobuchar also claimed college-educated women voters — winning 32 percent, followed by 22 percent for Buttigieg, 19 percent for Sanders, and just 13 percent for Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, ABC News reported.
“Pete's too young. Biden and Bernie are too old. Elizabeth Warren, I think, just has more negative a message," said Margaret Mitchell, 42, a physician assistant from Concord, of her down-to-the-wire decision to vote for Klobuchar. “I thought she did really well in the debates."
Klobuchar focused her closing argument on her centrist appeal, which she argued would make her a viable alternative to President Trump.
“Donald Trump's worst nightmare is that the people in the middle — the people who have had enough of the name-calling and the mudslinging — have someone to vote for in November," Klobuchar told her cheering supporters as they waved American flags and her green “Amy for America" signs.
The New Hampshire results seemed to indicate the pitch worked for many who find her pragmatic politics more palatable than the notion of a more progressive Democratic candidate. Some of her supporters touted her potential crossover appeal as a nominee.
“I have so many people in my family who are Trump supporters who said if it was her, they'd think about it," said Jenna Breitbarth-Guidi, a Salem, Mass., evangelical who is sold on Klobuchar.
“I'm from the Midwest so she really resonates with me," she said.
Breitbarth-Guidi brought her 5-year-old daughter, Lucy Guidi, to Klobuchar's primary night party, to satisfy the girl's burgeoning interest in politics. But she said that, come the general election, she will not be able to let her daughter watch the debates that include Trump.
“Because of the way he speaks to other people," she said. "We teach her, even if you don't like someone, you don't speak that way."
Klobuchar often says that the election will be a "patriotism check" and a “decency check" on Trump.
Klobuchar targeted Trump directly in her remarks Tuesday night, telling supporters that the president always blames others for his misfortunes.
“When I am behind that desk, I will take responsibility instead of passing it on," she said. “I will bring this country together instead of tearing it apart."
A sturdy, unflashy candidate who had announced her candidacy amid a Minnesota snowstorm a year and a day earlier, Klobuchar said she had been counted out many times over the past year.
“Tonight is about grit, and my story like so many of yours is one of resilience," she said. “America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people."
For much of the run-up to the New Hampshire primary, Klobuchar was polling low but steady, lagging behind four top rivals: Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren, and former vice president Joe Biden. Outpaced Tuesday night, Warren offered congratulations "to my friend and colleague Amy Klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out." The crowd watching the remarks at Klobuchar's party hooted in approval.
The two women represented the opposite poles of the Democratic field — Warren the progressive, to Klobuchar's Midwestern moderation — and shared a split endorsement from The New York Times that recognized the appeal of each approach to Democrats torn over the best strategy to counter Trump. But polls showed the other moderate candidates — Buttigieg and Biden — outpacing Klobuchar until recent days.
But by Tuesday, Biden was so far gone that he surrendered early, leaving the state well before the polls closed.
“I just don't feel like his heart is in it," said Deborah Goodwin, a 63-year-old retiree from Concord who voted for Sanders.
But like many Democrats on Tuesday, she expressed such deep disenchantment with Trump that she vowed to accept whichever Democrat prevailed as nominee.
“I would take Mickey Mouse. I would vote for anyone. I would vote for me," Goodwin said. "It could be anybody on the ballot, I would vote for them against Trump."

Texto completo: It's official: Wireless carriers T-Mobile and Sprint have been cleared to merge. On Tuesday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by attorneys general in Massachusetts, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia seeking to block the deal. The state AGs argued that the merger would lead to higher prices and poorer service for consumers; US District Judge Victor Marrero didn't buy it.
Was he right? That's hard to say. And some states may still appeal. But for now, here's what to watch out for when the deal goes down.
What will happen to my bill?
That's uncertain, especially in the near term. But the omens are worrisome. The US had four nationwide wireless carriers; now it's got three. That's 25 percent less competition, which in theory could result in higher prices and fewer special offers.
Back in 2011, when T-Mobile was denied permission to merge with AT&T, the company responded with a series of brilliant marketing promotions, including free streaming of video and music and free access to Netflix movies. Post-merger, it's hard to see how the the new company, operating under the T-Mobile name, will put out breakthrough deals like those anytime soon. Indeed, the deal is great news for the nation's other two wireless giants, AT&T and Verizon, because they now have less pressure to cut prices or offer new perks. That's why George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports, calls the merger “extremely damaging to competition."
On the other hand, backers of the merger, such as Jessica Melugin of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market-oriented think tank, argues that the merged company will have no particular incentive to raise prices either. T-Mobile will still have to compete against AT&T and Verizon, as well as cable companies such as Comcast with its Xfinity Mobile service. And these days, it's relatively easy to switch carriers, so nobody in the industry can afford to get too greedy.
In any case, T-Mobile has promised that it will offer service at its current rates or lower for at least the next three years. So that's something.
What will happen to my phone?
Sprint uses a cellphone technology called CDMA. But T-Mobile uses the dominant global standard, called GSM, which is incompatible with CDMA. The merged company will be all-GSM, and so some Sprint customers may have to buy new phones. T-Mobile claims these are a minority of customers, since most newer Sprint smartphones can function on either network. But if you've got a cheaper or older phone, maybe it's best to start thinking about an upgrade.
What's Boost got to do with it?
All the major carriers resell phone service under different brand names. Sprint owns two: Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.
But if you're a Boost or Virgin customer, you're about to join Dish Network. As a condition of the merger, Sprint has agreed to sell off those two operations, with about 8 million customers, to Dish, which aspires to build out a nationwide network to rival the giants. But there's a lot of industry skepticism about whether this will really happen, or whether it's just a fig leaf to pretend that the US will still have four nationwide cellular networks once the deal is done. Time will tell.
In any case, Dish says it will keep providing phone service over the T-Mobile network for the next seven years. So there's no need to panic. Still, the Boost and Virgin customers who own older phones with CDMA technology may have to upgrade.
What about 5G?
To hear the merger partners tell it, quicker deployment of superfast 5G technology is the biggest advantage of the deal. But for consumers, the benefits of 5G remain far in the future.
T-Mobile and Sprint say that as independent companies, they'd have to build a pair of cut-rate 5G networks that couldn't compete against 5G from AT&T or Verizon. Sprint was the smallest national carrier, with just 55 million lines, while T-Mobile had 85 million. They lacked the resources to match AT&T, with its 166 million lines, or Verizon, with 119 million. But thanks to the merger, T-Mobile becomes the nation's second-largest carrier. It can now afford to deploy a state-of-the-art system as good as anybody's, and give the US three first-class 5G networks. This will also put more pressure on AT&T and Verizon to speed deployment of their 5G networks.
It's a lovely story, which might even be true. But so what? Right now, and maybe even for years to come, consumers will see little benefit from 5G. Few of today's phones are compatible, and even when they are, 5G phones do pretty much the same stuff as 4G phones, only a little faster. 4G transformed the way we use mobile devices. It's why millions of us watch TV and movies on the subway. But nobody has yet invented a world-changing consumer application for 5G. Until that happens, the race to 5G is the last thing T-Mobile users should worry about.

Texto completo: At least 15 Rohingya refugees, including four children, drowned when the overcrowded boat they were in capsized off the coast of Bangladesh on Tuesday, according to the Bangladesh Coast Guard.
A Bangladesh Coast Guard official, Hamidul Islam, told Reuters that the boat was filled with people trying to leave camps near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have been living since a scorched-earth ethnic cleansing campaign by Myanmar's military in 2017.
“It was inhumane," he said. “The boat was carrying roughly 130 people, while it had a capacity of 50."
Coast Guard officials said that at least 40 people were still listed as missing.
More than 730,000 Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, have fled Myanmar to Bangladesh since a campaign of killing, rape, and arson began against them in 2017. Though both governments have promised the refugees would imminently return to Myanmar, the promise has not been kept.
Instead, the Rohingya live in miserable conditions near the Myanmar border at the world's largest refugee camp. Human trafficking runs rampant, with women sold into sex slavery and men sent away for indentured servitude.
In January, the International Court of Justice at The Hague ruled that Myanmar must take action to protect the Rohingya, the first time an international court has ruled against the country over its treatment of the minority population. But the court has no enforcement power, and Myanmar rejected the ruling.

Trump's Smart Play for African-Americans; His share of the black vote in 2016 was respectable. Even a small increase could put him over the top.

Texto completo: If his State of the Union address and Super Bowl commercial are any indication, President Trump is serious about increasing his support among black voters in November. He may or may not succeed, but we're a long way from his cynical "What the hell do you have to lose?" pitch to blacks in 2016.
Mr. Trump outperformed John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 among black voters, as administration officials never tire of reminding us. But that had less to do with Mr. Trump's personal appeal and more to do with Barack Obama's absence on the ballot in 2016. In recent decades, GOP presidential nominees have averaged around 12% of the black vote. Mr. Trump won only 8%, which is the worst performance of any Republican presidential candidate since 1976, except for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.
The best black outreach is strong economic growth, and the president is right to highlight the low unemployment rates and steady pay increases that have redounded to black workers' benefit during his administration. Last year, median wage growth among blacks was higher than it was for whites. There is no denying that black Americans on balance are better off economically today than they were four years ago or at any point under the previous administration. If presidents deserve credit for such developments, give Mr. Trump his due.
Among other things, the president's pitch to blacks includes touting his bipartisan criminal-justice reform and support for school choice. My guess is that the former won't hurt him but that the latter could pay higher dividends at the ballot box. On Twitter and MSNBC, blacks might obsess over the defects of our criminal-justice system. But outside those progressive bubbles, most black voters understand that the underlying problem in poor black communities is crime, not policing or the length of sentences handed down to lawbreakers. Black families care far more about safe neighborhoods and functional schools, and Mr. Trump's push for more education choices is very much in line with those priorities.
According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 67% of charter students are nonwhite and 58% come from low-income families. Nationwide, five million students are on waiting liststo attend charter schools, which had strong backing from the Clinton and Obama administrations. Yet Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and other leading Democratic presidential candidates seeking the endorsement of teachers unions have vowed to curb the growth of charters. Richard Buery, an executive at the nation's largest charter network, KIPP, told the New York Times last year that this new Democratic opposition to charters is "a reflection more broadly of the lack of respect for black voters" in the party. "These are folks that should be champions of black children and allies of black educators," said Mr. Buery, who is black and described himself as a Democrat.
Nor is education the only area where Mr. Trump could exploit the disconnect between black voters and the Democratic candidates who claim to represent them. Polling has shown, for example, that a majority of blacks oppose Medicare for All, which would eliminate private health insurance for millions who are happy with their coverage. And you would be hard-pressed to find a critical mass of blacks who want to decriminalize illegal border crossing and pay higher taxes to cover the cost of providing free health care to poor immigrants.
If the president is serious about courting blacks, the changing demographics of black America might also aid his efforts. Black people of a certain age, by which I mean anyone who still takes organizations like the NAACP seriously, are probably lost to Republicans. But the black population is younger than the white population, and black millennials have proved to be more persuadable than their elders. While black seniors will likely vote Democrat or stay home, there has been a weakening of black attachment to the Democratic Party among younger blacks and black men. Exit polls showed Trump winning 13% of black men in 2016, and the most heavily black neighborhoods in the country voted more Republican than in 2012.
Black newcomers from Africa and the Caribbean provide yet another opening for the president. The black immigrant population has more than quadrupled since 1980, according to research by Sharon Austin, a political scientist at the University of Florida who has studied black voting patterns in several major U.S. cities. Many of the new arrivals are Haitians and Jamaicans. Both groups are far less likely than blacks in general to vote Democrat.
Does any of this amount to Donald Trump running away with the black vote on Election Day? Of course not. But the president has already shown that he can win without much black support, and Democrats are deluding themselves if they don't think he's capable of improving on his 2016 performance. Black voters have far more to lose today than they did four years ago.

Not Even Socialists Believe in Socialism Anymore; Look south before you vote, North Americans.

Texto completo: Polls say that many New Hampshire voters are selecting Sen. Bernie Sanders today for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Sanders calls himself a "democratic socialist." But Granite Staters who haven't yet voted and citizens in upcoming primary states should note the latest news from a socialist state where the regime also spoke of democracy and originally came to power via the ballot box.
Even socialism's leading practitioner in the country now acknowledges that private investment is the only way to save a critical industry. Anatoly Kurmanaev and Clifford Krauss report in the New York Times:
After decades of dominating its oil industry, the Venezuelan government is quietly surrendering control to foreign companies in a desperate bid to keep the economy afloat and hold on to power...
The government's power and legitimacy have always rested on its ability to control its oil fields — the backbone of the country's economy — and use their profits for the benefit of its people.
But the nation's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, in his struggle to retain his grip over a country in its seventh year of a crippling economic crisis, is giving up policies that once were central to its socialist-inspired revolution.
Not that encouraging private investment will be easy after the socialists have spent two decades turning one of Latin America's richest countries into a land of hunger and misery. It may be especially challenging to attract foreign executives given the treatment they came to expect when working for state-owned Citgo Petroleum Corp The Journal's Jessica Donati recently reported :
Venezuelan authorities rounded up U.S. oil executives held under house arrest in Caracas Wednesday night and moved them to a prison, the top U.S. envoy to Venezuela told reporters on Thursday...
Top U.S. envoy Elliott Abrams said the six Citgo employees, who have been detained since 2017 without trial, were believed to have been transferred to Helicoide prison in Caracas.
If questioned on the horror that is now Venezuela, Mr. Sanders will surely claim that it does not represent his kind of "democratic socialism." But how will he explain the support he provided to the strongmen of Caracas as they went about trashing Venezuelan democracy and prosperity?
In January of 2003, as Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez was cracking down on regime opponents, he was thrilled to receive support from a few extremists in the U.S. Congress. Pascal Fletcher reported for Reuters:
Chavez on Sunday read out a Jan 9 letter of support sent by 19 U.S. Congress members recognizing him as the legitimately elected president of Venezuela.
"If Abraham Lincoln or George Washington were alive and here today, they would be on our side," he said.
In their letter, the 19 members of the U.S. House of Representatives - 18 Democrats and one independent - told Chavez they strongly opposed attempts to remove him from office and condemned Bush administration officials who appeared to support the short-lived coup against him in April.
The authors of the letter included Reps. John Conyers of Michigan, Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and independent Rep. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
It's hard to calculate how much better off Venezuelans would be today if the resistance to the thug Chavez had succeeded in 2002. But even then, Mr. Sanders should have known that U.S. actions in the country did not deserve condemnation. His show of support for Chavez came months after the U.S. State Department's inspector general reported on the actions of U.S. diplomats:
Throughout the course of the weekend of April 12-14, Embassy Caracas and the Department worked to support democracy and constitutionality in Venezuela.
Based on credible reports that (a) pro-Chávez supporters had fired on a huge crowd of peaceful Chávez opponents, killing some and wounding others; (b) the Chávez government had attempted to keep the media from reporting on these developments; and, bowing to the pressures, (c) Chávez had fired his vice president and cabinet and then resigned, the Department criticized the Chávez government for using violent means to suppress peaceful demonstrators and for interfering with the press. Both the Department and the embassy worked behind the scenes to persuade the interim government to hold early elections and to legitimize its provisional rule by obtaining the sanction of the National Assembly and the Supreme Court. When, contrary to U.S. advice, the interim government dissolved the assembly and the court and took other undemocratic actions, the Department worked through the Organization of American States (OAS) to condemn those steps and to restore democracy and constitutionality in Venezuela.
Chavez quickly resumed control in April of 2002. As for the Venezuelans who had briefly resisted his orders, in August of that year the Journal's Mary Anastasia O'Grady noted the "11-9 ruling by Mr. Chavez's handpicked Supreme Court that four military officers involved in removing the president from power should not be tried for insurrection. Those officers say that when they were given an order to use force against the crowd they refused. That eventually led to Mr. Chavez's removal. The Court has ruled their action was defensible."
What is not defensible is Bernie Sanders continually standing up for brutal regimes. In 2006, Mr. Sanders engineered another public-relations coup for Venezuela's socialist government by arranging a deal with regime-owned Citgo to provide subsidized heating oil in Vermont. Whatever it cost the Venezuelan government was surely worth the propaganda value. Mr. Sanders helped the regime embarrass the U.S. Government, which had been trying to alert the world to the rising authoritarianism and economic destruction occurring in Caracas.
Sen. Sanders has a history of supporting socialist tyrants. Now voters must decide what kind of socialism he would inflict on the United States.

Other Than That, the Polling Was Accurate In a series of Monday tweets, Tom Bevan of RealClearPolitics provides a timely reminder that in recent years public surveys ahead of the New Hampshire Democratic primary have been about as reliable as software apps built by Shadow.
First Mr. Bevan reviews the polling leading up to Hillary Clinton's 2008 victory:
Flashback: one of the biggest polling misses ever took place in the Dem primary in New Hampshire in 2008. Seven likely voter surveys all showed Obama winning handily.
Mr. Bevan adds :
As a point of comparison, polls in 2016 Dem primary in New Hampshire had Bernie winning by 13, and he over-performed, winning by 22...
Today , on eve of 2020 Dem primary in New Hampshire, seven surveys all show Bernie in the lead.
Beyond polling, this may not be the finest hour for those engaged in political reporting and analysis. Matt Taibbi observes in Rolling Stone:
Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg seemed perfect, a man who defended the principle of wine-based fundraisers with military effrontery. New York magazine made his case in a cover story the magazine's Twitter account summarized as: "Perhaps all the Democrats need to win the presidency is a Rust Belt millennial who's gay and speaks Norwegian." (The "Here's something random the Democrats need to beat Trump" story became an important literary genre in 2019-2020, the high point being Politico's "Can the "F-bomb save Beto?").
Breaking: President Asserts Authority to Select His Staff "Bigger than Vindman: Trump scrubs 70 Obama holdovers from NSC," Washington Examiner, Feb. 10
But Will Joaquin Approve? "It may sound more like science fiction than science fact, but researchers have created bionic jellyfish by embedding microelectronics into these ubiquitous marine invertebrates with hopes to deploy them to monitor and explore the world's oceans.
"A small prosthetic enabled the jellyfish to swim three times faster and more efficiently without causing any apparent stress to the animals, which have no brain, central nervous system or pain receptors, the researchers said," Reuters, Jan. 30

Texto completo: Wary travelers are donning masks on New York City subways and in San Francisco airports. Panicked consumers are arming themselves with disinfectants. Businesses are suspending operations and airlines are halting flights.
As China grapples with a coronavirus outbreak that has killed hundreds of people and infected tens of thousands more, people across the world have grown anxious about being in crowds or traveling in confined spaces like airplanes.
All of this can be confusing. So we asked health professionals how travelers can stay healthy while on the move.
Philip M. Tierno boarded a flight to Paris not long ago and sat behind a woman who appeared to have a bad cold. She sniffed. She coughed. She didn’t cover her mouth or use a tissue. Tierno, a professor of microbiology and pathology at NYU Langone Health in New York City, asked to move. The flight attendant said no. Sure enough, within a week, Tierno was coughing.
“It was the only time that I wished I’d had a mask,” he said.
So do masks really work? The answer is yes and no. Tierno said he had seen people wearing surgical masks on the subway and it was “like having no mask at all.” Air can seep in through the gaps. A cloth mask, too, provides little protection. Sometimes mask wearers cover only their mouths, leaving noses exposed. “For most people, a mask is not necessary,” he said.
When one is needed - mostly in a place where a lot of illnesses have been reported - people should wear an N95 respirator, a heavy-duty mask fitted to the face that filters out 95% of smaller air particles. But, Tierno warned, “it is a very tough mask to breathe through.”
Vicki Hertzberg, director of the Center for Nursing Data Science at Emory University, said travelers should be wary about the people they sit next to on airplanes. (Tierno had a point.) She is an author of a study that found that the travelers most vulnerable were those seated next to a sick person or in the row in front or behind.
This seems so simple that Trevor Noah recently made a joke about it on “The Daily Show.” Health professionals say washing hands with soap and water is the most effective line of defense against colds, flu and other illnesses.
Just think about where your hands have been in the past 24 hours. Now think about all the hands that have touched airplane tray tables and seat-belt buckles. If that doesn’t give you pause, consider whether you bite your nails, touch your face or rub your eyes.
“The 10 dirtiest things are your fingers,” Tierno said.
Hand washing can reduce the risk of respiratory infections by 16%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If soap and water aren’t available, hand sanitizers with more than 60% alcohol work. Here’s a tip: Hertzberg said to make sure the sanitizer dries on your hands. If it doesn’t, germs can thrive.
“Don’t eat off the table,” Tierno said.
A 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office found that crew members had a limited time to clean the cabin before passengers on the next flight boarded. Some of the people the GAO interviewed said employers “did not provide hands-on training to respond to specific disease outbreaks such as Ebola.”
And the office cautioned that the United States lacked a comprehensive plan “aimed at preventing and containing the spread of diseases through air travel.” One bright spot: Fourteen airports and three airlines reviewed had such plans.
So what does that mean for travelers? Some people bring sanitizing wipes and use them to wipe down seats, tray tables, bathroom handles and even air vents. The health care professionals we spoke to said this was not recommended.
Hertzberg suggested placing sheets of paper on tray tables so laptops or other items don’t come in contact with the surface. She suggested using a paper towel when opening and closing the bathroom door. And forget about using seat-back holders. A 2014 study from Auburn University in Alabama said some germs could survive a week on a cloth pocket.
The risk of contracting an illness from a fellow airline passenger is similar to the risk of getting sick after traveling on a bus or subway, or sitting in a movie theater, according to a 2018 report from the International Air Transport Association. That said, it offered a qualifier: The risk is probably lower on planes because they use high-efficiency air filters that are comparable to those used in hospital operating rooms. Called HEPA filters, they capture 99% of the airborne microbes in recirculated air and are changed at regular intervals, the association said.
What that doesn’t address is the overhead vents themselves, which carry germs transmitted by people’s hands. Health professionals advise moving vents so they blow on hands, not on the mouth, face or nose. The humidity in aircraft cabins is low, too, usually less than 20%. (In homes, it is usually above 30%.) While this poses no serious health risk, according to the World Health Organization, it can cause discomfort to the nasal passages and the skin.
The healthier your immune system, the better your chance of not getting sick. Sleep six to eight hours a night, Tierno said. Exercise. Eat fruits and vegetables.
And slow down, he said: “Stress is the worst thing that can happen to your body.”

Vice Media Group saw problems ahead for its business in 2017 when the new-media company set out to raise more money.
The priority for co-founder and then-chief executive Shane Smith was to secure an eye-popping valuation, some people close to the company say. He got his wish when private-equity firm TPG invested $450 million, valuing Vice at $5.7 billion, far higher than any Vice rivals.
But the cash infusion came at a cost: Vice agreed to guarantee TPG substantial payouts down the road. Under the terms of the initial deal, Vice anticipated making payments worth up to nearly $400 million to TPG in stock and cash dividends between 2020 and 2024, starting last month, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Last year Vice Media renegotiated terms with TPG, which agreed to adjust the payments to favor stock over cash, people familiar with the situation say. That gave Vice some breathing room, but the new arrangement could leave TPG as the largest outside shareholder and dilute other investors.
Vice, by far the largest new-media company, has struggled to turn a profit. It lost about $50 million last year, people familiar with its financials say. The company was targeting revenue of $650 million in 2019 but brought in roughly $600 million, according to the documents and the people familiar with the matter.
It isn't a situation Vice and its management team intended to be in, according to the documents and the people. They were betting the TPG bill would never come due, because Vice would sell or go public before then. Instead, the company, once regarded as a budding media titan that attracted investments from the likes of Walt Disney Co. and the former 21st Century Fox, is resolving a messy equation with investors at the same time it is executing a difficult turnaround.
Some Vice shareholders have had to downgrade their expectations for the company and its valuation considerably. In the last two years, Disney has taken two write-downs on its investments in Vice, totaling $510 million in charges. The TPG deal threatens to jeopardize investor returns even more.
Vice Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc, who took the helm from Mr. Smith in 2018 and inherited the challenges of the TPG deal, renegotiated that pact and raised $250 million in debt last spring from a consortium led by 23 Capital and including Soros Fund Management LLC and Fortress Investment Group LLC. (Mr. Smith stayed on as the company's chairman.)
Ms. Dubuc has told investors she expects Vice to be profitable this year, according to people familiar with the matter. She has sought to hold down costs and focus on areas of growth, including the Virtue ad agency and the company's production arm, which has struck recent deals with Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video, Netflix Inc., Hulu and Showtime.
She also agreed last fall to purchase women-focused publisher Refinery29 to help broaden the company's audience and appeal to advertisers, and to push Vice deeper into the events business. She has tried to diversify the company away from relying on advertising sales, which now account for less than a third of its revenue, one of the people said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Can Vice Media withstand its current financial pressures? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Vice, which made a splash in the late 2000s with gonzo travelogues like its "Vice Guide to North Korea," distinguished itself with a mix of on-the-scene correspondence and edgy articles that cut across topics like food, tech and music. Programming on the Vice TV cable channel, which it co-owns with A+E Networks, has included shows like "Bong Appetit," a series about cannabis-infused delicacies.
Like other new-media companies, Vice capitalized on investor appetite a few years ago for what looked like a booming industry. More recently, Vice and its peers have struggled to compete for digital advertising dollars against giants like Facebook Inc. and Google. Many are developing new lines of business, from licensing to commerce, and are looking to cost-cutting to achieve profitability. BuzzFeed, Vox Media Inc. and Group Nine Media Inc. all expect to be profitable this year after years of operating at a loss. For several years, Vice's valuation skyrocketed as it raised money from in successive waves from venture-capital firms and entertainment giants. By 2017, it was time to raise money again as the competitive landscape was getting more challenging.
At a board meeting held at Disney's Burbank, Calif., headquarters in May of that year, Vice's Mr. Smith said the digital-advertising market was concentrating around Google and Facebook, edging out players like Vice, according to a person familiar with the meeting. While Mr. Smith said at the meeting that Vice would need more revenue sources beyond ad sales, the company's chief financial officer predicted Vice would be profitable in 2018, the person familiar with the meeting said. Mr. Smith said his goal was to raise money one last time before selling the company or launching an initial public offering, the person said.
TPG offered a flashy valuation—$5.7 billion, up more than $1 billion from Vice's previous valuation—unusual at a time when investors' skepticism of digital media was growing.
But the terms acted more like a loan than an equity investment. The original deal—code-named "Project Venus" and announced in June 2017—called for Vice to pay TPG quarterly cash dividends of more than $10 million starting this year. In addition, Vice anticipated making a quarterly equity payment of more than $10 million if it didn't meet an aggressive profitability target, according to the documents the Journal reviewed and people familiar with the matter.

The new arrangement from the renegotiated pact involves shifting the payment mix from cash to preferred equity, the people said.
The original deal also called for TPG's preferred stock to pay out at least 1.4 times its initial investment in the event of a strategic transaction, according to the documents. That meant if Vice Media were to sell to another company, TPG would be entitled to getting repaid at a significant premium before payouts went to common shareholders. However, no shareholder—including TPG—would get paid before the debtholders in such a situation.
The original agreement also gave TPG the option of selling its shares back to Vice Media at a premium if the company hadn't completed an IPO before the five-year anniversary of the funding deal, according to the documents. It couldn't be learned whether these provisions remain after the renegotiation with TPG.
Later in 2017, the management team weighed two scenarios: trying to sell the company in the short term but risk having to accept a discounted valuation, or trying to boost revenue for two years and then push for a sale, a person familiar with the matter said. They contemplated hiring bankers to pursue a sale before the end of 2019, when the onerous payments to TPG were to come due.
Instead of growing, Vice's revenue shrank and its losses mounted . In 2018, rather than become profitable, the company lost more than $150 million, according to people familiar with the matter.
In addition to trying to stabilize Vice's finances, Ms. Dubuc has had to reckon with the aftermath of allegations of sexual harassment by managers at the company that predated her appointment as CEO. Following a New York Times article detailing the accusations, Vice acknowledged in late 2017 that it had failed to create "a safe and inclusive workplace." After Ms. Dubuc took over, she said in an interview with Vanity Fair that sexual harassment wouldn't be tolerated, seeking distinguish the "old Vice" from the company under her leadership.
People close to Vice remain optimistic about the company's turnaround, noting its losses shrank considerably last year. They cite a $25 million investment last fall by former 21st Century Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch—as part of the Vice-Refinery deal—as a vote of confidence.
Mr. Murdoch later said at a conference that he took the minority stake because he thought the company had a bright future. A spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch declined to comment.
The Murdoch family is a major shareholder in Journal parent News Corp.

Texto completo: Couch Slouch
The XFL is back. Ask not why but why NOW?
The reboot of the XFL just debuted - the weekend after the Super Bowl. That's like having a sewerage commission election the Tuesday after the presidential election.
They start playing XFL games on the heels of the NFL's grandest game?
That's like going to Paris, Texas right after going to Paris, France.
That's like ordering a New York strip at Sizzler right after ordering the porterhouse at Peter Luger.
That's like visiting the border wall right after visiting the Great Wall of China.
That's like watching 17 years of Jimmy Kimmel right after watching 17 years of Johnny Carson.
(I'll stop now because I think you all get the point and, frankly, I'm even starting to annoy myself.)
How badly do you need to see more football six or seven days after the Kansas City Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54?
And when I say "more football," I mean the XFL, where the 'X' stands for Xtraneous, Xcessive, Xasperating, Xpendable and inXplicable.
We don't need more football.
We certainly don't need year-round football; we don't need year-round anything.
I mean, I'm a big fan of food detox, but there is a big difference between a 14-day cleanse and, say, a 365-day cleanse. Trust me, you'd be cleansed out before the 365-day mark.
The XFL, which fabulously failed during its one-season incarnation in 2001, has returned to prove again that few people want to watch more pro football after the NFL signs off for six months.
The expression is "March showers bring April flowers," not "XFL passes bring spring masses."
Nobody is thinking about RPOs in March and April. It would be as if pro hockey - training camp to Stanley Cup finals - decided to consume 10 months of the calendar.
(Editor's Note: Actually, the NHL already does this. We would have deleted the previous paragraph, but Mr. Chad is contractually obligated to provide us 800 words per week.)
The new XFL consists of eight teams - in seven NFL cities, plus St. Louis -- playing a 10-game schedule.
Out of professional responsibility to Sports Nation, I decided to take in the XFL's opening day. On ABC, it was the Seattle Dragons at the DC Defenders; on Fox, it was my Los Angeles Wildcats - I'm thinking about season tickets, but I figure I can find cheap seats on the secondary market - at the Houston Roughnecks.
This is what I saw and heard:
ABC's excitable Steve Levy: "The first carry - everything's a first!"
Analyst Greg McElroy: "If you look at Ja'Quan Gardnerprobably not a name you recognize." Uh, you think?
McElroy was intent on emphasizing that these players were THIS CLOSE to being in the NFL, much as I am THIS CLOSE to writing for the New York Times.
With 11:25 left in the first quarter, the crowd chanted, "MVP! MVP!" for Defenders quarterback Cardale Jones. Now, that's funny.
Defenders fans, thinking they were at a R*dsk*ns game, started booing the home team early in the second quarter.
Fox analyst Joel Klatt never stopped talking. He's still talking right now as you read this.
We got to hear the coach or offensive coordinator calling the plays from the sideline, which captivated me almost as much as hearing the pimply kid shout out my order at Wienerschnitzel.
(Memo to the Houston Astros: In the XFL, you don't need to steal signs, you can just listen to the other coach telling you the next play on live TV.)
Anyway, the football was entertaining and many XFL rules changes will be keepers. But for all the bells and whistles, it doesn't alter the inescapable fact that we are not pining for more football the next 75 days.
The XFL is the proverbial tree falling in the forest that no one hears, so does it make a sound?
In this respect, it resembles most Couch Slouch columns - exquisitely written, extraordinarily unread.
Ask The Slouch
Q. Did someone forget to tell Joel Embiid that the Philadelphia 76ers aren't tanking anymore? (Dan Cantwell; Albany, N.Y.)
A. Speaking of which, I guess The Process is complete - the 76ers are now trading away draft picks.
Q. With Bob Knight ending his 20-year split with Indiana, did that give you any thoughts about your first marriage? (Ken Ryan; Huntsville, Ala.)
A. I would have to violate a court order.
Q. Shouldn't fellow Vienna, Va., resident Terry Golden get a bonus - say, an extra 50 cents - for having the most questions answered in your column? (Jan-Peter Ozga, Vienna, Va.)
A. Listen, pal, Mr. Golden has built an addition to his home off of Ask The Slouch winnings. You want me to INCREASE his windfall? You send him the extra half-buck and I'll sign the card.
Q. Is it true that the NFL will be using the Iowa caucus app to speed up the replay process? (Terry Golden; Vienna, Va.)
A. Pay the man, Shirley.

'It's cutthroat'

Texto completo: A great example of the relentless competition for roster spots on the U.S. women's soccer team might have been a short video clip that popped up on social media last week.
In it, several U.S. players could be seen filing off a bus before a training session. Forward Tobin Heath with a coffee and a stony look. Goalkeeper Adrianna Franch, headphones firmly in place. And then a surprise: striker Alex Morgan, seven months pregnant, flashing a mischievous smile.
Morgan, of course, is absent these days from the team she helped lead to the World Cup title last summer. Her first child is due in April, only three months before the Americans open play in the Tokyo Olympics, and her visit to a training session was merely a chance to see her teammates while they were in town to punch their ticket to the Games.
But there also was a subtle message in Morgan's appearance, in her decision to go through warm-ups and in the workout videos she has been regularly posting on her social media accounts: Don't forget about me.
She knows as well as anyone that after Sunday's 3-0 victory against Canada in the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament final, the U.S. players will begin a much tougher competition: the battle for places on the team for Tokyo. And no one, not even Morgan, wants to be left behind.
Simple math makes the battle for places a high-stakes affair: Because Olympic rosters are capped at 18 players, at least five members of the 23-player roster that won the World Cup -- talented, popular, world-beating players -- will need to be cut before the team leaves for Japan.
Regulars such as Allie Long, Morgan Brian and Mallory Pugh, who were left off the squad for the Olympic qualifiers, have already felt the squeeze. And the emergence of new options such as forward Lynn Williams will only complicate the decisions, which can have profound professional and financial consequences for the players involved.
"Yeah, it's tough," forward Carli Lloyd, who wears her ruthless competitive streak as a badge of honor, said of seeing teammates dropped, even temporarily. But she also said it would only get harder. "It's going to be cutthroat."
On Friday, with qualification for Tokyo on the line in a winner-take-all semifinal, coach Vlatko Andonovski showed little interest in experimenting. He started 10 of the 11 players who started the World Cup final in July, subbing only Lloyd for the absent Morgan.
On Sunday, with the spot secure, he rested parts of his favored lineup and sent out Williams, Christen Press and Lindsey Horan as well as second-string defenders Ali Krieger and Emily Sonnett.
Press and Horan rewarded his faith -- and bolstered their cases for bigger roles -- with second-half goals. Megan Rapinoe delivered the third goal off the bench, to the delight of a crowd that roared even louder when she struck her now-famous arms-out celebration pose.
With yet another win over Canada in the books, the daily competition for places and for playing time will only intensify. Mexico coach Chris Cuellar joked Friday that the U.S. was far ahead of its rivals because "every practice is probably tougher than a lot of their matches."
"Every game, every play, every practice -- it's very intense," midfielder Julie Ertz said of the expectations for players new and old. "We take it very seriously, and we have a standard we hold each other to."
Aly Wagner, a television broadcaster who made her national team debut in 1999 and later played in two World Cups and two Olympics, lived those daily battles for more than a decade.
"It is cutthroat," she said. "It's competitive and feisty and intense every day.
"It's emotionally a lot, for each of these players. If you're playing and starting, it's perfect. If you're scratching and clawing to get into this roster, or get into the lineup, it's a grind."
Wagner and current players described the atmosphere of constant competition as a battle not of player against player but of player against "their best self."
But, yes, Wagner said, there were also hard fouls and kicks in training and sideways glances in the locker room. Every player does it at some point, she said, and then sets it aside.
"That's how you navigate this environment," Wagner said. "If you start to think about you versus someone else, that is septic. It's not good for you as a player, and it's not good for the group."
Instead, players try to sharpen their focus on things they can control. Midfielder Sam Mewis said Andonovski had worked with her on improving even a single kind of pass each time. Williams has been instructed to "do right now what nobody else can do and use your speed and be dynamic."
"So that's what I'm doing," she said. "Hopefully he likes it. Hopefully it continues."
In the end, Williams said, whether she gets a bigger role for the SheBelieves Cup in March or a set of April friendlies or even the Olympics "is not my decision."
So she will keep trying to get behind defenders. And Press, who hit the crossbar with a rocket Sunday, will keep trying to score every time she's on the field. And Sonnett -- who played multiple positions in recent games -- will continue to show value in her versatility.
"One step is just getting in the door," Williams said. "And then the next step is hopefully getting on the field."

LEILA JANAH: 1982-2020

Texto completo: Leila Janah, a social entrepreneur who employed thousands of desperately poor people in Kenya, Uganda and India in the fervent belief that jobs, not handouts, offered the best escape from poverty, died Jan. 24 in Manhattan. She was 37.
Samasource, one of her companies, said the cause was epithelioid sarcoma, a rare soft-tissue cancer.
A child of Indian immigrants, Janah traveled to Mumbai, India, in the mid-2000s as a management consultant to help take an outsourcing company public. Riding through the city by auto rickshaw, she passed an enormous slum. But after arriving at the outsourcing center, she found a staff of educated middle-class workers. Few, if any, of the nearby poor were employed there.
"Couldn't the people from the slums do some of this work?" she recalled thinking, in an interview with Wired magazine in 2015.
It proved to be a galvanizing moment for Janah, who called the intellect of the poorest people in the world "the biggest untapped resource" in the global economy.
She went on to start Samasource in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2008 -- "sama" means "equal" in Sanskrit -- with the aim of employing poor people, for a living wage, in digital jobs like photo tagging and image annotation at what she called delivery centers in Kenya, Uganda and India. The workers generate data that is used for projects as diverse as self-driving cars, video game technology and software that helps park rangers in sub-Saharan Africa prevent elephant poaching.
At least half the people hired by Samasource are women, the company says.
"Leila had a vision about bringing the dignity of work and the promise of a living wage to the world's most vulnerable," Kennedy Odede, the founder and chief executive of Shining Hope for Communities, a grassroots organization in Kenya that has worked with Samasource, said by email. Through her work, he added, "young people began to see different possibilities for their futures."
Samasource's employees have worked under contracts with companies including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Walmart, Getty Images, Glassdoor and Vulcan Capital, a holding company formed by Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft.
The company has helped an estimated 50,000 people -- 11,000 workers and their dependents -- and regularly evaluates whether it is meeting living-wage requirements, Wendy Gonzalez, Samasource's interim chief executive, said in a phone interview.
Another venture developed by Janah is LXMI, a luxury cosmetics line that has the same mission as Samasource: to hire marginalized people and give them a decent wage. Begun in 2015, it employs hundreds of poor women along the Nile River Valley, largely in Uganda, to harvest Nilotica nuts and turn them into a butter that is exported to the United States for use in the production of its skin-care products. More people have been hired in other African countries and in India to harvest other ingredients.
The idea for LXMI came to Janah during a visit to Benin, in West Africa, where she saw local people growing shea nuts, from which a butter is extracted, in their yards.
"I said, 'Let's build an export industry but only for poor women,' " she told Fast Company magazine in 2016. "We can solve poverty while also making our skin better."
Leila Chirayath was born Oct. 9, 1982, in Lewiston, New York, near Niagara Falls. Her father, Sahadev Chirayath, is a structural engineer; her mother, Martine Janah, held various jobs, including chopping onions at a Wendy's restaurant, after immigrating to the United States. Leila began using her mother's surname professionally about 10 years ago.

Texto completo: The Justice Department has dropped its antitrust inquiry into four automakers that had sided with California in its dispute with the Trump administration over reducing climate-warming vehicle pollution, deciding that the companies had violated no laws, according to people familiar with the matter.
The investigation had escalated a dispute over one of President Donald Trump's most significant rollbacks of global warming regulations. The Justice Department's move was one of a slew of seemingly retributive actions by the White House against California, as the state worked with Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen of America, Honda and BMW to defy Trump's planned rollback of national fuel economy standards.
A spokeswoman from Ford confirmed last week that the company had been notified that the investigation was closed. Representatives from BMW, Volkswagen and Honda did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department did not release a statement.
The Justice Department's decision could boost the efforts of the auto companies and California to move ahead with tighter vehicle pollution standards than those being finalized by the federal government.
In July, the four automakers announced that they had reached an agreement in principle with California on emissions standards that would be stricter than those being sought by the White House. The announcement came as an embarrassment for the Trump administration, which assailed the move as a "PR stunt."
In the coming weeks, the administration is expected to finalize a rule that would permanently roll back the federal Obama-era standards, which would have required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of their new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs by 2025.
Under those rules, new vehicles would have had to average about 54 mpg. The Trump administration's plan will roll back that standard to about 40 mpg.

Pressure builds to reinvestigate the 1965 killing of Malcolm X

Texto completo: For more than half a century, scholars have maintained that prosecutors convicted the wrong men in the assassination of Malcolm X.
Now, 55 years after that bloody afternoon in February 1965, the Manhattan district attorney's office is reviewing whether to reinvestigate the murder.
Some new evidence comes from a six-part documentary called "Who Killed Malcolm X?," which began streaming Friday on Netflix. It posits that two of the men convicted could not have been at the scene that day.
Instead it points the finger at four members of a Nation of Islam mosque in Newark, New Jersey, depicting their involvement as an open secret in their city. One even appeared in a 2010 campaign ad for then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker.
"What got us hooked," said Rachel Dretzin, a director of the documentary along with Phil Bertelsen, "was the notion that the likely shotgun assassin of Malcolm X was living in plain sight in Newark and that many people knew of his involvement, and he was uninvestigated, unprosecuted, unquestioned."
The case has long tempted scholars, who see a conspiracy hidden in unreleased government documents. A detective in the case, Anthony V. Bouza, wrote flatly a few years ago, "The investigation was botched."
Yet it has never sparked the widespread obsessive interest of the John F. Kennedy assassination or the equally brazen killing of Tupac Shakur. Attempts to reopen the case -- to uncover the possible roles of the FBI, New York Police Department and the Nation of Islam leadership, including Louis Farrakhan -- have gotten nowhere.
"The vast majority of white opinion at that time was that this was black-on-black crime, and maybe black-extremist-on-black-extremist crime," said David Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian. "And there was for decades a consensus in black communities that we are not going to pick up that rock to see what's underneath it."
At the time Malcolm spoke at the Audubon Ballroom on Feb. 21, 1965, he was a marked man -- spied on by the FBI and the police, denounced as a traitor by the Nation leadership, viscerally hated and beloved. Farrakhan declared him "worthy of death." A week before his assassination, his home in Queens was firebombed while he and his wife and four daughters slept inside.
Seconds after Malcolm stepped to the lectern, gunfire rang out, then pandemonium.
Talmadge Hayer, a member of the Nation of Islam from a New Jersey mosque, was arrested fleeing the ballroom, with a clip from a handgun used in the killing. Later the police arrested two men from Malcolm's former Harlem mosque, Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, both known as enforcers.
At trial, Hayer, who later became Mujahid Abdul Halim, admitted his guilt but said the other two men were innocent. All three men were convicted and received life sentences. Johnson, who became Khalil Islam, died in 2009; Butler, who is now Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was granted parole in 1985 and still maintains his innocence.
In the late 1970s, Hayer filed affidavits naming four members of the Newark mosque as his partners in the crime. Civil rights lawyer William Kunstler moved to reopen the case but was denied.
Since then, the legwork has fallen to biographers and independent researchers, including a Washington tour guide named Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, the central figure in the new documentary series.
"It bothered me that no one cared about it," Muhammad said. "I didn't get paid to do any of this. I've sold cars. I'm just a working-class guy."
In 2010 Muhammad uncovered the identity of one of the supposed assassins named in Hayer's affidavit, William Bradley, who had changed his name to Almustafa Shabazz and was married to a prominent Newark activist. It was Bradley's shotgun blast, researchers contend, that killed Malcolm.
Shabazz, who died in 2018, denied any involvement in the murder and lived in plain sight. "I knew him well," Cory Booker says in the documentary, adding that he was not aware of Shabazz's past identity.
Muhammad published Shabazz's name and photograph on his blog in 2010, and then shared his research with Manning Marable, who was working on his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention." Muhammad thinks the other three men named in Hayer's affidavits are dead.

Texto completo: Casper Sleep, a startup that sells mattresses online, has become the latest money-losing outfit to get a cold shoulder from Wall Street investors.
The company's stock began trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $14.50 a share, slipped below $14 in the afternoon and closed at $13.50. The lackluster first day of trading did not come close to fulfilling what Casper's venture-capital investors thought it was worth a few months ago.
The 5-year-old startup, based in New York, had been valued at $1.1 billion by private investors last year. But that was before it disclosed in January that it lost $67 million on $312 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2019, thanks in part to spending $114 million on marketing.
Casper reduced its proposed share price, valuing the company at less than $500 million. It raised $100 million in the offering.
While investors continue to enthusiastically buy shares in the tech industry's biggest companies, they have been skeptical of young companies that are losing money.
Last year, Uber and Lyft, ride-hailing competitors that are both losing huge amounts of money, had disappointing public offerings. WeWork, the commercial real estate company, dropped its IPO plans and experienced a management shake-up after investors recoiled from its poor financial performance.
In an interview, Philip Krim, chief executive and co-founder of Casper, was still enthusiastic about his company's first day of trading. "Getting out to public investors has gone great," he said. "I've enjoyed telling people what we're trying to build and helping people understand it at a level of depth that the headlines might mislead you from."
Krim said his company's model of selling goods directly to customers, rather than exclusively through retail chains, is a new concept to public market investors. "Our business is not what investors are used to seeing at this scale," he said.
Before it went public, Casper had been the toast of the startup world. The company shook up a stodgy mattress industry by selling beds online, delivering them to peoples' doorsteps in boxes the size of mini fridges.
To lure customers from traditional department stores and mattress chains, Casper advertised heavily on subways, podcasts, television and through quirky marketing campaigns.
"They transformed the way people buy mattresses, sort of forever," said Ben Lerer, an early investor in Casper through the investment firm Lerer Hippeau. "People didn't buy mattresses online before Casper existed and now they do."
Venture investors poured more than $340 million into the company, according to Crunchbase, and Casper began calling itself the "Nike of sleep," selling pillows, sheets, dog beds and other accessories to what it termed the "sleep economy."
The company opened 60 of its own stores. In 2017, Casper turned down a $1 billion acquisition offer from Target, which sells Casper products. The chain invested in the company instead.
But as Casper grew, competitors saw an easy opportunity and rushed in, with an average of one new "bed-in-a-box" company launching per week between 2015 and 2018. There are now 175 competitors in the market, according to mattress comparison site GoodBed.

Johnson tried to save impeachment witness's job

Texto completo: MADISON – U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in recent days tried to dissuade President Donald Trump from ousting a key impeachment witness who helped land Johnson in the middle of the House Democrats' probe.
Johnson is one of a handful of Republican senators who unsuccessfully urged Trump not to fire European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland as part of the president's effort to purge from his administration witnesses who testified in the House impeachment hearings, according to the New York Times.
"Gordon was pretty resigned he was going to be leaving the post anyway and I think it would have been nice to give him the ability to exit on his own terms and in his own time in a few weeks," Johnson said in an interview with POLITICO.
An aide to Johnson did not immediately respond to questions from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The Wisconsin Republican became a key figure of the president's impeachment over withholding military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Trump's political rivals after Johnson told the president he didn't want aid tied to such information gathering — a quid pro quo Johnson learned about from Sondland.
Sondland was fired Friday despite the Republicans' calls on the same day Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who also testified in the House impeachment hearings, was escorted out of the White House. The firings came two days after the U.S. Senate acquitted Trump on two articles of impeachment, which were ordered over the withholding of aid from Ukraine.
Johnson joined Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina in warning Trump about the optics of removing Sondland, according to the Times.
Johnson and the Republican lawmakers did not seek to preserve Vindman's job, however. He told POLITICO he didn't respect the way Vindman conducted himself. Both Sondland and Vindman testified under a congressional subpoena.
Johnson is chair of the Europe subcommittee of the Senate foreign relations panel and a member of the Senate's bipartisan Ukraine Caucus. He has traveled to Ukraine six times. And he was the only member of Congress to attend Ukrainian president Voldomyr Zelensky's inauguration in May.
Johnson was blocked by Trump in August from telling Ukraine's president that U.S. aid was on its way amid accusations Trump was withholding it until the eastern European nation investigated his political rival.
Johnson told reporters Trump said he was considering withholding the aid because of alleged corruption involving the 2016 U.S. election. Johnson stood by the president, saying he was sympathetic to his concerns and didn't see any bad motives on his part.
Johnson's full-throated and very public defense of Trump before and during the impeachment of the president stands out amid the silence of many of other Senate Republicans.
The Oshkosh Republican and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley also are looking into "potential conflicts of interest" with Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden is the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Grassley and Johnson sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray last week asking for clarification on "whether Hunter Biden used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business" and details of his travel records.
In defending Trump from accusations that he improperly pressured Ukraine to open investigations into Biden and his son, Republicans have sought to shift the focus onto their claim that Biden conducted foreign policy in order to benefit his son's business interests in Ukraine, for which there is no evidence.
Republicans contend the reason Joe Biden pushed out a former Ukrainian prosecutor was to quell a probe into the Ukrainian energy company for which Hunter Biden served on the board. The former vice president's position was actually that the prosecutor wasn't tough enough on corruption cases in the nation, a view shared by international leaders and anti-corruption groups.
Democrats have said Trump only wanted investigations to damage Joe Biden in the 2020 election and allegations of corruption against him had been debunked, while Trump's legal team argued in the Senate trial that the president had legitimate reasons to be concerned.

In prosecution, a politician sees perk Italy's Salvini bets that a trial would boost his comeback

Texto completo: ROME - Matteo Salvini can hardly believe his good fortune. He's facing prosecution.
In another country, that might spell trouble for a politician like Salvini, Italy's nationalist leader. But Salvini is being pursued for turning away rescued migrants when he was interior minister, by southern prosecutors who have called it an abuse of power and an act of abduction.
As the effort to criminally pursue Salvini comes to a critical juncture, just weeks after a defeat in an important regional election thwarted his attempted return to power, he has seized upon it as a political life raft.
"Immigration is surely not a theme that scares me," said Salvini in an interview in his Senate office, surrounded by the law enforcement shirts he often dressed up in, dozens of cross necklaces dangling in a row like Mardi Gras beads and assorted gifts that he receives on the campaign trail.
It's not hard to see why. The potential prosecution has unwittingly revived migration as an issue despite only a trickle of arrivals to Italy.
And it has rearmed Salvini, an expert in political victimization, with a powerful issue to rally his base.
"I see the similarities of a left that tries to win through legal means that which it can't win through democratic means," Salvini said in the interview, on the day of President Donald Trump's acquittal in a Senate trial.
He added that prosecutions "against Trump will end in nothing, and they will end in nothing for me."
Rather than run from the case, Salvini can hardly stop talking about it, in his daily Facebook Live soliloquies, campaign trail appearances and interviews. He spoke with amazement about a schedule of votes this month and the next to determine whether or not he could be prosecuted for the signature issue that fueled his rise to become the most popular politician in Italy.
"Here," he said, "every month there is a request to prosecute on immigration that they send forward."
They, as Salvini sees it, are ideologically motivated magistrates spurred on by liberal enemies determined to stop his rise in Italian politics.
Salvini's critics see a more straightforward case of his breaking the law, not to mention disregarding the dire human suffering of those on board the ships he left floating at sea and of a judicial system doing its job to hold him accountable. They are doubtful that Salvini will actually vote for the case to go ahead in another legislative step Wednesday. His office says it is still evaluating what to do.
Either way, Salvini, despite his complaint about having to eat breakfast with his lawyer rather than his girlfriend, is now relishing the opportunity.
In the politics of persecution, Salvini has few peers, having picked up where Silvio Berlusconi left off. The media magnate and former conservative prime minister spent decades excoriating Italy's prosecutors as the country's Communist opposition - to great political fortune.
Salvini has replaced Berlusconi as the de facto leader of the Italian right, though he has sat on the sidelines since his coalition government collapsed last summer.
But even Salvini's political opponents have sensed the danger of turning him into a martyr on the migration issue. They have wavered on whether to let the prosecutions proceed, suggested they be delayed until after regional elections and ultimately abstained in critical votes.
There has, however, been one surprise advocate for allowing the prosecutions to go forward: Salvini himself.
"They will put on trial the entire Italian people," he took to saying on the campaign trail, often to sustained applause.
Salvini and his nationalist allies understand how much the issue of migration still resonates with European voters. This month, Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, appeared at a conference of international conservatives in a Rome hotel and said the importance of the 2015 migration crisis was that it had lifted the taboo of speaking about identity and national borders.
Since Salvini's failed bid to trigger early elections by pulling the plug on his coalition with the 5-Star Movement last year, staying at the center of things has become more of a challenge.
That problem has intensified since his candidate's loss in the regional elections in January in Emilia Romagna, a traditional left-wing stronghold where Salvini spent weeks campaigning to demonstrate his dominance of Italian politics and his appeal in formerly enemy territory. He lost badly.
In an effort to find his footing, he has focused on more regional elections this year to apply pressure on Italy's fragile government, an awkward alliance of his former, and cratering, 5-Star partners and the center-left Democratic Party.
But the man who just weeks ago was in such a hurry to collapse the government now seemed resigned to the fact that he had to play a long game. The next elections are not scheduled until 2023.
When discussing his potential comeback, Salvini exclaimed, "There's no rush!"
In the meantime, Italian political analysts have argued that Salvini needed to move more toward the center to expand his support beyond 33%. There were some indications that Salvini wanted to shed his hard-right image.
In the interview, Salvini said that it was "probably a reductive vision" to lump him in with other nationalists like Orban and Marine Le Pen in France based solely on their shared opposition to migration.
His League party, formerly the Northern League, he pointed out, ran many of Italy's regions, including one of its richest and most successful, Lombardy.
It had also, he failed to note, once advocated breaking Lombardy and the rest of the north away from Italy in a fictional nation called Padania. But now, Salvini said, the League was a truly national party, and it had become clear that "Lombardy alone goes nowhere."
Even so, Salvini argued that he was in no way distancing himself from the hard-right nationalist milieu in which he emerged as a global leader. Despite failing to appear at the conservative conference, he met privately with Orban and "brainstormed about scenarios of future collaboration."
His hard line on immigration - prosecution or not - was a winning one and one from which he wouldn't budge.
"I don't move," he said, as he sat at his desk, waiting for the bell signaling the next Senate vote to ring.

Texto completo: Mila Docheva faced down the camera, her contours camouflaged by an outsize hoodie raucously inscribed with neon graffiti. Her turnout, which she posted on Instagram, was an homage to her idol, pop star Billie Eilish.
"When I dress like Billie, I feel just a little bit closer to her," Mila, 14, said through a translator, in an email (she lives in Silistra, a town in northeastern Bulgaria). "I'm not a girlie girl. I am curvy, and I ride a skateboard. Feeling comfortable in my skin is important to me. Billie's style gives me the courage to do that."
Swarms of girls and young women ranging in age from under 10 to their early 20s are echoing those sentiments. They are smitten with Eilish, who took home an armful of Grammys recently, remodeling themselves in her image, posting gaudy makeovers on Instagram and other social platforms, from places as far-flung as Tbilisi and Nashville.
Eilish's following has swelled since her first single, "Ocean Eyes," went viral on SoundCloud five years ago. Her style clout has grown alongside it, on infectious display on Instagram, where she has millions of followers. It recalls the kind of fashion fervor rarely seen since Madonna's early videos incited throngs of very young fans to shimmy their frames into merry widows and pile on stacks of bangles and cataracts of chains.
The enthusiasm of Eilish's devotees denotes a striking turnabout, a new generation's rejection of the flirty babe aesthetic embodied by contemporary idols like Ariana Grande in favor of something more crazily improvised and less strenuously sexual.
At 18, Eilish, who often goes without makeup, favors a pastiche of outsize 1980s and '90s hip-hop and skater looks. That look speaks assertively to a Gen Z crowd chary of artifice and aggressive displays of sensuality.
"Her look is not about vanity," said Lucie Greene, a trend forecaster and brand strategist. "She is flipping the idea of beauty to something surreal, something influenced by gaming and the cyberculture."
"These are not the filtered images of millennials," Greene said.
Since arriving on the pop scene, Eilish has underplayed, and even willfully sabotaged, the vampiness that has long been deemed a prerequisite to stardom. To some she is the anti-Ariana, a tomboyish naïf.
Her look, paradoxically standoffish and in your face, is punctuated by shocks of blue or green hair, riotously patterned tops and tracksuits, and thorny punk and goth references. It is, in Mila's phrase, "an act of rebellion," as provocative as it is protective.
"She has an armor that's bright and loud," said Rachel Gilman, a fashion stylist whose clients have included Bloomingdale's and Adidas. "It's dye your roots green and wear the baggiest clothes in the room. It's good for girls to see that they can succeed without wearing a push-up bra if that isn't their vibe."
The star's advent, some say, could not have been more timely. "It feels fair to describe Eilish's aesthetic as both an antidote to and a queering of the hyper-feminized pop-star archetype," Amanda Petrusich wrote in The New Yorker last summer. Her style resonates, Petrusich said, "in a cultural moment when we are all trying very hard to sort out real people from the ones who are merely savvy and ambitious enough to know the right way to curate and present an authentic-seeming vibe."
Eilish's apparent realness has inevitably snared the attention of marketers as well. Her appearance last spring in the "I Speak My Truth in #MyCalvins" ad campaign contrasted sharply with previous Calvin Klein campaigns modeled by scantily clad boys and girls.
Only last month H&M sought to cash in on the impact of her socially conscious, street-inflected message, releasing a line of sustainably produced sweatshirts, supersize hoodies, bucket hats and beanies.
Eilish presents as audacious and spontaneous, if a bit candied at times. "She dresses like a Disney princess, but she doesn't sound like one," said Giana, a 10-year-old social media personality from Dallas with a shock of emerald-tone hair and an Instagram following of her own. To Giana, who goes by her first name only and dresses in Eilish-inspired clashing plaids and colors, Eilish is the mistress of brash self-invention.
"She knows you can make a look fearless," Giana said, "and she makes me feel it too."
It may jolt her to learn that Eilish once scorned wannabes, venting that resentment in her lyrics. "Copycat trying to cop my manner/ Watch your back when you can't watch mine," she taunts in "Copycat," released in 2017.
She has certainly vaunted her originality. "I could easily just be like, you know what, you're going to pick out my clothes, someone else will come up with my video treatments, someone else will direct them and I won't have anything to do with them," she said in a profile in The New York Times last year.
"But I'm not that kind of person and I'm not that kind of artist," she said.
She seems happy enough, all the same, to exploit an ever-widening fascination with her fashion bravura, entering into partnerships with Freak City, an online platform based in Los Angeles, and with youth-oriented stores like Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic. She has introduced a children's line on Blohsh, the Billie Eilish online store that sells vinyl albums and CDs, along with fleece blankets, socks and sweatshirts with spray-painted logos.
Some fans may chafe to discover that she has worked since she was 14 with Samantha Burkhart, a high-powered stylist whose clients include Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera and Mark Ronson. Her outfits are excessive, Burkhart said.
"She enjoys the uncomfortableness of not fitting in," she said. "That appeals to a generation that grew up sick of manufactured pop music produced in a way that follows algorithms."
Admirers perceive a more earnest intention underpinning Eilish's over-the-top appeal. "She makes ethical choices in her everyday life, from wearing ethically produced fashion to leading a vegan lifestyle," Mila said. "Many people don't take outspoken young girls such as Billie and Greta Thunberg seriously. They diminish them as being just children. But I'm grateful to have them as role models."

Texto completo: MADISON – U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in recent days tried to dissuade President Donald Trump from ousting a key impeachment witness who helped land Johnson in the middle of the House Democrats' probe.
Johnson is one of a handful of Republican senators who unsuccessfully urged Trump not to fire European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland as part of the president's effort to purge from his administration witnesses who testified in the House impeachment hearings, according to the New York Times.
"Gordon was pretty resigned he was going to be leaving the post anyway and I think it would have been nice to give him the ability to exit on his own terms and in his own time in a few weeks," Johnson said in an interview with POLITICO.
An aide to Johnson did not immediately respond to questions from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The Wisconsin Republican became a key figure of the president's impeachment over withholding military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Trump's political rivals after Johnson told the president he didn't want aid tied to such information gathering – a quid pro quo Johnson learned about from Sondland.
Sondland was fired Friday despite the Republicans' calls on the same day Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who also testified in the House impeachment hearings, was escorted out of the White House. The firings came two days after the U.S. Senate acquitted Trump on two articles of impeachment, which were ordered over the withholding of aid from Ukraine.
Johnson joined Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina in warning Trump about the optics of removing Sondland, according to the Times.
Johnson and the Republican lawmakers did not seek to preserve Vindman's job, however. He told POLITICO he didn't respect the way Vindman conducted himself. Both Sondland and Vindman testified under a congressional subpoena.
Johnson is chair of the Europe subcommittee of the Senate foreign relations panel and a member of the Senate's bipartisan Ukraine Caucus. He has traveled to Ukraine six times. And he was the only member of Congress to attend Ukrainian president Voldomyr Zelensky's inauguration in May.
Johnson was blocked by Trump in August from telling Ukraine's president that U.S. aid was on its way amid accusations Trump was withholding it until the eastern European nation investigated his political rival.
Johnson told reporters Trump said he was considering withholding the aid because of alleged corruption involving the 2016 U.S. election.

Why caucuses are more democratic than primaries

Texto completo: The national media received what it had requested, and now it wants to blame the Iowa Democratic Party for not having the media's information quick enough.
For years, national and local media have yearned for raw numbers from the Iowa Democratic caucuses. There was a reason why previous caucuses did not release raw numbers: They actually have no relevance. This year, a delay in providing information became news itself rather than the news the media is seeking.
Before you criticize the Iowa caucuses, you should know a little about them. That's most of the problem; representatives of media know little about them.
The New York Times, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, CNN, the Des Moines Register, and every news outlet around the world cannot talk or write about the Iowa caucuses without using the word "vote." Let's make it clear that not one Democratic presidential candidate left Iowa with as much as one vote. Iowa's Democrats don't vote in caucuses except to elect a caucus chairperson, secretary, precinct committee people, and a slate of delegates. Oh, yes, and there is a vote taken to adopt planks that will eventually become the party platform, the original purpose of neighborhood caucuses.
Iowa Republicans do vote. However, as Kevin Cooney mentions in his Des Moines Register op-ed of Feb. 4, it doesn't mean very much because the real election comes later in the caucus, after most people have left, and it's an election for delegates.
Democratic caucuses are mini-conventions. Delegates are selected to advance to the next convention level, and delegates are chosen by those individuals who share the same slant on policies as the person they want to represent them. Many delegates are chosen based upon the volunteer work they have donated to a particular candidate. Caucusgoers aligning with a particular candidate vote for the delegate to represent them at the next level in the process — not for the candidate.
Another way to look at a caucus is to compare it to a ballot petition. You may sign a petition for a candidate to get on the ballot, but your signature is not a vote. Likewise, if a candidate's group must contain 20 people to be viable, and the group can come with only five eligible participants, it's like not having enough signatures on a petition to get on a ballot.
Caucuses differ from primaries in several ways, but a caucus is actually more democratic. Primaries give citizens the opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate, but not the people in their neighborhood who are going to be leaders in their local politics.
On the day after the Iowa caucuses, "Meet the Press" moderator Chuck Todd said that there are too many numbers to digest. That is part of the media's problem. It wants results, numerous results, and it wants them now. Wouldn't you rather settle for accurate results instead of quick, inaccurate results? Isn't that what the media wanted in 2016? And in 2012? And in 2008? The media wanted the numbers of the first alignment, the second alignment, and the final delegate count. Now that it has those numbers, it's complaining about those numbers.
What goes around comes around. Keep the caucuses. Whether Iowa precincts select particular delegates to county, district, and state conventions, who just happen to be supporting a particular candidate, should be irrelevant. It's politics at the grassroots level — not the level desired by the media. At least the Democratic neighbors will know that they have a long-term voice, not just a fleeting vote.

Texto completo: Ed Stefanski believes the Pistons are well-positioned.
After the Andre Drummond trade, the franchise has financial flexibility, armed with $35 million in cap space for future roster construction.
The Pistons have some promising young pieces in third-year guard Luke Kennard, rookie Sekou Doumbouya, surging big man Christian Wood and second-year guards Svi Mykhailiuk and Bruce Brown.
The Pistons own all of their future first-round picks.
The Drummond trade added a future second-round pick.
But with the Pistons fully committed to a youth movement and developing prospects, why not add more?
That's the main question skeptical fans rightfully have after the Pistons retained veterans Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris and Langston Galloway through Thursday's trade deadline.
If it's about asset acquisition, why not turn those veterans into future picks?
Stefanski, the Pistons senior advisor, said there were talks, but indicated the market – specifically with Jackson, Morris and Galloway – wasn't there.
The Pistons weren't going to make a trade just to make a trade — despite the presence of two productive second-round picks in Brown and Mykhailiuk.
"I've been in this long enough to say, hat name am I going to put that to?' " Stefanski said during Friday's teleconference. "We have egos and think we're good talent evaluators, but it's not that easy when you get a pick in the 50s."
Stefanski didn't mention another aspect.
The market simply wasn't there for Jackson, Galloway and Morris.
And with Rose, as I reported previously, the Pistons preferred to keep him around.
Inside the deadline Several teams — notably the Lakers and Clippers — are seeking to add playmaking for a title run.
Why not Jackson, who scored 28 points Friday night in the Pistons' loss at Oklahoma City?
He's on an expiring deal and the Pistons have paid nearly 66% of his $18 million salary so the financial hit isn't as onerous for the oft-injured point guard.
That wasn't enough to create a market.
Multiple league sources have told the Free Press for several seasons Jackson had little trade value and that came to fruition.
There's the injury history. He has missed significant time in three of the last four seasons because of injuries, including a back issue that forced him to miss 42 games this season.
Jackson also still carries baggage from forcing his way out of Oklahoma City at the 2015 trade deadline.
Galloway reportedly received interest from the 76ers, but he remains an undersized shooting guard.
The 76ers obtained wings Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks from the Warriors, which eliminated a potential trade partner.
A source with firsthand knowledge of the Pistons front office's thinking said if they could have landed a second-round pick for Jackson or Galloway, they would have done it.
Reports say Jackson is a candidate to be bought out.
The New York Times reported late Friday night the Clippers would be a potential suitor.
"I haven't thought about it," Jackson said. "I don't know who said that."
Rose can help the youngsters The Pistons' young players drew significant interest.
Wood offers 3-point shooting in a 6-foot-10 athletic frame for a contenter, but the Pistons hope to re-sign the free agent this offseason.
The Pistons were deep in talks with the Suns about a potential Kennard trade; ESPN reported talks reached an impasse because the Suns sought limits on first-round pick compensation.
Kennard has missed the past 24 games with soreness in both knees and that may have limited trade activity.
Kennard is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension this offseason, but sources say the Pistons aren't concerned about the price tag.
Rose probably could have fetched a late first-round or an early second-round pick.
But if the Pistons draft a point guard, he could be moved later.
He has missed two straight games with a hip issue so that may have depressed his trade value.
Stefanski is good with that.
"He's a leader," Stefanski said.. "They love him, they probably idolize him a little bit. He's great with the young guys. On the court, he's just a terrific player to help them.
"Going forward, you are going to need some veterans and I don't know if you can pick a better veteran than Derrick Rose to help you go forward in this rebuild."

Texto completo: It was a rough week for Democrats. President Donald Trump is preening over his acquittal, his poll numbers and the economy, while the Democratic nomination race looks like a divided mess. Many Democratic voters are anxious that they have no great candidates, only those guaranteed to alienate one half of the party or the other.
Moderates worry that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren aren't just wrong on big issues, but too left-wing to get elected. Progressives worry that Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bloomberg are uninspiring centrists who resemble recent presidential losers and wouldn't solve America's problems even if they won.
My message to panicking Democrats is: Take a deep breath, and don't make your job harder. Neither side of the party can ensure that its preferred candidate will win the nomination. But both can help avoid the outcome they fear most - Trump's reelection.
The current moment, when everybody is wearing a veil of ignorance about the nomination, is a good time for Democrats to ask themselves a question: If the primaries don't turn out as you hope, will you still do everything ito deny Trump a second term?
Or will you instead exaggerate your differences with the nominee - say, complain about Sanders or Warren as a Trump-style radical; or buy into the caricature of Buttigieg as a corporate tool; or retweet, with outrage added, the least enlightened things Biden or Bloomberg has ever said?
Yes, the candidates have their differences. But they have much bigger similarities. If elected, every single Democratic presidential candidate would act to slow climate change, raise taxes on the rich, reduce gun deaths, expand voting rights, lower health care and education costs, protect abortion access, enforce civil-rights laws, appoint progressive judges, rebuild overseas alliances and stop treating the Justice Department as a personal enforcer. The moderates are running to the left of Barack Obama, and the progressives would be constrained by Congress. The alternative, of course, is truly radical. Many Democrats know all this, yet they still get so caught up in the passions of the primary campaign that they risk helping Trump.
Today the Republican Party has become so radicalized that it opposes almost any government action to solve problems.
Progressives are right that over the past half century, Democratic moderates have often allowed conservatives to dictate the terms of political conversation, on economic growth, criminal justice, family values and more.
Moderates, for their part, are right that every great progressive victory in American history - abolition, women's suffrage, the income tax, labor rights, Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, marriage equality and more - has required compromise in the service of persuading allies who disagree with progressives on other issues. It's not enough to state your case purely and wait for a silent progressive majority to emerge.
In the long run, each side is likely to accomplish much more if it can recognize that the other isn't the enemy. In the short run, obviously, there is an inescapable dilemma: The party can nominate only one person. Before that choice is made - while both sides are fighting hard for their preferred nominees, as they should - they should pause to reflect on the strengths of the other side. For progressives, that means recognizing that moderate congressional candidates really did fare better in swing districts in 2018.
For moderates, it means acknowledging that Sanders' pugnacious authenticity appeals to some swing voters more than wonkish centrism does. And it means pushing back against the false notion that Sanders and Warren are somehow un-American. A Sanders or Warren presidency would have more in common with Dwight Eisenhower's presidency than a second Trump term would have with either of them.
The 2020 campaign still has a long way to go. Democrats should remember which parts of it they can't control and which they can.

Texto completo: MADISON - U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in recent days tried to dissuade President Donald Trump from ousting a key impeachment witness who helped land Johnson in the middle of the House Democrats' probe.
Johnson is one of a handful of Republican senators who unsuccessfully urged Trump not to fire European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland as part of the president's effort to purge from his administration witnesses who testified in the House impeachment hearings, according to the New York Times.
"Gordon was pretty resigned he was going to be leaving the post anyway and I think it would have been nice to give him the ability to exit on his own terms and in his own time in a few weeks," Johnson said in an interview with POLITICO.
An aide to Johnson did not immediately respond to questions from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The Wisconsin Republican became a key figure of the president's impeachment over withholding military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Trump's political rivals after Johnson told the president he didn't want aid tied to such information gathering — a quid pro quo Johnson learned about from Sondland.
Sondland was fired Friday despite the Republicans' calls on the same day Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who also testified in the House impeachment hearings, was escorted out of the White House. The firings came two days after the U.S. Senate acquitted Trump on two articles of impeachment, which were ordered over the withholding of aid from Ukraine.
Johnson joined Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina in warning Trump about the optics of removing Sondland, according to the Times.
Johnson and the Republican lawmakers did not seek to preserve Vindman's job, however. He told POLITICO he didn't respect the way Vindman conducted himself. Both Sondland and Vindman testified under a congressional subpoena.
Johnson is chair of the Europe subcommittee of the Senate foreign relations panel and a member of the Senate's bipartisan Ukraine Caucus. He has traveled to Ukraine six times. And he was the only member of Congress to attend Ukrainian president Voldomyr Zelensky's inauguration in May.
Johnson was blocked by Trump in August from telling Ukraine's president that U.S. aid was on its way amid accusations Trump was withholding it until the eastern European nation investigated his political rival.
Johnson told reporters Trump said he was considering withholding the aid because of alleged corruption involving the 2016 U.S. election. Johnson stood by the president, saying he was sympathetic to his concerns and didn't see any bad motives on his part.
Johnson's full-throated and very public defense of Trump before and during the impeachment of the president stands out amid the silence of many of other Senate Republicans.
The Oshkosh Republican and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley also are looking into "potential conflicts of interest" with Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden is the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Grassley and Johnson sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray last week asking for clarification on "whether Hunter Biden used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business" and details of his travel records.
In defending Trump from accusations that he improperly pressured Ukraine to open investigations into Biden and his son, Republicans have sought to shift the focus onto their claim that Biden conducted foreign policy in order to benefit his son's business interests in Ukraine, for which there is no evidence.
Republicans contend the reason Joe Biden pushed out a former Ukrainian prosecutor was to quell a probe into the Ukrainian energy company for which Hunter Biden served on the board. The former vice president's position was actually that the prosecutor wasn't tough enough on corruption cases in the nation, a view shared by international leaders and anti-corruption groups.
Democrats have said Trump only wanted investigations to damage Joe Biden in the 2020 election and allegations of corruption against him had been debunked, while Trump's legal team argued in the Senate trial that the president had legitimate reasons to be concerned.

After the Andre Drummond trade, the franchise has financial flexibility, armed with $35 million in cap space for future roster construction.
The Pistons have some promising young pieces in third-year guard Luke Kennard, rookie Sekou Doumbouya, surging big man Christian Wood and second-year guards Svi Mykhailiuk and Bruce Brown.
The Pistons own all of their future first-round picks.
The Drummond trade added a future second-round pick.
But with the Pistons fully committed to a youth movement and developing prospects, why not add more?
That's the main question skeptical fans rightfully have after the Pistons retained veterans Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris and Langston Galloway through Thursday's trade deadline.
If it's about asset acquisition, why not turn those veterans into future picks?
Stefanski, the Pistons senior advisor, said there were talks, but indicated the market – specifically with Jackson, Morris and Galloway – wasn't there.
The Pistons weren't going to make a trade just to make a trade — despite the presence of two productive second-round picks in Brown and Mykhailiuk.
"I've been in this long enough to say, hat name am I going to put that to?' " Stefanski said during Friday's teleconference. "We have egos and think we're good talent evaluators, but it's not that easy when you get a pick in the 50s."
Stefanski didn't mention another aspect.
The market simply wasn't there for Jackson, Galloway and Morris.
And with Rose, as I reported previously, the Pistons preferred to keep him around.
Inside the deadline Several teams — notably the Lakers and Clippers — are seeking to add playmaking for a title run.
Why not Jackson, who scored 28 points Friday night in the Pistons' loss at Oklahoma City?
He's on an expiring deal and the Pistons have paid nearly 66% of his $18 million salary so the financial hit isn't as onerous for the oft-injured point guard.
That wasn't enough to create a market.
Multiple league sources have told the Free Press for several seasons Jackson had little trade value and that came to fruition.
There's the injury history. He has missed significant time in three of the last four seasons because of injuries, including a back issue that forced him to miss 42 games this season.
Jackson also still carries baggage from forcing his way out of Oklahoma City at the 2015 trade deadline.
Galloway reportedly received interest from the 76ers, but he remains an undersized shooting guard.
The 76ers obtained wings Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks from the Warriors, which eliminated a potential trade partner.
A source with firsthand knowledge of the Pistons front office's thinking said if they could have landed a second-round pick for Jackson or Galloway, they would have done it.
Reports say Jackson is a candidate to be bought out.
The New York Times reported late Friday night the Clippers would be a potential suitor.
"I haven't thought about it," Jackson said. "I don't know who said that."
Rose can help the youngsters The Pistons' young players drew significant interest.
Wood offers 3-point shooting in a 6-foot-10 athletic frame for a contenter, but the Pistons hope to re-sign the free agent this offseason.
The Pistons were deep in talks with the Suns about a potential Kennard trade; ESPN reported talks reached an impasse because the Suns sought limits on first-round pick compensation.
Kennard has missed the past 24 games with soreness in both knees and that may have limited trade activity.
Kennard is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension this offseason, but sources say the Pistons aren't concerned about the price tag.
Rose probably could have fetched a late first-round or an early second-round pick.
But if the Pistons draft a point guard, he could be moved later.
He has missed two straight games with a hip issue so that may have depressed his trade value.
Stefanski is good with that.
"He's a leader," Stefanski said.. "They love him, they probably idolize him a little bit. He's great with the young guys. On the court, he's just a terrific player to help them.
"Going forward, you are going to need some veterans and I don't know if you can pick a better veteran than Derrick Rose to help you go forward in this rebuild."

Texto completo: As the European Union considers a five-year ban on facial recognition technology, affording lawmakers the opportunity to conduct research and craft meaningful regulation, revelations regarding the practices of an American facial recognition company should motivate Congress to consider its own temporary ban on the technology.
Facial recognition software has been controversial for some time now. The technology has the ability to compare photos taken by, say, a surveillance camera with a larger pool of photos — driver’s license pictures, mug shots, etc. The software then connects the images, thus giving the user the identity of the person captured on surveillance image.
Law enforcement and government officials have celebrated the technology’s ability to identify criminals, while civil liberty and privacy advocates fear facial recognition could infringe upon the rights of every citizen whose image is captured and examined.
To this point, facial recognition has relied upon preexisting photo databases, curated by law enforcement or the government. But Clearview AI, a relatively new facial recognition company founded by Australian entrepreneur Hoan Ton-That, has pushed the technology into disturbing new territory. According to an investigative report published by The New York Times, Clearview’s software is groundbreaking in its scope. A user can upload a picture of a person, which is then cross-referenced with Clearview’s photo database — a database that has been constructed by scraping more than 3 billion images from social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Venmo and more.
Clearview’s “innovation” has sparked a lot of interest in the U.S. law enforcement community. The company has partnered with more than 600 state and federal agencies throughout the country. Officials claim that Clearview has been used to solve crimes ranging from theft to fraud to murder. The Indiana State Police say Clearview helped solve a shooting within 20 minutes of the incident.
Despite the excitement the software has created among law enforcement, Clearview’s business model is rife with concerns related to civil liberties, criminal justice and privacy.
Even the most rigorously tested facial recognition systems are not 100% accurate. In fact, they are inaccurate an alarming amount of the time, particularly when identifying people of color. But Clearview’s system has not been scrutinized by independent third parties or industry experts. And because large databases increase the risk of misidentification, Clearview’s system could be even more likely to provide false positives, which could lead to wrongful arrests.
There are also many concerns about the data Clearview has accumulated, who may have access to it and how the software could be used. Any person who appears in a photo that has been posted on social media — in other words, most Americans — could be identified by Clearview. From there, the opportunities for abuse are myriad.
Congress should see the current conversation around Clearview and facial recognition as reason to take action. Clearview’s decision to transgress the unofficial rules of facial recognition have made it clear that real rules must be created, to protect citizens from unlawful intrusion by private companies, law enforcement and the government.
U.S. lawmakers should take a cue from the EU and impose their own temporary ban on facial recognition technology. The suspension would give researchers time to study facial recognition’s accuracy, its effects in other countries (facial recognition is already commonplace in China) and create recommendations for future regulations.
The dangers of facial recognition are too numerous to allow its spread to continue unabated. The U.S. is on a slippery slope to accepting a surveillance state. We need more research, evidence and debate before facial recognition can become the norm.

Work permits for Maine's asylum applicants? Slow down We need more data on how long it takes most refugees to make enough in wages to support their families without taxpayer help.

Texto completo: HOLDEN -- As more asylum seekers arrive in Portland, members of Maine's congressional delegation want to expedite work permits, pointing to labor shortages and taxpayer costs. But good reasons exist for continuing to require a wait for work permits.
Before 1994, we gave asylum seekers work permits on arrival, which led to an explosion of asylum applications. The Clinton administration established a six-month waiting period to discourage frivolous claims and address a growing backlog. Following the implementation of the waiting period, asylum claims plummeted 57 percent, freeing up resources to focus on bonafide refugees.
Denise N. Slavin, then-vice president of the National Association of Immigration Lawyers, told The New York Times in 2011, "Fraud in immigration asylum is a huge issue and a major problem." In 2012, the Obama administration indicted 10 New York law firms and dozens of immigration lawyers who helped asylum applicants fake their stories.
Since 2009 asylum claims have skyrocketed. In response, the Trump administration, taking a cue from Clinton, proposed a longer waiting period for work authorization. A more effective response would be to increase the number of immigration judges to process applications more rapidly, focusing on serious claims and expeditiously deporting those with frivolous claims.
I believe that the labor benefit of employing asylum applicants is exaggerated, as court denial rates for West African applicants are up to 50 percent, suggesting that almost half of Portland's asylum seekers will eventually be denied and possibly be deported. And of those who achieve refugee status, there are substantial costs.
An internal Trump administration study leaked to the Times, "The Fiscal Costs of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and Local Levels from 2005-2014," provides important data for Maine's representatives in Washington. The authors estimate that refugees and their dependents generated a $52.8 billion federal surplus but caused a net deficit at the state and local levels of $35.9 billion. Since the federal surplus would be shared nationwide, but the state and local deficits fall entirely on state and local governments, increasing the number of refugees in Maine would cost Maine taxpayers.
And I imagine that the study's computed federal benefit is inflated, as the impact of refugees on the high cost of national defense or federal debt was not included in this study.
Refugee costs shouldn't surprise us. Moving to a new country, learning the language and making enough money to support your family is difficult. The Maine Department of Labor looked at the employment data five years after Somalis arrived in Lewiston-Auburn in 2001. By 2006, only half of working-age Somalis had worked at all. Many of those jobs were seasonal and low wage.
Before providing work permits to a new population of asylees, we need more data. How long does it take most refugees to make enough to support their families without taxpayer programs? Will Portland's applicants stay when they get refugee status? Or will they move to cities with better wages? Do they have the skills our employers need?
The New Mainers Resource Center, providing language instruction, case management and links to employers, reports that 398 people contacted the center for services in 2018; 73 percent had a college degree, and 95 percent of this population found jobs. But we don't know how this number compares to the nearly 20,000 refugee population. How many asylum applicants who already have work permits are employed?And at what wages? The center also reports that one of the greatest challenges is finding work that pays a livable wage.
When politicians provide foreign workers to employers that don't pay a livable wage, then taxpayers will eventually subsidize the employee with public programs. It would be better to require employers to recruit Americans.
And we might ponder the future. A recent McKinsey study is projecting that automation will replace nearly half of the American workforce by 2055. Walmart already uses robots to stock shelves, and McKinsey predicts that automation will sweep the economy. Let's slow down, and think this one through.

MY FREDERICK DOUGLASS JOURNEY REFLECTING ON A LIFE FOLLOWING THE FAMED ABOLITIONIST

Texto completo: During this 2020 Black History Month, I would like to examine the remarkable journey of Frederick Douglass but in the context of my own experience.
Douglass was born into slavery on a plantation on the eastern shore of Maryland around 1818. He grew up to be a renowned orator, preacher, diplomat, publisher (mainly through the North Star newspaper), banker and, most important, an international abolitionist leader.
Through his autobiographical writing, we learn that his enslaved mother - who died when he was 7 years old - was black and his unknown father was white. As a boy, he was hired out and/or gifted to others repeatedly. But, fed up with the tribulations of slavery, he escaped in 1838 - after two attempts - with the help of a free black girlfriend, Anna Murray, whom he married within days of his liberation.
Mr. Douglass had educated himself, as well as other slave children. He fashioned a career as a powerful voice in America and England against slavery. He was also a confidante of Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and, before him, Abraham Lincoln, with whom he often disagreed, particularly on black suffrage.
Like a real-life black Forrest Gump with somewhat more wits, I shamelessly put myself in the historical Douglass conversation: in my New York hometown of Syracuse, where I grew up professionally, and in my adopted home of Pittsburgh.
In the Victorian-era Great Hall of the Cooper Union, downtown Manhattan's private engineering, art and architectural college (where Lincoln had spoken on Feb. 27, 1860), I sat enthralled by the majesty of it all as my physicist friend, Cooper Union President George Campbell, delivered his inauguration address in 2000.
It was at this event that I was made aware that on Feb. 2, 1863, Frederick Douglass had addressed a Great Hall audience praising President Lincoln's newly issued Emancipation Proclamation, free speech and freedom of assembly, as well as the virtues of arming black men and enlisting them into the Civil War's Union army. (The Douglass lecture was summarized the next day in The New York Times, where it was noted that the event was presided over by New Yorker Henry Highland Garnet, who would found Pittsburgh's first black Presbyterian church - Grace Memorial - five years later in 1868.)
In mourning and outrage, Douglass returned to the Great Hall at Cooper Union on June 1, 1865, and delivered a rebuke of the New York City Council ordinance forbidding African Americans from participating in the parade accompanying the funeral procession of the recently assassinated President Lincoln.
About 100 years later, and on a significantly happier note, my family vacationed on Martha's Vineyard down the street from the family of Frederick Douglass Weaver, the great-great grandson of the mighty abolitionist. The descendant headed an amiable clan that comprised of seven children, including a teenage daughter named Anastasia.
On an even more personal note, shortly after my arrival in 1977 as a vice president at Syracuse University, I encountered a young lady with a vaguely familiar name: It was Anastasia Weaver. She established that she was indeed a daughter of Fred Weaver, the Douglass great-great grandson, who had adopted her. She graduated from SU in 1980.
As a group of us organized a black and Latino(a) SU alumni network, research revealed that the first black graduate of Syracuse University was a woman. Sarah Loguen Fraser graduated from the SU College of Medicine in 1876. When she joined her sister in Washington D.C., Amelia had married Frederick Douglass' oldest son Lewis.
Like a good in-law, the elder Douglass bought a shingle for Sarah to hang over her D.C. medical practice door; introduced the young doctor from Syracuse to her Dominican chemist husband Charles Fraser; and wrote to her when she moved to the Dominican Republic. The couple's daughter Gregoria was born there.
Following her renowned mother, Gregoria Fraser Goins appears to be the second black - and the first Afro-Latina - alumnus(a) of SU circa 1901. With the widowed Dr. Loguen Fraser, the daughter had moved to the Salt City's Westcott Street while attending SU.
I resumed my "travels" with Douglass here in Pittsburgh as the executive-in-charge of the University of Pittsburgh's 2008 "Free at Last: Slavery in Pittsburgh in the 18th and 19th Centuries" exhibition at the Senator John Heinz History Center. Not content merely to present documented evidence that the "great" white men (mostly) of the day held black fellow Pittsburghers in bondage, I wanted to depict in dioramas black empowerment - great slave escapes.
Samuel W. Black, director of African American Programs at the History Center, suggested wax figures. We depicted freedom-seeker Frederick Douglass in wax in a borrowed sailor's uniform - replete with fire-engine red shirt - in that aforementioned escape from bondage in Maryland to freedom in Pennsylvania.
Eventually in his travels, the great self-freed champion of liberty lectured in Pittsburgh in November 1843. Astonishingly, early in the 21st century, I spoke at that same First Baptist Church of Pittsburgh where Frederick Douglass, who had collaborated with Harriet Tubman and other key abolitionists, had lectured. The church had moved to a different location, but it was the same church nonetheless. First Baptist was the rare Pittsburgh church - rare for reasons that decidedly differ - where abolitionist Frederick Douglass and I could command the pulpit. He died in 1895.

NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES A CAMPAIGN OF FEAR, PURGING AND MOCKERY WILL SECURE HIM A SECOND TERM. IT WON'T.

Texto completo: The malaise began with a debacle in Iowa brought about by a faulty app and internet trolls clogging the phone lines. Suddenly, the competence of the Democratic Party was questioned because the results of the first in the nation caucus couldn't deliver a clear winner by week's end.
President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech rattled critics too easily thrown off by his competent reading of a teleprompter and the sheer theatricality used in awarding known bigot Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom while he sat feigning surprise in the first lady's box.
Mr. Trump's uncharacteristic gestures to black America during the SOTU announced an unexpected new front in his re-election bid. "I thought I was watching BET," comedian Bill Maher said on his Friday night show.
On Wednesday, as expected, Mr. Trump survived an impeachment conviction thanks to his party's numerical advantage in the Senate, not because anyone truly believes the facts exonerated him. Despite his ritualistic chest-beating and delight at having cowed the entire Republican Senate with the exception of Utah's Mitt Romney, he knows he got caught and that everyone knows he got caught.
The only question was: Would Mr. Trump moderate his behavior after narrowly surviving an impeachment vote? The answer came at the National Prayer Breakfast the next morning when our self-pitying president explicitly rejected a gentle reminder from one of his hosts to follow Christ's example to "love his enemies."
Go to the comment sections of the stories regarding Mr. Trump's mockery of the faith of his political opponents and count how many self-professing Christians claim he has biblical justification for pursuing post-impeachment vengeance.
Mr. Trump then went on a series of televised rants, often profane and mostly filled with lies and distortions. It was a sad national embarrassment cheered on by people for whom Mr. Trump's antics are always a projection of their own resentments and alienation.
On Friday, when he began purging the government of those who dared to testify honestly against him, we all knew that Mr. Trump, who entered the White House as a broken, shameless man, was feeling more emboldened in his shamelessness and brokenness.
One poll had him at 49% approval post-impeachment, the highest of his presidency. Political pundits scrambled to appear more "even-handed," and it seemed that everyone on cable TV was having second thoughts about the ability of any Democrat to defeat the energized and angry "cult of Trump."
It was this defeatism, more than anything else, that made me sick to my stomach last week. There really are folks - and too many of them are Democrats - who believe they're entitled to a clear shot at political power and representation in the system with minimal struggle or outlay of energy. They get scared at the first sign of determined resistance.
This is America, a country that has been manifestly unfair to a good percentage of its people from Day One. The fact that America as represented by the governing class is unfair to most of its people and not just the minority is new, but the trend is familiar and sanctioned by centuries of practice and constitutional precedent.
It is our job as citizens to make sure that oligarchy doesn't win. It's always going to be a struggle. What's so hard to understand about that? I got an email from a friend last week that better articulated what I was feeling at the moment:
"One thing that bothers me is that after this difficult week, I see a lot of people on our side giving in to despair," my friend, a local lawyer, wrote. "But succumbing to despair only ensures it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"When we look at history we see all successful wars for nobler causes like our Revolution, the Civil War and WWII started horribly for those fighting on the side with the noblest moral cause. I am particularly reminded of the horrors of Valley Forge in the winter of 1777.
"The Revolution looked lost. Washington and our army had suffered a string of stinging defeats including losing Philadelphia. To make matters worse, he had to put down a rebellion in his own ranks of men who were tired of being tired, miserable and cold. He rightly described the Christmas of 1777 as his most dismal ever.
"At that point he looked more likely to be hanged as a defeated rebel than be the father of our country. Yet he, and most importantly his loyal soldiers, persevered and worked together to overcome the problems and prepared themselves to beat enemy. [They] did not, thankfully, surrender to despair.
"As Thomas Paine memorably wrote at the time to bolster the wavering Colonists' faith in their just cause (and his words apply with equal force to the war against the fascism Donald Trump embodies):
"'These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like Hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.'
"So, to paraphrase Sir Winston Churchill," my friend wrote, "we will fight them on the beaches, fight them in the streets, fight them in the hills, fight them in hell and, if hell freezes over, fight them on the ice!"
My buddy then suggested that one concrete way to take immediate action in light of Mr. Trump's firing of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman last week was to nominate him for a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award. He believes hundreds of thousands of votes for Mr. Vindman would drive the president out of his mind.
I was enormously heartened by this letter. It hit just the right notes for me and was a reminder of how precarious democracy as a form of self-government is if the people responsible for legitimizing it with their votes and investment of time and energy give in to despair.

Texto completo: The Congressional Budget Office's recent projection that soaring federal red ink will hit $31.4 trillion by 2030 is an issue deserving attention this election year. That figure will be 98% of the national economy, the largest percentage of the U.S. gross national product since just after World War II.
Presidential and congressional candidates should be asked what they will do to avoid the average $1.3 trillion deficits per year in the CBO forecast. If they say spending cuts, they should provide specifics. Tax increase proposals also should be specific and tied to reasonable expectations of what they'd raise.
Budget deficits, which peaked at $1.4 trillion in 2009 before falling to $585 billion at the end of President Barack Obama's second term, are climbing again amid a strong economy. Tax cuts - which did not, as promised, pay for themselves - and an 18% increase in spending during President Donald Trump's first three years in office are partly to blame. So is an aging population and increased spending on Social Security and Medicare.
The other fast-rising cost identified by CBO as driving future deficits is outrageous and pathetic: Interest on the federal debt, which is projected to grow more than 50% as a percentage of GDP over the same period. Those payments will cut into future spending while giving those doing the paying nothing in return. Should interest rates rise, that debt could drive them higher and harm the nation's economy and further cut into spending needed elsewhere.
Our leaders must stop crying about waste they either never identify or never find a way to eliminate. They also must stop promising to raise taxes on someone else to raisethe money for the government services we're getting. There's a reason President Bill Clinton's 1993 tax hike included the middle class: That's where the money is, especially when talking about reliable streams of revenue such as income taxes.
Amid a booming economy, it's time for citizens and elected officials to consider how much government they want, and at what price.
Can we afford our existing military commitments? Defense spending is, after all, more than $600 billion, 15% of the federal budget overall and nearly half of discretionary spending.
Those running for office this year should be pressed to tell the truth, acknowledging the costs of both their big ideas and of the government we've got. And they need to tell us what it's going to cost us, not the future generations already facing $31.4 trillion in government debt put on the national credit card.

Klobuchar, from margins to race's center

Texto completo: EXETER, N.H. — Senator Amy Klobuchar has spent much of the 2020 primary race mentioned as an add-on, one of those “also-running" candidates milling below the top tier.
Well, she sure isn't milling in obscurity any more.
“As you probably heard, we're on a bit of a surge," Klobuchar told a cheering crowd of about 550 people who packed Exeter Town Hall for her Monday afternoon rally.
The latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk University poll showed the Minnesota Democrat moving into third place, with 14 percent, ahead of former vice president Joe Biden, the once-presumptive front-runner for the nomination, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who at one time topped the polls here. On Monday morning, Klobuchar announced that her campaign has raised more than $3 million in small online donations since Friday's debate.
At her Monday events with voters, she touted her endorsements from various New Hampshire newspapers and The New York Times endorsement she shared with Warren.
Suddenly, she appeared to be grasping the elusive “momentum" the day before the primary, and members of the media crammed into her speaking events and rallies across New Hampshire, on the eve of the nation's first primary election, even as many New Hampshire voters said they remain undecided. Klobuchar tried to draw them in with her centrist appeal, pledging in Exeter to take the opposite tack of President Trump, to “unite rather than incite."
“When you think about the words that define Donald Trump's political playbook, it's divide and demoralize, where mine is unite and lead," Klobuchar told the crowd.
Her pitch persuaded Doke Collins, 57, a Portsmouth woman who emigrated from Holland in the 1990s and who liked what Klobuchar had to say about welcoming immigrants. She'll be voting for only the second time in a presidential election.
“She's very knowledgeable. She has a great background, experience," Collins said. “She's strong. She won't be shaken up."
Klobuchar's rise could spell trouble for both Warren and Biden, both of whom could be seriously wounded if beaten Tuesday by a candidate who was barely on the map just a few weeks ago.
Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and veteran campaign manager, said Klobuchar placing ahead of Warren in New Hampshire “would finish Warren's candidacy off."
If Warren is losing support among progressives to Sanders, which Trippi said clearly seems to be the case, and then loses her status as the top woman in the race, it doesn't necessarily make Klobuchar a real contender for the nomination “but it could be a real problem for Warren going forward. Where, moving forward, can you turn it around?"
In an interview with the Globe on Sunday, Klobuchar said she didn't know whose voters were switching to support her, but from what she's hearing anecdotally, she believes her debate performance Friday caught voters' attention.
“A lot of independents are getting sick and tired of Donald Trump, and those are the exact people we need to win," she said.
Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire in the 2016 general election by only about 2,700 votes, so Granite State voters “are very aware of the politics of this and what it would mean to have someone heading up a ticket that can actually bring those people in," Klobuchar said.
That's the heart of Klobuchar's message to voters here: She is less extreme than candidates such as Warren and Bernie Sanders and says she can attract a wide array of voters, including moderates, ind­e-p­endents, and even some who voted for Trump in 2016. She likes to say she “has the receipts," pointing to her record of strong wins in bright red parts of Minnesota and how she helped down-ticket Democrats win there, too.
She noted that she has won three times in the district of conservative former congresswoman Michele Bachmann and said she has won every race she's run since the fourth grade. “I have always told people that if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me."
On Monday afternoon, she addressed a meeting of the Nashua Rotary Club, where more than 100 Rotarians — many of them Republicans — filled a Nashua Country Club ballroom, and she tried to make the case that she could build bridges that Trump has destroyed.
“I truly believe that what unites us is bigger than what divides us," she said. “My campaign has always been about reaching out and not shutting people out but bringing them with me. That starts actually with a competitive agenda for this country."
Not everyone was sold. Some voters remained undecided, less than 24 hours before the polls would close.
“She was very impressive, very articulate. Very competent but not blowing me away," said Carol Farmer, 80, of Nashua, a Republican who refuses to vote to reelect Trump, finding him “dangerous."
Asked about news reports that Trump's reelection campaign plans to work to flip her home state to his column in November, Klobuchar suggested Democrats should be worried about that prospect before pointing to a poll from her home state paper that showed her doing best of all the Democratic contenders in a hypothetical matchup with Trump.
“I just think that if history here is any instruction, you look at who won these races in harder states," she said. She said she has “excelled" in tough areas such as suburban districts “while still having the highest voter turnout in the country, which means a huge urban turnout that supported me."
As for what a “victory" in New Hampshire would look like for her, Klobuchar said it would be exceeding expectations.
“We are clearly surging, no one can doubt that, since the debate," she said. “We don't know where this is going to end up, but all I know is I'm not going to be chained to my Senate desk" during impeachment proceedings as she was in the run-up to Iowa. “I'm going to be able to go everywhere."

Texto completo: Harriet Frank Jr., an Oscar-nominated screenwriter who with her husband and lifelong collaborator Irving Ravetch explored the social crosscurrents of postwar America in such films as "Hud" and "Norma Rae," has died at her home in Los Angeles.
Frank, who was the daughter of a Hollywood story editor who began her career in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's young writers program, died Jan. 28, her nephew Michael Frank told the New York Times. She was 96.
Frank and her husband were a sought-after writing combo who wrote more than a dozen film scripts, dipping into the novels of Larry McMurtry, Elmore Leonard and William Faulkner for inspiration.

Although they sometimes adapted the story as written, they just as often used it as a starting point for a far different story -- villains would be recast as heroes, minor characters reshaped as the script's protagonist, multiple characters melted carefully into one complexity.
The two met at the MGM studios and soon were writing the script for "The Long, Hot Summer," the story of a crafty drifter who stumbles into a small Mississippi town and endears himself to the town's most powerful businessman. The script was culled from three different Faulkner stories.
In "Hud," which starred Paul Newman as a hard-drinking womanizer, Frank and Ravetch bent and twisted McMurtry's "Horseman, Pass By" to fit their script, which was nominated for an Academy Award for screenwriting.
In "Norma Rae," the 1979 Academy Award-winning film for which Sally Field won best actress as a fiery union organizer, the two turned to the real-life story of Crystal Lee Sutton, a much-harassed union organizer at a textile plant in the Deep South. It too was nominated for an Oscar for screenwriting.
Born Harriet Goldstein on March 2, 1923, she and her two siblings were raised in Portland, Ore., where her father ran a shoe store and her mother hosted a radio show.
Her mother eventually took a job in Hollywood as a story editor, changed the family's last name to Frank and adopted her daughter's first name as her own -- minting herself Harriet Frank Sr.
In a 2003 interview with Michigan Quarterly Review, Frank and Ravetch said their collaborative process was built on "talking through" every screen and every line in a script.
Frank said the two would draft a single-page outline listing 35 to 45 scenes that would form the skeleton of the script.
"Once we're ready to begin, we start 'talking' the screenplay to each other. Out loud. It's a line-for-line conversation," Frank said.
"In truth, we get so involved that we can't even tell who starts a line or who finishes it. It's a very animated, running conversation where we act out the lines along with running commentary."
Martin Ritt, the award-wining director who had been blacklisted by Hollywood for his purported communist sympathies, worked with the couple eight times.
"I don't know of any better screenwriters in America," said Ritt, who died in 1990.
Other film scripts by Frank and Ravetch included "The Sound and the Fury," "The Reivers," "Hombre," "Conrack" and "Stanley & Iris."
Ravetch died in 2010.

BACK STORY; Racism and the royal move; Meghan Markle's experience sounds all too familiar to some observers

Texto completo: It has been a month since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced that they would "step back" as senior members of the British royal family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex can no longer use their "royal highness" titles and will no longer receive public funds for their royal duties. The couple -- he is 35, she 38 -- and their 9-month-old son, Archie, have been relaxing on the west coast of British Columbia. They were recently spotted in Miami, where they attended a private function for JPMorgan and dined with Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez. There are reports that the couple are looking for a house in Los Angeles.
The British have a lot on their minds -- it was only last month that the nation formally exited the European Union, ending a tumultuous 47-year affair with the Continent -- but it is clear, at least from recent conversations with Londoners, that the royal couple's departure is still fresh on people's consciousness. For a nation that has long grappled with its identity, and with its former status as an empire, the question of race looms large.
In 2018, when Markle, a Los Angeles-born divorced former actress whose mother is African American, married Harry, the sixth in line to the British throne, some observers heralded it as a "post-racial" moment. An African American minister, the Most Rev. Michael Curry, delivered a stirring sermon. The Kingdom Choir, a British gospel group, performed "Stand by Me," a tune made famous by the African American singer-songwriter Ben E. King.

Inevitably, their marriage appears to have revealed complex dimensions of race, class, power and privilege, rather than resolving them.
Slavery helped build modern Britain; at its peak, the British Empire covered a fourth of the world's land mass. Over the last 75 years, since the end of World War II, Britain has struggled to change from empire to commonwealth, and from colossus to mere country; its debates over how much it should integrate with the rest of Europe have been emblematic of that struggle.
In an opinion essay last month in the New York Times, Afua Hirsch, a black British journalist who also teaches journalism at USC, said the reasons for Markle's departure from the royal system were of no surprise to black Britons, noting racist headlines in the Daily Mail, a tabloid, about Markle being "(almost) straight outta Compton" and having "exotic" DNA. Even before the couple married, they complained of vicious treatment by the press; in an extraordinary 2016 statement, the royal family condemned "the racial undertones" of commentary directed at the couple.
"No matter how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy, charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will still follow you," Hirsch wrote.
In an interview, Hirsch said that in the United States, "people acknowledge that race is a thing," whereas in Britain, "all of our energy is expended trying to prove it exists."
Hirsch said that some Britons maintain a sense of moral superiority because Britain was not home to the chattel slavery that existed in societies from Brazil to Cuba to the United States. And yet, it was not until 1807 that the British Empire abolished the slave trade, and British merchants and landowners operated plantations across the Caribbean.
Hirsch's narrative touched off debate. Writing in the conservative newspaper the Telegraph, columnist Sherelle Jacobs argued that Hirsch "conveniently overlooks the overwhelmingly fawning coverage that the duke and duchess enjoyed, from their engagement to their wedding day," and the harm the couple might have inflicted to their own reputations. "Emotional baggage from our country's legacy of aristocratic privilege has endowed Middle England with the kind of stridently meritocratic values that are a complete anathema to judging people by their color," Jacobs argued.
In recent interviews, a number of black Londoners said the role of race could not be denied.
"In British society, people want to say racism doesn't exist," said Esther Adjepong, a 35-year-old musician who lives in Brixton, a South London neighborhood with a historically large Afro-Caribbean community. She said that addressing race is like "banging your head against a brick wall," adding: "You can be a black person in this country screaming out 'I'm discriminated against,' and you'll just be told, 'No, you're not. What are you talking about?' "
The reality Markle has endured is familiar to Adjepong. "We recognize that as being racially motivated because its how we are treated and have to navigate society," she said.
Amy Francis, 73, a retiree who lives in the borough of Wandsworth in southwest London, said the couple's departure should serve as a rebuke to British society. "May they shame the public and live together till death do they part," she said. "Leaving was right. They need freedom. I'm glad they're free."
She added: People don't "love Meghan, because she's black."
Larelle Benjamin, 24, a paralegal who lives in Croydon, in South London, said that too much emphasis had been placed on the duchess. "It's good that Harry stepped out of tradition. but Meghan is getting the backlash. People are blaming her for leaving, but it's a joint decision."
She added: "More change in the royal family is good. They're getting more black in there."
Others said they were tired of the subject. Anton Davis, a 29-year-old barber in Brixton, said he could not care less about the monarchy. "They have nothing to do with real people," he said.
While people of African ancestry have lived in Britain for centuries -- and an 18th century queen, Charlotte, might have had African ancestors -- most modern black Britons are descended from immigrants who made their way to the British isles in the last century, particularly after 1948, when Parliament opened the door to people from colonies in the West Indies and Africa to settle in Britain.
Despite that increasing diversity, Markle was never going to fit into the royal family because it "globally signifies whiteness," according to Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University.
In Britain, the doctrine of scientific racism was refined and deployed to support the colonization of much of Africa, the Caribbean and Asia. The royal family no longer has much political power today and serves a largely symbolic function, but, Andrews said, it still represents an imperialist past that tortured, starved, killed and raped to dominate other countries.
"This backlash was always going to happen because blackness doesn't fit in this mold," he said. "It was inevitable. Particularly now that Brexit is done."
The nearly four-year process of leaving the European Union triggered a "massive resurgence of English white nationalism," he said. The number of reported hate crimes in England and Wales has more than doubled since 2013, according to a government report. And 76% are said to be racially motivated.
Writing in the liberal newspaper the Guardian last month, Amna Saleem, a Pakistan-Scottish writer and comedian based in Glasgow, lamented the treatment of Markle. "Critics have argued that Markle knew what she was signing up for, and should have been more prepared," Saleem wrote. "But the onus should not be on people of color to swallow racism.
"If Markle, a former successful actor who was largely palatable to an overwhelmingly white media, can be harassed into stepping away from the crown, then how might the public react to someone with less privilege than her?"
That is probably not the mainstream view in Britain. At President's Trump's State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol last week, one guest was Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party.
This reporter asked whether there was any racial element in Markle's departure, and Farage scoffed. "Any suggestion that there was even an inch of racism in what's happened is simply wrong and deeply insulting to a country that is very relaxed about these things," Farage said, adding that the couple have "chosen exile."
He added: "And frankly, good."

Texto completo: Bill Veeck, who in his lifetime owned the Cleveland Indians, the St. Louis Browns and the Chicago White Sox, once said, "Roger Kahn is doomed to go through life having everything he writes compared with 'The Boys of Summer.' "
Veeck was dead center. Whenever the name Roger Kahn appeared, it was invariably followed by, "the author of 'The Boys of Summer.' " Regarded as the finest baseball book ever written, Kahn's signature work sold more than 3 million copies.
Forever linked to his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers, Kahn died Thursday in New York, his literary agent Robert Wilson said. He was 92.

Acclaimed by many as the best baseball writing in the country, his prolific output was widely diverse. He wrote more than 20 books, two of them novels, the others dealing with such topics as politics, Jews in America, racial injustice, student unrest and boxing.
He had also been sports editor of Newsweek, editor at large of the Saturday Evening Post, a columnist for Esquire magazine, a writing professor at three colleges, and a friend and admirer of poet Robert Frost.
Even so, he often wandered back to baseball, his first love. Besides his 1972 epic, "The Boys of Summer," in which he recalled his childhood as a fan of the Dodgers, the team he covered as a sportswriter in the early 1950s, then examined the same players' mostly unhappy lives after baseball, he wrote eight other books about baseball and baseball players and their lives.
He lifted the title of his major work from a poem by Dylan Thomas, who described "the boys of summer in all their ruin." In an era when all but the very best ballplayers made ordinary money, most returned to normal working lives after retiring from baseball.
One season, Kahn bought and operated a minor league team, the Utica Blue Sox in upstate New York, so that he would be properly prepared to write "Good Enough to Dream," a book about baseball in the lowest of the minor leagues, another hit among baseball cognoscenti.
With all the accolades, though, came occasional controversy, conflict and utter sadness.
His 1989 book on the disgraced player-manager Pete Rose, for instance, in which he professed belief in Rose's claims that although he'd gambled on other sports he'd never bet on baseball games, was widely panned as ridiculously naive, if not downright deceitful.
Wrote one critic of "Pete Rose: My Story," "Of all the devastation Rose has wrought on the game he purports so grandly to love, the soul of Roger Kahn as ravaged in this book is one of the saddest ruins to behold."
Kahn was flayed anew when Rose, years later, finally admitted that he had bet not only on baseball but on his own teams' games.
"[Rose] was always surrounded by a bodyguard of liars," Kahn told Bill Dwyre of The Times in 2007, "and so the question had to be put to him, before we went forward with the book. I must have ... asked him five times, 'Did you bet on baseball?' And the answer was always the same. He'd look me in the eye and say, 'I've got too much respect for the game.'
"I regret I ever got involved in the book."
Kahn also was on Ted Koppel's "Nightline" ABC news program the night in 1987 when longtime Dodgers executive Al Campanis, on the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier, told a national TV audience that blacks "may not have some of the necessities to be, let's say, a field manager or, perhaps, a general manager."
"My first sense was shock," said Kahn, who had been close to Robinson and was a friend of Campanis. "My next thought was, 'How can I bail him out?' ... Then I got to thinking that I wouldn't want to hear this kind of talk at a party, much less on a TV show in front of millions of people, so I can't bail him out of his position at all."
Campanis ignored Koppel's efforts to let him recant and soon afterward was no longer a Dodgers executive.
Kahn endured a bitter divorce from his second wife and a six-year legal battle over money and child custody; but worst of all was the suicide of his younger son, also named Roger.
Kahn was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 31, 1927. His father, Gordon, a teacher at Brooklyn's Thomas Jefferson High School, was a die-hard Dodgers fan who began taking Roger to games as an infant. His mother, Olga, also a teacher at Jefferson High, much preferred literature, leading family readings of classical authors.
In 1948, the year after Robinson broke the color barrier, Kahn worked for the New York Herald Tribune as a copy boy. He met the paper's legendary sports editor, Stanley Woodward, and occasionally wrote stories for the section.
By 1952, Kahn was covering his beloved Dodgers for the paper, and forging a bond with Robinson. He saw firsthand the racism Robinson had to battle, although his paper wouldn't let him write about it, and supplied much of the content for Our Sports, Robinson's short-lived magazine aimed at an African American readers.
Said Kahn in a New York Times interview in 1996, "Robinson has been called a pioneer, prophet, visionary and SOB. He could be any or all. Mostly, I remember him as a man who would risk anything, even his life, for what he believed in."
Kahn covered the Dodgers for several seasons, becoming the best-paid beat writer in New York at $10,000 a year. Then, after calling Ebbets Field a "sarcophagus" in a story, he was reassigned to the New York Giants, with whom Willie Mays was fast becoming "the most exciting player" Kahn had ever seen.
By 1956, Kahn had moved on to Newsweek.
"All my life, I've tried to write literature," he wrote on his website. "I am aware that, like Stan Musial and Ted Williams at the bat, most of the time I've failed. But the critical word is 'try.' That effort has been the wonder of my life."
Kahn is survived by his third wife, Katharine Johnson, son Gordon, daughter Alissa Avril and five grandchildren.

They Were Homeless, Seeking Steady Work. They Found It, Serving Eviction Notices.

Texto completo: As rents skyrocket, more homeless people are trying to find work, even if it means becoming part of the process that forces people out of their homes.
SAN FRANCISCO -- After two months of missed rent, it was the knock on the door that the family had been dreading. Eviction brought the prospect of homelessness after months of living on the brink.
But little did they know that the man handing over the eviction documents, John Hebbring, was homeless himself.
"Believe me, we see the irony," said Mr. Hebbring, whose job it is to deliver eviction notices with his girlfriend, Kim Hansen. Together they live in a 50-year-old trailer infested by rats.
The couple's predicament offers a measure of how far-reaching the homelessness crisis has become in California. The evicted are doing the evicting.
It not their job to change locks or physically remove people from their homes -- that is the sheriff's domain -- but several times a week Mr. Hebbring and Ms. Hansen leave the crowded, trash-filled, homeless encampment in Oakland where they live and travel to cities around the Bay Area: Newark, Millbrae, Fremont, Daly City, East Palo Alto and Hayward among them.
They go mainly by public transport, with a stack of documents. In some cases, they can post the notices on doors. In others, they are required to put them directly into the recipients' hands.
"I'm sympathetic to their situation because I know what mine is," Ms. Hansen said, bundled up on a rainy and cold winter night outside their trailer. "Look at us. I'm out here sick and homeless."
Ms. Hansen says that despite the couple's misgivings about delivering eviction notices, their options are limited.
"No one wants to be the one delivering bad news but pretty much right now it's our only source of income," she said.
They have earned around $ 1,600 since they started the work in September, only enough to pay for food and, if they have money left, gas for their sputtering generator.
Homelessness in California has reached record levels; the governor has all but declared an emergency over the issue and is requisitioning shuttered hospitals and fairgrounds to shelter the more than 150,000 homeless people, two-thirds of whom are living on the streets.
Ms. Hansen's and Mr. Hebbring's trailer is in a homeless encampment profiled by The New York Times in December that the authorities are in the process of dismantling, one of more than 100 camps across Oakland.
Like many of their neighbors, the couple scratch around for ways to make money -- working and being homeless is a growing reality across the nation. He sometimes fixes cars. She pokes around for odd jobs. Focus groups, medical trials. "We went on a treadmill for 15 minutes and wore a watch on our wrist. Got $ 165 per person," Ms. Hansen said, detailing one of the more lucrative ones. She came across the eviction process server gig on Craigslist.
Evictions brought on by rising rents have helped reshape the demographics of Northern California. The wealthy have concentrated in the bull's-eye of the Bay Area -- in and around San Francisco -- and those who cannot afford the rent have shifted to the outer rings, to towns further and further away.
There is no reliable eviction data in California because most records are sealed, according to Carolyn Gold, director of litigation and policy at the Eviction Defense Collaborative, a nonprofit organization. She estimates that there are around 3,000 evictions a year in San Francisco alone based on the number of cases in court calendars.
But even that estimate does not fully capture the dynamics of the affordability crisis, says Leah Simon-Weisberg, one of the leading tenant attorneys in the Bay Area.
"At some point people are involuntarily pushed out from where they are living, whether it is through the legal process or not," she said.
Annual surveys carried out by cities try to quantify how people become homeless. The leading causes in San Francisco in 2019 were losing a job (26 percent), alcohol or drug use (18 percent), eviction (13 percent), arguments among family or friends (12 percent), mental health problems (8 percent), and divorce or breakup (5 percent), according to city data.
But for Mr. Hebbring and Ms. Hansen -- and many other people without homes across the country -- those categories tend to blend together.
For Ms. Hansen it was the combination of a fractured family, a mother who got hooked on methamphetamines and natural disasters: Twice Ms. Hansen had her home burn in wildfires.
For Mr. Hebbring it was repeated encounters with the criminal justice system -- both he and his father went to prison for selling drugs at separate times -- and the sudden death of his wife eight years ago that forced his eviction from their home.
I met with Mr. Hebbring and Ms. Hansen a dozen times over the past four months and followed them on their eviction document deliveries. In a soaking rain we walked to a FedEx shop in Oakland where the store manager downloaded and printed the documents for $ 1.37.
Since they accepted their first freelance gig for the legal services company in September, Mr. Hebbring and Ms. Hansen have delivered dozens of documents. Ms. Hansen maps the locations on her phone before they head out.
"What a way to get to know my way around," she joked.
Roy Cordeiro, the owner of a process serving company in the Bay Area, says the number of eviction notices he serves has increased from a couple each week to, more recently, a couple every day.
Despite the soaring stock market and the lowest unemployment rates in decades, hundreds of thousands of Americans are falling with no one to catch them.
"They say the economy is doing good but people can't pay the rent," Mr. Cordeiro said.
Mr. Cordeiro says several thousand people are registered as process servers in the Bay Area and hundreds more do it without a license.
"There are a lot of Mickey Mouse operators out there," he said.
Mr. Cordeiro charges $ 175 per delivery. By contrast, the legal document company that hires Mr. Hebbring and Ms. Hansen pays them $ 30 if they post a document and $ 50 if they hand it directly to the person served.
On a chilly evening we went to an apartment in the Mission District of San Francisco, walking past restaurants teeming with the young and attractive. Nearby were boutiques on Valencia Street selling specialty chocolates, designer eyewear and gleaming Japanese kitchen knives.
At a four-story apartment on a tree-lined street, Mr. Hebbring could not find the tenant he was looking for so he posted the notice on the superintendent's door.
For their next set of documents, Ms. Hansen called a friend who sleeps in his car to ask for a lift. It was for a delivery at Hunters Point, a lower-income neighborhood on the southern edge of the city.
At a few minutes past 9 p.m., Mr. Hebbring, wearing a faded N.F.L. jersey and a jacket, knocked at the apartment listed on the documents.
He carried a small digital camera in case no one answered and he needed proof that he had taped the papers onto the door.
A woman answered, looking confused.
Mr. Hebbring read out the name listed on the documents.
"I'm her mother," the woman replied.
The apartment, which was subject to rent control, went for $ 135 a month, a tiny sum by San Francisco standards, where the median rent is above $ 4,000. The tenant was ordered to pay two months' rent, $ 270, or leave within three days.
The woman explained that her daughter had lost her job as a driver, was strapped for cash and was planning to move out. Her father was out of the picture.
"She's been going through a lot," the woman told Mr. Hebbring. "We are trying to keep her from being homeless."
Mr. Hebbring handed over the documents and walked back to the car, where he rejoined Ms. Hansen. He shook his head at the idea that someone would be unable to pay $ 270.
Ms. Hansen says she wonders how many people they serve papers to end up homeless. Maybe she will see them on the streets someday or in the vacant lot where they sleep in Oakland.
"I almost want to tell them, 'If you get kicked out, I've got a spot right here next to me."'

Texto completo: One reader says the firings confirm the need for whistle-blowers to remain anonymous. Another explains why the president can target New Yorkers with impunity.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Hits Back, Firing Witnesses After Acquittal" (front page, Feb. 8):
Given the treatment of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Ambassador Gordon Sondland and others, no one should ever again question the need for whistle-blowers to maintain anonymity, if they wish. Thank you, Mr. President, for making the case so clearly and so powerfully.
And, thank you to these two gentlemen and all those who had the courage, including Senator Mitt Romney, to do what they believed was right. I suspect history will applaud your efforts.

To the Editor:
Re "New York Law on Immigrants Spurs Reprisal" (front page, Feb. 7):
President Trump's targeting of New York State for retribution for a new law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses points up yet another drawback to the Electoral College system.
It makes no difference to Mr. Trump if this action -- barring New Yorkers from Trusted Traveler programs -- costs him votes in New York, which is in the Democrats' pocket for November.

Texto completo: President Trump's former campaign adviser was convicted of lying to Congress and trying to block a witness in order to impede an investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign.
Federal prosecutors asked a judge on Monday to sentence Roger J. Stone Jr., President Trump's longtime friend and former campaign adviser, to up to nine years in prison for lying to Congress and tampering with a witness to prevent investigators from discovering how the 2016 Trump campaign tried to benefit from stolen Democratic documents.
Mr. Stone, 67, deserved seven to nine years behind bars because he threatened the witness with bodily harm, interfered with a congressional investigation and then, after he was charged in a federal indictment, repeatedly flouted the orders of the judge overseeing his case, the prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum.
In a multiyear scheme, the prosecutors said, Mr. Stone lied under oath, forged documents and engaged in "a relentless and elaborate campaign to silence" the witness because he could have exposed his lies to the House Intelligence Committee. When flattery failed, they said, he harassed the witness and even threatened his life and that of his dog. Even if the witness believed Mr. Stone would personally never injure him, he feared that he could inspire others to do so, they said.
"Stone's actions were not a one-off mistake in judgment. Nor were his false statements made in the heat of the moment. They were nowhere close to that," the prosecutors argued. "Stone's conduct over the past two years shows the low regard in which he holds the House Intelligence Committee's investigation and this very criminal case."
In their own memorandum, Mr. Stone's lawyers argued that the prosecutors had misconstrued harmless messages from Mr. Stone to the witness, a New York radio host named Randy Credico, as genuine threats. They argued that Mr. Stone should be sentenced to less than 15 months in prison for the seven felonies he was found guilty of in November.
The evidence in Mr. Stone's jury trial showed that in the months before the election, he strove to obtain emails that Russia had stolen from Democratic Party computers and funneled to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks then released the emails at strategic moments to damage Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's Democratic opponent.
Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Stone used every chance he had to brief the Trump campaign about whatever he picked up about WikiLeaks' plans. But in September 2017, he told the House Intelligence Committee that he never described to anyone involved in the Trump campaign his conversations with an intermediary to WikiLeaks. To cover up his lies, he urged Mr. Credico to take the Fifth Amendment rather than testify before the committee.
"Stone's criminal conduct was not an act of desperation. He is a man of substantial means, and he has enjoyed a modicum of fame from his years of being a political adviser and confidant to powerful politicians," the prosecutors wrote. "His conduct was undertaken purposefully, by someone who knew exactly what he was doing."
But the defense lawyers argued that Mr. Stone not only never intended to threaten Mr. Credico, but created no real obstacle for federal investigators. While Mr. Credico refused to testify before Congress, he cooperated fully with the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, they argued. And he in fact had no incriminating information about the Trump campaign or WikiLeaks, they said.
Mr. Credico himself submitted a letter asking the judge not to send Mr. Stone to prison, saying incarceration damaged both prisoners and their families. While he stood by his testimony during the trial, he wrote, "I never in any way felt that Stone himself posed a direct physical threat to me or my dog."
On the eve of the jury's verdict in his trial in November, Mr. Stone appeared to appeal to the president for a pardon, using as his proxy Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who runs the website Infowars. Although Mr. Trump has said nothing about pardoning Mr. Stone, he quickly criticized the verdict, suggesting that prosecutors and F.B.I. officials had themselves lied during the Russia investigation.
Prosecutors characterized Mr. Stone's apparent appeal for a pardon as part of a pattern of violations of gag orders imposed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington, who oversaw his case. They argued that Mr. Stone's behavior before and after he was criminally charged underscored the need for a prison term to teach him respect for the law.
The prosecutors also stressed that Mr. Stone had threatened the judge herself in February 2019, when he posted a photo of her with an image of what appeared to be the cross hairs of a gun next to her head on social media. During a hearing on the matter, the prosecutors said, Mr. Stone "openly lied to this court about matters directly affecting the integrity of these proceedings."
The prosecutors' request that Mr. Stone be imprisoned contrasted sharply with their recent plea for leniency in the case of Rick Gates, Mr. Trump's former deputy campaign chairman who also helped manage his inauguration. In recognition of his cooperation with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, prosecutors asked that Mr. Gates be sentenced to probation for his part in a criminal financial conspiracy and for lying to federal prosecutors.
Judge Jackson, who also oversaw that case, sentenced Mr. Gates in December to 45 days in jail.

Texto completo: They gave the hounds and the herders the once over at the Westminster Dog Show on Sunday. The bassets and the beagles, the collies and the corgis. Monday is terrier day, but also showtime for the toy and nonworking groups. The Havanese and the Maltese, the Finnish Spitz and the French Bulldogs.
Each one will be groomed and pampered, allowed a few snacks and even a nap or two, and then poked and prodded and allowed to preen. By Tuesday night, the judges will have culled a field of hundreds to seven for the finale at Madison Square Garden. Only one will be left then, for best in show. For now, take a moment to celebrate them all.
A xoloitzcuintli, one of the newest breeds at Westminster, staked out an upper-deck seat at Madison Square Garden.
Terriers on parade.
Sutton, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, in for a mist and a brush.
The Standard Poodles were not, well, standard.
Best in Nap.
"So I was thinking, maybe next year we bring the big crate?" Westminster's guide to breeds makes the Borzoi sound like a great catch, with "a gentle temperament and striking good looks."
A poodle, left, heads toward the competition floor.
"You said this wouldn't take long. And yet here I wait."

What's better than a Bichon Frise? Bichons Frises.
It is perfectly acceptable to tease the Pomeranians.
It is important to dress for the occasion, regardless of the time of day.
With no firehouses or Disney villains in sight, a group of Dalmatians waits at Pier 94.
A Maltese (we promise there is a dog under there) is groomed ahead of judging.
Good dogs!

Texto completo: It's the latest push by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte against media outlets he views as critical of his government.
MANILA -- The Philippine government moved Monday to end the franchise of the country's leading broadcast network, the latest push by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte against media outlets that have been critical of his leadership.
The Philippine solicitor general, Jose Calida, lodged a complaint with the country's highest court, accusing ABS-CBN Corp. and its subsidiary, ABS-CBN Convergence, of violating the operating franchise it was granted by Congress, which is set to expire in March.
The move comes despite the fact that the House of Representatives has yet to start deliberating several bills supporting the renewal of the franchise. It was not clear how Mr. Calida's petition would affect that legislation.
"We want to put an end to what we discovered to be highly abusive practice of ABS-CBN benefiting a greedy few at the expense of millions of its loyal subscribers," Mr. Calida said in a statement announcing the move. "These practices have gone unnoticed or were disregarded for years."
But critics of Mr. Duterte say he is on the warpath against media entities that have questioned his drug war, which has drawn international condemnation. ABS-CBN, along with the Filipino online news site Rappler, have been at the forefront of critical reporting about the antidrug campaign, which has left nearly 6,000 people dead since Mr. Duterte took office in 2016.
Mr. Calida said the government will prove that ABS-CBN has been broadcasting for a fee, "which is beyond the scope of its legislative franchise." He also accused the company of hiding behind what he said was an "elaborately crafted corporate veil" by allowing foreign investors to take part in its ownership.
He stressed that ABS-CBN "abused the privilege granted by the state" when it introduced a pay-per-view channel without approval by the government's telecommunications commission.
As he has with ABS-CBN, Mr. Duterte has personally gone after Rappler, arguing that it was partly owned by foreign investors.
The attempt to shut down Rappler, however, appears to have fizzled after the news site's foreign investors transferred their shares to their Filipino partners.
The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines assailed the move against the network.
"This proves without a doubt that this government is hell bent on using all its powers to shut down the broadcasting network," the union said. "We must not allow the vindictiveness of one man, no matter how powerful, to run roughshod over the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of the press and of expression, and the people's right to know."
Mr. Duterte has had particularly tense relations with the media. He and his aides have attacked The New York Times and The Washington Post, and several court cases are pending against Rappler's chief executive, Maria Ressa.
While the Philippine Constitution specifically calls for the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, Mr. Duterte has de facto control over the Senate and the House of Representatives through his allies.
Richard Javad Heydarian, a political scientist and author of "The Rise of Duterte: a Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy," said that while the government move was expected, time is on ABS-CBN's side because Mr. Duterte is already in the second half of his six-year term.
If the government does succeed in revoking the network's franchise, ABS-CBN could still most likely operate in some "legal gray zone," perhaps over the internet, so this would not likely be a death knell for the company, Mr. Heydarian said.
"I don't see any editorial compromise on the part of the ABS-CBN, which is very reassuring in itself," Mr. Heydarian said.
He said that Mr. Duterte appears to have taken from the playbook of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has also been accused of curtailing freedom of the press.
"There are just elements of Putinism here," Mr. Heydarian said. "We can see some Putin-like crackdown on the independent media, which was part of the Russian strongman's strategy of consolidating power."

Shopping List Has Ingredients for a New Arms Race

Texto completo: The president's spending proposal requests money for a new arms race with Russia and China, and restores nuclear weapons as central to military policy.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has begun to put a price tag on its growing arms race with Russia and China, and the early numbers indicate that restoring nuclear weapons to a central role in American military strategy will cost tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.
In the 2021 budget released on Monday, the administration revealed for the first time that it intended to create a new submarine-launched nuclear warhead, named the W93. Its development is part of a proposed 19 percent increase this year, to $ 19.8 billion, for the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department agency that maintains the nuclear stockpile and develops new nuclear warheads. More tellingly, that is a jump of more than 50 percent since 2017, President Trump's first year in office.
There is $ 15.5 billion scheduled for development and deployment of new space assets -- part of the new Space Force created by Mr. Trump -- that are central to detecting incoming launches and for the command and control of American offensive weapons.
Buried in the budget is a significant new effort to develop intermediate-range missiles -- largely conventional weapons -- that were prohibited by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty with Moscow that Mr. Trump withdrew from last year.
The budget also proposes $ 3.2 billion for hypersonic weapons, a 23 percent increase in research and development meant to compete with a growing number of similar Russian weapons. The missiles are particularly hard to defend against because they follow an unpredictable path to a target, at tremendous speed. But there were few specifics about whether the American versions would be fielded around the time that Russia's weapons roll out, now scheduled for later in this decade, or whether they would follow by a number of years.
The increases reflect more than budget priorities. They reveal a significantly different philosophy, rooted in Mr. Trump's own belief that the United States should maintain the world's most powerful nuclear force -- and perhaps enlarge it.
When President Barack Obama's administration signed the New START agreement with Russia nearly a decade ago, Mr. Obama declared that it was United States policy "to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy and focus on reducing the nuclear dangers of the 21st century." At the same time, he pledged to maintain a "safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent."
As Mr. Obama struggled to reconcile those two goals, he did not authorize new weapons. Instead, he renovated the weapons laboratories -- part of the political deal that resulted in passage of the New START treaty -- and deferred decisions about new bombers, ground-based missiles and nuclear-equipped submarines.
"This started under President Obama, but they consciously made no choices because the bill wasn't due yet," said Stephen Young, the Washington representative of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Now the Trump administration has put new projects on the table."
The Trump budget also proposes putting significant funds into reinvigorating old systems.
For years, strategists have debated whether the United States could abandon its ground-based nuclear missiles, spread out in silos across the West. They are considered highly vulnerable and so old -- many of them date to the 1970s -- that they are a hazard.
But Mr. Trump has produced a base budget of $ 1.5 billion in 2021 to prepare for deploying a new generation of missiles in the late 2020s. That is a nearly threefold increase from last year.
In fact, the administration has put so many new projects in front of the Energy Department and the Pentagon that it seems unlikely many of them will get done, at least on the schedule Mr. Trump envisioned in his budget plan. The W93 weapon would not go into production until 2034, or nearly a decade after Mr. Trump would leave office if elected to a second term. Another new nuclear warhead, called the 87-1, a redesign of a 40-year-old thermonuclear weapon made for ground-based missiles, would not begin production until 2030.
"The bottom line is that N.N.S.A. has more work on its plate than it can perform," Mr. Young said of the National Nuclear Security Administration. "They are attempting to rebuild the entire nuclear stockpile, while building new components. And their history is that they do not perform big projects on time and on budget."
It is possible that Mr. Trump's plan could be upended by the next president, or the president after that. But for now, the message being sent abroad is that the United States is back in the nuclear weapons business, either because it wants to bolster its arsenal or because Mr. Trump wants a stronger hand in negotiations.
At the same time, American allies are going in the other direction. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a speech on Friday that his country's arsenal had dropped below 300 weapons, and that he would seek other cuts.
"These decisions are in line with our rejecting any type of arms race and our keeping the format for our nuclear deterrent at a level of strict sufficiency," he said. He also called for "an autonomous and competitive industrial defense base," so that France is less dependent on American technology.
The key decision over the next year will not be what weapons to manufacture, but whether the restraints on creating a new, larger arsenal will expire a year from now.
That is when the New START treaty is scheduled to expire, unless Mr. Trump and Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, decide on a five-year extension, a move that would not require a Senate vote. So far, Mr. Trump has said he would take that step only if China -- which did not sign the accord -- joins it, along with other nuclear powers.
China has expressed no interest in doing so, and notes that its arsenal is one-fifth the size of Washington's and Moscow's, each of which is limited to 1,550 deployed weapons under the treaty. The administration has not explained whether it envisioned allowing China to significantly expand its arsenal to match the Russian and American levels, which seems unlikely, or to diminish the arsenals of the two largest superpowers, which is also hard to imagine.
"Time is critical," a former secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and a former Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed column on Monday. "Doing nothing while waiting for a 'better' agreement is a recipe for disaster: We could lose New START and fail to replace it. The treaty's agreed limits on nuclear arsenals are too important to be put at risk in a game of nuclear chicken."
But many of Mr. Trump's advisers appear to disagree. They believe that the threat of a nuclear arms race will force Russia and China into a new negotiation, one that will result in a broader treaty.

Texto completo: The legislation, to be introduced Tuesday, has little chance of becoming a law, but the effort shows the increased influence of environmental groups in taking on recycling issues.
Recycle that plastic bottle. Drink from a reusable water bottle. Stop eating from foam takeout containers.
Solutions to the plastic waste problem are often described in terms of what consumers can do to help. But federal legislation, set to be introduced by two Democrats in Congress on Tuesday, would shift responsibility to the industries producing the plastic encircling the globe.
The bill, being introduced by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico and Representative Alan Lowenthal of California, is one of the most aggressive, sweeping attempts to hold the plastics industry, beverage makers and other companies financially responsible for dealing with the waste they create.
The so-called Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act is a long shot, with no Republican co-sponsors and several provisions that seem sure to be nonstarters in an election year. But the legislative effort at the federal level, even if a politically unrealistic one, shows the growing sway of environmental groups that have pushed to stem the flow of plastic waste into the ocean.
The legislation includes measures that the sponsors argue will increase the nation's meager recycling rates, such as a national "bottle bill" that would incentivize people to return their empty soda and water bottles by providing a 10 cent refund for each bottle. It would also require companies that produce and sell food service and plastic packaging to pay for the waste collection, a burden that now falls primarily on taxpayers.
"The plastics pollution crisis has reached a tipping point and the American people are fed up," Mr. Udall said in a conference call with reporters on Monday.
The bill calls for a pause on creating new plastic producing plants, which have been a boon for the oil and gas industry and a job generator in states like Texas, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.
As the supply of oil and gas swells but global demand shows signs of leveling off, plastic production is one of the fossil fuel industry's most promising areas of growth. That dynamic is causing concern about increased greenhouse emissions and poor air quality caused by the new petrochemical plants, but it also means the oil and gas industry is poised to fight vigorously to defend its expansion.
There are some provisions in the bill that could find broader support, like mandating standardized labels on recycling and composting bins to help people more effectively sort their used containers.
Most of the legislative efforts to battle plastic waste have played out at the state and local levels, where officials have voted to ban products such as plastic bags and polystyrene foam food containers. But even as these measures have taken hold in some places, beverage companies and plastics lobbyists have successfully beaten back other initiatives like bottle bills in large part because of the costs it would impose on the industry.
For decades, the plastics industry has encouraged consumers to recycle their empty containers by sponsoring marketing campaigns and school competitions. But in reality, the vast majority of used plastic has been ending up landfills, incinerators or shipped to other nations, where its fate is far from clear. An increasing number of municipalities have stopped accepting most plastics to be recycled because the cost of collection and sorting the material is not worth it.
"The public has been sold a bill of goods," Mr. Lowenthal said on Monday. "Very little of what is called recyclable is actually recyclable."

Texto completo: Court reporting is a cornerstone of Times journalism. Three experienced hands explain how they approach the work.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
By 6 a.m., the line to enter the courtroom where the film producer Harvey Weinstein stands trial for sexual assault usually stretches down the block.
Jan Ransom, the Metro reporter who is covering the case in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan for The New York Times, arrives early to get a good seat.
The trial starts at about 9:30 a.m., and Ms. Ransom listens closely all day, every day. She watches the movie producer's facial expressions, notes the testimony of the witnesses and records the reaction of the jury.
She said she hopes readers "feel like they were there with me."
As she captures those details, she's also staying mindful of the larger issues that transcend this case. The allegations against Mr. Weinstein helped to spur the #MeToo movement; many of the questions raised during this global reckoning with sexual harassment and assault are being addressed in the trial.
The Times has reporters who cover the state courts, federal courts and the United States Supreme Court. In addition to reporting on trials, these journalists monitor court dockets for new cases and watch for verdicts, motions or rulings in important proceedings. The work involves foresight, sacrificed lunches, long nights, a working knowledge of legal procedures and an ability to read rapidly.
During the Weinstein trial, Ms. Ransom usually updates her article online multiple times daily. In the morning, she often posts a preview of what is expected to happen that day. She updates it during lunch. From The Times headquarters in New York, Jim McKinley, an assistant editor, will typically read it, then a second editor reads it and publishes it. Sometimes, a Metro reporter like Alan Feuer will take notes from Ms. Ransom and help craft the article.
When the court reconvenes after lunch, Ms. Ransom updates the article again. The final version, which reflects all of the day's major developments, is posted online later that evening and appears in the newspaper the following day. (Regarding lunch, she's trying to figure out how to eat more than mangos and popcorn.)
In criminal cases, like the Weinstein trial, there are typically several major points of interest for journalists: the arraignment (when the accused party first appears before a judge), key pretrial motions, jury selection, opening statements, witness testimony, closing arguments, the verdict and sentencing.
"A trial is really exciting because you have a running story," said Ben Weiser, who has covered the Manhattan federal courts for The Times for many years. "You have characters who are there throughout -- it's like watching a play," Mr. Weiser said, "and people become personalities."
But unlike courtroom dramas on TV, there are often hours of proceedings that can include long exchanges between lawyers and the judge. Skilled reporters are able to discern the new and important developments.
"It's 99 percent tedium, but you have to be listening and then suddenly someone will say something," Mr. Weiser said, "and that will be your lede."
When everyone is following the same case, however, distinguishing your coverage from the competition can be tricky.
"The fun part about it is when you have 10 reporters all watching the exact same thing," Mr. Weiser said, "and you think, 'Did anyone else notice that thing that's going to be my lede?"'
John Schwartz, a reporter for The Times, who has a law degree from the University of Texas, but does not practice, previously worked as the legal correspondent for the National desk. He now reports on climate and covers environmental cases around the country. One major challenge, he said, is navigating the rules and regulations of each court.
In many federal courthouses, cellphones, laptops and recording devices are not permitted, which means reporters must take notes by hand. Often, at these proceedings, reporters have to call their editors or other reporters with the news.
"You're back to being a reporter from the 1950s," Mr. Schwartz said. "You phone it in and compose it in your head and provide that first bit of information just as quick as you can."
In New York State Court, it is sometimes possible to have electronics, depending on the judge. And in the Weinstein trial, reporters are allowed to have laptops and recording devices, but they can't publish anything from the courtroom. (This means, several times a day, Ms. Ransom must step outside of the courtroom to notify her editors that they can publish the article.)
The reason these reporters go to great lengths to cover the courts is simple, Mr. Schwartz said.
"The court system is a huge part of what maintains civil society. It is why we don't kill each other with clubs," he said, adding, "to the extent we don't kill each other with clubs."

Texto completo: How to actually make it the best part of waking up.
"Oh! The coffee's good today" is something my husband or I murmur on occasion as we slowly come alive with our first sip of the morning. On most days, though, the coffee we make at home is just good enough. We make it the same way every time, but whether we achieve coffee nirvana on any particular day is anyone's guess. How to brew a great cup mystified me for years -- until I decided to get to the bottom of it.
It turns out that even with quality beans, it's hard to be a good home barista without the right tools. Some of these things are admittedly pricey but entirely worth it, according to coffee experts. For instance, a burr grinder (such as the OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder, a pick from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products), which chops and grinds beans into a consistent coarseness, starts at about $ 100. And a reverse-osmosis filtration system, which reduces the mineral content in hard water (check the United States Geological Survey site to see if you have it), can cost well over $ 100.
Luckily, just about everything else is quite affordable. In collaboration with Wirecutter, here are five cheap(ish) things that can vastly improve your coffee-drinking experience -- acoustic-guitar playlist optional.
The right storage container
Oxygen interacts with coffee and creates stale flavors. If your beans or grounds come in a sturdy valve bag -- which are foil-lined and resealable, with a circular blister near the top -- it's actually best not to transfer them to a storage container. "The bag is enough to keep oxygen out," said Peter Giuliano, chief research officer at the Specialty Coffee Association. In fact, dumping your coffee elsewhere can disrupt the layer of carbon dioxide that surrounds and protects it.
However, if your beans are not in a valve bag, you'll need an airtight container. Wirecutter likes the durable and tightly sealed Rubbermaid Brilliance Pantry Storage Containers. In any case, keep your beans in a cool, dark spot, and avoid cabinets above or near the stove. Light, heat and moisture are kryptonite to them.
A kitchen scale
Beans and grounds vary in shape and size -- they don't settle into that tablespoon or coffee scoop the same way every time. This means you can have differing coffee-to-water ratios. Sometimes you end up with good coffee, and sometimes you don't.
"It seems weird and fussy, but a scale is a powerful thing," Mr. Giuliano said. "It can improve consistency a lot." The American Weigh Scales LB-3000 Compact Digital Scale, which takes up little counter space, is the most accurate 0.1-gram scale Wirecutter tested. (For something that also works for larger tasks, like cooking a meal, Wirecutter's top pick is the Escali Primo Digital Scale.)
A pour-over dripper
I was pleased to discover that the tool that makes arguably the best coffee is also among the cheapest. Drippers, which cafes use to make high-end coffee, cost about $ 20. With a slow pour, you'll have full control over how evenly your coffee is saturated with water, allowing for more even flavor extraction. "You also get to have precise control over other variables, like the temperature of your water, which can affect the flavor of your coffee," said Marguerite Preston, Wirecutter's senior appliance and kitchen editor.
Wirecutter's tests show that the Kalita Wave 185 Dripper consistently makes great coffee, even if you're not an expert. (Wirecutter's guide to the best pour-over coffee gear also offers guidance on the best technique).
A great mug
We love a travel cup with a lid, but it cuts off the aroma, and we detect flavor with sensory cells both in the nose and on the tongue. For the most flavorful cup of coffee, drink it hot -- but not too hot, said Brad Barnes, director of consulting and industry programs at the Culinary Institute of America. You want the ability not only to smell it but also to let the coffee linger on your tongue for a while without being scalded. The senior staff writer Lesley Stockton swears by the $ 20-a-pair Bodum Pavina Double Wall Glasses.
Descaling solution
A vinegar-water solution (as described in this post on why you should regularly clean your coffee maker) will do but, if playing kitchen chemistry is keeping you from good coffee hygiene, a prepared solution might help. "Descaling once a month will greatly improve the taste of your coffee," Mr. Giuliano said. Ms. Preston suggests the Urnex Dezcal Coffee and Espresso Descaler and Cleaner, which can be used on coffee and espresso makers as well as kettles.

Oh, That Other State? New Hampshire Surveys the Fallout From Iowa and Smirks

Texto completo: The "first in the nation" primary never lets Iowa tell it what to do. Especially not this year.
DERRY, N.H. -- Throughout the nearly half century-long presidential rivalry between Iowa and New Hampshire, sometimes a state has to dig deep to make its case for why its contest is in fact superior.
Not this year.
As New Hampshire Democrats head to the polls Tuesday, they are divided over their candidates, the direction of their party and how to defeat President Trump. But there's at least one core belief that unites them: That other first-in-the-nation contest really messed this one up.
"The very first real primary is going to be New Hampshire and rightfully so," Howard Wooldridge said as he waited with a group of people hoping to get into a packed town hall event with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. That other early state? "Nobody is going to get anything out of it."
New Hampshire voters are known for their steely New England independence, an eagerness to buck whatever those Midwesterners do with their votes.
The first-in-the nation primary is the place that made Bill Clinton the "comeback kid" after a devastating defeat in the 1992 Iowa caucuses. Sixteen years later, Granite State voters helped his wife, Hillary, eke out a surprise victory against Barack Obama, reviving her campaign after being bested by the Illinois senator in Iowa. In 2016, the New Hampshire voters reversed course yet again, delivering a 22-point victory to Senator Bernie Sanders over Mrs. Clinton.
Yet, New Hampshire voters have never seen Iowa caucuses quite like these. How does a contrary New England Democrat stick it to Iowa, when there's no one to stick it to?
The Iowa Democratic Party released results indicating that Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the winner after it updated data from 55 precincts. But errors in the result tabulations have led several news organizations, including The New York Times, to refrain from calling the race. Mr. Sanders, who won the popular vote in the state, and Mr. Buttigieg are calling for a partial recanvass of some precincts.
In the midst of the mess, the two men swaggered across New Hampshire talking about an Iowa win, each telling voters he has emerged as a clear front-runner from the contest.
Senator Amy Klobuchar's Iowa-bashing was subtle -- or, perhaps, more politic -- than that of New Hampshire voters themselves.
"You're a state that's a primary, so people can vote," Ms. Klobuchar, who is from Minnesota, told a laughing crowd in Keene on Monday. "You know how to count votes."
As she sat in a concert hall, waiting for Senator Elizabeth Warren to address voters in Derry, Mary Bishop, 71, said she was totally stuck on picking a candidate. But she was certain that the mess in Iowa would play no role in her decision making.
"Good lord, no," she said. "They're in another country. You need a passport to go from Iowa to New Hampshire."
The fact that both states would be voting in the same presidential election -- the very reason a Granite Stater would pay attention to Iowa in the first place -- did not seem to interfere with the trash talk.
Ms. Bishop's friend Sue Dickinson agreed, questioning how you could trust any results out of such a chaotic process. Yet, she also wondered whether she might just want to give Mr. Buttigieg -- a candidate she previously dismissed as too inexperienced -- a second look.
"When you get to the middle of the country, and that just might be my bias, but they seem very set in their ways. More traditional," Ms. Dickinson said. "It surprised me that they'd consider him."
In interviews with dozens of voters across the Granite State, it's clear that Iowa is on their minds, even if they don't like to admit that a state many are eager to disparage might influence their decision making.
The New Hampshire primary electorate tends to be a bit less ideologically liberal in Democratic races: More than 40 percent of New Hampshire voters are independent (officially called undeclared) -- a significantly greater share than either party can claim -- and independents are allowed to participate in either primary. With Mr. Trump facing little opposition, many are expected to flock to the more competitive Democratic primary race.
Dante J. Scala, professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, says the idea of New Hampshire as a fiercely countervailing force is more political lore than fact, at least when it comes to Democratic primaries. In the 2000 and 2004 cycles, the state echoed the choices of Iowans, picking Al Gore and John Kerry.
One similarity: Like Iowans, New Hampshire voters decide late in the process. A month ago, polling showed that less than one-third of registered Democratic primary voters had "definitely" settled on a candidate.
The late-breaking nature of the electorate gives events in the final week before voting -- like the Iowa caucuses or Friday night's debate -- significant influence to shift the race.
Michael Arnow, 66, said he had been considering Ms. Klobuchar but was leaning toward Mr. Buttigieg after seeing how well he performed amid the "craziness" of Iowa. As he waited to get into a packed town hall meeting with the former mayor on Thursday afternoon, he worried that Mr. Sanders could not defeat Mr. Trump -- his main criterion for assessing the field.
"I don't want to waste a vote for a politician that may not ultimately get to that point," Mr. Arnow said. "I'm jumping on the bandwagon, admittedly."
Still considered the favorite in the state, Mr. Sanders has been holding steady in polling. But recent surveys show Mr. Buttigieg ticking up, surging to a virtual tie with the Vermont senator early last week, and Ms. Klobuchar gaining steam. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., meanwhile, has dropped precipitously.
"Biden's collapse here, Buttigieg's rise has to do with Iowa," said Mr. Scala, the author of a book on the history of the New Hampshire primary. "The Iowa thing really kind of threw everyone here into sixes and sevens, and people started shopping."
That new reality visibly frustrates the famously voluble former vice president. At campaign events, he stresses that the Iowa results are unrepresentative of his ability to win bigger battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.
"You ever been to a caucus?" he shot back at a student who asked Mr. Biden to explain what his disastrous finish in Iowa meant for his national prospects. "No, you haven't. You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier."
Not all New Hampshire voters have the patience to wait for those later contests.
After listening to Mr. Buttigieg address a veterans hall in Derry, Dave Agennessey, 73, said he was torn between Mr. Biden and the former mayor. But after the caucuses, he's leaning toward Mr. Buttigieg -- despite, well, Iowa.
"The caucus system itself is flawed. It's wrong," said Mr. Agennessey, a semiretired Realtor. "If people do well, the winner will come out of New Hampshire."
Mr. Scala says that New Hampshire voters might want to be a little more careful in their scathing reviews of their fellow early voters.
The caucus crisis has left many party leaders eager to restructure the early-voting process, with officials in places like Michigan and Illinois already salivating at an opportunity to jump ahead in the lineup.
"The thing is, once you open the box, where do the reforms end?" he said. "We've been joined at the hip with Iowa for so long in the process people are going to say it's got to be a twofer. You've got to take out Iowa and New Hampshire."

Texto completo: The death of Qassim al-Rimi is part of a string of setbacks that have damaged the group's ability to carry out operations against the West.
WASHINGTON -- For more than a decade, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen has been one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations on the planet. The group spent years inventing explosives that are difficult to detect, including trying to disguise bombs in devices like cellphones. It has tried at least three times to blow up American airliners, without success.
But the White House's announcement last week that the United States had killed the group's leader, Qassim al-Rimi -- confirming what The New York Times first reported several days earlier -- was the latest in a string of setbacks over the past few years that have damaged the group's ability to orchestrate or carry out operations against the West, American and European counterterrorism specialists say.
A flurry of American drone strikes in Yemen in recent years has now killed two successive leaders of the group as well as Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, the affiliate's notorious bomb maker. Clashes with rival Islamic State and Houthi rebel fighters in Yemen have also weakened the group, whose full name is Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And its once formidable jihadi news media presence has been far surpassed by the Islamic State's.
"AQAP doesn't seem like the beast it once was," Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former British ambassador to Yemen who is now a top United Nations counterterrorism official, told a think-tank audience in Washington last week.
As the Yemen branch reels from these body blows, other Qaeda affiliates around the world are elbowing their way to prominence. The Shabab, an East African terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, has ramped up attacks in Somalia in recent years, drawing increasing fire from American missile strikes. The group last month assaulted a Kenyan military base housing United States troops, killing three Americans.
American counterterrorism officials have voiced increased alarm about a Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Hurras al-Din, that they say is plotting attacks against the West by exploiting the chaotic security situation in the country's northwest and the protection inadvertently afforded by Russian air defenses shielding Syrian government forces allied with Moscow.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has dogged President Trump since his first days in office in 2017, when the president authorized an ill-fated raid on Mr. al-Rimi's hide-out in Yemen that left dead one member of the Navy's elite SEAL Team 6, Chief Petty Officer William Owens.
Even though the group has been weakened, intelligence and counterterrorism officials warn that the organization remains dangerous.
The group claimed last week in an audio recording by Mr. al-Rimi -- made before his death -- that it had directed a Saudi military officer to carry out the shooting at a United States military base in Florida in December that killed three sailors and wounded eight people.
The group offered no evidence that it had trained the gunman, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, but it produced a copy of his will as well as correspondence that indicated that he had been in contact with Al Qaeda. Experts said those elements made the claim plausible.
At a news conference last month, the F.B.I. deputy director, David Bowdich, said that while Lieutenant Alshamrani did not appear to be motivated by one specific terrorist group, his social media comments echoed those of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical Yemeni-American cleric and senior leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was killed in a drone strike in 2011.
"AQAP remains a significant, lingering concern, in part because the group was so fixated on aviation as a target, and the kind of bomb-making expertise that the group developed was unlikely to have been contained to just a few select individuals," said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.
"That kind of knowledge and expertise is of course shareable and transferable -- not just within AQAP but beyond to other Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups and other like-minded terrorists," said Mr. Rasmussen, who is now the acting executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a think tank.
Bill Roggio, the editor of The Long War Journal, a website run by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that tracks military strikes against militant groups, noted that AQAP had been counted out before only to rebound through resilience, patience and a commitment to its cause.
Still, the Yemen affiliate has suffered several major blows in recent years. Nasser al-Wuhayshi -- the first emir of AQAP, who was widely considered to be a likely successor to Ayman al-Zawahri, the overall leader of Al Qaeda -- was killed in an American drone strike in 2015.
Four years later, Mr. Trump announced that Mr. al-Asiri, the bomb maker, had died in a drone strike in Yemen in 2017. It was Mr. al-Asiri who sewed a bomb into the underpants of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to detonate the device on an American airliner approaching Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009. The bomb fizzled harmlessly, and Mr. Abdulmutallab was arrested and imprisoned.
Mr. al-Asiri also designed explosive devices disguised as printer cartridges intended to blow up cargo planes over the United States in 2010, and another device meant to bring down a passenger plane in 2012. Both plots were thwarted.
And then last week, Mr. Trump confirmed in a statement that Mr. al-Rimi had been killed. The statement offered few details, but The Times reported that the C.I.A. carried out the airstrike in late January using remotely piloted drones after months of tracking him.
The White House statement noted that Mr. al-Rimi's death degraded not just Al Qaeda's activities in Yemen but "the global Al Qaeda movement." Mr. al-Rimi played an important senior coordinating role with other Qaeda affiliates, avoiding the need to consult on every matter with Mr. Zawahri from his hide-out, most likely along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
Analysts say several hardened jihadists are among those to succeed Mr. al-Rimi as the group's next leader.
A measure of the United States' success against AQAP is evident in the number of American military drone strikes in Yemen, which dropped to eight last year from a peak of 125 in 2017, according to statistics compiled by Mr. Roggio's organization. The strikes resulted in fewer high-priority targets and drove many surviving leaders underground, officials said.
"AQAP failed to capitalize on the turmoil in Yemen to recruit more members and expand its following," said Colin P. Clarke, a senior fellow at The Soufan Center, a New York-based research organization.
"While the group did indeed make inroads with certain Sunni tribes, the past several years have been focused more on survival and less on growth and plotting external attacks," Mr. Clarke said.
Without the high-level terrorist attacks against the West that the organization had become known for and that its brand was partly built around, its image suffered, and the group seemed to have become more insular, analysts said.
"It has been decimated by drone strikes, infiltrated by spies, fragmented by infighting and handicapped by a near total shutdown of its communications networks," said Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen scholar at the University of Oxford who visited the country in October. "But a die-hard core will always remain. The more Yemen continues to unravel with the recent re-escalation of hostilities, the easier AQAP will find it to survive and prosper again."

Daniel Kehlmann Says Hello to a Cruel World

Texto completo: "Tyll," a best-selling novel in Germany and soon to be a Netflix series, is set in the dark times its author couldn't get out of his head.
BERLIN -- When Daniel Kehlmann read the news that the former Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn, facing financial misconduct charges in Japan, fled the country in a box, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration.
It was the kind of caper that he might have written into one of his novels, where escape artists, pranksters or con men often outwit their adversaries. For example: "Tyll," his latest book, which Pantheon will publish in an English translation by Ross Benjamin on Feb. 11. It has sold nearly 600,000 copies in Germany since it was published there in 2017, and is being adapted by Netflix as a television series.
"Tyll" transmits the 14th-century tale of the jester Tyll Ulenspiegel about 300 years into the future, plopping him into the Thirty Years' War. Tyll travels through a Europe devastated by conflict, encountering fraudsters, soldiers and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, whose love of Shakespeare chimes with Tyll's own sense of theatrical spectacle.
Kehlmann's eighth novel and the sixth one to come out in English, "Tyll" is also his second book of historical fiction, following his 2005 best seller "Measuring the World." "Tyll" has either been or is being translated into more than 20 languages. But for a long time it was a novel that Kehlmann, who turned 45 in January, was reluctant to write.
"It might sound very weird now, but I actually don't like historical novels," he says. "When I wrote 'Measuring the World,' I told myself: 'This is an experiment, I'm never going to write another historical novel."'
"Measuring," which is set in the 19th century, follows the adventures of two historic Germans -- the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt and the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss -- as they set out to measure the world from its highest mountain to its deepest cave. With "Tyll," Kehlmann envisioned something darker, about wars of religion and the impotence of statecraft.
"In a way, it's a serious literary experiment in trying to imagine what the world was like before the Enlightenment," he says, "what was it really like to live in a world before Voltaire, Newton and all these people. It's great to write about, but of course you wouldn't want to spend even an hour in this world."
At one point, Tyll goads the residents of a German village to take off their shoes, throw them into the air and then reclaim the ones that belong to them -- watching with amusement as a brawl ensues. "I was about 7 years old when I heard this story at school, which was presented to us as something didactic, as if Tyll is showing people their folly," Kehlmann says. "But that's not true. The only thing that story actually demonstrates is that everyone had the same kind of shoes, and he's just being a really mean prankster."
The idea of a jester character appealed to Kehlmann, he says, "because he's someone who could go anywhere and meet anybody at a time when there was not much social mobility."
"Tyll" took him five years to write, twice as long as any of his other novels. Kehlmann was about two-thirds of the way through when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. Kehlmann, his wife, the human-rights lawyer Anne Rubesame, and their son, Oscar, live in Manhattan, after years shuttling between New York and Berlin.
"When Trump won, I was so shocked and worried that for a while I couldn't write anymore," Kehlmann says. "But then I thought of Tyll's resilience and his way of making fun of anything. It was revelatory because I'd never had any experience of my own character helping me to finish something or to cope."
One of Kehlmann's hallmarks as a novelist is the impish humor that he injects into bleak and absurd situations. It is there in "Tyll" and "Measuring," but also in his modern-day novels, such as "Me and Kaminski" (2003), "Fame" (2009) and "F" (2013), where the vanities of artists, actors, writers and businessmen are exposed by their appetite for outlandish quests.
"His fascination for comic writing is very unusual in German literature nowadays, especially the way he combines it with elements of horror," says Alexander Fest, Kehlmann's longtime editor at his German publisher Rowohlt Verlag. "I think he grew fascinated by Tyll Ulenspiegel because two of the things he's interested in came together in this one character. Tyll is an uncanny figure in the way he makes fun of people and is funny -- not for the people he makes fun of, but for the others standing around."
Kehlmann, who was raised in Vienna, credits his Austrian roots for this sensibility. "There is quite a lot of comic literature in Austria which didn't travel a lot because the canon of German literature is still very much formed by northern Germany," he says. "My growing up in Austria gave me a certain distance from the funny side of German culture, and the ability to make fun of it that maybe I wouldn't have had if I'd grown up in Berlin."
He studied philosophy and German literature at the University of Vienna, but was more interested in Latin American magical realists like Gabriel García Márquez and Mario Vargas Llosa. "I was always captivated by stories of escape, especially escape by means of tricks and brilliance of the mind," he says.
Part of this fascination also stemmed from the experiences of his family during World War II. His paternal grandparents were assimilated Austrian Jews who survived thanks to forged documents that disguised their identity. His father, Michael, was imprisoned in the Maria Lanzendorf concentration camp, but was released about a month before the end of the war.
Michael Kehlmann went on to have a productive career as a TV and theater director. Daniel Kehlmann regrets that his father never got to read "Measuring the World," as he was suffering from dementia and died two months after it came out.
But without knowing it, a baton had been passed. While Michael Kehlmann was alive, his son never considered writing for the theater.
"I always felt like theater was my father's world, so I didn't want to get close to it," Daniel Kehlmann says. "But when I wrote 'Measuring the World,' one of the upsides of writing a big best seller was that it freed me up to try out many things."
He recently completed his fourth play, "The Voyage of the St. Louis," about Jewish refugees who left Germany in 1939, were refused entry in Cuba and the United States, then turned back to Europe. Later this year it will be performed as a BBC radio play in an adaptation by Tom Stoppard.
For Kehlmann, the new play feels like a corrective. German fans for years congratulated him on writing books that had no relation to Nazi Germany. "I told them that I knew where they were coming from, but I didn't set out to be official proof that we have left that past behind," he says. "We haven't, and we shouldn't."
Correction: Feb. 4, 2020
An earlier version of this article misstated the century in which Daniel Kehlmann's book "Measuring the World" takes place. It is set in the 19th century, not the 18th.

'Parasite' Grows On the Academy

Texto completo: The film academy vowed to diversify in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite. That has meant a growing number of members from around the world.
LOS ANGELES -- Song Kang Ho, one of the stars of "Parasite," cried on the Oscar stage. The film's director, Bong Joon Ho, smiled and giggled.
"Parasite" made Academy Award history on Sunday night by becoming the first foreign-language movie to win best picture. Its victory was a testament to the near universal praise for the film -- a sharp contrast with last year's winner, "Green Book" -- and for Bong, who became a beloved figure as he enjoyed all the trappings of the awards season.
"I feel like something will hit me, and I will wake up from this dream," he said backstage, with two of the four Oscar statuettes won by the film grasped in his hands like barbells.
For the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Bong's dream is something it has been working to make a reality for several years, ever since being stung by the humiliation of the #OscarsSoWhite outcry.
"We are so proud of the academy," Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the former president of the organization, said during an interview at the Governor's Ball, the academy's official after-party. "We have talked for a couple of years now about acknowledging the brilliance of filmmakers from all around the world and paying attention to their storytelling, to their visions, to their creativity. Tonight we saw it happen."
Since 2016, following two straight years in which no actors of color were nominated for Oscars, the academy has been working to diversify its voting base: by race, gender and nationality. According to an analysis by The Hollywood Reporter, 39 percent of the organization's new members hail from outside the United States.
Last summer, the academy invited 842 people from 59 countries to become members, including the Korean New Wave director Yim Soon-Rye ("Little Forest"), the "Parasite" cinematographer Hong Kyung-Pyo and the South Korean documentarian Hong Hyung-Sook ("Reclaiming Our Names").
The academy invited 928 people from 59 countries to become members the previous year, and 774 people from 57 countries a year earlier.
In contrast, at the start of the decade the academy was inviting fewer than 180 people annually to become members, with most of the invites going to people already working in Hollywood. The academy only invited 105 people to join in 2008.
Yet the effect on Oscar voting had not been all that pronounced. The academy was criticized this year for yet again not nominating any women in the best director category. The majority of the best picture nominees skewed heavily male and heavily white. And of the 20 individuals nominated in the four acting categories, only one, Cynthia Erivo, was black. No one from the "Parasite" cast was nominated.
Then came the big night for "Parasite," which triumphed over more traditional films -- like "1917" and "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" -- with its distinctive examination of class relations as seen through the lens of two intricately linked families.
"We're not only celebrating 'Parasite,' but how a foreign movie just won best picture, the biggest award," said Choi Woo Shik, who played the son of the central family in the genre-defying film. "It opens up the windows for foreign cinema lovers, and this means a lot to us."
Last year, the Netflix film "Roma," a family drama set in Mexico, was nominated for best picture and won best director for Alfonso Cuarón. On Sunday night, some observers were giving it credit for paving the way for "Parasite."
"Five years ago, 'Parasite' would have never won best picture," said the producer Mark Johnson, who is an academy governor and ran the foreign-language committee for close to two decades. "The idea that a foreign-language film was seen by enough people to win is extraordinary."
Still, there was something special about "Parasite" from its initial debut at the Cannes Film Festival back in May, where it nabbed the coveted Palme d'Or. That helped propel the film to its $ 130 million international box office, before it came to the United States and collected an additional $ 35 million.
Miky Lee, the heiress-turned-media mogul who financed and distributed "Parasite" through her role as vice chairwoman of the Korean media conglomerate CJ Group, has seen the film 18 times. "The first time I watched it, I thought the low-income people are parasitic to the high-income people," she said in an interview at the Governor's Ball. "I watch it a second time and realize that they are parasitic to each other. This is something that affects everybody, how to coexist with respect and without crossing the line."
Also contributing to the movie's success was Neon, the indie film company that distributed "Parasite," and its spirited campaign, academy governors said. The studio, led by Tom Quinn, turned awards journalists into evangelists by opening its doors wide to them, in contrast to the more controlling larger studios. On the trail, "Parasite" became draped in an almost irresistible narrative: the little engine that could.
What Neon lacked in resources -- Netflix, for instance, has 60 people in its awards and talent department campaigning for films like "The Irishman" and "Marriage Story" -- it made up for with buoyancy and heart.
Bong wandered through the season with his camera in tow, documenting his unlikely journey and returning some joy and excitement to a process that has been overrun with cynicism and commercialism. He became pals with the "Jojo Rabbit" writer-director Taika Waititi, and showed reverence to the filmmakers who came before him, like his competitors Martin Scorsese ("The Irishman") and Quentin Tarantino ("Once Upon a Time"). He was a perfect character for voters to get behind.
"Bong is fresh and new in town," Boone Isaacs said. "Though we've all known about his talent for quite awhile."
The internet, Bong said, also helped make voters, and audiences in general, open to a wider range of content. "There are streaming services, YouTube, social media," he said backstage. "We will come to a day when a foreign-language film winning this won't be much of an issue, hopefully."
Yet those who have seen the academy embrace inclusion at times, only to seemingly reverse course, remain skeptical. Spike Lee, who last year nabbed his first Oscar for his adapted screenplay for "BlacKkKlansman," one of a record seven black Oscar winners that year, told The New York Times earlier this year: "After last year's ceremony, I said, 'It ain't gonna be like this next year!' It's always feast or famine with us."
When asked Sunday night at the Governor's Ball if he thought the victories by "Parasite" made up for the lack of diversity in other parts of this year's Oscar race, Lee wouldn't bite.
"The struggle continues," he said.

Texto completo: Holden Matthews, 22, said he set fire to the churches last year in an attempt to raise his profile as a musician in a subgenre of heavy metal.
A 22-year-old man pleaded guilty on Monday to intentionally setting fires to three predominantly black Baptist churches in Louisiana over a 10-day period last year -- crimes that set a rural Cajun community on edge.
The man, Holden Matthews, the son of a local sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty to four federal criminal counts, including three counts of intentional damage to religious property, which is a federal hate crime, and one count of using fire to commit a felony, according to a statement issued by the United States Department of Justice. Later on Monday, he pleaded guilty to six state charges, including aggravated arson of a religious building and three hate crime counts.
He will face 10 to 70 years in prison when he is sentenced on the federal charges on May 22. He will be sentenced on the state charges four days later.
During his plea hearing in United States District Court in Lafayette, La., Mr. Matthews said he had targeted these buildings because of their religious character, according to the statement. Mr. Matthews, an aficionado of black metal, a subgenre of heavy metal, said he was copying similar crimes committed in Norway in the 1990s in an attempt to elevate his status among the black metal community, whose most extreme practitioners engaged in church burning, vandalism and killings.
Mr. Matthews was a member of a black metal band called Vodka Vultures. He also admitted to posting photographs and videos of the churches burning on Facebook as a promotional tactic.
Mr. Matthews set fire to St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, La., on March 26, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, also in Opelousas, on April 4.
All the fires took place in the middle of the night and did not injure anyone. Mr. Matthews was arrested about two weeks after the first fire.
Though race was not mentioned as a factor in the charges, the three fires destroyed churches that had existed for more than a century and had been the spiritual homes of generations of black families, evoking the long history of racist crimes committed in the Jim Crow South. Since the 1950s, black churches across the South have been targets of arson, bombings and armed assault.
Dustin Charles Talbot, Mr. Matthews's lawyer, said that Mr. Matthews had the social and mental development of an adolescent, and that his actions were not motivated by the racial makeup of the congregations.
"Holden now fully understands the seriousness and gravity of his actions and is deeply remorseful for what he has done and the pain he has caused the congregations of these churches," Mr. Talbot said.
In a statement, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People described Mr. Matthews's actions as "domestic terrorism" and urged Congress to take concrete steps in combating hate crimes against communities of color.
"Churches are incredibly influential in Black culture and serve as a safe space for convening," the association said. "All Americans deserve to feel safe in their churches, schools and homes."
David C. Joseph, the United States attorney for Louisiana's Western District, said in the statement: "Today, the defendant has taken responsibility for the burning and destruction of three of our churches. The freedom to safely congregate and worship in our churches is a fundamental right of all Americans and will be vigorously protected by my office and our law enforcement partners."
A crowdfunding campaign for the fire-ravaged churches received more than $ 2 million after it was widely shared on social media after the arsons. Many users noted that millions of euros were being pledged to rebuild the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris after it suffered a calamitous fire, but the small churches in Louisiana were still struggling.

Texto completo: Joaquin Phoenix brought a message to milk and meat lovers, and California's growers had a response. Police warn of mayhem as a wave of progressive district attorneys join the ranks of traditional tough-on-crime prosecutors. And specially trained dogs are helping citrus growers protect their crops.
It's Arlene Martínez with news for Monday.
But first, it's the story of the 71-year-old man who stepped in to save the state's oldest weekly newspaper from extinction. The Mountain Messenger's alum includes Mark Twain.
And later, don't miss what Democratic presidential candidates had to say on whether California should continue to be allowed to set its own emissions standards.

Joaquin Phoenix: Stop stealing milk for your coffee and cereal
Some California farmers weren't particularly fond of Best Actor winner Joaquin Phoenix's acceptance speech Sunday night at the Academy Awards. Phoenix won for his (incredible) portrayal of the lead character in "Joker," and took his time in the limelight to lecture those who eat and drink animal products.
“We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby. Even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable,” Phoenix said. “And then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. ”
Erik Wilson, who founded the popular My Job Depends On Ag movement that became a PBS documentary series last year, fired back at the activist actor.
“I find it interesting that not too far from that award show is the great Central Valley of California. Perfect area to grow all the vegan products that one can imagine,” Wilson said in a Facebook post. “But . . . he and the many folks in the entertainment industry support California's politicians that deny the very water to grow their vegan food. ”
California is home to the top milk-producing region in the country in Tulare County, which produced 10 billion pounds of milk and generated nearly $1. 7 billion in revenues in 2018 alone.

And while we're talking Oscars, take a photo peek behind the scenes of the year's biggest night in movies.
A disease-tracking dog and big cats in the news
In an effort to help protect expensive crops, citrus growers throughout California have turned to man's best friend. The scientist-trained dogs are helping sniff out a crop ailment called huanglongbing that has hit orange, lemon and grapefruit orchards elsewhere in California as well as in Florida and Texas.
The dogs can detect the disease weeks to years before it causes the visible problems of mottled leaves and deformed fruit. That's critical because the disease is incurable and eventually deadly to trees.
In a Texas experiment, trained dogs were accurate 95% of the time in distinguishing grapefruit trees recently infected with the disease-causing bacteria that are spread by a tiny insect, the Asian citrus psyllid.
A property owner who lost 12 animals to a mountain lion over two years received the go-ahead to off the cougar that committed the acts. It's the first permit issued to kill a radio-collared mountain lion in the Santa Monica Mountains area.
Not too far away, another mountain lion briefly eluded capture over the weekend when the cat made its way into a residential neighborhood. No animal or human was hurt before state Department of Fish and Wildlife authorities sedated and took the cat away.
Attacks on human lions by mountain lions are rare. Since 1890, there have been just 16 verified attacks.
As criminal justice is re-envisioned, police warn of mayhem
The installation of a new district attorney in San Francisco — one the city's powerful police union spent $650,000 trying to defeat — is bringing attention to a new brand of criminal justice and causing tension between law enforcement and the progressives now holding top prosecutorial positions across the country.
Three of them spoke with USA TODAY about their experiences pushing reform-oriented policies. Here's some of what they said:
“This country has been operating too long on a policy of jail and retribution,” says Philadelphia's Larry Krasner, whose most recent move was to refuse prosecution of those caught with Buprenorphine-based medications commonly used to treat opioid use. “We need drug treatment, mental health treatment. The other policies don’t work. ”
Boston-based Suffolk County (Massachusetts) District Attorney Rachael Rollins, the first woman of color to hold a DA post in the state and who calls herself “smart on crime,” says a hallmark of the progressive wave is relying “on numbers, not anecdotes. ” She is busy hiring “technologists and data experts so we can document all this and show how these policies are making a difference. ”
Joe Gonzales, the recently installed Bexar County DA in San Antonio, says he has already seen results from an approach that includes citing and releasing those stopped for minor drug infractions who are then steered to community service.
“In the last six months, around 1,400 people who would have been arrested before have been directed to other facilities, which means we’ve saved the county about $1 million in booking costs,” Gonzales says. “I like to say that jails are for people we’re truly afraid of. ”
What else we're talking about
Vanessa Bryant opens up about losing Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter, "Gigi": "God I wish they were here and this nightmare would be over. "
Tarmac-dancing airport workers in Fresno who posted their moves on TikTok and Twitter are fired for what bosses called “inappropriate behavior in the work environment. ”
President Donald Trump proposes spending roughly $2 billion to add 82 miles of a U. S. -Mexico border wall.
Did the LAPD misuse a gang database?
The state Department of Justice is investigating the Los Angeles Police Department's use of CalGang — a criminal intelligence database used by law enforcement agencies across the state to identify and monitor alleged gang members — following reports that falsified or inaccurate records were submitted by officers in the agency's Metropolitan Division.
The LAPD's Internal Affairs division is conducting its own investigation and has already removed some officers from active duty.
“Transparency and accountability are fundamental to effective policing," California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. "Our state Legislature recently entrusted oversight of the CalGang system to DOJ. As part of that oversight responsibility, we will take appropriate measures to hold accountable those who misuse the CalGang system. ”
Democratic presidential hopefuls talk emissions
The federal government has for decades granted California special power to set its own emission standards to limit the smog-inducing exhaust shrouding cities like Los Angeles.
The state was already regulating emissions before the federal government passed the Clean Air Act in 1963, so the Environmental Protection Agency allowed the state to apply for waivers to enforce emission standards tougher than the federal government's.
But under President Donald Trump, the EPA has worked to revoke the state's special ability to set its own standards, arguing the issues caused by greenhouse gases are no different here than anywhere else.
In September 2019, after the feds announced they planned on stripping the state's authority to set emission standards, California Attorney Gen. Xavier Becerra filed suit. The tug-of-war has major implications for car manufacturers, who often choose to produce vehicles that comply with California's stricter standards for the entire market.
The Desert Sun enlisted emission standards expert and UCLA environmental law profess Ann Carlson to ask each of the candidates running in the Democratic Party's presidential primary election a question about the battle.
Check out how they responded. And here's what they said about:
California's housing crisis.
How to confront wildfires.
How to handle a fast-growing aging population.

Watch out AT&amp;T and Verizon: Federal judge expected to clear T-Mobile Sprint merger, reports say

Resumen: T-Mobile can combine forces with Sprint to take on AT&T and Verizon despite concerns the merger will lead to higher prices, judge is expected to rule

Texto completo: A federal judge will clear the way for T-Mobile's to combine forces with Sprint over the objections of a coalition of state attorneys general who argued the merger would result in higher mobile phone bills for customers, according to reports in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
The decision, expected Tuesday, removes one of the last remaining challenges to the deal which would create a much larger competitor to wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon.
Shares of Sprint surged nearly 69% in after-hours trading Monday to $8. 10.
It is not yet known if T-Mobile and Sprint, the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers, will have to make any additional concessions beyond what they've already agreed to. Federal officials signed off on the deal after Sprint agreed to sell its Boost Mobile prepaid carrier unit to Dish and other concessions.
Higher cellphone prices?: Sprint exec suggests T-mobile deal may increase mobile service prices for consumers
Merger outlook was unclear: FCC formally approves T-Mobile-Sprint merger, but companies aren't out of the woods yet
During the trial in U. S. District Court in New York, 13 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia, attempted to persuade Judge Victor Marrero that the $26. 5 billion deal should be blocked.
The two wireless carriers struck a merger agreement about two years ago in an all-stock deal worth $26. 5 billion.
The impact of the deal remains uncertain. Critics say consumers will pay higher cellphone prices and as many as 30,000 jobs will be lost.
Though T-Mobile and Sprint have long claimed otherwise and committed to not raise prices for three years, messages by a Sprint executive revealed in federal court suggested he thought an acquisition by T-Mobile might increase prices.
Merger supporters have argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be a stronger competitor to AT&T and Verizon and will help keep prices low.

Doctored video of Pelosi to stay online

Texto completo: Facebook and Twitter have rejected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's request that they remove a video posted by President Trump that was edited to make it appear she was ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address as he honored a Tuskegee airman.
The decision highlighted the tension between those who want social media platforms to crack down on the spread of misinformation and others who argue that political speech should be given wide latitude, even if it's deceptive or false.
The debate has accelerated during the presidential campaign as congressional Democrats demand that Facebook and other tech companies take tougher action, while some on the right argue that such policing could muzzle conservative viewpoints.
Into that politicized environment came the video Trump posted on Twitter Thursday. The roughly five-minute clip shows Pelosi repeatedly ripping up his speech, in between snippets of him paying tribute to the airman, Charles McGee, as well as other guests he had invited to the State of the Union, including military families.
In fact, Pelosi ripped a copy of Trump's speech immediately after his address to Congress on Tuesday.

Girl Trump called 'trapped' attends sought-after school
The Philadelphia fourth-grader singled out by President Trump during his State of the Union address as one of thousands of students "trapped in failing government schools" actually attends a sought-after charter school.
Janiyah Davis and her mother, Stephanie Davis, were seated in the House chamber for the president's prime-time address last week. Trump said Janiyah was one of thousands of students on a waiting list for private school scholarships and urged Congress to pass a federal tax break that would reward donations to those scholarship programs.
In one of several made-for-TV moments, Trump then surprised Janiyah and her mother by announcing that a scholarship had become available. "Your long wait is over," he said. "You will soon be headed to the school of your choice."
The next day, officials said the scholarship was being personally funded by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a strong backer of school choice. But administration officials would not answer any questions about where Janiyah attends school or where she hoped to go.
As it turns out, she attends the popular Math, Science and Technology Community Charter School III, known as MaST III, according to John Swoyer, chief executive of the network that runs the school.
The information was first reported in an account that Stephanie Davis gave to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Justice Dept. reviewing Giuliani's info on Bidens
The Justice Department has begun receiving information obtained by Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, from Ukraine about former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Sunday.
Graham, of South Carolina, who chairs the Judiciary Committee and is a vocal Trump ally, said Attorney General William Barr told him early Sunday morning that the department was “receiving information coming out" of Ukraine delivered by Giuliani.
“He told me that they have created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified," Graham said on CBS's “Face the Nation."
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The department has previously taken steps to distance itself from Giuliani, and in September it said that Barr had “not discussed anything relating to Ukraine" with Giuliani.

Man carrying knife arrested outside of White House
A man carrying a knife was arrested outside of the White House after he told a Secret Service officer that he was there to kill the president, police said.
Roger Hedgpeth, 25, was taken into custody Saturday on a charge of making threats to do bodily harm, the Metropolitan Police Department said.
Hedgpeth allegedly approached a Secret Service officer who was patrolling outside the White House and said he was there to assassinate President Trump and “I have a knife to do it with," according to a police report obtained by the Associated Press.
Police found a 3½-inch knife in a sheath on his left hip, and Hedgpeth had an empty pistol holster on his right hip, the authorities said.
He was brought to a hospital for a mental health evaluation, police said.
Officers also impounded his vehicle.

Fla. man allegedly drove into GOP voter-registration tent
A man was under arrest in Florida after he deliberately drove a van into a tent where voters were being registered by local Republicans, the authorities in Jacksonville said Sunday.
The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office reported via social media that Gregory William Loel Timm, 27, of Jacksonville, had been charged with two counts of aggravated assault on a person 65 or older, one count of criminal mischief, and driving with a suspended license.
The Republican party of Duval­ County said it had set up the tent on Saturday in order to register voters.
The county GOP said via Twitter that six volunteers for President Trump's campaign "were intentionally targeted while registering voters."
Local news media said there were no injuries.
In a tweet, GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said:
“These unprovoked, senseless­ attacks on @realDonaldTrump's supporters need to end."
President Trump retweeted that message and added, “Be careful tough guys who you play with!"
In a statement, the Duval County Democratic Party condemned what it called “this cowardly act of violence."

Texto completo: Wayne County readers couldn’t get enough of Nicholas Sparks last year.
His New York Times best-selling novel “Every Breath” was the most circulated book within the Wayne County and Orrville Public libraries.
The novel — Sparks’ 14th book to hit the No. 1 spot on the best-sellers list — chronicles the fated meeting of two strangers who share a bittersweet romance.
Rounding out the top five circulated list were four other romance/​mystery best-selling novels: “Redemption” by David Baldacci, “Turning Point” by Danielle Steel, “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens and “The First Lady” by James Patterson.
Tanaya Silcox, technical services manager for the Wayne County Public Library — which has libraries in Creston, Dalton, Doylestown, Rittman, Shreve, West Salem and Wooster — noted that most of Sparks’ books have a romance that ends well or in a tragedy.
“People are just drawn to these types of romances,” she said.
She also attributed the popularity of the top five books to the authors having a big following.
“People look for their new releases and if a book is made into a movie, it makes it even more popular,” Silcox said.
Other things that draw readership are “media hype, good reviews and best-selling lists,” she noted.
Orrville Public Library Director Daphne Silchuk-Ashcraft added “an Oprah plug or book club choice” to that list. She has seen a small but steady uptick in the number of patrons utilizing emedia — which she describes as “anything you can read or listen to on a device” — but it only accounts for 9% of all circulated material.
“Traditional books are not going away any time soon,” she said.
While the public libraries were seeing fiction fly off the shelves, at the University of Akron Wayne College, the top five circulated items were a lot more diverse.
They were: “Educated” by Tara Westover, “The Wangs vs. the World” by Jade Chang, “Barron’s GRE” (a college prep test guide), “A Spark of Light” by Jodi Picoult, and a three-way tie for fifth place among “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing” by Marie Kondo, “Happy Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” by J.K. Rowling, and “Little Fires Everywhere” by Celeste Ng.
“Honestly, we traditionally do not cater to pleasure reading at a college library,” library Director Maureen Lerch said. “College students generally don’t have time for it. Our main focus is on curricular support.”
The college library does have a small collection of “popular reading” titles that staff and faculty take advantage of, she said.
Silcox said that what drives non-fiction at the Wayne County Public Library is usually “what’s in the media or news, the latest cookbooks or diet trends and biographies. Notable people’s life stories are always popular.”
When it comes to kids books, the top five circulated books last year were: “Daisy Town” by Rene Goscinny, “The Berenstain Bears and the Excuse Note” by Stan and Jan Berenstain, “The Man from Washington” by Laurent Gerra, “Clifford Gets a Job” by Norman Bridwell, and “The One-Armed Bandit” by Bob de Groot.
While it’s not always crystal clear what drives a book’s popularity, what is clear is that reading is still popular. Adults read an average of 12 books apiece last year, according to Pew Research. Based on Wayne County Public Library statistics, “reading stays pretty steady throughout the year with an increase during the Summer Reading Club and a small dip during the holidays,” Silcox noted.
And libraries are still destination centers, according to a Gallup Poll. In fact, “visiting the library remains the most common cultural activity Americans engaged in” last year, a poll concluded. Adults made nearly 10.5 trips to the library last year.
Silchuk-Ashcraft said that statistic is encouraging. She sees book clubs as a good way to bolster this.
“Book clubs (available at all public libraries and University of Akron Wayne College) offer the opportunity for new friends and new perspectives,” she said. “It also gets readers out of their comfort zone and encourages them to read new genres. Often, we just can’t wait to discuss what we’re reading together.”

Joe Scarborough rebukes media for 'deafening' silence on Snoop Dogg attacks against Gayle King

Texto completo: MSNBC host Joe Scarborough criticized his colleagues in the media for what he viewed as their failure to defend CBS News's Gayle King after Snoop Dogg made threatening remarks directed at her.
The 48-year-old rapper condemned the reporter for asking former WNBA superstar Lisa Leslie about Kobe Bryant's sexual assault settlement after he was killed in a helicopter crash with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others last month. The teased clip of the interview featuring the questioning went viral, with many accusing King of not being sensitive after the former NBA star's death.
The panelists of Morning Joe discussed on Monday's show the profanity-laced tirade in which Snoop Dogg called King a "funky dog-head bitch" and a "punk motherf---er." Scarborough called the media's silence on the issue "deafening." He also called out people "like Katy Perry, who worked with Snoop in the past. People like our dear friend Martha Stewart, who’s working with him now.”
MSNBC's Scarborough rebukes media for 'deafening' silence over Snoop Dogg threatening Gayle King
“It’s time for people to actually speak out. ... Again, let’s just keep this very simple, because it is very simple. A black female journalist asked a tough question in the middle of a wide-ranging interview, and because of that, her life was threatened. ‘We’re coming to get you,’ from a man, it must be remembered, who was arrested for murder,” he added. “'We’re coming to get you’ and the New York Times doesn’t write an editorial about this? The Washington Post doesn’t write an editorial, the Wall Street Journal doesn’t write an editorial about this, nobody talks about this?”
In the video Snoop Dogg posted on social media, he stated in part: "Gayle King, out of pocket for that shit. Way out of pocket. What do you gain from that? ... We expect more from you, Gayle. Don’t you hang out with Oprah [Winfrey]? Why are y'all attacking us? We your people. You ain't come after Harvey Weinstein, asking them dumbass questions. I get sick of y’all."
CBS News President Susan Zirinsky released a statement calling Snoop Dogg's comments "reprehensible."
The rapper posted another video over the weekend, claiming he never meant to threaten King. “I’m a nonviolent person. When I said what I said, I spoke for the people who felt like Gayle was very disrespectful towards Kobe Bryant and his family," he said.

Daily on Energy: Trump budget reflects sensitivity to environmental politics

SOME SIGNS TRUMP IS SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS: President Trump’s fiscal year 2021 budget request cuts funding for the key energy and environmental agencies, but not as severely as previous proposals.
The president is also flip-flopping on storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, by not including money to license the project as it did with past budgets.
The changes may reflect Trump is sensitive to voter perceptions of his handling of environmental issues ahead of the 2020 election (see bad polling for him below). Congress, by bipartisan margins, has blocked Trump’s earlier attempts at funding cuts for environmental and energy agencies, a reflection of their popularity.
But that doesn’t mean the administration is suddenly changing its deregulatory approach or losing its apathy regarding clean energy and climate change programs.
Trump’s new budget calls for $6.7 billion in total funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, a cut of 27% from current funding (Trump proposed a 31% funding cut for EPA in fiscal year 2020, the most of any agency).
The Energy Department would get $35.4 billion, a 8% cut, compared Trump’s call for a 11% decrease in fiscal year 2020.
The Interior Department would also get less money with $12.7 billion in funding, a 16% reduction from current funding.
We’ll know more about the details of the proposed cuts when agencies host press briefings on their budgets this afternoon.

YOUNG VOTERS WANT REPUBLICANS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE: Whether GOP lawmakers do could affect how much youth support they attract this election cycle.
More than half of young right-leaning voters said climate change would sway their vote in 2020, according to new polling released Monday by the American Conservation Coalition, a group of young conservative climate advocates. Even more, 77%, of right-leaning young voters say climate change is important to them.
The numbers are an opportunity to win over young voters, but they also raise the stakes: “Republicans are losing independent voters and young people on this issue. They already knew that,” Benji Backer, the American Conservation Coalition’s president, told Abby. “This polling showcases they are losing the base on this issue, too.”
More on the new survey in Abby’s story published this morning.
TRUMP NOT TRUSTED ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES: A new poll commissioned by the liberal Center for American Progress found a majority of voters disapprove of how Trump is handling environmental issues.
The poll of 1,000 voters, split evenly between supporters of Trump and Hillary Clinton in the last election, revealed that 63% disapprove of how the president handles climate change.
The poll was focused mostly on Trump’s proposed streamlining of the National Environmental Policy Act to build infrastructure faster.
Most of those polled (80%) have never heard of NEPA. However, a majority of them opposed some of the proposed changes, such as narrowing consideration of projects' effects on greenhouse gas emissions and allowing companies or contractors to assume a greater role in preparing their own environmental reviews, rather than relying on the government.
BROUILLETTE: USMCA COULD BOOST COAL EXPORTS: The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade could enable more cooperation in exporting coal to Asia, said Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
We couldn’t get to everything from Brouillette’s address to the Atlantic Council in Friday’s newsletter, but this also caught our eye.
Brouillette said he expects Mexico and Canada to help the U.S. send coal to Asia to get around the blocking of export facilities by Western states like California, Washington, and Oregon.
“That’s why the USMCA was so important,” Brouillette said. “We hope to work more collaboratively with both Mexico and Canada to find export facilities to get the coal [mined] from Wyoming.”
Brouillette later told reporters that he respects the right of Democratic governors to block permits for coal ports, but that “it's not going to prevent the administration from working with our colleagues in Canada or Mexico to look for those types of opportunities.”
GREEN LIGHT FOR SOLAR DESPITE FERC’S PRO-FOSSIL FUEL ORDER: Competitive Power Ventures confirmed Monday it is proceeding with a 150-megawatt solar project, dubbed Maple Hill, in western Pennsylvania.
If you remember, Josh spotlighted Competitive Power Ventures in a recent newsletter, in which the Maryland-based power company described how FERC’s proposed “MOPR” order won’t derail its plans to develop more renewables.
Competitive Power Ventures mostly has natural gas in its portfolio, but the company has plans for “several hundred” megawatts of wind and solar in the coming months, including some in the PJM power market, where FERC is looking raise payments to fossil fuel plants to combat state policies that subsidize renewables and nuclear.
“CPV’s mission of modernizing U.S. power generation means we are making significant investments in renewables and highly efficient, flexible natural gas generation to create the electric grid of the future,” said Sean Finnerty, executive vice president of Competitive Power Ventures.
TEMPERATURE’S RISING...EVEN IN ANTARCTICA: Antarctica just clocked a record-high temperature of 65 degrees.
The measurement was taken last week at the Esperanza Base along the continent’s Trinity Peninsula, according to the Washington Post. The measurement shattered the previous record of 63.5 degrees, which was taken in March 2015, although it still needs to be officially reviewed and certified.
The Antarctic Peninsula is warming faster than many places in the world. In the past 50 years, temperatures there have risen 5 degrees, which scientists attribute to climate change. During that same period, 87% of the glaciers on the peninsula’s west coast have retreated.
DEMOCRATS DEBATE USMCA AND CLIMATE...AGAIN: If you were expecting fresh, new questions on the Democratic candidates’ climate policy positions, Friday night’s debate in New Hampshire didn’t deliver.
The only climate question moderators asked was a rehash of why Bernie Sanders voted against the new North American trade deal while his colleagues — including fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren — supported it.
Sanders has said repeatedly he opposed the trade deal because it wasn’t strong enough on climate. Warren and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar defended their votes for the deal, saying it made improvements on the environment and they’d work to negotiate something better.
Not much new there, but one more interesting tidbit: Joe Biden, in defending his record against newcomer former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said he was the reason the Chinese came to the table on the Paris climate agreement.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT — TRUMP BACKS OFF PROBE OF CALIFORNIA AUTO DEAL: Democrats had said the antitrust investigation was political retaliation against the four automakers siding with California on fuel economy — and a threat to keep other carmakers from joining.
The Justice Department closed its probe into whether those companies had violated federal competition laws, Abby and Josh confirmed Friday.
The White House could have been more confident other carmakers weren’t going to join with California, though. Since that deal was struck in July, several other auto companies, including General Motors, Toyota, and Fiat Chrysler, joined with the Trump administration to defend its move to eliminate California’s ability to set its own, stricter tailpipe greenhouse gas limits.

Texto completo: The White House has identified the Trump administration official behind the anonymous tell-all book and critical New York Times opinion piece about the White House and will part ways with that person, according to former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova.
DiGenova, a lawyer whose work has been caught up in the Ukraine-impeachment controversy, said on Monday that he and his wife, Victoria Toensing, were told by "a senior government official" that "Anonymous" had been identified as an official working in the White House and would be removed "soon."
DiGenova declined to reveal more details in an interview with WMAL’s Mornings on the Mall, but his comments come days after the White House dismissed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an impeachment witness, and his identical twin brother from the National Security Council.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this report. DiGenova declined to comment to the Washington Examiner.
DiGenova has been in the news lately as details emerged about his and Toensing's work with President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to uncover evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden held up to $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine to help his son escape a potential corruption investigation. Trump pressing Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, including the Bidens, was the subject of impeachment, which ended in an acquittal of the president in the Senate last week.
The publicly unknown administration official first made him or herself known in September 2018 when the New York Times published an anonymous opinion piece by a senior member of the Trump administration, explaining that there is an internal "resistance" group of officials working to stymie the president's worst inclinations.
Following the publication of the New York Times piece, a multitude of Trump administration officials denied being the author amid feverish speculation, including Vice President Mike Pence, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump labeled the author "gutless" and questioned whether a "so-called 'senior administration official'" even existed.
"Anonymous" published a book titled A Warning last November.
There were several explosive claims in the book, including one alleging that a group of White House aides put together a tally of Cabinet members who they believed would support the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Another section of the book talks about how a group of senior Trump administration officials considered a "midnight self-massacre" in which they would resign together.

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s presidential campaign is experiencing a last-minute surge ahead of tomorrow's New Hampshire primary election.
Two new polls have the Minnesota Democrat in third place, behind Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg but ahead of both Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. This is a significant and much-needed gain for the self-proclaimed realist, especially after she failed to make her mark in the Iowa caucuses, in part, probably, because the Senate’s impeachment trial kept her tied up in Washington.

Klobuchar has received a fair amount of national attention — the New York Times endorsed her alongside Warren — but enthusiasm for her campaign has been scant. Now, that seems to be changing. Her strong performance in last week’s Democratic primary debate solidified her image as a pragmatist who is willing to make tough calls and even criticize her party's left wing. She’s carried that image into her recent campaign events in New Hampshire, and it seems to be making an impact.

It’s almost as if we’re seeing an entirely different side of Klobuchar. She’s more willing to go on the offensive and call out her Democratic opponents, whereas before, she hesitated to engage in direct attacks. Klobuchar seemed timid before Iowa. Now, she seems confident. “We feel the surge,” she said this week, noting she’s visited New Hampshire more than 23 times since she announced her candidacy last year. “For me, it’s been a long time coming.”

Klobuchar’s newfound self-assurance could have something to do with Biden’s collapse. The former vice president had a disastrous showing in Iowa, and he’s lagging in New Hampshire’s polls, too. The Biden team’s hopes now depend on South Carolina, but even that won’t be enough to revitalize his drowning campaign.

As Biden sinks and Warren founders, it makes sense that Democratic voters are now turning to a female centrist who has branded herself as the bridge between the Democratic Party and the centrists and independents dissatisfied with the Trump administration.

Buttigieg’s message is quite similar, so Klobuchar will need to beat him in New Hampshire if her campaign is going to survive. Given Buttigieg’s Iowa victory, it’s unlikely that Klobuchar can overtake him, but she could do it yet. A Boston Globe poll found that Buttigieg has 19% support, compared to her 14%. She gained 5 points in one day this weekend, so who’s to say she can’t do so again?

The biggest obstacle for Klobuchar will be the lack of fervor for her campaign. Any reporter covering the 2020 campaign will tell you that Sanders’s supporters are truly passionate about his campaign. The same goes for Buttigieg’s and, to a certain extent, Warren’s. The problem with Biden’s campaign was always its inability to replicate this kind of enthusiasm. The voters who consistently support Biden do so for one reason: electability, and, now, even that has been called into question.

Klobuchar faces a similar dilemma. She’s positioned herself as the electable candidate who can bridge the divide, but Biden is evidence that, in today’s Democratic base, that isn’t enough. New Hampshire is Klobuchar’s opportunity to prove voters wrong, and she’s well on her way to doing just that.

Texto completo: Chinese President Xi Jinping was spotted wearing a surgical mask and meeting with patients after an extended public absence amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The 66-year-old Xi visited a number of places around Beijing on Monday, a day after China saw 97 additional deaths from the virus, a single-day record in the country’s health crisis. More than 40,000 people have been infected, and 910 have died from it. Most of the deaths and infections occurred in mainland China, but the coronavirus has spread to the United States and more than two-dozen other countries.
Xi visited a community neighborhood office on Monday where he received a briefing on the work being done to combat the disease. He also was seen having his temperature taken by health workers and mingling with residents, according to the New York Times.
Xi Jinping gets his temperature taken“Let’s not shake hands in this special time,” Xi said to some laughter.
“How much do the vegetables cost?” he asked two people carrying grocery bags.
The Chinese leader also visited a hospital in Beijing where he wore a lab coat and spoke via video chat with hospital officials in Wuhan, the city in which the virus originated and where many of the deaths have occurred.
“Here, on behalf of the Central Party Committee,” Xi said, “I extend my high respect and heartfelt thanks to you and to the medical workers in the fight against the epidemic throughout the country.”
Xi Jinping waves on MondayThe public display was seen as a way for him to project his authority during the outbreak, which is the worst health crisis China has experienced since the 2002-03 SARS outbreak.
Xi has not yet visited Wuhan, but Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Sun Chunlan have. Sun imposed extreme measures during her visit and ordered authorities to go house-to-house and to send the infected to quarantine internment camps.
“Set up a 24-hour duty system. During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever,” she said last Thursday.
Amid fears of a worldwide pandemic, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global public health emergency.

Sherrod Brown plays along after CNN misrepresents his misleading impeachment claim

Texto completo: The host of CNN’s ironically named Reliable Sources misrepresented the content of a recent opinion article by Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, claiming, incorrectly, that it states Republican senators told the Ohio lawmaker in private they voted to acquit President Trump out of fear.

Reliable sources, indeed.

Brown was introduced Sunday on CNN to discuss his recent New York Times op-ed, “In Private, Republicans Admit They Acquitted Trump Out of Fear.” The show’s anchor, Brian Stelter, wanted very much to talk about what the headline alleges, as well as his own chief obsession, Fox News, which he claims kept GOP senators in line during Trump's impeachment trial.

To the first point, Stelter said, “[Brown] wrote an op-ed for the New York Times recently, describing what he says his colleagues across the aisle were saying in private. … So, you’re saying that, in private, some of your colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle did admit to feeling fear, and that’s what motivated their decision to acquit?”

The problem here is this: Brown’s op-ed does not actually say what the headline alleges. You would know that from reading the damn thing. In Brown’s defense, he almost certainly did not write the headline. As anyone who works in the news business will tell you, headlines are seldom written by the article’s author. As for the body of the op-ed itself, it does not actually say anywhere that Republican senators “admit they acquitted Trump out of fear.”

But, rather than set the record straight and say clearly what his op-ed states, Brown opted instead to modify, only slightly, Stelter’s misrepresentation of the article, allowing for the perpetuation of the idea that the Democratic senator has an inside line on what Republican lawmakers are supposedly admitting in private about last week's impeachment vote.

Brown responded: “No politician will ever say they're fearful. … I saw it in their eyes. I saw it in their excuses. I hear what they say about the president's countless numbers of lies. I hear what they say about the president, his demeanor, his character.”

The senator added, “That same fear that I saw in my colleagues in the last month … reminded me of the fear I saw when I voted against the Iraq War as a member of the House almost 20 years ago.”
BS
What a weasel. It is extremely unlikely Brown is unaware that people believe what is alleged in the misleading headline of his op-ed. Yet, here he is on CNN, doing exactly nothing to dispel the bogus narrative.

And, really, the way Brown’s New York Times op-ed reads, it sure sounds like these alleged conversations took place in one form or another.

First, there is the op-ed's headline. Second, there is this passage:
In private, many of my colleagues agree that the president is reckless and unfit. They admit his lies. And they acknowledge what he did was wrong. They know this president has done things Richard Nixon never did. And they know that more damning evidence is likely to come out. So watching the mental contortions they perform to justify their votes is painful to behold: They claim that calling witnesses would have meant a never-ending trial. They tell us they’ve made up their minds, so why would we need new evidence? They say to convict this president now would lead to the impeachment of every future president — as if every president will try to sell our national security to the highest bidder. I have asked some of them, “If the Senate votes to acquit, what will you do to keep this president from getting worse?” Their responses have been shrugs and sheepish looks.
That said, there is one line buried deep, deep in the op-ed, in the second-to-last paragraph, which reads:
They will not say that they are afraid. We all want to think that we always stand up for right and fight against wrong. But history does not look kindly on politicians who cannot fathom a fate worse than losing an upcoming election.
After all of that, it is not until the end of the article that the reader learns that there is nothing to support the headline's claim that GOP senators “admit” they voted “out of fear.” Yet, you would think otherwise, based on the news cycle that Brown’s op-ed sparked.

“GOP Senators Privately Admit Trump Is Unfit For Office, Sherrod Brown Says,” reported HuffPo.

The Week reported, “Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown reveals Republican senators privately admit Trump is 'reckless and unfit.’”

“Democratic Senator Claims Republicans Privately Admit Trump Lies, Acquitted Him out of Fear,” reported the Independent Journal Review.

Compare these headlines to Brown’s weaselly response on Sunday (“I saw it in their eyes”?). It seems increasingly clear the Democratic senator is intentionally misleading people, now. Call it a hunch.

If you can believe it, there was no follow-up question or push for clarification from Stelter, despite the fact that Brown gently contradicted the host’s misreading of the op-ed. Instead, Stelter blew right past the senator's response so that he could ask the Democratic lawmaker about, you guessed it, Fox News.

“Hm,” said the CNN anchor, “people used to say that if Watergate happened and Nixon had Fox that he would have stayed in office. Do you think that is what we all just experienced?”

How? What? Why? You just misrepresented a widely shared, heavily covered, and misleading New York Times op-ed, for which the author offered a mealy-mouthed corrective, and your only reaction is to ask him a hypothetical about Nixon and Fox News?

Again, this is not the behavior of a serious news organization. This is the behavior of an activist group with press credentials.

Tail winds help British Airways flight break record for fastest subsonic trip from New York to London

Texto completo: A British Airways flight broke the record for the fastest subsonic flight between New York to London.
The trip took less than five hours.
At a top speed of 825 mph, the Boeing 747 flew 4 hours and 47 minutes to cross the Atlantic Ocean, landing Sunday morning in London. In the last 30 days, the average flight time for the same route often used by pilots was 6 hours and 13 minutes. Two other flights from Virgin Atlantic also made the trip in under five hours that same night.
British Airways was able to maintain its subsonic flight status despite flying well above the speed of sound, 767 mph, due to a strong tail wind that pushed the aircraft across the Atlantic. Tail winds exceeded 200 mph as the flights followed the jet streak, which is the strongest part of the jet stream.
Tweet
“It’s just astounding that they got there so quick,” Jay Spenser, a museum curator at the National Air and Space Museum, told the New York Times. The previous record was held by a Norwegian Air flight that made the subsonic trip in 5 hours and 13 minutes.
The strong tail winds were attributed to a hurricane near the United Kingdom that grounded many flights in the area earlier in the day. On the ground, parts of the nation faced damaging winds and severe flooding because of the storm.
Chip Garner, a spokesman for British Airlines, said the flight was safe despite the stormy conditions on the ground. He said, “We always prioritize safety over speed records, but our highly trained pilots made the most of the conditions to get customers back to London well ahead of time.”
The British Airlines flight was able to carry 400 passengers on the same amount of fuel as the 100-passenger Concorde, a retired line of supersonic aircrafts that could cross the Atlantic in three and a half hours, due to the boost from Mother Nature. The airline said passengers were largely unaware of the speed of the flight until the descent into London began well ahead of schedule.
While passengers from New York to London zoomed to their destination, those headed from London to New York were not so lucky. Strong head winds added an hour and 49 minutes to the flight.

Nicholas Kristof: Part of America is still ignored under Trump

Texto completo: President Donald Trump declared in his State of the Union address that “our economy is the best it has ever been.”
Put aside the Trumpian hyperbole, and it’s true that the economy is strong — and that this is critical to Trump’s chances for reelection. The Obama recovery has continued under Trump, with the stock market surging and corporate profits swelling. Just last month, employers added 225,000 jobs.
Private wealth owned by U.S. households and nonprofits has soared just since 2000 by the equivalent of more than $800,000 per household, according to Federal Reserve data. Wow! I feel richer already.
Yet we live in two Americas, and there’s another side of the country that Trump didn’t mention — one that helped elect him but that he has neglected since. In the other America, suicide rates are at a record high in the post-World War II era, and more Americans die every two weeks from drugs, alcohol and suicide — “deaths of despair” — than died in 18 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.
These deaths are symptoms of a larger economic malaise for working-class Americans that predates Trump. It’s not his fault, but neither has he tried seriously to address it; in some ways, especially in health care, he has worsened it.
Important new research finds that 20 million Americans, particularly those with low levels of education, describe all 30 of the last 30 days as “bad mental health days.”
“These men and women report in effect that every day of life is a bad day,” said David G. Blanchflower, a Dartmouth economist who conducted the research. Blanchflower noted that self-reported happiness in America has continued to fall.
Low-income Americans also report levels of physical pain impairing their lives that are higher than reported by wealthier Americans, and far higher than in other advanced countries. One-third of Americans say that they have been in pain “often” or “very often” in the last four weeks.
Some of the pain probably results from a lack of universal health care. Millions of Americans endure constant toothaches in a way that doesn’t happen in our peer countries.
In effect, we have a bifurcated economy, marked by prosperity for millions of Americans and by a Social Great Depression for millions of others.
It’s strange to make a comparison to the Great Depression, for output is surging. But consider the effect on mortality: Even during the Great Depression, life expectancy rose strongly, while in three of the last four years it fell because of deaths of despair.
We’re used to thinking of a depression as geographic, but this one is demographic. Working-class Americans, often defined as those without a college degree, are caught in a dust bowl.
“The crisis is almost invisible for those with a college degree,” noted Anne Case, a Princeton economist who is an author, with her husband, fellow economist Angus Deaton, of an excellent book coming out this spring about deaths of despair.
It is these working-class Americans, white and black alike, who have seen earnings collapse, family structure disintegrate and mortality climb. These Americans are earning less on average, adjusted for inflation, than their counterparts back in the 1970s.
“Our story of deaths of despair is essentially a long-run account of destruction of the working class,” Deaton said.
In the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt worked hard to address the Depression with the New Deal. This time, Trump in some ways has exacerbated the pain — such as by chipping away at access to health care. Some 400,000 children have lost health insurance under Trump.
It’s true that unemployment has dropped and that workers at the bottom are enjoying some of the largest wage gains, a pattern that is drawing some people back into the labor force. That’s significant and welcome (albeit the wage gains result partly from local increases in the minimum wage and the economic strength partly from trillion-dollar deficits). But Case says that even so, almost half of Americans age 25 and over with only a high school diploma are no longer in the labor force.
Meanwhile, the central fact of America today is not its economic vigor but its profound inequity.
I noted that private wealth has increased by $800,000 per household. It’s similarly true that whenever Jeff Bezos walks into a room, average wealth there shoots up so that each person becomes, on average, a billionaire.
Interesting but not very meaningful.
—
Last week, I told how U.S. Bank had fired two employees who had used $20 of their own money to help a stranded customer. Within hours of the column going online, I received a call from the bank’s CEO, Andrew Cecere, who previously wouldn’t return my calls, apologizing and saying that he would correct the situation.
Here’s an update. Abigail Gilbert, the manager who was fired, confirms that she will return to her old job. Cecere says the bank is talking with Emily James, the other fired worker, about a job with more responsibility and higher pay; she is also discussing jobs with other companies.
This all sounds promising, but indignant columns are not a scalable solution to the problem of labor injustices.

Texto completo: A Republican friend of mine rolled his eyes (and maybe even licked his chops) at the possibility that Democrats would nominate Bernie Sanders.
“Have they learned nothing from Jeremy Corbyn?” he asked.
“Maybe not,” I acknowledged. “But they’ve learned a lot from Donald Trump.”
Corbyn, of course, led the Labour Party in Britain to a whopping defeat by Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. He lost for many reasons, but his leftist politics were in the mix. He calls himself, well, a democratic socialist.
I needn’t provide such a primer on Trump. But I should point out that while he didn’t initially command broad support within his party, the backers he did have were loud and proud to the point of fanaticism (and remain so).
He promised to explode the status quo. He and his followers practiced (and aced) absolutism: You stood with or against them — there was no squishy in between — and America could be sorted neatly into villains and victims. He dispensed with the usual political etiquette, chafed against the ill-fitting political party in which he’d garbed his ambitions, and insisted that the system was rigged.
Sound like any senator from Vermont you know?
You can analyze Sanders and assess his prospects in terms of how liberal many of his positions are: the end of private health insurance, the dismantling of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, free tuition at public colleges regardless of a student’s economic circumstances. By that yardstick he’s Corbyn, and, in my view, a hell of a general-election risk.
Or you can focus on his irascibility, his grandiosity and the bellicosity of his believers. Through this lens he’s Trump. And what better way to topple the current president than with his ideologically inverted alter ego?
That’s a theory of the case — fight fury with fury, one messiah with another — that I hear frequently as Sanders cements his front-runner status in the Democratic primary and as Democrats, desperate to defeat Trump, wrestle with the wisdom or folly of giving Sanders that assignment.
He essentially tied Pete Buttigieg in the Iowa caucuses and is slightly favored to win the primary Tuesday in New Hampshire, where he trounced Hillary Clinton four years ago. He leads Buttigieg by significant margins in polls in the two states, Nevada and then South Carolina, that follow it. Meanwhile, it’s hard to see how Elizabeth Warren pulls ahead of him, and Joe Biden is struggling to overcome a humiliating fourth-place finish in Iowa. That makes Sanders as strong a bet as any other candidate to nab the nomination.
The reasons for his success include his similarities to Trump, but don’t get me wrong: There’s no alignment of agendas among the two of them, no common set of political values and no moral equivalence — not remotely. I’ve read too much journalism that comes too close to suggesting that they’re versions of the same old white guy and have the same sloppiness with facts, talent for bullying and instinct for demagogy. Trump is a tyrant all his own.
But Sanders is a populist of the left as surely as Trump is a populist of the right, with a familiar distaste for compromise and a comparable appeal to Americans disgusted by politics as usual.
He, like Trump, breaks the mold and defies the laws of political gravity: He had a heart attack last fall, at the age of 78, and it didn’t scare away voters or slow his stride. While Trump claims leadership of “a movement the likes of which the world has never seen,” Sanders spearheads a “revolution,” to be brought about by “the most unprecedented campaign in the modern history of this country.” And aspects of his pitch — on trade, for example — resonate with the blue-collar workers in the Rust Belt who were important to Trump’s election. While some of Trump’s advisers believe that Sanders would be an easily caricatured foil, others believe that he could be trouble.
Look closely and you see the spirit and lessons of Trump all over the Democratic primary and the Democratic Party. You see it in the Biden campaign’s questioning of the legitimacy of the Iowa results days before The Times discovered and reported on specific irregularities. You see it in Mike Bloomberg’s merciless trolling of Trump with commercials that make him look fat and unhinged, and statements that would be shockingly juvenile but for their mimicry of Trump’s taunts. Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg’s campaign, recently called the president “a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.”
You see it Nancy Pelosi’s theatrical ripping up of her copy of Trump’s State of the Union address. And you see it in the dive bar in Iowa where, on the eve of the caucuses, one Sanders supporter led others in a crude call-and-response, as recounted by Shawn McCreesh in Rolling Stone. The supporter would say the F word, and everyone would answer “Biden!” or “Warren!” or such.
Is this the rowdy road to a Democratic victory in November 2020? My brain and gut both say no, and those who think so — and who designate Sanders as the one to lead the stampede — overlook several dynamics, starting with policy. Polling shows that most Americans dislike a “Medicare for all” plan that eliminates private insurance, as Sanders’ signature proposal does. Polling also shows that most Americans wouldn’t want that plan to cover immigrants without legal status. Sanders’ covers them.
And Trump is already testing his attack on that front. “If you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens,” he said in the address that Pelosi shredded. He also vowed that he would “never let socialism destroy American health care.”
The idea that Sanders would be the strongest nominee is challenged by the most recent midterms, when the candidates who helped the Democrats gain 40 seats in the House and recapture control of it weren’t ideologically pure soldiers of the revolution. They struck less militant, more nuanced notes, as veteran Democratic strategist James Carville observed a few days ago in a lament about Sanders’ rise.
He told Vox’s Sean Illing that in 2018, “we did great: We talked about everything we needed to talk about and we won. And now it’s like we’re losing our damn minds.” On MSNBC he said he was “scared to death” that Democrats would blow the 2020 election.
Turnout in the Iowa caucuses was hardly reassuring. It appears that about 170,000 Iowans participated — considerably fewer than in 2008, when 240,000 people took part. That contradicts Sanders’ and his followers’ contention that his candidacy would rouse legions of dormant and first-time voters.
As for the argument that Hillary Clinton’s defeat proves the inefficacy of an establishment or center-left nominee, well, Clinton won the popular vote by about 3 million ballots and lost the Electoral College by only about 77,000, despite Russia, despite James Comey, despite a relentless focus on her emails and despite her own uniquely heavy political baggage. Subtract all of that and you get a winner — a winner who looks nothing like Bernie Sanders.
But when you go back exactly four years ago, you’re also reminded that Trump was causing utter panic among his party’s standard-bearers, who were convinced that nominating him would be akin to forfeiting the election. He was too idiosyncratic, too provocative — too much. Any responsible political analyst could see it. And almost every responsible political analyst saw it wrong.

Steve Israel: How the Never Trumpers fell in line

Texto completo: During my 16 years in Congress, from 2001 to 2017, I worked closely with Republicans in the House and, occasionally, in the Senate. Still, as I watched my former colleagues defend the president during his impeachment trial, I was struck by the same question that baffles many: Why didn’t more Republican senators convict President Trump, or at least allow additional witnesses in his impeachment trial? My conversations with lawmakers, and my own experiences in Congress, offer up a theory.
Republican members of Congress broadly fall into two types: those who, on principle, have always supported the president, and those who, fearing electoral consequences, have rationalized their decision to stick with him.
When I think of this second type, I remember a House Republican who once told me he thought Donald Trump would destroy his party. Then, in the summer of 2016, I ran into him at an airport. He told me he’d just received the results of a poll.
“Who do you think is the most popular candidate in my district?” he asked.
“You?” I responded. (Congressional protocol requires consistent flattery.)
“Nope. Donald Trump.”
And so he began to shift his position. At first, he dipped in a toe, declining to criticize Mr. Trump when given the chance. Then, when he saw dissenting Republicans defeated in primaries or humiliated in tweets, he waded in deeper, publicly coming to Mr. Trump’s defense. Now, he’s undergone a baptism. When I recently asked him about Mr. Trump’s behavior, he told me about the strength of the economy, the reduction in taxes and regulation, and the danger of extremist Democrats.
How did he go from “Never Trump” to “never allow a witness who might implicate Trump”?
He’s part of a growing wing of the Republican Party: the rationalizers.
I’m familiar with political rationalization — I watched and even practiced it during my time in Congress. Like erosion, political rationalization is incremental, shaped by harsh winds and climates over a period of time. It usually begins when a small issue meets a larger electoral consequence. Constituents push you to vote “yes” when you want to vote “no,” so you rationalize: “I’ll wait for someone else to put it over the top, then my ‘yes’ vote won’t mean as much.” Or: “I’ll vote yes, but the Senate will defeat it. Or the president won’t sign it. Or if it does become law, well, there’s always the Supreme Court.”
Pressured by re-election, you make a tiny, inconsequential concession on a specific issue or vote. Nothing more than a small chip off your principles.
Early in my career, I had my own moment of rationalization. In 2001, only six months after being sworn into the House of Representatives, President George W. Bush proposed significant tax cuts. I was deeply concerned about their impact on the debt, but my polling showed that voting against lower taxes in my Republican-leaning districts was politically fatal. So I rationalized: “This will be the last tax cut I support” (it wasn’t); “the deficits will be offset” (they weren’t); “by voting with Republicans on this, it gives me more credibility to vote against them on other issues” (actually, in that case, it did).
An occasional concession does no harm to democracy. But when justifying compromises becomes an operating system — when each day, politicians contort their views to fit the politically popular, as ordained by the president — our representatives become unrecognizable. They transform from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde — or 2016 Lindsey Graham to 2020 Lindsey Graham.
The pull to rationalize is made stronger by the fact that the president doesn’t allow for nuance in the Republican ranks. You’re either with or against him. Several Republicans have told me the story of Representative Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, who announced in September that he was not running for re-election.
Two months later, he was asked on ABC News about Mr. Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president. Included in his otherwise fulsome defense of the president was this: “I believe it was inappropriate. I do not believe it was impeachable.” Hours later, Mr. Trump tweeted: “Republicans, don’t be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable. No, it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!”
Message received: If your support of President Trump isn’t complete and unequivocal, he will go after you in a viral tweet.
As Republicans flock behind the president, they start to believe his exaggerations and misinformation. Soon, an initial concession of a few inches widens to an inescapable partisan trench. What was once an adopted position — a line pushed by the president — becomes a tribal truth. It’s the Ukrainians who meddled not the Russians. Separating children from parents and putting them in detention centers is an exaggerated liberal narrative. The real problem isn’t President Trump, it’s Hunter Biden. There’s no more dancing around these issues; now they stomp in unison.
Pragmatism, compromise and even ideological agility have always been part of politics. But what is happening now is dangerous. The rationalizers aren’t just turning against their own principles; many are turning against fundamental norms of democracy. The constant rationalization has made them unrecognizable. Unlike the Republicans who were Trumpian even before Donald Trump, the rationalizers have forgotten that what they now believe they once made up.
So they will stick with Mr. Trump. No matter how damning the facts or clear the evidence, they will defend him.
For so many of them, the loyalty is, well, quite rational.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Lesser has a way with hard topics that helps me lean into them a bit easier. I’ve revisited her 2004 book, “Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow,” multiple times and was correct in assuming her 2016 book, “Marrow: Love, Loss & What Matters Most,” would deliver the same emotional depth. It’s the story of Lesser and her sister, Maggie, who needs a bone marrow transplant. Elizabeth is a perfect match, and the two embark on a journey to heal their relationship at the same time Elizabeth’s marrow attempts to heal her sister’s body.

Stephens: Courage and patriotism in Mitt Romney’s lonely vote

Texto completo: To honor the memory of Kirk Douglas, who died this past week at 103, I watched “Lonely Are the Brave” Thursday night. The 1962 classic is about a 20th century cowboy at mortal odds with modern life — a roaming spirit who won’t be stopped by wire fences, prison bars, search helicopters or sadistic lawmen.
The men and women in the film are short on talk but strong in character. In other words, the exact opposite of our politicians today.
It was good to see “Lonely Are the Brave” at a moment when the closest Washington had to the film’s hero was Mitt Romney, who, alone among Republicans, voted to convict and remove President Donald Trump from office for abuse of power.
Mitt?
Was this the same man who denounced Trump as a “con man” in March 2016 and then auditioned to be his secretary of state that November? Who, as governor of Massachusetts, pioneered a version of Obamacare in 2006 only to denounce Obamacare when he ran for president in 2012? Who by turns has called himself a “progressive” and “moderate” Republican, as well as a “severely conservative” one?
One and the same. Yet the senator from Utah finally seems to have found the hill he’s willing to die on. It’s courage that demands respect.
I’ve been reading and rereading Romney’s moving and masterly Senate floor speech Wednesday, in which he explained his vote. “I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial,” he said in his peroration. “They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong, grievously wrong.”
The central theme of Romney’s address is obligation: the things to which we are bound, and those to which we are not. Romney says, and clearly believes, that he is bound by the Constitution, his oath to God, the evidence, his conscience and the judgment of history.
What doesn’t bind him: loyalty to president and party, the opinions of his constituents, the need to “stand with the team” or — most specious of all — the idea that, whatever the facts, the Senate is obliged to acquit Trump so that voters can render their own verdict in November.
Yet there is no constitutional case to leave to voters decisions that belong only to Congress — the dark road Mitch McConnell went down when he denied Merrick Garland a confirmation hearing in 2016, on the theory that “the American people” should choose Antonin Scalia’s replacement. The whole concept of small-r republicanism rests on the idea that self-government works only when public opinion is filtered through multiple institutions and wiser heads, not merely flushed through Congress like sewage in a drain.
Conservatives used to believe this, just as they used to believe that the branches of government were coequal; that political dirty tricks should never be normalized; that embattled allies must not be enlisted in such tricks; that, as Judge Laurence Silberman once said, “The most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage is to use its law enforcement machinery for political ends”; that innocence isn’t established by the failure to get away with the intended crime; and that acquittal isn’t vindication. Among the things now permanently lost to Republicans amid their supposed victory in the impeachment saga is the hope of having a leg to stand on when, in the fullness of time, a future Democratic president behaves toward them exactly the way Trump behaved last year.
Also lost: that once deeply held American ideal that the person who says “no” when everyone else says “yes” (or vice versa) doesn’t defy democracy but ennobles it. The right-wing vituperations descending on Romney, directed by the president and amplified through his media minions, are no better than the left’s cancel-culture warriors, seeking to wreck the lives of anyone who falls short of expectations or doesn’t toe the ideological line.
To his credit, Romney knew this would come: Like Kirk Douglas’ cowboy in “Lonely Are the Brave,” nobody breaks out of prison, physical or ideological, without expecting a posse. “I’m sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,” Romney predicted, knowing that Trump never disappoints the meanest expectations.
But even Romney’s bitterest critics, left and right, ought to give him this: He voted without regard for personal advantage, without fear of partisan obloquy and without an eye on the easy way out — all for the sake of his own self-respect.
The country would be a better place today if more people in positions of authority acted similarly.
A line frequently (if probably erroneously) attributed to Andrew Jackson is that “one man with courage makes a majority.” What happened in the Senate this past week shows how wrong that line usually is. But if Mitt Romney’s lonely vote proves anything, it’s that political courage makes a patriot.

Texto completo: In what was either coincidental or providential, right after a pair of senators showed admirable political courage, Caroline Kennedy, the former US ambassador to Japan, sent out a mass e-mail, soliciting nominations for the Profile in Courage award given in memory of her father, the murdered president John F. Kennedy.
The e-mail arrived the same day I had written, only half-jokingly, that if Mitt Romney had done anything by becoming the first senator is history to vote to convict an impeached president of his own party, he had made it easy for the Profile in Courage judges.
In response, I heard from many readers who received the same e-mail, readers who lauded both Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Utah Republican, and Doug Jones, the Democrat from Alabama.
Some suggested Jones showed even more courage than Romney, as Jones has to face voters in a deeply red state next fall. Some pundits believe Jones, who barely won a special election in 2018 against a Bible-thumping Republican who had been credibly accused of sexual misconduct, cost himself his reelection by voting to convict Trump while representing a state which is second only to Wyoming in its approval of Trump.
But it seems to go against the spirit of what Romney and Jones did to try to ascribe a hierarchy of virtue. Both men knew they would be inviting a boatload of scorn, and both men followed their consciences anyway.
Romney certainly knew what he was in for.
“I am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced," Romney said on the Senate floor. “I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?"
Romney had to wait only a few hours to hear that “abuse from the president" — first in tweets (what else?), then a day later at the National Prayer Breakfast, where all those good Christians listened to the president say, “I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong."
Later, during an impromptu session with his supporters in the East Room of the White House, Trump went on a rant and was more specific about Romney, questioning the senator's Mormon faith and suggesting Romney used his faith as a “crutch."
Clearly, as Senator Susan Collins of Maine had predicted, Trump has learned a lesson. But it was not the lesson Collins had imagined. Instead it was a lesson he learned from the execrable Roy Cohn, who holds the dubious distinction of having worked for both Trump and Senator Joseph McCarthy: attack, and never apologize.
Charlie Pierce, formerly of this newspaper, now of Esquire, put Jones's political courage into an important historical and human context. As a prosecutor, Jones won convictions against the racists who blew up the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four schoolgirls.
“What did people expect?" Pierce wrote. “That Doug Jones would be afraid? That a guy who faced down the Klan ... would shrink from his constitutional duty in the face of some angry tweets and the possible loss of his Senate seat?"
Doug Jones talked, poignantly, about that case the last time he was at the Kennedy Library. I hope he gets to talk about it again, later this year, if he and Mitt Romney take the stage together, as they should, admirable symbols of bipartisan decency in an ugly era of hyperpartisan stone-throwing.
There's plenty of room on the stage in the library on Columbia Point. In fact, there's so much room they could easily fit another with Jones and Romney if the judges so decide. But, then, Susan Collins played it safe and cut what is, for her, by now a familiar profile. It is not one of courage.
Now the only judges she has to worry about are the voters in Maine.

Texto completo: The Philadelphia Museum of Art has selected a New York-based consulting firm, VallotKarp, to conduct an assessment of the museum's workplace environment, according to an email sent to all staff members late Friday afternoon.
Leslie Anne Miller, chair of the museum's board of trustees, said in the email that the firm was selected based on its "experience with issues of equity, access, diversity and inclusion; experience working with organizations facing challenges similar to our own; the ability to begin immediately and to pursue an accelerated schedule; and a lack of previous engagement with the museum or other potential conflicts of interest."
VallotKarp will be assessing the Art Museum following a New York Times article last month that reported a former museum manager, Joshua Helmer, 31, entered into relationships with women at the museum who were subordinate to him in rank while dangling possibilities for professional advancement.
Helmer left the museum in 2018 and subsequently was named director of the Erie Art Museum; he departed that museum following the report in the Times. Reached Friday evening, Helmer's lawyer, Paul John Susko, said of his client: "His separation from the PMA did not involve any sexual harassment in the workplace."
Miller was not immediately available to comment on the selection, according to a museum spokesman. Calls to Angela Vallot, a principal in the management firm, were referred to the museum.
Vallot and Mitchell Karp are scheduled to meet with the staff of the museum on the morning of Feb. 21.
In her email, Miller said VallotKarp have been charged with "prioritizing staff involvement" and will be helping initially to form "a staff advisory group." That group will hammer out just how the staff will be engaged in the assessment.
It was unclear whether the assessment would examine what actually happened in the Helmer situation or whether it will gather information about unrelated past instances of possible discrimination or gender manipulation - to provide a kind of baseline for future assessment.
On its website, VallotKarp describes itself as "a boutique management consulting firm that focuses on creating inclusive environments where people can work together more effectively."
The website goes on to say that the firm provides "a broad range of services to corporations, law firms and other organizations on issues relating to diversity and inclusion, cultural competence, mentoring/sponsorship, gender dynamics and conflict resolution."
Miller said VallotKarp has conducted "cultural assessments" and led "staff engagement" at many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On its website, the firm touts its work with a wide variety of corporate entities, including media giant Viacom and legal titan Skadden.
A precise timeline following the Feb. 21 all-staff meeting has not been established, but museum officials have said in the past that they want to move forward as quickly as possible.

Unique Illinois law leads to $550M Facebook deal

Texto completo: BY KATHLEEN FOODY
The Associated Press
CHICAGO - Adam Pezen, Carlo Licata and Nimesh Patel are among millions of people who have been tagged in Facebook photos at some point in the past decade, sometimes at the suggestion of an automated tagging feature powered by facial recognition technology.
It was their Illinois addresses, though, that put the trio's names atop a lawsuit that Facebook recently agreed to settle for $550 million, which could lead to payouts of a couple hundred dollars to several million Illinois users of the social networking site.
The lawsuit - one of more than 400 filed against tech companies big and small in the past five years, by one law firm's count - alleges that Facebook broke Illinois' strict biometric privacy law that allows people to sue companies that fail to get consent before harvesting consumers' data, including through facial and fingerprint scanning. Privacy advocates hail the law as the nation's strongest form of protection in the commercial use of such data, and it has survived ongoing efforts by the tech industry and other businesses to weaken it.
Attorneys who focus on privacy law predict that the Facebook settlement - if approved by a federal judge - will trigger a new round of lawsuits and make the targets of existing ones more likely to settle. Illinois' legal landscape also could shape debates over privacy protection in other states and in Congress, particularly about whether individuals should have the right to sue over violations.
"We're going to see a lot of constituents saying, 'Why not me?'" said Jay Edelson, a Chicago attorney whose firm first sued Facebook for allegedly breaking Illinois' law. "This settlement, it's going to really make the point that having laws on the books is the difference between people getting to go to court and getting real relief, and otherwise just getting trampled by these tech companies."
Although the buying and selling of consumer data has become a multi-billion-dollar industry, Illinois' law - the Biometric Information Privacy Act - predates even Facebook's iconic "like" feature and was a reaction to a single company's flop.
Pay By Touch, a startup that teamed with grocery stores to offer fingerprint-based payments, had gone bankrupt and was expected to auction off its assets, including its database of users' information. Worried about where that user data would wind up, Illinois lawmakers quickly passed a law in 2008 requiring companies to get consent before collecting biometric information and to create a policy specifying how that information will be retained and when it will be destroyed.
It also gave Illinois residents the right to sue for $1,000 over negligent violations and $5,000 for intentional violations.
For years, "literally nothing happened," said John Fitzgerald, a Chicago attorney and author of a book on the law that is due out this year. He couldn't find any record of a case filed before 2015.
Edelson's firm and others that focus on class-action suits were first, accusing Facebook of failing to meet Illinois' standard in multiple lawsuits filed in 2015. The three Illinois men fronting the class-action suit against Facebook said they were never told that the site's photo tagging system used facial recognition technology to analyze photos then create and store "face templates."
A federal judge later grouped the cases together as a class-action on behalf of Illinois Facebook users who were among the stored face templates as of June 7, 2011.
Facebook only changed the technology last year. The tag suggestion tool was replaced a broader facial recognition setting, which is turned off by default.
The Illinois law is the basis for two recent suits filed against Clearview AI, a facial recognition company that harvests images by scraping social media sites and other places and then sells access to its database to law enforcement agencies.
Facebook, Twitter, Venmo and YouTube have all demanded that Clearview stop harvesting their users' images following investigative reports by The New York Times and Buzzfeed.
Although there are Illinois lawsuits against other major tech companies, including Google, Snapchat and Shutterfly, the vast majority of the cases are filed on behalf of employees who were directed to use fingerprint scanning systems to track their work hours and who accuse employers or the systems' creators of failing to get their prior consent.
Illinois is one of three states that have laws governing the use of biometric data. But the other two, Texas and Washington, don't permit individual lawsuits, instead delegating enforcement to their attorneys general.
The state's Chamber of Commerce and tech industry groups have backed amendments to gut Illinois' allowance of individual lawsuits or exempt time-keeping systems.
Illinois' law puts "litigation over innovation," said Tyler Diers, the Illinois and Midwest executive director of the industry group TechNet, whose members include Apple, Facebook and Google.
"This case exemplifies why consumer privacy law should empower state regulators to enforce rather than line the pockets of class action attorneys," Diers said in a statement.
Facing Illinois' law, some companies opt out of the state. Sony, for instance, refuses to sell its "aibo" robot dog to Illinois residents and says the device's ability to behave differently toward individual people depends on facial recognition technology.
Backers of the law argue that it's not difficult to comply - simply tell consumers you plan to use biometric data and get their consent.
State Rep. Ann Williams, a Chicago Democrat, said the ability to sue is critical for consumers facing global companies that make billions of dollars per year.
"If the penalty's only a fine, that's the cost of doing business for them," Williams said. "A settlement like (the Facebook case), we're talking about real money that will go to consumers."
People eligible for the settlement will be contacted directly and don't need to take any action until then, attorneys on the case said.

Klobuchar surges in N.H., shaking up race

Texto completo: EXETER, N.H. — Senator Amy Klobuchar has spent much of the 2020 primary race mentioned as an add-on, one of those “also-running" candidates milling below the top tier.
Well, she sure isn't milling in obscurity any more.
“As you probably heard, we're on a bit of a surge," Klobuchar told a cheering crowd of about 550 people who packed Exeter Town Hall for her Monday afternoon rally.
The latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk University poll showed the Minnesota Democrat moving into third place, with 14 percent, ahead of former vice president Joe Biden, the once-presumptive front-runner for the nomination, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who at one time topped the polls here. On Monday morning, Klobuchar announced that her campaign has raised more than $3 million in small online donations since Friday's debate.
At her Monday events with voters, she touted her endorsements from various New Hampshire newspapers and The New York Times endorsement she shared with Warren.
Suddenly, she appeared to be grasping the elusive “momentum'' the day before the primary, and members of the media crammed into her speaking events and rallies across New Hampshire, on the eve of the nation's first primary election, even as many New Hampshire voters said they remain undecided. Klobuchar tried to draw them in with her centrist appeal, pledging in Exeter to take the opposite tack of President Trump, to “unite rather than incite."
“When you think about the words that define Donald Trump's political book, it's divide and demoralize, where mine is unite and lead," Klobuchar told the crowd.
Her pitch persuaded Doke Collins, 57, a Portsmouth woman who emigrated from Holland in the 1990s and who liked what Klobuchar had to say about welcoming immigrants. She'll be voting for only the second time in a presidential election.
“She's very knowledgeable. She has a great background, experience," Collins said. “She's strong. She won't be shaken up."
Klobuchar's rise could spell disaster for both Warren and Biden, both of whom could be seriously wounded if beaten Tuesday by a candidate who was barely on the map just a few weeks ago.
Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and veteran campaign manager, said Klobuchar placing ahead of Warren in New Hampshire “would finish Warren's candidacy off."
If Warren is losing support among progressives to Sanders, which Trippi said clearly seems to be the case, and then loses her status as the top woman in the race, it doesn't necessarily make Klobuchar a real contender for the nomination “but it could be a real problem for Warren going forward. Where, moving forward, can you turn it around?"
In an interview with the Globe on Sunday, Klobuchar said she didn't know whose voters were switching to support her, but from what she's hearing anecdotally, she believes her debate performance Friday caught voters' attention.
“A lot of independents are getting sick and tired of Donald Trump, and those are the exact people we need to win," she said.
Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire in the 2016 general election by only about 2,700 votes, so Granite State voters “are very aware of the politics of this and what it would mean to have someone heading up a ticket that can actually bring those people in," Klobuchar said.
That's the heart of Klobuchar's message to voters here: She is less extreme than candidates such as Warren and Bernie Sanders and says can attract a wide array of voters, including moderates, independents, and even some who voted for Trump in 2016. She likes to say she “has the receipts," pointing to her record of strong wins in bright red parts of Minnesota and how she helped down-ticket Democrats win there, too.
She noted that she has won three times in the district of conservative former congresswoman Michele Bachmann and said she has won every race she's run since the fourth grade. “I have always told people that if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me."
On Monday afternoon, she addressed a meeting of the Nashua Rotary Club where more than 100 Rotarians — many of them Republicans — filled a Nashua Country Club ballroom, and she tried to make the case that she could build bridges that Trump has destroyed.
“I truly believe that what unites us is bigger than what divides us," she said. "My campaign has always been about reaching out and not shutting people out but bringing them with me. That starts actually with a competitive agenda for this country.“
Still not everyone was sold. Some New Hampshire voters remained undecided, less than 24 hours before the polls would close.
“She was very impressive, very articulate. Very competent but not blowing me away," said Carol Farmer, 80, of Nashua, a Republican who refuses to vote to reelect Trump, finding him “dangerous."
Asked about news reports that Trump's reelection campaign plans to work to flip her home state to his column in November, Klobuchar suggested Democrats should be worried about that prospect before pointing to a poll from her home state paper that showed her doing best of all the Democratic contenders in a hypothetical matchup with Trump.
“I just think that if history here is any instruction, you look at who won these races in harder states," she said. She said she has “excelled" in tough areas such as suburban districts “while still having the highest voter turnout in the country, which means a huge urban turnout that supported me."
As for what a “victory" in New Hampshire would look like for her, Klobuchar said it would be exceeding expectations like she did in Iowa.
“We are clearly surging, no one can doubt that, since the debate," she said. “We don't know where this is going to end up, but all I know is I'm not going to be chained to my Senate desk" during impeachment proceedings as she was in the run-up to Iowa. “I'm going to be able to go everywhere."

Texto completo: Ann Tedesco of Hazleton passed away peacefully early Saturday morning at Manor of St. Luke Village, Hazleton, with her loving sons at her bedside.
Born and raised in Hazleton, she was the daughter of the late Salvadore and Mary (Joseph) Correll and a life resident of the area.
Ann was a 1940 graduate of Hazleton High School. Upon graduation, she was a sewing machine operator in the local garment industry until her marriage in 1947 to the love of her life, Frank (Kelly) Tedesco.
After marriage, Kelly and Ann started their family and Ann became a homemaker. Although typical for the era, she was an exceptional wife and mother, raising her sons on homemade dinners and catering to their every need. Anyone who knew her sons knew she was the star in their eyes and that’s all that ever mattered to her.
Growing up in a home where music was always played, she continued that tradition filling her own home from dusk to dawn with classical and jazz music and her favorite artist, Frank Sinatra.
Ann’s favorite pastimes were doing The New York Times crossword puzzles and discussing politics. She was a passionate and proud Democrat and defended her party’s beliefs.
Having devout faith, Ann was a life member of Queen of Heaven Parish at Our Lady of Grace Church.
Although Ann’s family grieves her loss, they know it was time for Ann to join her husband, son and siblings in heaven and will remember her in a way that honors her spirit.
Preceding in death was her husband, Frank (Kelly) Tedesco, in 1982; son, Frank L. Tedesco, in 2013; brothers, Michael, Samuel and Neil Correll; and sisters, Jenny Matuella, Rose Delese and Grace Hamershock.
Surviving are her loving and devoted sons, Larry Tedesco and Mary Therese Tedesco, Allentown; Dennis Tedesco, primary caregiver for many years, Hazleton; Don Tedesco and Therese Tedesco, Hazleton; and daughter-in-law, Mary Beth Tedesco, Conyngham. Also surviving are “Mom Moms” cherished grandchildren, Rebecca L. DeHaven, Jennifer A. Surmick, Frank J. and Christopher L. Tedesco, Elizabeth A. Shrader, Carrie A. Tedesco, Michele Fritts, Kelly Flynn, Tina Nelson and Don Tedesco; and 18 treasured great-grandchildren.
The family thanks the staff of St. Luke Manor for their loving, tender care and Maylath Hospice for their comfort care in Ann’s final days.
A funeral will be held at 9 a.m. Thursday from Joseph B. Conahan Funeral Home Inc., 532 N. Vine St., Hazleton.
A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 9:30 a.m. in Queen of Heaven Parish, Our Lady of Grace Church, Hazleton.
Interment will follow in Calvary Cemetery, Drums.
Family and Friends may call from 6 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at the funeral home.
Donations in memory of Ann may be made to Catholic Social Services, 214 W. Walnut St., Unit 1, Hazleton, PA 18201

The coronavirus has killed hundreds, but is China giving us the full picture?

Resumen: The numbers of coronavirus diagnoses are rising every day, and due to China's suppression of information, there's still so much we don't know.

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2. 5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I.
Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: “Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2. 1% every day since Jan. 30. ‘This magical virus is very good at math!’ I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime’s rule. . . . I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line. ”
Closed channels of communication
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials lying, but perhaps they’re telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what’s going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what’s really happening, as opposed to what underlings are reporting to their superiors.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
Joe Biden: Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak
It’s a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities’ position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there’s no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there’s no way for the people at the top to know whether they’re being told the truth.
Healthy systems of organization ensure that bad news can always flow from the bottom to the top. Systems that don’t do this become increasingly disconnected from reality and unstable.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I’d be worried.
The problem may be worse
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get. Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can’t always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they’re doing, it looks like they’re pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China’s already sluggish economy, suggests something serious. At the same time though, China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don’t need the help, or because they have secrets they’d rather keep? For now, there’s no way to know.
American trapped in Wuhan: I won't evacuate without my wife and son
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we’ll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let’s hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won’t be too expensive.

Local journalism is just fine, thank you

Texto completo: I've read a lot lately about the precarious state of local news in New York City. It's a drumbeat of doom and gloom: The Village Voice, gone. DNAinfo, gone. Staffs and news holes cut and then cut again. Careers and families wrecked by layoffs.
No doubt the puzzle of how to make money in local journalism remains unsolved. But with all the hand-wringing and use of the scary phrase "news desert" is a built-in assumption: Everything in the old days was better, that we've descended from some glorious epoch where every citizen of the five boroughs was well-served by reporters and editors.
As someone with 28 years experience covering New York City, I'm here to tell you it's much more nuanced than that. The good old days weren't always so good.
And today? Well, I'd argue that we are actually in the middle of a new golden age of journalism here.
When I became a police reporter at New York Newsday (RIP) in 1991, the city's four dailies had robust staffs and acres of stories. The competition was fierce for political scoops, for scandals, for crime and for monster breaking news: subway crashes, riots, the bombing of the World Trade Center.
We did a lot of things well, but our coverage could be one-dimensional. We ran and went through walls to get the best quote but didn't always dig to truly understand what that quote meant, how it reflected our times and our changing city. I covered roughly 300 homicides but rarely paused to understand the societal forces causing the bloodbath.
Today's city journalists see a far wider breadth of stories, aided by all kinds of spectacular visual and graphic elements.
And they dig deeper. The hammer killing of four homeless men last year in Chinatown prompted news organizations to drill down on the lack of city services, the scope of the homeless problem, the biographies of the dead and the accused, and the missed cues that contributed to the tragedy.
Amazon's decision to abandon plans for a second headquarters in Long Island City resulted in similarly thoughtful, ambitious and in-depth coverage.
From homelessness to transit to mental health to criminal justice reform and more, reporters today don't just chase the story; they chase the story behind the story.
The most ghastly thing I saw as a police reporter was the bodies of a young couple slain in Chinatown. They'd been bound and gagged, then shot in the back of their heads. It merited a tiny story deep in the paper. I'd wanted to come back on it, find out what it was all about, but I was swept away by the next day's crime.
I can only imagine the depth of coverage that the execution of these two striving young immigrants would rightly garner today.
Online, Politico New York, City & State and The City provide smart, expert and focused coverage, making life easier for dedicated readers. The reporting in those places is sophisticated, the writing sharp.
On the radio, there's WNYC. On local network TV, reporters break big stories. And Errol Louis' "Inside City Hall" on NY1 is an indispensable, deeply informative daily discussion.
Nostalgia springs eternal. When I started out, plenty of veterans remembered what they called the good old days, with six or seven or 12 dailies in a mad scrum to write the city. But take a look today at a yellowing copy of an old New York Journal-American or New York Daily Mirror. Ugh.
Yes, they covered the hell out of big news, but their stories could be at best cliched and one-source thin, and at worse racist, misogynist and peppered with quotes that just couldn't be real.
Kudos to the paper you are reading for apologizing for the way it covered the Stonewall riot in 1969 - you know, the one with the headline, "Homo Nest Raided, Queen Bees Are Stinging Mad."
Again: ugh. The good old days? Nah, these are the good old days.

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE -- The Democratic presidential nominating contest got off to a disastrous start last week when the Iowa caucus experienced a complete meltdown, but the candidates don't have time to dwell on what happened in the caucus calamity.

New Hampshire votes Tuesday, and Democrats in other states -- including Florida -- already are casting early ballots.

Florida elections supervisors sent vote-by-mail ballots to military and overseas presidential primary voters at the beginning of February, and domestic ballots started going out last week.

More than 1.2 million Floridians voted absentee in the 2016 presidential primary, including 520,035 Democrats and 713,857 Republicans.

In Florida‘s Democratic president primary, absentee voters made up one-third of the electorate in 2016.

With a big presidential field that is attracting plenty of attention, and a deep feeling among Democrats that they need to find a strong challenger to take on President Donald Trump, many Democrats are eager to cast primary ballots this year. The number of Democrats requesting

absentee ballots for the 2020 primary already is way up in some Florida counties.

Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections Ron Turner mailed out 30,607 absentee ballots to Democratic presidential primary voters last week, compared to 19,269 during the entire 2016 Democratic primary. The number of Manatee County Democrats requesting absentee ballots for the presidential primary this year is 25,621, up from 15,312 in 2016. The ballots will be mailed out Monday.

Turner expects that some people already will have filled out the ballots by today.

"The election has already started," he said.

While Florida's presidential primary is underway, it's still not clear what role the state ultimately will play in choosing the nominee.

Florida Democrats will see 16 names on their presidential primary ballot, including candidates who already have dropped out, such as Corey Booker and Julian Castro. More candidates likely will drop out before Florida's March 17 primary date, but the ballot had to be finalized back in December to allow time for printing.

Most of the candidates who are still in the race haven't had much of a presence in Florida so far, but a few have invested early and that could pay off if the state is competitive.

The four early voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- get most of the candidate attention early on because wins there can provide much-needed momentum and fundraising, while losses can cause support to collapse.

But if the race remains muddled deep into the primary calendar, Florida could play a key role in the nomination. That scenario looks more likely now, with Iowa's vote-counting problems resulting in the state failing to give the type of big lift or devastating defeat that can help winnow the field.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a disappointing performance in Iowa, but it was overshadowed by the caucus dysfunction.

If Biden can rebound in some of the other early voting states, Florida could help propel him further. He consistently has led in the polls here, and likely is locking in absentee votes before other candidates have a chance to focus on targeting Florida voters.

"As vote-by-mail gears up across Florida, we feel energized by the growing support we have across the state," said Jackie Lee, the senior adviser for Biden‘s Florida campaign, in announcing five more endorsements from Florida elected officials last week, bringing the total to 50 endorsements in the state. "These legislators are well-known, influential leaders that know Joe Biden is the candidate best-positioned to beat Donald Trump in the critical state of Florida."

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also could benefit from the confusion in Iowa. Bloomberg got into the race late and is not competing in the early states. Instead, the billionaire is spending enormous sums in states that vote in March, including Florida.

Bloomberg already has spent millions on television advertising in Florida and has more than 100 campaign staffers working in field offices around the state. He is betting that no candidate will come out of the early nominating contests strong enough to match his resources, and Iowa's diminished influence helps that strategy.

Bloomberg told the New York Times last week he was doubling his ad spending in every market where he currently is on TV -- which includes Florida -- after the problems in Iowa.

Bloomberg's army of campaign workers, coupled with the heavy advertising, could help him amass absentee votes in Florida before other candidates have a chance to build a ground game.

"We have a lot of staff on the ground that is going to be communicating with voters, we're going to be talking to them at their doors and you're going to see a lot more ads from us through the election," said Scott Kosanovich, who is running Bloomberg's Florida campaign.

The other top tier candidates -- Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar -- all have a limited Florida campaigns right now and are banking on generating momentum in other primaries that will carry over into the state.

That strategy is still the best bet to win the nomination based on historical precedence, but if the race stays competitive the campaigns eventually will need to start ramping up in Florida.

Aside from Bloomberg, Warren and Biden may have the most robust Florida campaigns among the top tier candidates.

Biden has a network of supporters and donors that has been built up over many years. Warren opened a campaign office in Miami in September, opened a second office in the state, in Orlando, earlier this month and has been hiring Florida campaign workers.

"From the very beginning we invested in Florida before any other campaign has; we were the first to put staff on the ground," said Kim Diaz Scott, who is running Warren‘s Florida campaign with a staff of more than 20.

"Everything that we are doing is because we were well aware that a little under half of Florida's primary voting base will be voting before March 17," Scott added. "That's why we needed to invest early."

Sanders still has plenty of supporters in Florida who have been with him since his 2016 campaign. But he got crushed by Hillary Clinton in Florida's 2016 presidential primary and does not appear to be investing heavily in the state so far this cycle, although he recently hired a Florida field director.

Buttigieg and Klobuchar also don't appear to have much campaign infrastructure in the state, although Klobuchar won satellite caucuses in St. Petersburg and Port Charlotte that the Iowa Democratic Party put on for the first time this cycle.

Whether Florida proves to be a pivotal battleground in the primary remains to be seen. Candidates who haven't invested in the state may not pay much of a price if they build up enough momentum before Floridians vote.

But the debacle in Iowa made it more likely that Florida's primary matters.

Texto completo: Three high-ranking Houston school district administrators have been temporarily relieved of their duties amid an investigation into allegations that staff members “were not appropriately dressed and behaved in a manner that lacked decorum” during an on-campus faculty holiday party.
The reassigned administrators include Madison High School Principal Carlotta Brown, who received national attention last spring after she implemented a dress code for parents visiting the southside campus.
Memos obtained through a public records request show the administrators were temporarily placed on home duty, with pay, in mid-January as district officials began an investigation into an event at Madison. District officials ordered the administrators to remain available by phone from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each school day.
The documents do not provide any additional details about the event, which is described in the memos as a “faculty fashion show.”
Video clips purporting to show part of the after-school event circulated online several weeks ago, showing two adults dancing while wearing provocative Christmas-themed outfits. No children were seen in the clips.
The administrators under scrutiny are Felicia Adams, an area superintendent responsible for leading the district’s $20 million campus turnaround plan known as Achieve 180; Dana Arreola, a school support officer who monitors implementation of campuses under Achieve 180; and Brown, who took over as Madison’s principal in early 2019.
“Based on the seriousness of this allegation, we believe it is in your best interest and that of the Houston Independent School District that you be temporarily relieved of your duties until a decision is reached as to how the matter will be resolved,” the memos stated.
No other Houston school district employees have been notified that they are under investigation in connection with the incident.
The allegations of inappropriately dressed staff members come less than a year after Brown’s move to institute a parent dress code drew a strong backlash. The rules mandated that parents wearing bonnets, pajamas, hair rollers or leggings, among other clothing items, would be turned away from campus.
Brown defended the dress code, which remains in place, arguing that parents should set an example for their children by wearing clothing considered appropriate in professional and public settings. She enforced a similar dress code during her 13-year tenure at Peck Elementary School, receiving no significant attention for the move.
Some community members, however, said the dress code contained discriminatory language targeted at black, lower-income and female parents. National news outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, wrote about the outcry.
Adams has helped lead the Achieve 180 initiative since its inception in 2017. She previously served as principal of Lanier Middle School and Lockhart Elementary School.
Arreola, a 20-year veteran of Houston-area public schools, rejoined the Houston district as a school support officer in 2017 after a two-year stint as principal of Clark Intermediate School in the Spring district.
Efforts to reach Adams, Arreola and Brown were unsuccessful last week. The trio rank among the highest-paid employees in the district, with annual salaries ranging from $132,600 to $176,382, according to district payroll records.
Three clips totaling about 75 seconds purportedly taken at the party were posted online by Gerry Monroe, an outspoken community activist. Monroe was banned from Houston school district premises for several months after instances of belligerent behavior, including the repeated use of vulgarities and racial epithets directed at Arreola during a meeting last April. The premises ban expired in January.

Texto completo: John Bolton never had any intention of testifying in Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial. And he knew he would never have to.
Trump's former national security adviser threw Democrats a sucker punch by pretending that he was noble enough to stand up against his old boss and the entire Republican Party. Turns out, he's a selfish manipulator -- just like Trump. And the American people got played.
Bolton is the only person who got anything worthwhile out of the drama that ensued over his possible testimony. His book sales likely will soar through the roof. And with juicy tidbits already out in the open, he has virtually guaranteed that his book won't fizzle out as quickly as every other tell-all book about Trump has.
Having worked for Trump, Bolton knew the lengths to which the president would go -- even beyond tying a subpoena up in court -- to keep him from telling senators what he knew about the Ukraine shakedown.
He also knew it would never get to that point. Bolton had the proof Democrats needed to show that Trump had abused his presidential power by withholding military funding to Ukraine in order to force an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
As a political insider, he knew there was no way Republicans ever would get the four votes needed to hear him say it under oath -- because such damning information would only make it harder for the senators to explain away the acquittal.
Anyone waiting for Bolton to speak out now that Trump has been acquitted should forget about it. If he were a noble man, he would never have been part of such a corrupt president's administration to begin with. News organizations are clamoring for an interview. If he had any intention of doing right by the American people, he would have broken his silence by now.
If there was any uncertainty about Bolton's sincerity, House impeachment manager Adam Schiff helped put it to rest last week during an interview on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show." After Republicans voted against hearing new witnesses, Bolton wasn't even willing to submit an affidavit.
"After they voted to be the first impeachment trial in history without witnesses, we did approach John Bolton's counsel, asked if Mr. Bolton would be willing to submit an affidavit under oath describing what he observed in terms of the president's Ukraine misconduct, and he refused," Schiff said.
"For whatever reason, he apparently was willing to testify before the Senate, but apart from that, seems intent on saving it for his book. He'll have to answer for that."
According to Schiff, Bolton's attorneys threatened to sue Democrats if they tried to subpoena him to testify before the Congressional impeachment hearings last year.
In their desperation to hear from someone who had firsthand knowledge of Trump's abuse of power, Democrats seemed willing to ignore who Bolton really is. That doesn't mean they were entirely taken in by him. In several speeches, Schiff alluded to the curiosity over Bolton's sudden benevolent change of heart regarding his testimony.
What Bolton wants more than anything -- and likely the reason he joined Trump's administration in the first place -- is to have an influential voice in developing and promoting the Republican public policy agenda.
Though Bolton might be on the outs with Trump right now, he will never be a friend to Democrats. A longtime advocate of bombing Iran into submission, he is an outspoken proponent of using military force around the world rather than engage in peaceful negotiations. In that regard, he is the antithesis of most Democrats.
When President George W. Bush nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations in 2005, Democrats despised him so much that they filibustered his confirmation in the Senate. Bush had to wait until the Senate was on summer recess to sneak his appointment in.
While the public doesn't know how The New York Times learned what's in a manuscript of Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened," scheduled for publication next month, it is easy to surmise who benefited most from its release.
According to the Times, Bolton reveals that Trump ordered him to help pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on his perceived Democratic rival and told him to call President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and urge him to meet with Trump's go-to guy and personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.
That's some powerful stuff. The suspense over whether he would actually get to testify to it under oath increased America's thirst for more information about what happened behind the scenes. At the same time, the leaked teasers shielded Bolton from a likely public lashing had these details come to light after the trial had ended.
The current drama over whether Trump's people will try to stop publication of the book by arguing that it contains significant amounts of classified information heightens expectations. There could be no better publicity.
At the same time, Bolton gets to parade around like a whistleblower who was kept, by no fault of his own, from blowing his whistle. When his book does finally come out, it won't be any help to the America people.
It will be a useless rehash of what we already know about this corrupt president. Maybe we should give the book the shaft the way Bolton gave it to us.

Pistons, needing to keep some vets, value Rose's leadership

Texto completo: Ed Stefanski believes the Pistons are well-positioned.
After the Andre Drummond trade, the franchise has financial flexibility, armed with $35 million in cap space for future roster construction.
The Pistons have some promising young pieces in third-year guard Luke Kennard, rookie Sekou Doumbouya, surging big man Christian Wood and second-year guards Svi Mykhailiuk and Bruce Brown.
The Pistons own all of their future first-round picks.
The Drummond trade added a future second-round pick.
But with the Pistons fully committed to a youth movement and developing prospects, why not add more?
That's the main question skeptical fans rightfully have after the Pistons retained veterans Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris and Langston Galloway through Thursday's trade deadline.
If it's about asset acquisition, why not turn those veterans into future picks?
Stefanski, the Pistons senior advisor, said there were talks, but indicated the market – specifically with Jackson, Morris and Galloway – wasn't there.
The Pistons weren't going to make a trade just to make a trade — despite the presence of two productive second-round picks in Brown and Mykhailiuk.
"I've been in this long enough to say, hat name am I going to put that to?' " Stefanski said during Friday's teleconference. "We have egos and think we're good talent evaluators, but it's not that easy when you get a pick in the 50s."
Stefanski didn't mention another aspect.
The market simply wasn't there for Jackson, Galloway and Morris.
And with Rose, as I reported previously, the Pistons preferred to keep him around.
Inside the deadline Several teams — notably the Lakers and Clippers — are seeking to add playmaking for a title run.
Why not Jackson, who scored 28 points Friday night in the Pistons' loss at Oklahoma City?
He's on an expiring deal and the Pistons have paid nearly 66% of his $18 million salary so the financial hit isn't as onerous for the oft-injured point guard.
That wasn't enough to create a market.
Multiple league sources have told the Free Press for several seasons Jackson had little trade value and that came to fruition.
There's the injury history. He has missed significant time in three of the last four seasons because of injuries, including a back issue that forced him to miss 42 games this season.
Jackson also still carries baggage from forcing his way out of Oklahoma City at the 2015 trade deadline.
Galloway reportedly received interest from the 76ers, but he remains an undersized shooting guard.
The 76ers obtained wings Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks from the Warriors, which eliminated a potential trade partner.
A source with firsthand knowledge of the Pistons front office's thinking said if they could have landed a second-round pick for Jackson or Galloway, they would have done it.
That would indicate there was interest in Morris, reportedly from the Rockets.
Before the 2019 deadline, the Pistons turned the expiring contract of Reggie Bullock into Mykhailiuk and a future second-rounder.
Did Morris potentially offer a similar return?
It's doubtful since Bullock drew several suitors, which allowed the Pistons to bargain for a decent haul from the Lakers.
Mykhailiuk, a player the front office liked, was the key.
"We knew him, we knew him from scouting," Stefanski said. "We liked a lot of his qualities. That got me excited."
Reports say Jackson is a candidate to be bought out.
The New York Times reported late Friday night the Clippers would be a potential suitor.
"I haven't thought about it," Jackson said. "I don't know who said that."
Rose can help the youngsters The Pistons' young players drew significant interest.
Wood offers 3-point shooting in a 6-foot-10 athletic frame for a contenter, but the Pistons hope to re-sign the free agent this offseason.
The Pistons were deep in talks with the Suns about a potential Kennard trade; ESPN reported talks reached an impasse because the Suns sought limits on first-round pick compensation.
Kennard has missed the past 24 games with soreness in both knees and that may have limited trade activity.
Kennard is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension this offseason, but sources say the Pistons aren't concerned about the price tag.
Still, as the Pistons seek to add assets, Kennard is a name to watch on the trade market this summer.
"Luke is well-respected and well-liked by NBA teams," Stefanski said. "The kid has a lot of talent."
Rose probably could have fetched a late first-round or an early second-round pick.
But if the Pistons draft a point guard, he could be moved later.
He has missed two straight games with a hip issue so that may have depressed his trade value.
Stefanski is good with that.
"He's a leader," Stefanski said of Rose's impact on younger players. "They love him, they probably idolize him a little bit. He's great with the young guys. On the court, he's just a terrific player to help them.
"Going forward, you are going to need some veterans and I don't know if you can pick a better veteran than Derrick Rose to help you go forward in this rebuild."
Next up: Hornets
Matchup: Charlotte (16-35) at Pistons (19-36).
Tipoff: 7 p.m. Monday, Little Caesars Arena.
TV/radio: Fox Sports Detroit; WXYT-FM (97.1).
Line: Off.
Pistons senior adivsor Ed Stefanski likes how Derrick Rose leads young players: "They love him, they probably idolize him a little bit."

Texto completo: Less than six weeks into 2020, we already have a leading candidate for the year's most misguided architectural idea: A proposal, now reportedly circulating in the Trump White House, that would make classicism the preferred style for federal courthouses and a wide range of other federal buildings.
The title of the seven-page screed, a draft executive order called "Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again," proves, if nothing else, that its authors know how to curry favor with the slogan-slinging occupant of the Oval Office.
If enacted, it would quash architectural innovation and expressions of cultural diversity, likely saddle taxpayers with more expensive construction costs, and undercut the very democratic ideals that such classically-inspired national icons as the White House and the Lincoln Memorial so stirringly represent.
The plan is being spearheaded by a Washington, D.C., nonprofit called the National Civic Art Society, which claims that the public finds contemporary architecture "ugly, strange, and off-putting." The copy I obtained says the order would apply to all federal courthouses and agency headquarters, all federal public buildings in the Washington, D.C., area, and other federal buildings expected to cost more than $50 million.
Under the sway of avant-garde modernists, the order asserts, the federal government "has largely stopped building beautiful buildings that the American people want to look at or work in." Instead, it says, federal architecture "should once again inspire respect instead of bewilderment or repugnance."
Trouble is, it only deems certain styles "beautiful" -- the Greek and Roman Revival as well as others that could be used outside the nation's capital (including Gothic, Romanesque and Spanish Colonial) -- and never gets around to specifying what underlying characteristics render a building beautiful.
New styles would not be banned, but they could have to overcome numerous bureaucratic hurdles to get built. And there would be an outright prohibition against Brutalism, the mid-20th Century style known for rough-hewn exposed concrete. (President Donald Trump has called one Brutalist building -- the FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, completed in 1975 and designed by Chicago architects C.F. Murphy Associates -- "terrible" and "one of the ugliest buildings" in Washington.)
So much for aesthetic and cultural diversity.
The proposal would make it exceedingly difficult to win approval for anything like the Chicago Federal Center, a modernist masterwork by one of the 20th Century's greatest architects, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The same hurdles could prevent the construction of a federal building that resembled the recently completed, widely acclaimed National Museum of African American History and Culture, whose three-tiered exterior draws inspiration from African art.
The top-down proposal would force architects to drape federal buildings in classical or traditional garb instead of allowing local communities to decide how their federal buildings should look and work. It would reverse widely respected principles for federal architecture that have guided the General Services Administration, the agency responsible for commissioning a vast portfolio of federal buildings, since the early 1960s.
Composed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who later became a New York senator, the principles explicitly argue against architectural prescriptions. "The development of an official style must be avoided," the guidelines say. "Design must flow from the architectural profession to the Government, and not vice versa."
There are undertones here of the nation's Cold War battle against totalitarian regimes that mandated architectural styles, as well as a respect for professional expertise.
The proposal's departure from those ideas appalled some ardent classicists I contacted.
"The federal government should not be getting into mandating a particular kind of architecture," said Michael Lykoudis, dean of Notre Dame's school of architecture, one of the nation's foremost centers of traditional design. "To be truly inclusive, it means that you look at the best quality of architecture. You don't set up stylistic parameters."
"That's horrifying," said Aric Lasher, design director at Chicago's HBRA Architects, which happens to have shaped a neo-classical federal building and courthouse in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, that the draft order singles out for praise. "I hardly think that style is really going to be the source of success or failure in architecture. Does Portland want to be represented in the same way as Tuscaloosa?"
In a letter to President Trump, the American Institute of Architects, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group, rightly slammed the draft executive order as a "one-size-fits-all mandate." It also raised a crucial practical point: Classical and traditional architecture, which rely on expensive stonework and decoration, can add substantially to a project's cost, even tripling it."
It's unclear if Trump supports the order. The White House press office would not comment on the draft order, which carries the heading "pre-decisional."
But the New York Times reported Thursday that the proposal's backers hope it will reach the president's desk "within the next month." Always an effective counter-puncher, Trump could spin opposition to the plan as the out-of-touch opinions of the cultural elite. Or he could do the right thing and kill the plan, which would cement for decades an architectural legacy that is profoundly anti-democratic.

Texto completo: As Iowa Democrats struggle to tally votes and claw their way out of the rubble of Monday's caucus crackup, there continues to be angst and outrage about the damage the Hawkeye State has inflicted on the democratic process - and the Democratic process. Terms like "catastrophe," "debacle," "fiasco" and "disaster" are being tossed about like salad greens.
That's one way to look at the situation. Another way is, Iowa has done the Democratic Party - the nation, even - a tremendous service. Yes, the reporting of votes was a perfect storm of incompetence. And the muddled outcome failed to give any of the candidates the electoral tailwind about which they'd been fantasizing. But, delayed and deflated though they were, the results so far have provided more clarity than anyone is giving them credit for - in some regards more than if the voting had gone off as planned. Among the valuable takeaways:
1. There is not yet a fresh burst of voter participation. At last count, turnout in Iowa was on track to hit 2016 levels - in the neighborhood of 170,000 caucusgoers - a far cry from the Obama-inspired groundswell of 2008, for which about 240,000 Iowans showed up. This should give particular pause to anyone betting on Bernie Sanders' argument that he will win by creating a new movement, fueled by people who normally don't vote. But it should also be a warning for anyone counting on anti-Trump fervor to mobilize the masses. Clearly, the masses still need some convincing. Iowa deserves credit for revealing that sooner rather than later.
2. Even moderate Democrats have real concerns about Joe Biden's ability to go the distance. The former vice president has many fine qualities. His resume is gold-plated, particularly in the crucial area of foreign policy. He's got his regular-Joe patter down, he adores retail politics, and arguably nobody feels voters' pain better than him. Biden should have the so-called moderate lane of this race locked down. But he doesn't. And whatever the precise vote tally, his lagging behind not just the field's hard-charging progressives, Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but also Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a sign that he needs to up his game.
3. The Democrats' nominating process needs to more accurately reflect its electorate. As is often noted, Iowa is way too white to have so much influence. So is New Hampshire, for that matter. As a party with a diverse electorate, the Democrats should not be spending so much time and money catering to such a monochromatic subset. The current debate over how much weight to give the Iowa weakness of Biden, who has held a comfortable lead among minority voters for this entire race, should not be happening. It is unproductive.
4. Caucuses should go the way of the eight-track tape. Their convoluted, undemocratic nature has been pointed out again and again. They jettison the principle of the private ballot. They are overly complicated and make participation too onerous for too many. In 2016, less than 16% of voting-eligible Iowans took part. This compared with a 52% participation rate in the New Hampshire primary. In 2018, the Democratic National Committee adopted new rules urging states to switch from caucuses to primaries and calling on those that stuck with caucuses to increase accessibility. After the 2016 kerfuffle in which Hillary Clinton's razor-thin win left Sanders' supporters complaining about a lack of transparency, Iowa, in a panicked effort to save the process, vowed to make it more transparent by reporting out more of the raw data. It also sought to make the process more accessible by establishing online caucuses. The latter plan fell apart over security concerns. (It wound up adding "satellite sites" instead.)
The additional reporting requirements ... well, we're seeing the unintended consequences of those now. Observers have spent this week critiquing the intelligence, tech savvy and even the advanced age of the legions of campaign volunteers trying to navigate the new app that was supposed to make the reporting process easier but wound up destroying it. But the core problem is the process itself. Don't hate the player; hate the game. And keep in mind that Iowa is not the only state still relying on caucuses. (Looking at you, Nevada.)
5. There is a strong argument to be made that no single state deserves to hold the rest of the electorate hostage the way Iowa has for decades. Why should the parochial concerns of Iowans be forever more important than those of Arizonans or North Carolinians or Michiganders? Multiple alternative ways to set the calendar have been floated, and it's past time to give them serious consideration. They could hardly be worse than the current system. If this year's meltdown doesn't spur Democrats to take long overdue action, they deserve all their future nightmares.
So, thank you, Iowa. This may be the most you have taught the electorate in a long while. Now take your bows and step aside.

Texto completo: Marine Pfc. Edward A. Nalazek, a Chicagoan born to proud Polish immigrants, died in 1943 with nearly 1,000 fellow Marines at the Battle of Tarawa during World War II. He was 27.
A decade later, his namesake nephew was born. Edward McNicholas of Newport News came to know the story of Uncle Eddie, but details were scarce.
He knew Nalazek was a cum laude college graduate who studied for the priesthood before enlisting in the Marines.
But whenever McNicholas pressed family members for more information, he got nowhere.
"Anytime I asked anybody, they just cried," he said. "My one sister calls it the wall of tears. They just couldn't talk."
McNicholas could not even visit his uncle's grave. Nalazek had been buried in a trench with other Marines on Betio Island, where he fell. But the cemetery's location was lost to history, and in 1949 the family was told that Nalazek's remains could not be recovered.
That changed last year.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) announced in November that Nalazek's remains had been accounted for, and he will be buried Feb. 10 at Arlington National Cemetery. It marked the end of an effort that was decades in the making, a case that illustrates the challenge of recovering and identifying those who fell in past conflicts.
It starts in 1967. That year, construction work uncovered multiple sets of remains - American and Japanese - on Betio Wharf. This was before the age of DNA identification. The American remains, still unidentified, were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu.
In 2013, McNicholas was alerted by one of his two sons, Edward, of Chesapeake, to a story in The New York Times that described the effort of History Flight, a nonprofit foundation dedicated to recovering the lost Marines of Tarawa and other fallen servicemen. McNicholas and his sister submitted DNA samples in case of a match.
Two years later, History Flight uncovered the remains of 36 Marines in a trench near the Betio Wharf. Because of the possible connection between those remains and the ones already at the Punchbowl, the different sets were studied together.
As it turned out, Nalazek's remains were in both groups.
"My uncle was buried between the two," McNicholas said.
The family's attention now turns to Arlington National Cemetery, where Nalazek will be buried with military honors. It is also a chance to reflect.
Nalazek studied for the priesthood from 1938 to 1941 before being absolved of his vows and leaving the seminary. His reason for leaving is a mystery, but McNicholas does not think the onset of war had anything to do with it.
"Maybe (the priesthood) just wasn't for him," he said. "We just don't know."
He enlisted in the Marines on March 18, 1942, and trained as a combat engineer. The Battle of Tarawa was the beginning of the U.S. campaign in the Central Pacific.
The Japanese had heavily fortified their position, and Nalazek went ashore amid ferocious fighting. He was killed on Sunday, Nov. 21, 1943, the second day of the battle. The circumstances of his death are unknown, except that he died from a gunshot wound. By the end of the week, the U.S. had control of Betio Island and the rest of the Tarawa Atoll.
McNicholas hopes the story of his uncle will highlight the painstaking work of organizations like DPAA and History Flight. He has special praise for Mark Noah, the president of History Flight, whom he calls "a great American." And he's overwhelmed by the efforts of Marines who are arranging all the details of the Feb. 10 funeral at Arlington.
He is also left to contemplate fate.
Had his Uncle Eddie lived, McNicholas' mom and dad never would have met.
Nalazek's sister, Josephine, was an Army Air Corps nurse scheduled to go overseas. When her brother died, she stayed stateside and met her husband, an Army flight surgeon. They had four daughters and a son, McNicholas.
McNicholas went on to serve in the Air Force. He served in intelligence and was stationed in different parts of the world. He served for 20 years, retired in 1996 and worked as a contractor at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton.
Asked what the upcoming service will mean, McNicholas didn't hesitate.
"Closure," he said. "And me being retired military, I'm proud. I'm named after him."

Texto completo: Valentine's Day is coming! Prepare yourself for an onslaught of Instagram posts featuring bright flowers, sparkling jewelry, and oversized teddy bears. Your feed is about to get #blessed. If you get to know me for more than 10 seconds, you know that's not what I'm about. Heck, my husband isn't even on social media. And I'm okay with that.
One study wanted to find out if couples who post excessively about each other are actually happier in their relationships. Spoiler alert: They're not. The study found "over-the-top displays are being used to compensate for weaker relationships."
This doesn't mean you don't love your husband if you talk about how wonderful he is on social media. Hopefully, you and your spouse affirm each other daily and in person.
But when I think about the healthiest couples I know, they're not the ones posting about each other 24/7. They're also not worried about what other people think, so they're not buying more stuff to impress people (just so they can post about it).
They're secure in their lives, but not because of an expensive lifestyle that they can flaunt. Instead, the couples I look up to have one thing in common — they're all intentional in their marriages.
A strong marriage doesn't happen by chance. If you want to be intentional and make your spouse feel really secure, work together on these three areas:
1. Set goals together A 2017 study by Ramsey Solutions revealed that 94 percent of couples who describe their marriages as "great" also say they discuss money goals together. Getting on the same page financially with your spouse is one of the best things you can do for your marriage. If you need some help reconnecting and realigning the goals of your relationship, check out this episode of The Rachel Cruze Show (rachelcruze.com/show/money-mistakes-that-can-ruin-your-relationships). You'll learn about money mistakes that can ruin your relationship, and practical ways to communicate and work better together.
2. Be willing to have tough conversations My friend, Dr. Les Parrott, says conflict is the price we pay for a deeper level of intimacy. You can disagree, and still make space to hear each other. Hashing it out, putting in the work, and coming from a place of understanding will only make you stronger. And by the way, I'm a huge fan of counseling for every marriage, not just the ones in crisis mode.
3. Don't compare your marriage to someone else's Comparison will steal your joy and frustrate your spouse. Too many people let Instagram-level expectations form their values and family priorities. I've been there, too, and I know it's an empty and endless battle trying to keep up. Spend that time and energy focusing on all the things you truly love about your spouse, and the life you've already built together.
Flowers will die, and jewelry will tarnish. But a relationship built on these three principles will make your marriage a blessing, not just #blessed.

Getting on the same page financially with your spouse is one of the best things you can do for your marriage. If you need some help reconnecting and realigning the goals of your relationship, check out this episode of The Rachel Cruze Show (rachelcruze.com/show/money-mistakes-that-can-ruin-your-relationships). You'll learn about money mistakes that can ruin your relationship, and practical ways to communicate and work better together.
2. Be willing to have tough conversations My friend, Dr. Les Parrott, says conflict is the price we pay for a deeper level of intimacy. You can disagree, and still make space to hear each other. Hashing it out, putting in the work, and coming from a place of understanding will only make you stronger. And by the way, I'm a huge fan of counseling for every marriage, not just the ones in crisis mode.
3. Don't compare your marriage to someone else's Comparison will steal your joy and frustrate your spouse. Too many people let Instagram-level expectations form their values and family priorities. I've been there, too, and I know it's an empty and endless battle trying to keep up. Spend that time and energy focusing on all the things you truly love about your spouse, and the life you've already built together.
Flowers will die, and jewelry will tarnish. But a relationship built on these three principles will make your marriage a blessing, not just #blessed.

Market Phobia Comes to Cyberspace

Texto completo: Remember the panic over net neutrality? Pressure groups convinced millions that strengthening market competition in broadband would "end the internet as we know it," exposing web users to corporate exploitation and control. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai needed a security detail.
The policy went through and none of the abuses happened, but many who ginned up the hysteria have found a new capitalist threat to the internet. This time the targets are Ethos Capital, a private-equity firm that announced its intention to buy the .org web-registry, and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), which has to sign off on the sale. Antipathy to markets is again misleading the public and opening the door to regulatory abuses.
Some background: All websites have a domain name -- a virtual address that allows them to be located online. The most familiar "top-level" domains include .com, .net, .org and .edu. Each is managed by a registry. The .org registry is owned by the Internet Society (ISOC), a nonprofit corporation that aims to expand internet access, among other causes.
In November ISOC announced it is selling the registry to Ethos. Some in the .org community, led by vocal left-leaning nonprofits, are outraged. Scores of articles and blog posts have denounced the "private-equity takeover" of .org. Icann has had protests outside its headquarters. Democrats in Congress asked Icann in a January letter to block the sale.
The most common concern is cost, as Ethos will seek a return on its $1.1 billion investment. Yet the current annual cost of owning a .org domain is about $10, and Ethos has committed not to raise prices more than 10% a year on average. A $1 per year cost increase is negligible even for the smallest nonprofit.
Even without this commitment, market pressure would contain the price. There are more than a thousand domain-name middlemen, like GoDaddy, which sell addresses directly to consumers. There are also dozens of competitor for-profit registries, and the largest, .com, faces regulatory caps on price increases. If Ethos jacked up the price, it would cause groups to leave .org and deter new ones from joining. Yet expanding .org's presence beyond the U.S. is key to Ethos' business strategy.
ISOC says it decided to sell .org partly because it was not equipped to deal with this business environment. New domains (like .us and .site) have come online, and more people are accessing the web through apps. ISOC hoped a for-profit could be a more versatile steward. To protect its investment, Ethos will need to invest in services to enhance .org's appeal to consumers.
Those most sensitive to price increases are speculators who own thousands of domains and sell them off. Nearly two million .org domains turn over each year, and the Internet Commerce Association, which represents domain holders, was one of the first to howl about the sale. It would be ironic if protests against the "capitalist-based internet industrial complex," as one nonprofit CEO told the New York Times, serve the interest of domain-name arbitrage.
Another irony comes from the appeals to free speech online from the likes of Elizabeth Warren. The Senator has made suppression of political speech on social media a tenet of her presidential campaign, demanding Facebook remove ads critical of Democrats she deems misleading. Yet her letter to Icann paints the Ethos acquisition as a free-speech threat, citing registries' intervention in trademark disputes.
Trademark infringements are covered by Icann's dispute-resolution policy which won't change when the .org registry is sold. Registries disable sites only in extraordinary circumstances -- a contrast to the heavy-handed approach many on the left are demanding of Big Tech firms. In any case Ethos has less cause to suppress speech than a nonprofit and says it will create a "Stewardship Council" that will "ratify strong rules protecting freedom of expression."
There's a larger point here about "stakeholder capitalism," which is coming into fashion. Ethos emphasizes its commitment to all "stakeholders," not just its owners, and apparently will give some teeth to those commitments in its charter for the .org registry. Yet that's not enough for many activists, who see private capital as inherently exploitative rather than a source of value creation and technological progress enjoyed by all.
The nonprofits raising a fuss over Ethos are vehicles of political interests. The real danger is that Icann will be intimidated, hurting the reputation for political independence of what should be the web's honest broker.

Texto completo: Emperor Trumpand heads on pikes
In his impeachment closing remarks, Congressman Adam Schiff said (paraphrased) Republican jurors know Trump is guilty but are afraid to vote to remove him from office, fearing their heads would be put on a pike. Many Republicans were “insulted” that they would be so fearful of Trump.
I had never heard this phrase before so I googled it. Apparently during ancient Roman times, a leader would cut off the heads of enemies then stick them on pikes (long spikes). When the emperor/leader was giving a speech, heads on pikes were displayed in front of the speech giver. To the audience, the message was clear: Cross me and I will have your head on a pike.
True to form, “Emperor” Trump has Sen. Mitt Romney's head symbolically on a pike. Along with James Comey, John Bolton and others. It has been reported “Emperor” Trump has an ever-growing enemies list. I bet he'll need lots of “pikes.”
By the way, many of Trump's GOP cult are calling for Romney to be “banished from the Republican Party.” Banished? Shunned? Scorned?

Scoreboard page needs improvement
As a faithful subscriber to the Concord Monitor for many years, I believe the Scoreboard section needs an upgrade.
The last straw was the puny one-third of a page on Jan. 27.
For many years, I thought we had a great Sports section. We always had the scores from late-night games. This came to an abrupt halt when the Monitor was transitioning to the vacant Rivco building in Penacook. It was admirable that the Monitor apologized daily for the early press time.
On many occasions over the last several months, there have been days when the NHL or NBA standings could not be found. It's absurd that in the middle of winter in a sports-crazed state that you could not devote more than one-half of a page for scores, standings, etc. Instead of devoting one-half of a page on the Scoreboard page to a chiropractic advertisement or church directory, maybe you should consider adding other sports standings, like AHL, Hockey East, Big East, ACC or more Division I men's and women's winter sports.
The price of the Monitor has increased over the years while the quality, specifically the Sports section Scoreboard page, has become abysmal. I would think that as the internet has become so easy to access news and sports information that newspapers would want to present a worthy product.
I do miss the time when I could drink my coffee in the morning while enjoying a complete summary of sporting events and standings from the night before.

The price of denying science
A partial quote from the New York Times: “Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, warned medical school classmates about evidence of a new virus in an online forum on Dec. 30, and the authorities later forced him to declare that he had spread an unfounded rumor.” Dr. Li Wenliang recently died from that virus.
This is the danger of having leaders who deny established science or other evidence: viruses, environmental degradation, hiding documented proof of wrongdoing, climate change. These are the actions of a corrupt leadership, protecting their own egos and, often, bottom lines.

Romney's courage
Dear Sen. Romney: Thank you so much for the inspired reminder that genuine democracy is governed by principles, not politicians – nor by the fear of them.
Your vote is a ray of light peering into the morally diminished chamber of a self-absorbed majority in the Senate, mesmerized by a self-appointed king whose Republican subjects are apparently willing to sell their souls for his adulation and their own re-election.
Your moral courage is the kind of light that sparkles with hope and will make America great again. May it radiate and glow from sea to shining sea.

Vote to keep fossil fuels  in the ground
The climate clock is counting down. The era of half-measures, in which science has taken a back seat to fossil fuel interests and political power grabs, must end. Our next president will be tasked with taking immediate action on climate or else risk placing us in the headlights of unprecedented climate chaos.
The changes we need to keep within the 1.5-degree C “safe” threshold of warming must be far-reaching, requiring a halt to the development of all new fossil fuel projects and rapid deployment of renewable energy technologies. However, while these major shifts in our energy infrastructure are critical in adapting to a warming planet, they are not enough.
The people who live and work in environments that are directly impacted by the fossil fuel economy are the most vulnerable. Frontline communities, communities of color, low-income groups, Indigenous people and workers, disproportionately bear the burden of extraction and climate destabilization. For example, here in New Hampshire, communities situated along the Seacoast and the proposed Granite Bridge Pipeline, as well as workers in the fossil fuel industry, face severe economic, health and housing risks.
This Tuesday, it is essential that we vote for a candidate who's got a plan for a fair and equitable transition for workers and impacted communities. Technological innovation alone will not save us. In the words of Quinton Sankofa, “Transition is inevitable. Justice is not.”
For a just future that includes all of us, we must keep it in the ground.

To the Editor:
Re "I Feel Personally Judged by J. Lo's Body," by Jennifer Weiner (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Feb. 4):
I chose to judge J. Lo and the halftime show at the Super Bowl through a different lens. How does one reconcile the show with the #MeToo movement? To be sure, the technical aspects and performances were first rate. But keeping in mind that this is a show watched by all ages and backgrounds, the dance moves and costumes were more befitting a strip club minus the stripping or a prelude to a soft-porn video.
The show used images meant to excite and seduce. Yet the #MeToo movement is all about not objectifying women, not viewing them through the lens of sex and using sex to manipulate, dominate and take advantage.
The performers are wonderful dancers and good singers. How about costumes and choreography that showcase these talents without having to exploit the overused "sex sells" approach.
I was not offended by the show -- just sad and dismayed.
Olivia Koppell

To the Editor:
I was struck by how differently Jennifer Weiner reacted to Jennifer Lopez and Shakira's performance than my friends and I did. Perhaps it is generational -- my friends and I are a mix of genders and races in our mid to late 20s -- but we focused very little on their appearances. We were more struck by the enthusiastic display of Latino culture and pride, capped by the unfurling of the Puerto Rico flag, at an event hosted by an organization that often ignores social issues concerning their minority players and viewers.
I understand the tension between celebrating women's bodies versus using them to sell things. But it is sad to me that the actual message that J. Lo and Shakira were sending, a celebration of cultural diversity in a time of cultural division, was lost amid the focus on their bodies. Funny how we as a society seem incapable of moving beyond this issue.
Renée Wang
Pasadena, Calif.
To the Editor:
Jennifer Weiner's opinion piece communicated the perception that men consume junk food with abandon and have no anxiety or feelings of inadequacy about what their bodies look like. I'm now in recovery from body dysmorphia and a related eating disorder, and it is exactly that perception that helped make it so difficult for me to admit I had an issue or to seek help.
Body image issues are not the sole domain of women. And guess what? They never have been. But we as men are often not encouraged to be open about also falling prey to these conditions. It's truly a shame that the body acceptance that Ms. Weiner urged for those reading her article didn't seem to extend to men also. We're all in this together.
Nicholas Malfitano
Philadelphia
To the Editor:
I read Jennifer Weiner's witty and honest reflections during my lunch break as a radiation oncologist. I had just seen two patients healing from mastectomies and another whose cheek had been significantly eroded by oral cancer. I doubt that they had lost sleep on how their thighs compared to J. Lo's. Above all, they were grateful to have a chance of cure.
Ms. Weiner's bittersweet piece made me wonder: How many waking hours of our short lives do we spend worrying about cosmetic "flaws"? If those insecurities creep up, please be kind to yourselves. Turn off your screens. Don't wait for a life-changing crisis to realize what matters. Realize today that you are enough.

Texto completo: He designed and built some of the best-known courses in segregated Louisiana. But though he loved the game, he was never permitted to play those courses.
Since 1851, many remarkable black men and women did not receive obituaries in The New York Times. This month, with Overlooked, we're adding their stories to our archives.
As an African-American youngster -- as young as 7 years old, some say -- Joseph Bartholomew caddied in the afternoons at the private, whites-only Audubon Park Club golf course in New Orleans, earning $ 3 a day. There he learned the game by watching the men whose bags he bore on his shoulders.
Bartholomew prided himself on his caddying skills, particularly in finding errant shots.
"It distracts a golf player to lose his ball," he was quoted as saying in the reference book "African-American Business Leaders: A Biographical Dictionary" (1994). "I never lost one golf ball a year."
Audubon's club professional, Freddie McLeod, who would go on to win the 1908 United States Open, taught Joseph how to repair clubs and eventually offered him a job.
The catch?
"He told me," Bartholomew later recalled, "'I can't give you $ 3, just 50 cents."'
Most people wouldn't dare take such a pay cut, or such a risk. But, Bartholomew said: "I figured I can learn more from Mr. McLeod than I can as a caddie. So, I took it."
Learn, the young man did.
Bartholomew would one day become the greens superintendent and give lessons -- as many as 12 per day at $ 2 per lesson. And beyond that he would become an admired golf course designer.
But it would take decades for him to get to that point. And through it all -- as he rose from caddie to club repairman to superintendent to course designer -- Bartholomew, a black man in the Jim Crow South, was barred from playing at Audubon or any other segregated private club, even those whose courses he designed.
Joseph Manuel Bartholomew was born on Aug. 1, 1888, in New Orleans to Manuel and Alice Bartholomew. He was ambitious from a young age. He once asked a teacher if there would be any objection to his completing two grades in one year. "She said no," he told Sports Illustrated in 1966, "so I went ahead and skipped."
Bartholomew was in his 30s, in the early 1920s, when local golfers, impressed with his interest in the game and his work as a groundskeeper, collaborated to send him to a golf architecture school in New York, where he studied with the golf course architect Seth Raynor.
"Whooo, but I was surprised," Bartholomew told Fortune magazine in 1949. "They gave me a whole bunch of money and told me to go and find the best course in the world and bring it back."
He did even better, returning with the design for a course composed of holes modeled on famous ones at courses throughout the United States and Scotland.
The golfers liked it, and hired him to build it. Opening in the '20s, it was called Metairie Country Club, and he was named its first club professional. But while he was permitted to give lessons, he was not allowed to play a round of golf there. Indeed, he was hired to design and build several more golf courses in the area for white golfers but barred from playing them.
Undeterred, he eventually built a seven-hole course on property he owned in Harahan, La., a Mississippi River town west of New Orleans. And in Pontchartrain Park in New Orleans he built Louisiana's first municipal golf course for African Americans.
By the time he died on Oct. 12, 1971, at 83, Bartholomew had been celebrated as a golf course architect by Sports Illustrated. In 1972, he was posthumously elected into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. And in 1979, the City of New Orleans renamed its Pontchartrain Park golf course the Joseph M. Bartholomew Sr. Municipal Golf Course.
After building his courses, Bartholomew rented his construction equipment to white contractors. And just as he had learned golf by watching the players he caddied for, he learned the construction business by observing, on the job, the men who had rented his equipment.
Working with, and not just for, white men was unusual for black men in the South, but Bartholomew had become accustomed to it. "Don't try to outsmart the white folks -- they're smart," he told Fortune. "Be honest, listen and learn."
And make money. Bartholomew started his own construction enterprise, focusing on drainage, foundations and landscaping. He landed contracts with large public and private housing projects in New Orleans, as well as for office buildings and factories.
He didn't stop there. He invested contracting profits in a fledgling life insurance company named for Frederick Douglass. It was losing money when he bought it in 1940 and took over as president. Nine years later it was thriving, headquartered in a building that Bartholomew had bought.
Bartholomew turned his attention to real estate full time when a man for whom he once caddied came to him to be a partner on a land-improvement venture. They bought hundreds of acres of rough land and, using Bartholomew's equipment, drained and upgraded the property. They then sold it, with some parcels going for more than 10 times what they had paid.
In what may have been Bartholomew's ultimate venture, he built an ice cream plant for $ 75,000. By 1949, it was raking in profits.
Bartholomew rarely saw a risk that wasn't worth taking, and he told Fortune he believed that that had been the key to his success.
"That's the difference between me and most of the rest of the colored people," he said. "They won't take a chance because they've been skinned before. I take 'em all the time."

Texto completo: At a conference in Berlin, tech outfits from around the world were eager to do business with law enforcement.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hello, Adam Satariano here. I cover technology in Europe for The New York Times.
This past week, as part of some research I have been doing about government uses of technology, I went to Berlin to attend the European Police Congress, an annual conference for law enforcement agencies.
When the conference started more than 20 years ago, the discussion was mainly about training techniques and other cop-on-the-beat-type work, said Uwe Proll, the main organizer. The companies there were predominantly selling guns, safety gear, radios and other equipment.
But as in every other industry, the conversation is now dominated by technology. At the panels I attended, and in conversations I had with attendees, the central topics were how to take advantage of artificial intelligence, data analytics, facial recognition and other emerging technologies.
Many representatives from the tech industry were on hand. A common theme was that police departments risk giving criminals an edge if they don't buy the latest technology. "They want it, they need it," said Ozan Yilmaz, a project manager for Ava, a data-analytics firm whose customers include police departments in Los Angeles and London.
Microsoft demonstrated its image recognition technology. Samsung displayed a range of handsets, including a specially designed Galaxy phone for police officers. IBM was pitching artificial intelligence. Oracle showed how its technology would help with immigration enforcement, with gang and drug investigations, and in prisons.
Cognitec, a German facial recognition company, showed me how its technology can follow people as they move around an airport or public space. The sales rep told me that demand for its software from law enforcement had never been higher.
Nearby was a booth for NSO Group, the firm accused of making spy software that has been used against journalists and government dissidents. "Find anyone, anywhere," read its slogan. The marketing manager at the booth refused to speak with me.
While companies clearly see a business opportunity in law enforcement, representatives from police departments said they were wrestling with the ethical traps of using the latest technology.
Many said clearer laws were needed to outline which systems were acceptable, particularly with emerging technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence. Otherwise, law enforcement authorities will be left making policies on their own, as London's police department did last month when it announced it will use real-time facial recognition.
In the years ahead, many of the most important debates about technology will be about how governments are adopting these new systems and what impact they are having.
Cade Metz and I just published an article about how people in the United States and Europe are being affected by the government use of algorithms to make decisions in criminal justice, social welfare and children services.
In Bristol, a city I visited on the west coast of England, an algorithm is being used to flag youths who may be at risk of becoming involved in crime. After years of budget cuts, officials there see it as a way to make up for lost human resources.
In Philadelphia, Cade met with a man whose probation had largely been dictated by an algorithm. The man didn't know the software was playing such a decisive role in his life until Cade told him.
Some stories you shouldn't miss
The Iowa caucuses meltdown taught us an important (and arguably self-evident) lesson about tech. Kevin Roose explained that trying out new technology for targeting voters and campaign organizing was all well and good. But when it comes to the nuts and bolts of counting votes, the more analog the better.
The app at the center of the problems in Iowa was part of an effort by Democrats to narrow the lead Republicans have built up over the past several years in using digital technology. The faulty app, my colleagues reported, was "the work of a little-known company called Shadow Inc. that was founded by veterans of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential campaign, and whose previous work was marked by a string of failures, including a near bankruptcy."
Several tech companies reported earnings. The results showed that the gap between the largest tech companies and everybody else is widening, according to an analysis by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Matt Phillips.
Perhaps my favorite story of the week was a delightful piece by Steve Lohr about Anguilla, a tiny British territory in the Caribbean, that is cashing in on its ownership of the internet domain for ".ai."

Nuns March To Highlight Global Plague Of Trafficking

Texto completo: To mark the sixth annual international day of prayer and awareness against human trafficking, nuns and lay people took to the streets.
VATICAN CITY -- For years, nuns around the world have worked to help trafficked and enslaved people break free from the conditions that ensnare millions of men, women and children.
They have prayed for them, and they have offered hospitality. On Sunday, they marched on St. Peter's Square for them.
"There have never been as many slaves in the world as there are today," Gabriella Bottani, the international coordinator of Talitha Kum, a global network of nuns that assists trafficked persons, said in kicking off the march. "Only together we can break the chain of trafficking and slavery."
Dozens of nuns, lay people and a smattering of priests walked along the broad avenue that links the Castel Sant'Angelo to St. Peter's Square, but Sister Bottani said that several women who had been trafficked decided at the last minute not to join.
"They don't want to be identified," she said.
The march was part of the sixth World Day of Prayer, Reflection and Action against Human Trafficking, which takes place each year on Feb. 8, the feast of St. Josephine Bakhita, a Sudanese nun who has become the symbol of the Roman Catholic Church's commitment to fight human trafficking.
Addressing the faithful gathered in St. Peter's Square for the Angelus prayer and blessing, Pope Francis described trafficking as a "real plague that exploits the weakest," and said that fighting it required a unified commitment.
He also warned that as criminal organizations increasingly used social media to target potential victims, people should "be educated" to use these more "healthily," while social networking services should be held accountable for the content of their sites.
From the start of his papacy, Francis has spoken out on behalf of the millions of men, women and children who are trafficked and enslaved. He has called human trafficking a "scourge" and an "open wound." And he has said that trafficking is "a global phenomenon that exceeds the competence of any one community or country."
The International Labor Organization estimates that almost 25 million people are in forced labor worldwide; about a fifth of those are in forced sexual exploitation.
Talitha Kum, which is based in Rome and operates in 92 countries, was formed 10 years ago to coordinate the actions of Catholic nuns who fight human trafficking. It supports women sold into prostitution, as well as the thousands of people -- including children -- who are sold into forced labor or slavery. It also lobbies for better laws to fight human trafficking.
Its diversity was evident on Sunday as nuns from all over the world joined the march.
"It's a difficult issue, because it's so caught up with poverty," Mayra Cuellar, a nun from Bolivia, said of sexual exploitation. "It's really a plague."
Maria Das Dores Paz, a nun with the Benedictine Sisters of Divine Providence, which offers assistance to trafficked children and women in Brazil, said: "It's a big problem that's often hidden. We try to help, but it's often not enough, because a lot depends on the family."
"The fight against human trafficking has been the patrimony of the church for many years, but with Pope Francis it became central, as he has chosen it as one of the main themes of his pontificate," Sister Bottani said on Sunday. The march, she said, was one way of getting people to take notice.
On Saturday, the sisters tried another route: social media. Their hashtag #PrayAgainstTrafficking became a trending topic in Italy, sharing a top spot with the hashtag of the country's most-watched TV music event. Even the pope used the hashtag twice.
Francis also met with some of the sisters on Saturday to activate a new initiative for Talitha Kum: a fund-raising program called Super Nuns. The project involves street artists and comic book artists who create new pieces focused on the nuns' work with trafficked women.
"We are calling them Super Nuns because what they do is extraordinary work: very hidden work, quite dangerous work at times," Sister Patricia Murray, Secretary of the International Union of Superiors General told Vatican Radio on Saturday.
The first image, by Steve Powers, better known as the artist ESPO, was installed last month on a wall in Brooklyn, Sister Bottani said.
"We wanted to find a new way of speaking about trafficking that would resonate," she said.

Texto completo: Jon Jones faced his most serious challenge in years and held off Dominick Reyes at UFC 247 Saturday night in Houston, retaining his UFC light heavyweight belt. The unanimous decision of 48-47, 48-47, 49-46 was met with scattered applause and some boos.
Jones (26-1-1) handed the fourth-ranked Reyes (12-1) his first loss, improving to 15-0 in title fights.
In the co-main event, flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko (19-3) defended her title against Katlyn Chookagian (13-3), stopping the challenger in the third round. Houston-native heavyweight Derrick Lewis (23-7) beat Ilir Latifi(15-8) via unanimous decision, and featherweight Dan Ige (13-2) won his fifth straight fight, taking a split decision over Mirsad Bektic (13-3).
TENNIS
U.S. prevails in Fed Cup after Serena Williams' surprising defeat
Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin was hoping not to have to take the court again after falling short in her singles match. But after Serena Williams was defeated for the first time in a Fed Cup singles match, it was left to Kenin and Bethanie Mattek-Sands to get the United States into the finals.
Kenin and Mattek-Sands earned a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Jelena Ostapekno and Anastasija Sevastova to give the U.S. a 3-2 win over Latvia in their qualifying match Saturday night in Everett, Wash.
It was a more challenging day than expected for the Americans, who held a 2-0 lead entering the second day of singles. But Ostapenko beat Kenin in three sets, and Sevastova earned a win over Williams, who entered 14-0 in Cup play.
PRO FOOTBALL
Former Georgia QB Murray struggles in debut with XFL
For a second straight year, Aaron Murray started at quarterback for a league that wasn't the NFL. And again he struggled.
Murray, an SEC record passer during his four years at Georgia, appeared in six games, passing for 1,048 yards, 3 touchdowns and 7 interceptions, for the Atlanta Legends of the Alliance of American Football last year.
On Sunday, Murray made his debut for his hometown Tampa Bay Vipers of the XFL. Murray went 16 of 34 for 231 yards with two interceptions in a 23-3 loss to the New York Guardians.
SOCCER
African confederation's financial irregularities totaling millions
An audit of the governing body for soccer in Africa has uncovered millions of dollars of financial irregularities, a development that threatens to bring down its leadership after more than a year of turmoil at the troubled organization, The New York Times reported.
The board of the governing body, the Confederation of African Football, or C.A.F., agreed last year to an independent review of its operations amid accusations of financial wrongdoing. Auditors found problems across the board, including with the dispensation of millions of dollars of development funds sent to the African soccer body by FIFA.

JOE BIDEN'S LAST CAMPAIGN AS HIS PARTY RACES LEFT, THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT STRUGGLES TO CATCH UP

Texto completo: After trying twice before to win the Democratic party's presidential nomination, Joe Biden has spent the 2020 primary acting like a man scrambling to catch up with his moment, afraid it may have passed him by. And with good reason.
At campaign events in eastern Iowa the week before the caucuses, Mr. Biden focused most of his meandering rhetoric on President Donald Trump and didn't do anything to rebut - implicitly or explicitly - claims from his Democratic opponents that his candidacy is too backward-looking, too moderate for 2020.
It turns out that Iowa caucus-goers were inclined to agree with the former vice president's critics. The results from Iowa have been unclear thanks to the malfunctioning of a new app the Democratic Party was relying on to report totals in each precinct, but it was clear that Mr. Biden's campaign had flopped. In one precinct, Iowa's attorney general was forced to switch his support from Mr. Biden to former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg after Mr. Biden was disqualified for lack of support.
This outcome isn't surprising to anyone who witnessed Mr. Biden's efforts to connect with voters in the final days of the campaign in Iowa. Mr. Biden's events over the course of the week continually drew tiny crowds, and his speeches were increasingly rote, unfocused and lackluster. On the stump, he sounds depleted of energy, substituting occasional bursts of anger for the enthusiasm his voice lacks. The Saturday before the caucuses, his campaign stops in Cedar Rapids and Waterloo attracted just a few hundred people each, compared with thousands not just for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders but even for his surrogates.
In his appeals to voters, Mr. Biden has stuck to the "middle lane," attempting to come across as a trustworthy, experienced moderate even as he looks for areas where he can endorse the progressive policy agenda and win the support of far-left voters. Addressing criticism that he hasn't moved as far left as many of his competitors, Mr. Biden continually reiterates that his approach is the best way to defeat the president.
Despite pressure from other candidates, Mr. Biden has avoided endorsing the costly "Medicare for All" scheme, saying instead that his administration would push for a public option to be added to the Affordable Care Act. "Everyone in this race talks about health care, but I'm the only one who actually led into law a health care reform called Obamacare," he said at one event, to delayed and muted applause.
"If you want impressive change on health care, I'll say it to you plainly: I'm the only one with more than a plan," Mr. Biden continued. "I have a record of having gotten it done." This is his best defense against progressives who believe he isn't radical enough for the moment: Mr. Biden claims that any politician who promises more than he does simply hasn't had enough experience to know what is realistic.
At his event in Waterloo, Mr. Biden referred to other Democratic proposals as "incredibly good ideas" but insisted that it was wrong not to explain how they'd be financed, a swing at opponents such as Mr. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have been opaque about the bottom line on their expensive proposals: "The old saying is that talk is cheap. In politics, talk is sometimes very expensive, especially when you don't tell people how you're going to pay for what you tell them you're going to do."
In keeping with that theme, and although he insists that climate change is "the greatest threat facing our country," Mr. Biden has also refused to sign on to the Green New Deal, which estimates suggest would cost anywhere from $52 trillion to $93 trillion over the next 10 years.
"The one thing we can't do is end up not being straight with the American people," he said, in another swipe at others in the Democratic field."They'll eat us alive. Tell it straight. Tell the people what it's going to cost and why it's important."
Telling people how much things will cost has never been the most natural way to appeal to voters in presidential politics, and, one assumes, it is even less so in a party where even the notionally moderate candidates are proposing fiscal plans vastly more profligate than those Hillary Clinton offered in 2016.
Mr. Biden spends most of his campaign events talking about the sitting president. "We have to beat Donald Trump," he says again and again on the trail. In Waukee, Mr. Biden emphasized the theme with which he kicked off his campaign, saying that another term for Mr. Trump would "fundamentally change the nature" of the U.S., while his own presidency would "restore the character of the nation."
"I really do believe this year that the character of the nation is on the ballot" - that's how he put it in Waterloo, before repeating his campaign-video description of the Charlottesville violence. "To state the obvious, the next president is going to inherit a country divided and a world in disarray, and there is no time for on-the-job training," he added.
But Iowa's voters appear not to have agreed with Mr. Biden's assessment that he is the candidate best equipped to be that president. He's been banking on appealing to Democratic voters who can't stand Mr. Trump and are wary of the progressive direction in which other politicians want to take their party. In a state such as Iowa, those types of voters likely exist in droves, but Mr. Biden's efforts to win them over fell flat.
"Everything I say, I've done, and everything I talk about is authentic," Mr. Biden told an undecided voter in Cedar Rapids on the Saturday before the caucuses. "Now, if you don't like what I'm talking about, I understand. You can be for somebody else. But ask yourself, who is going to be able to unite the country? How can Pete do that? How can Bernie do that?"
That undecided voter later told The New York Times, "He 100% could have swayed me, and I was hoping that he would, and he did not."
Mr. Biden has a couple of weeks to find a way to convince voters like that, or the moment will indeed have left him behind.

Texto completo: In a wide-ranging career, he appeared in "The Elephant Man" on Broadway and was the voice of Mark Twain for a Ken Burns film and of an "Outer Limits" reboot.
Kevin Conway, who brought intensity to roles large and small on the screen and the stage, including memorable turns in the 1970s in the plays "When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?" and "The Elephant Man," died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 77.
Geraldine Newman, his longtime partner, said the cause was a heart attack.
Mr. Conway got a late start on his acting career, but by 1969 he was making his Broadway debut in Arthur Kopit's "Indians." His first significant film role was in "Slaughterhouse-Five," George Roy Hill's adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel, in 1972.
Early on, he often played explosive characters and tough guys. In 1978 he worked opposite Sylvester Stallone in both "F.I.S.T.," a tale of organized labor and organized crime, and "Paradise Alley," in which he played a hoodlum in the mean streets of 1940s New York. Mr. Stallone, he said, had suggested that he get a tattoo of an eagle on his forehead to make the character more memorable.
"I told him I wasn't crazy about the idea," Mr. Conway told People magazine. "A thing like that could cut down your employment opportunities."
Mr. Conway was also seen on TV in numerous series and mini-series. In 2007 alone he appeared in the short-lived NBC series "The Black Donnellys," about Irish brothers caught up in organized crime in New York, and the mini-series "The Bronx Is Burning," about the 1970s Yankees, in which he portrayed the team executive Gabe Paul.
He made good use of his compelling, slightly raspy voice as well, providing narration for television shows and commercials. He warned New Yorker subway riders to say something if they saw something. He was the voice of Mark Twain in a 2001 Ken Burns documentary. At about the same time, he was the creepy Control Voice for a remake of the science-fiction anthology series "The Outer Limits."
"There is nothing wrong with your television," he advised viewers as eerie static materialized. "Do not attempt to adjust the picture."
Kevin John Conway was born on May 29, 1942, in Harlem to James and Margaret (Sanders) Conway. His father was a mechanic, and his mother worked for the telephone company.
After graduating from Bishop Loughlin High School in Brooklyn in 1959, he spent time in the Navy and then took a job at IBM, starting in the mailroom and working his way up to sales. On a whim he enrolled in nighttime acting classes. Eventually, he said, he asked IBM to fire him so that he could collect unemployment while pursuing an acting career.
He began getting stage roles and delivering charged, attention-getting performances.
In the early 1970s he was in a long-running Off Broadway revival of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Dale Wasserman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about an asylum, playing the wildly disruptive McMurphy, the role played by Kirk Douglas in 1963 on Broadway and by Jack Nicholson in the 1975 film.
In 1973 he had another Off Broadway success in Mark Medoff's "When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?," playing an amped-up man with a gun who disrupts a diner.
"Mr. Conway lights up the stage with his half-amused, half-vicious personification," Clive Barnes wrote in his review in The New York Times. "Rarely can alienation have been exposed so mercilessly and, this is revealing, so understandingly."
An entirely different sort of role came his way in 1979, when he played Frederick Treves, the doctor who befriends the title character in "The Elephant Man," Bernard Pomerance's play about a Victorian-era Englishman with deformities. Treves was nothing like the brash extroverts Mr. Conway usually played, and nothing like Mr. Conway himself.
"Treves is much more uptight than a modern character," Mr. Conway told The Times. "He's a guy who tends to sit on his emotions, whereas my instinct is to let them go."
He reprised the role in a 1982 television version of the play.
Relatively early in his career, though, Mr. Conway realized that he wasn't destined to be a marquee star. "I don't envision posters of me hung on the walls of bedrooms of young girls," he told The Boston Globe in 1978.
"Yet," he added, "someone like Laurence Olivier gets better as he gets older."
As Mr. Conway got older, the fiery young characters gave way to more mature ones, requiring a restrained bluster or even pathos.
In a 1995 attempt to adapt the 1954 film "On the Waterfront" into a stage play, he was the racketeering boss Johnny Friendly, the role played by Lee J. Cobb in the movie. The Broadway production closed quickly, but Mr. Conway drew praise. "Easily the most riveting contribution is Mr. Conway's as the murderous union boss," Vincent Canby wrote in an otherwise unenthusiastic review in The Times.
In the film "13 Days" (2000), about the Cuban missile crisis, Mr. Conway was the hawkish Gen. Curtis LeMay, who locks horns with the Kennedy brothers. In "Invincible," a 2006 movie about Vince Papale, who made the roster of the Philadelphia Eagles as a 30-year-old rookie, he played Papale's father, a man who is not used to showing emotion but who chokes up with pride at his son's accomplishment. (Mark Wahlberg played Vince.)
Mr. Conway also directed plays, including several productions of Jerry Sterner's "Other People's Money," in which he starred when it played Off Broadway in 1989.
Mr. Conway's marriage to Mila Burnette ended in divorce. Ms. Newman said that in addition to her, Mr. Conway, an animal advocate, would have listed his survivors as his three beloved pets: a cat, Chico, and two dogs, Cotton and Dorothy.
Decades earlier, when appearing in "The Elephant Man," he would sometimes think of another pet dog, Jingles, when conjuring up the tenderness his character was feeling toward Merrick, the Elephant Man.
"It's not that the relationship is that of dog and master," he explained to The Times, "but that a pet will sometimes do something that really pleases you. Well, Merrick occasionally does things that surprise and delight Treves."

Texto completo: It was #OscarsSoPittsburgh from the start on Sunday.
The 2020 Academy Awards opened with Janelle Monae walking onto a re-created "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" set, changing into a red sweater and singing, "It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood." Then she threw it off to join with Billy Porter - decked out in a floor-length gold coat and red satin jumpsuit - singing "I'm Still Standing," before a number that celebrated many of the non-nominees.
The supposedly host-less ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles then moved into traditional co-host territory with Steve Martin and Chris Rock. Before the awards and opening, came the red carpet. And the most anticipated look came early in the night.
Porter, the Pittsburgh native who has traversed red carpets and earned wows for the past year, did not disappoint at the Oscars.
Wearing a custom couture creation by British designer Giles Deacon, Porter was an early arrival at the 92nd Academy Awards Sunday afternoon. Later he worked as a red carpet host for ABC's broadcast.
The "Pose" Emmy winner told The New York Times that the outfit - which featured a sleeveless bodice with gilded foil feathers and a huge, sweeping printed skirt - was inspired by Kensington Palace and its golden splendor.
Sammy Ratelle styled Porter, the Tony- and Grammy-winning star of "Kinky Boots," who wore shoes by Jimmy Choo.
Porter became an instant fashion icon at last year's Oscars, wearing a velvet tuxedo gown created by Christian Siriano. It put him on the map as the King of the Red Carpet, so dubbed by E! Network commentators early Sunday, and by the millions of people who made it Google's most-searched fashion moment of 2019.
He went on to be the men's ambassador to New York Fashion Week and won the Met Gala, according to Vogue, by arriving dressed as a Sun God and carried on a litter by six shirtless golden men.
Still, it was the 2019 Oscars look that started the conversation about Porter's gender-fluid fashion and gave him a red-carpet platform to express his activism, particularly for LGBTQ+ causes. The gown and Porter were back in the news in recent weeks because he was photographed wearing it to film an episode of "Sesame Street" for HBO.
Porter wore a second, more streamlined Siriano look in 2019 to chat up that year's Oscar nominees. He did not change Sunday, going from red carpet royalty to preshow interviewer still wearing Oscars gold.

Iowa Democrats Give Buttigieg the Most Delegates; Sanders Seeks Recanvass

Texto completo: Errors in the results have led The Times and others to refrain from calling the race, and the Sanders campaign manager said a partial recanvass of precincts could change the outcome.
DES MOINES -- Nearly a full week after the Iowa caucuses, the state Democratic Party on Sunday released results indicating that Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the winner after it updated data from 55 precincts. But errors in the result tabulations have led several news organizations, including The New York Times, to refrain from calling the race.
And shortly after the party's announcement, Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said the campaign would be calling for a partial recanvass of the results. The deadline for a campaign to make such a request is noon Central time on Monday.
The party's re-examination did not change earlier projections that Mr. Buttigieg led in the count of national delegates, but it moved one more into his column. The party said that Mr. Buttigieg had received 14 delegates, Senator Bernie Sanders took 12, Senator Elizabeth Warren earned eight, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. received six and Senator Amy Klobuchar got one.
The Associated Press, which historically verifies election results and makes calls on the outcome of races, has not allotted the final delegate to Mr. Buttigieg because of the errors in the caucus results-counting, nor has The A.P. declared a winner in the Iowa race. The Times, which has followed The A.P.'s calls in the past, has not assigned the final delegate to Mr. Buttigieg.
In an interview with CNN, Mr. Shakir expressed confidence that Mr. Sanders would have the same number of national delegates as Mr. Buttigieg "after it's all said and done," suggesting that the Sanders campaign believed a recanvass could result in a delegate being reassigned from Mr. Buttigieg to Mr. Sanders.
A Sanders aide confirmed that the campaign would be seeking a partial recanvass of results. The Iowa Democratic Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In recent days Mr. Buttigieg has claimed to have won Iowa because he leads the delegate count by a thin margin, while Mr. Sanders claimed victory because he had the most total supporters in both rounds of voting on caucus night. A tally of another metric, "state delegate equivalents," showed an even tighter race: By the party's count, Mr. Buttigieg earned 564.302 and Mr. Sanders had 561.528 -- a difference of one-tenth of one percent of the total awarded.
The party's re-examination of the results -- after it failed to report results on Monday night, throwing the Democrats' nominating race into an uproar -- is unlikely to assure the candidates and voters. Internal Iowa Democratic Party emails over the weekend revealed that although the party was taking a second look at some problematic precincts, close to 5 percent of the total, it would not fix errors that occurred on the official handwritten tally sheets from precincts.
Those records are known as "caucus math worksheets." The party only corrected discrepancies between the data as recorded on the worksheets and what was officially reported in public releases of the results.
The party could not change even blatant miscalculations on the worksheets, according to a lawyer for the party, because they were a legal record and altering them would be a crime.
"The incorrect math on the Caucus Math Worksheets must not be changed to ensure the integrity of the process," wrote the party lawyer, Shayla McCormally, according to an email sent by Troy Price, the chairman of the party, to its central committee members. The lawyer said correcting the math would introduce "personal opinion" into the official record of results.
Thanks to greater transparency in reporting the caucus results this year, outsiders were able to identify internal inconsistencies. The New York Times reported last week that some precincts, for example, had awarded more delegates to candidates than they were allotted.
In addition, caucus "captains" for individual candidates photographed the worksheets in their precincts and shared them internally with their campaigns. Those photographs provided further examples of problems. The most blatant were errors in adding up votes for candidates, which take place in two rounds, and miscalculations when using a formula that translates raw votes to "state delegate equivalents."
But because the caucus chair and secretary of each precinct had certified the results on the worksheets, along with representatives of candidates, the documents could not be readjusted without violating election law, the state party lawyer said.
"It is the legal voting record of the caucus, like a ballot," Ms. McCormally wrote in her opinion. "The seriousness of the record is made clear by the language at the bottom stating that any misrepresentation of the information is a crime. Therefore, any changes or tampering with the sheet could result in a claim of election interference or misconduct."
"The I.D.P.'s role is to facilitate the caucus and tabulate the results," Ms. McCormally continued. "Any judgment of math miscalculations would insert personal opinion into the process by individuals not at the caucus and could change the agreed upon results. That action would be interfering with the caucus' expression of their preferences. There are various reasons that the worksheets have errors and may appear to not be accurate, however changing the math would change the information agreed upon and certified by the caucusgoers."
Mr. Sanders said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that the Iowa contest had been "an embarrassment" and "a disgrace."
"They screwed it up badly, is what the Iowa Democratic Party did," Mr. Sanders said.
In response to pressure by candidates and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, the Iowa state party permitted campaigns to flag precincts that had problems. On Saturday, it said 95 had been identified by three campaigns, those of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren. Only 55 required updating, it said.
The party had notified campaigns that it would re-examine reported results if presented with "documentary evidence" of "inconsistencies" between the data on the worksheets and the reported results. "The inconsistencies must show a discrepancy between the Caucus Math Worksheet and the publicly reported results," the party told campaigns.
In the party lawyer's opinion, the only recourse a campaign has if it wants to challenge the worksheets themselves is to seek a recount, which would require examining "presidential preference cards" filled out by everyone who attended the caucuses. These cards were collected at the end of the evening, and were included in a packet that was sent to state party headquarters by the caucus chairs.
But even a full recount may not be definitive. Several caucus chairs said in interviews that not all caucusgoers had turned in their preference cards. They left into the Iowa evening after performing a proud civic duty, with no hint of the mess to come.

Texto completo: Without a host for a second year, the ceremony offered a grab bag of emotional moments and head-scratching choices.
The Oscars are now an ensemble production.
Last year, after the fiasco of Kevin Hart's dropping out as host after a backlash against his history of homophobic jokes, the Oscars went stag to its own party. The broadcast was brisk and entertaining, the ratings for the hostless event rose and the awards show decided to leave the post vacant.
This can work, as it did last year, especially with clever set pieces and some awards-magic serendipity. But one thing a host can do is give the broadcast a shape and a voice when nothing else provides them.
And this year's show seemed to feel the vacuum more, turning out a grab bag of emotional high moments and perplexing uses of time.
The hostless show opened with Janelle Monáe donning a Mister Rogers cardigan and belting out a medley with backup dancers and lyrics that rhymed "Parasites" and "Dolemites," followed by a quick, hit-and-miss joint monologue by former hosts Steve Martin and Chris Rock. ("This is such an incredible demotion!" Martin marveled.)
Ditching a host can help the show run on time (this one did not, and not only because of Joaquin Phoenix's extended argument for veganism). It can leave room for unscripted awards moments. But it loses one of the functions of the awards show host in recent years: to be the elephant-in-the-room pointer, the joker, lowercase, who acknowledges the industry's failures and embarrassments.
In this case, the Oscars' most noted offscreen controversy -- the glaring whiteness and maleness of many of the major categories and movies -- didn't get quite the airing an extended monologue might have delivered.
The collective did get in a few shots. Rock jibed that Cynthia Erivo, nominated for playing Harriet Tubman, must have hidden all the black nominees, while Monáe said, "We celebrate all the women who directed phenomenal films" (something the best director nominations pointedly didn't).
This anarchist collective of a ceremony ended up being a sort of anthology of mini-shows, hosted by a string of presenters. Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig won Best Audition for a Future Awards Show, nailing a tight a cappella duet medley themed to the best costume design category. James Corden and Rebel Wilson, in costume from "Cats," spoofed the uncanny-valley horror of that movie: "Nobody more than us understands the importance of good visual effects."
There was also a string of questionable choices, starting with a bizarre Russian-doll approach in which several of the presenters were introduced by their own presenters. (The show did recognize that some stars, like the musical guest Elton John, needed no introduction.) There was, for some reason, a musical recap of the program halfway through, rapped by Utkarsh Ambudkar.
In another puzzling musical decision, Eminem performed "Lose Yourself," his nearly two-decade-old rap anthem from "Eight Mile." (He followed a film montage, which followed an introduction by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who followed an introduction by Anthony Ramos. It was quite a journey.)
It may have worked in the room, and in the living rooms of viewers who still have the song on their workout playlist. But energizing the show with nostalgia for a 2002 soundtrack feels a little passive-aggressive toward the movies of 2019.
The ceremony was most effective when it simply got out of the way of its stars' shine. Erivo burned down the house with a performance of "Stand Up," from "Harriet" (for which she was also nominated as an actress). There was a meltingly tender Hollywood family moment when Laura Dern shared her first Oscar, for supporting actress in "Marriage Story," with "my acting heroes, my legends, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern." And last year's best actress, Olivia Colman, shared a side effect of winning a statuette: "Last year was the best night of my husband's life."
At its absolute best, this Oscars succeeded with what you can't script: great artists being recognized, and recognizing others. The room exploded for the surprise best-picture win for "Parasite," the class-conscious film from director Bong Joon Ho.
When Bong collected the best director award earlier in the evening, he saluted Martin Scorsese and the other nominees in the category, saying through a translator: "I would like to get a Texas chain saw, split the Oscar trophy into five and share it with all of you."
Then he switched to English to sign off: "Thank you. I will drink until next morning." A sentiment that, at the end of a long and formless awards show, plenty of us can also share.

SOCIALISTS IN THE WOODWORK OUR PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION PROCESS SUFFERS FROM "DEMOCRACY FUNDAMENTALISM"

Texto completo: In 1964, an optimistic theory was slain, as such theories often are, by reality. Bernie Sanders' supporters should take note. So should all who are interested in rethinking how the parties choose presidential nominees.
The "conservatives in the woodwork" theory was: Millions of conservatives, bored by centrist presidential candidates, skipped elections but would pour out of the woodwork and into polling places if offered "a choice, not an echo." So, conservative Republicans achieved the nomination of Barry Goldwater, who then lost 44 states, partly because those swarms of nonvoting conservatives were mostly fictitious. A conservative majority had to be patiently made, which took 16 years.
Goldwater understood that after President John F. Kennedy's assassination a distraught nation would not choose to have a third president in 14 months. But he also thought that his candidacy could make his party markedly more conservative. If Mr. Sanders has a "socialists in the woodwork" theory, he is daft. But some Sanders supporters might think a second Donald Trump term is an acceptable price to pay for a Sanders nomination that moves his party as dramatically leftward as Goldwater's nomination moved his party rightward.
The nation, however, needs a nominating process that minimizes the probability of kamikaze candidacies and maximizes the probability of selecting plausible presidents. Hence it needs a retreat from the populist idea that the voice of the people is easy to ascertain and should be translated, unmediated and unrefined, directly into nominee selection. Populism has been embraced by both parties since 1968, when Hubert Humphrey won the Democrats' nomination without entering any primaries. (Although a switch of about 300,000 November votes spread over four states would have made him president.)
In 1972, Democrats made their process more plebiscitary - more primaries, less influence for political professionals - in order to elicit and echo the vox populi. This, however, produced a nominee favored by the party's most intense minority, the anti-Vietnam war cohort: South Dakota Sen. George McGovern lost 49 states. Twelve presidential election cycles later, both parties are still uncomfortably holding the populist wolf by the ears.
Political scientist Raymond J. La Raja and Jonathan Rauch of the Brookings Institution recommend a recalibration. They do not favor what political realities would not permit - abandoning primaries (Mr. La Raja and Mr. Rauch prefer them to caucuses, which are more susceptible to capture by the elderly and those "for whom politics is a passion"). Rather, they recommend leavening mass participation with vetting by professionals - "political careerists with skin in the game" serving as gatekeepers or quality-control evaluators of candidates before the primaries begin. "In 2018, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee worked aggressively to weed out weak and extreme candidates in swing districts."
Doing something similar in presidential politics is difficult. The process has no gatekeepers: Remember the 2012 cycle, when Herman Cain had his 15 minutes as a front-runner? Misguided campaign finance regulations have diverted money away from experienced parties to unseasoned groups with minority agendas. The 2016 process illustrated the difficulty of aggregating voters' preferences when there are many candidates: A demagogic charlatan won without winning a majority of primary votes until after the nomination was effectively settled. Mr. Sanders' success so far this year demonstrates Mr. La Raja and Mr. Rauch's warning that in a congested field of candidates, many will shun coalition-building in favor of wooing purists.
In 1924, the parties' professionals blocked the presidential ambitions of industrialist Henry Ford, a racist and anti-Semite. In 1976, Democratic insiders helped clear the field in Florida's presidential primary to enable Jimmy Carter to end the candidacy of the racist George Wallace. Today, however, the power of party professionals is negligible compared to that of the media. They prefer flamboyant political showhorses to transactional, coalition-building workhorses, and become accomplices of fringe candidates and combative amateurs.
Mr. La Raja and Mr. Rauch suggest various "filters" by political professionals to mitigate the "democracy fundamentalism" of today's nomination process: e.g., more political professionals as "superdelegates" eligible to vote on conventions' first ballots; pre-primary votes of confidence in candidates by members of Congress and governors; "abolishing or dramatically increasing" contribution limits to the parties. But a precondition for all improvement is, they acknowledge, "to change the mindset that regards popular elections as the only acceptable way to choose nominees."
Limiting and influencing voters' choices by involving professional politicians early in the nomination process would require risk-averse political professionals to go against today's populist sensibility. But if this November the choice is between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the professionals might consider letting go of the wolf's ears.

Texto completo: Here are the winners of the 92nd Academy Awards.
The South Korean comedy thriller "Parasite" made history, becoming the first foreign-language film to win best picture. It also took home the awards for best original screenplay and international feature film, while Bong Joon Ho won best directing.
"1917," the World War I drama from Sam Mendes, won three awards, for best visual effects, cinematography and sound mixing. Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman" had 10 nominations, yet it left empty-handed.
Joaquin Phoenix won best actor for "Joker," while Renée Zellweger won best actress for "Judy."
Our television critic said this year's hostless show offered a grab bag of emotional moments and head-scratching choices.
Janelle Monáe made a pointed comment in her opening number about female filmmakers, who were noticeably absent from the best director category.

Are you ready for some more pro football? Sorry, XFL, the answer is simply no.

Texto completo: The XFL is back. Ask not why but why now ?
The reboot of the XFL just debuted " the weekend after the Super Bowl . That's like having a sewerage commission election the Tuesday after the presidential election.
They start playing XFL games on the heels of the NFL's grandest game?
That's like going to Paris, Tex., right after going to Paris, France.
That's like ordering a New York strip at Sizzler right after ordering the porterhouse at Peter Luger.
That's like visiting the border wall right after visiting the Great Wall of China.
That's like watching 17 years of Jimmy Kimmel right after watching 17 years of Johnny Carson.
(I will stop now because I think you all get the point and, frankly, I'm even starting to annoy myself.)
How badly do you need to see more football six or seven days after the Kansas City Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV?
And when I say 'more football,' I mean the XFL, where the 'X' stands for Xtraneous, Xcessive, Xasperating, Xpendable and inXplicable.
We don't need more football.
We certainly don't need year-round football; we don't need year-round anything .
I mean, I'm a big fan of food detox, but there is a big difference between a 14-day cleanse and, say, a 365-day cleanse. Trust me; you would be cleansed well before the 365-day mark.
The XFL, which fabulously failed during its one-season incarnation in 2001, has returned to prove again that few people want to watch more pro football after the NFL signs off for six months.
The expression is 'March showers bring April flowers,' not 'XFL passes bring spring masses.'
Nobody is thinking about RPOs in March and April. It would be as if hockey " training camp to Stanley Cup finals " decided to consume 10 months of the calendar.
(Editor's note: Actually, the NHL already does this. We would have deleted the previous paragraph, but Mr. Chad is contractually obligated to provide us 800 words per week.)
The new XFL consists of eight teams " in seven NFL cities, plus St. Louis " playing a 10-game schedule.
Out of professional responsibility to Sports Nation, I decided to take in the XFL's Opening Day. On ABC, it was the Seattle Dragons at the DC Defenders; on Fox, it was my Los Angeles Wildcats " I'm thinking about season tickets, but I figure I can find cheap seats on the secondary market " at the Houston Roughnecks.
This is what I saw and heard:
l ABC's excitable Steve Levy: 'The first carry " everything's a first!'
l Analyst Greg McElroy: 'If you look at Ja'Quan Gardner . . . probably not a name you recognize.' Uh, you think?
l McElroy was intent on emphasizing that these players were THIS CLOSE to being in the NFL, much as I am THIS CLOSE to writing for the New York Times.
l With 11:25 left in the first quarter, the crowd chanted, 'MVP! MVP!' for Defenders quarterback Cardale Jones. Now that's funny.
l Defenders fans, thinking they were at a R*dsk*ns game, started booing the home team early in the second quarter.
l Fox analyst Joel Klatt never stopped talking. He's still talking right now as you read this.
l We got to hear the coach or offensive coordinator calling the plays from the sideline, which captivated me almost as much as hearing the pimply kid shout out my order at Wienerschnitzel.
(Memo to the Houston Astros: In the XFL, you don't need to steal signs; you can just listen to the other coach telling you the next play on live TV.)
Anyway, the football was entertaining, and many XFL rule changes will be keepers. But for all the bells and whistles, it doesn't alter the inescapable fact that we are not pining for more football over the next 75 days.
The XFL is the proverbial tree falling in the forest that no one hears, so does it make a sound?
In this respect, it resembles most Couch Slouch columns " exquisitely written, extraordinarily unread.
Ask The Slouch Q . Did someone forget to tell Joel Embiid that the Philadelphia 76ers aren't tanking anymore? (Dan Cantwell; Albany, N.Y.)
A . Speaking of which, I guess the Process is complete " the 76ers are now trading away draft picks.
Q . With Bob Knight ending his 20-year split with Indiana, did that give you any thoughts about your first marriage? (Ken Ryan; Huntsville, Ala.)
A . I would have to violate a court order.
Q . Shouldn't fellow Vienna, Va., resident Terry Golden get a bonus " say, an extra 50 cents " for having the most questions answered in your column? (Jan-Peter Ozga, Vienna, Va.)
A . Listen, pal, Mr. Golden has built an addition to his home off Ask The Slouch winnings. You want me to INCREASE his windfall? You send him the extra half-buck, and I will sign the card.
Q. Is it true that the NFL will be using the Iowa caucuses app to speed up the replay process? (Terry Golden; Vienna, Va.)

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Kyle Johnson can't enter his high-rise apartment tower outside Shanghai without being greeted by men in white biosafety suits who take his temperature each time to check for signs of the coronavirus.
Although he's hundreds of miles from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak of the deadly flu-like illness began, the international school where the Kentucky native teaches history is closed, along with many local shops and restaurants. Taxi drivers who ferry him for groceries wear face masks. The area has a 9p.m. curfew.
"It feels a little like a ghost town," said Johnson, who grew up in Woodford County and lived for a time in Louisville before taking a teaching job in China about six months ago.
The death toll for the coronavirus outbreak was at more than 700 Friday, with almost all of those in China.
Just 12 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. and other nations have moved to temporarily block the entry of noncitizens from China, and hundreds of Americans who were evacuated from China are being quarantined for two weeks.
In China, officials have restricted people's movement and closed some public transit in hopes of containing the virus.
All that has left Johnson holed up in his apartment in China, where authorities have extended the Lunar New Year holiday break well into February to reduce the virus's spread. That decision has left Johnson's school closed for the rest of the month.
He has decided to stay put and is unlikely to return home anytime soon. Multiple airlines have halted or curtailed China flights.
"I saw that U.S. citizens coming to America from China had to spend two weeks in quarantine anyway, so I'd be doing the same thing, hanging out and watching movies," he said.
One woman and her 8-year-old daughter with Kentucky ties living in Wuhan were among those evacuated by a U.S. chartered flight last week, WLEX-TV reported.
The woman filmed her trip to the airport, which showed eerily empty streets.
In Kentucky, the virus has upended travel plans for employees of businesses such as Papa John's International and led universities to cancel travel to China study programs. They have urged students to adhere to U.S. State Department warnings against traveling to China.
The University of Kentucky, which had one staffer stuck in the quarantine zone in China while visiting for a funeral, hosts more than 500 Chinese students on campus. Many are worried about family, rescheduling trips and unsure when they can return, officials said.
"They're all in contact with families" on social media, said Huajing Maske, executive director of UK's Confucius Institute and director of the Office of China Initiatives.
Zhizhi Wang, 25, a graduate finance student, said his family is hunkered down in Yueyang, about a 30-minute train ride from Wuhan. From Lexington, he's been in touch daily on WeChat.
"When the Wuhan government issued a city lockdown, 10,000 people fled the city and camped in my hometown. That's when we freaked out," he said. "I told my family, just don't go out. You never know who you're going to bump into."
Cases have grown in the last week. "It's pretty scary," he said.
Some residents are afraid to visit those in hospitals and New Year's celebrations are taking place on social media video, not in person.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Wuhan officials had been ordered to round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.
In Kentucky, Wang has seen reported instances on Chinese American community social media chats of schoolkids being subject to phrases such as "Chinese virus, stay away!" he said, with many feeling that referring to it a "Chinese virus" was discriminatory.
Chang Zheng Wang, of Lexington, past president of the Kentucky Chinese American Association, said his relatives "are still safe, they're just stuck in the house every day. All the trains, buses, public transport is stopped, people can't go anywhere. One of my nieces works in a hospital, and they're seeing a lot of (coronavirus) patients."
Central China's Hubei province has added thousands of beds by building two new hospitals and creating quarantine centers.
The province has been in virtual lockdown, and international news has shown quiet, empty streets and residents staying distracted with television and food delivery.
CNN reported that social media videos show people coming up with all kinds of activities to kill time, including playing pingpong on dinner tables.
Far to the east, Johnson, who teaches at Kang Chiao International School, where students prepare to study at colleges in the U.S., has been largely stuck inside the apartment building he shares with other foreign teachers. Many had left for the break and have delayed their return.
Government workers came to his door to ask about his travel history, he said. And while public transportation has been shut down in some areas, buses still run where he lives.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - In the years before the helicopter crash that killed the basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people, the company operating the aircraft, Island Express Helicopters, had a series of disputes over its safety practices, according to federal accident reports and a former federal safety inspector.
The tensions first came to the attention of federal investigators in 2008, when a fatal accident involving an Island Express helicopter revealed disagreements that had been playing out for years behind the scenes. A Federal Aviation Administration operations inspector assigned to oversee the company, then under a previous owner, had been pushing for more stringent safety practices, according to federal records. The company's president at the time pushed back, asking the FAA to assign a different inspector.
The inspector, Gary Lackey, who agreed to step aside, said he was concerned that the company seemed unwilling to spend the money necessary to improve safety beyond what was minimally required.
"Everything that involves safety usually involves money also," Lackey, who is now retired, said in an interview. "I think they were trying to cut corners."
Before the tragedy involving Bryant, Island Express had four crashes since 1985 that damaged or destroyed helicopters, all under the company's previous management, according to records.
Tensions over the company's safety culture simmered even after the 2008 crash as the company came under new management several years later, according to people involved in the discussions.
The FAA recorded an additional "incident" in the summer of 2018, when two Island Express helicopters were started up too close to one another, causing significant damage to the blades on both aircraft.
As recently as 2017, Kurt Deetz, a pilot and former safety manager at Island Express, resigned from his safety responsibilities, he said, over "differences of opinion" about how the company's safety management system should be run.
It is not known what caused last month's crash. Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board said they are looking at a range of potential issues, ranging from weather to mechanical problems. A key question is whether the Island Express pilot attempted to fly into thickening clouds and fog; NTSB investigators have asked for the public's help in gathering photographs of weather conditions near the scene of the crash.
Island Express' general counsel, Teri Elizabeth Neville, declined to comment in detail until after investigators release their findings on the crash. In a telephone interview this week, Neville said she was not aware of disputes with safety officials and noted that the company's four crashes happened before the current management took over. She declined to say when that was, but state records and the company's website suggest it was in 2012 or 2013.
Lackey, who was the FAA's point person for Island Express off and on during his 17 years at the agency, said the tensions between him and the company's management began sometime around 2005, and NTSB records show that he issued warning letters to the company.
The records also show that the company's former owner, John Moore, pushed back against Lackey's efforts - in particular, his recommendations to tighten safety procedures on refueling, operating rotors when passengers were boarding, and operations at a helipad in San Pedro, California, that Lackey felt were unsafe. The company also protested when Lackey failed a pilot on a proficiency check.
Discussions over flying in bad weather came up with all helicopter companies, Lackey said. Though federal regulations allow helicopter flights in relatively low visibility, given their ability to fly very slowly when necessary, Lackey said he urged charter operators to consider the risks of doing so and advised them in such cases to land the aircraft and wait for the weather to clear.
He was aware that companies had to balance safety with the need to complete the jobs they were hired to do, he said, and those that did not deliver their customers on time might find their clients going to another operator.
Island Express was one of the few companies to go to Lackey's managers to challenge his oversight, he said. After a series of clashes, the FAA in 2008 assigned a new principal operations inspector for the company, records show.
"When John came in and said he wanted a new POI, I said, 'Fine, you can have somebody else,"' Lackey said, referring to Moore. Lackey said he felt the new person would also be vigilant about safety and that it was an opportunity to reset what had become a contentious relationship.
In a statement, the FAA said it could not comment on an individual case, but that it was not uncommon to periodically rotate inspectors to new assignments. "All aviation safety inspectors are qualified to perform the oversight work they are assigned," the statement said.
Lackey said he was assigned once again to oversee Island Express in subsequent years and found that Moore seemed more willing to accept FAA safety requests. The relationship improved, Lackey said, until new owners and managers took over at Island Express.
After that, Lackey said, some of the old conflicts began to reemerge. Once again, the company argued for a different inspector, but this time, Lackey said, he did not recall a change taking place in response to the request.
Accident and aviation experts said that tensions between aircraft companies and local FAA inspectors are not uncommon. But short of gross incompetence on the part of the inspector, they said, it is highly unusual for an inspector to be replaced at the suggestion of a regulated company. In his interview with NTSB investigators after the 2008 crash, Moore did not raise any issues about Lackey's competence, acknowledging that the inspector "knows his stuh."
Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said that "a personality clash between an operator and an inspector" is not uncommon.
"It's less frequent that an operator would hold sway over the FAA," he said. "It would have to be something that rises to the level of getting the attention of upper FAA management to say, 'Let's get this inspector off and get another inspector."'
Moore did not respond to a message seeking comment.
Deetz, the former safety manager who also flew Bryant as a pilot for Island Express, said that proactively managing safety within the company had been part of his job.
He said he established safety protocols for the company and convened a quarterly meeting with pilots and maintenance employees to discuss safety issues. But he said it was the company's owners who usually dealt directly with the FAA, and he was unaware of any disputes with federal regulators during his time at the company.
Deetz declined to elaborate on the specific dispute with company management that prompted him to resign from his position as safety manager sometime in 2017. "It all goes back to culture," he said. "There is window-dressing safety, and there is real, actual, get-your-hands-dirty safety culture."
He later left the company altogether to take a pilot position with a competitor and now hies air ambulances in Arizona.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. was poised to run for New York City mayor in the 2021, but he recently dropped a bomb in announcing that he was not only abandoning the race and retiring from politics after 22 years.
Diaz, 46, made the announcement in The New York Times during an interview saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family. He will not seek any other political office once his term as borough president ends in 2021.
"This decision is final, and no length of additional time will change that," he said in a statement. "Many New Yorkers have committed to support my future in numerous ways, and making this announcement now gives them enough time to make different plans."
Diaz was in a somewhat crowded pool of other mayoral hopefuls, who include Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, City Comptroller Scott Stringer and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson.
Diaz was first elected to political office in 1997 at age 23 when he was elected to the New York State Assembly, making him one of the youngest people ever elected to the governing body. He is the son of current City Council member and former state Sen. Ruben Diaz Sr.

U avoids hysteria but wary of virus

Texto completo: Zi Ting Wang returned to the University of Minnesota two weeks ago after visiting family in Zhe Jiang, China, where her parents remain quarantined at home amid the coronavirus outbreak.
She arrived back at a campus just beginning to face the outbreak as it threatens to take root in this country. Some students have been seen wearing medical masks, and the university has placed sanitation stations around campus, offering free tissue, hand sanitizer and medical masks.
"My parents are always warning me to wash your hands frequently, don't talk with anybody outside of the home and to just keep in touch," Wang said.
Minnesota's flagship university is among a growing number of higher education institutions across the country where health officials are balancing the need to inform their students about the rapidly spreading virus without exaggerating the threat and nudging their campuses toward hysteria.
The dilemma is particularly acute at the university, which is home to 3,000 Chinese students and 230 Chinese professors and staff who are constantly traveling back and forth to their home country.
The campus is not in panic mode over the virus, said Dave Golden, director of public health and communications for the U's Boynton Health. His office is continually updating a health alert webpage as the virus spreads across the country.
The U suspended its study abroad programming in China for this spring semester and Golden has fielded a few inquiries from staff at the U wondering if an Asian student exhibiting signs of a cold or flu should be allowed in class. The answer is yes, he said.
The campus pharmacy has sold about 8,000 boxes of medical masks, with more on order, and students have picked clean the boxes of free masks at the campus sanitation stations. But the run on masks is not a fresh sign of panic.
Wang said she knows students who have bought them to send to family and friends in China, where there are widespread shortages. So far China has reported 24,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and nearly 500 deaths.
Jasmine Hak, 22, of Chanhassen, who's of Chinese and Cambodian heritage, said her concerns are more about the spread of suspicion or mistrust of Asians rather than the virus itself. She said the virus is "not an excuse to be racist."
U professor Erika Lee said coronavirus is sparking widespread xenophobia directed toward Asians. Though Lee has not experienced this personally, she's read reports from across the country about Asian students being viewed with suspicion. A professor at the University of Connecticut is chronicling such accounts and news reports.
"Targeting Asian or Asian-appearing individuals when they cough and accusing them of being sick and them spreading viruses, there's a real racial layering that's happening with that behavior. And what I've been helping to illustrate is just how deep rooted the idea is that immigrants are carriers of dangerous diseases," Lee said.
Joan Brzezinski, executive director of the UMN China Center, said "viruses don't discriminate -- they will attack and hurt anyone."
College and university campuses are particularly prone to the rapid spread of viruses and other illnesses. Tight quarters where students learn, gather and recreate allows illness to spread rapidly. For their part, college dorms can quickly magnify an outbreak.
The University of Massachusetts Boston and Arizona State University each have a confirmed case of coronavirus, fueling fears and emergency responses.
Two students from Wuhan at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville were placed in special on-campus housing, as reported by the New York Times, but the university has since announced the 14-day incubation period set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had passed.
So far, the virus has not hit Minnesota, where three suspected cases of coronavirus all tested negative. In the U.S., there are 12 confirmed cases and 76 pending.
A new case was confirmed in neighboring Wisconsin at the UW Health Hospital. It's unknown if the patient diagnosed with the novel virus last week is a student or employee of UW-Madison.
The patient recently returned from Beijing after traveling to the virus' country of origin for the Chinese New Year. Many international students, including those at the U Twin Cities campus, had similar travel plans.
Golden, Boynton's spokesman, said the University of Minnesota's response to the coronavirus is much more muted than the last big outbreak, influenza H1N1, in 2009. When H1N1 hit, he said hundreds of U students were quarantined in dorms.
With the coronavirus, Golden said, a couple of them were placed in isolation rooms at Boynton for screening as a precautionary measure. Students with flu-like symptoms who recently traveled to China and have a cough or fever are being asked to come into Boynton for screening.
Meanwhile, health officials are carefully measuring their response to the coronavirus amid a looming threat from a far more common and dangerous virus with similar symptoms. So far this flu season, the number of influenza-related deaths in Minnesota has reached 42.
Brzezinski said there has been a lot of calming coronavirus communication on campus.
"Everyone here is on top of anticipating what messages need to go out so people feel comfortable and informed," she said.

When Garbo fled Palm Beach

Texto completo: In the movie “Grand Hotel,” Greta Garbo uttered the line that came to define her: “I want to be alone.” But if that’s what she really wanted, she should have never come to Palm Beach.
Eighty years ago this month, the enigmatic Garbo — one of Hollywood’s most glamorous and mysterious
stars — arrived on the island accompanied by her diet guru and supposed love interest, Gayelord Hauser.
She planned a discreet sojourn at the height of see-and-be-seen Season. Naturally, it didn’t work out that way.
The reserved, privacy-obsessed Garbo — dubbed the Swedish Sphinx by a press that breathlessly tracked her every move — checked into the Whitehall Hotel, which then was a 300-room, ten-story add-on at the back of Henry Flagler’s landmark mansion along Cocoanut Row. Being Garbo, she commanded the best room, a penthouse suite with spacious terraces and stunning waterfront views.
But she fled the island four days later. Reports said she couldn‘t bear the attention of Palm Beach’s jewel-encrusted social set, proving that even jaded boldfacers can gawk like the rest of us when a luminous star shoots across their horizon.
Garbo had planned to stay here for two weeks. It would have overlapped with the announcement that she had received an Oscar nomination — her third —- for playing a Russian taskmaster softened up by a trip to Paris in Ernst Lubitsch’s exquisite comedy “Ninotchka.” (“Garbo Laughs!” went the ad campaign, one of the most famous in Hollywood history.)
Before arriving in Florida, gossip columnists were abuzz that Hauser, a Dr. Oz of his day but without a medical degree, had put Garbo on a vegetarian diet. And there was speculation that he would succeed where others had failed — wooing the reluctant star to the altar.
Well, the first mistake Garbo made in her quest for a quiet vacation was lunching at the same place as a Palm Beach Post reporter.
Garbo‘s diet: Buttermilk and hot vegetables
Entertainment columnist Emelie C. Keyes was noshing with her hubby and friends at The Alibi restaurant on Worth Avenue (where the Tory Burch boutique now stands). They were enjoying an afternoon on the sun-drenched patio when a friend whispered in Keyes’ ear:
“Don’t look now, but there’s Greta Garbo!”
Keyes immediately dropped all pretense of journalistic objectivity. She definitely gawked.
“Almost nose-diving into my cold roast beef and turkey in my excitement,” Keyes wrote, “I murmured an excuse for exchanging places with my husband, who had a chair with a view, and trusted that (Garbo) couldn’t see me staring through my sunglasses.”
It was front page news the next day, Feb. 9, 1940, in The Palm Beach Post: “Greta Garbo Laughs, Diets As She Pays Palm Beach Her First Visit With Dr. Hauser.“ She shared top of the page space with reports of the widening war in Europe.
There’s no indication in the story that she actually laughed. It might have been hard to tell since Garbo’s face, the subject of many a rapturous photo, was covered by an enormous sun-hat. But she was adhering to Hauser’s eating regimen, which he had imposed on other famous clients, such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
“The stories about the health diet that Dr. Hauser has put her on are NOT press agent fabrication,” Keyes wrote. “Sitting in a typical mid-winter Palm Beach setting, she drank her buttermilk, ate her vegetable salad and hot vegetables, (along) with fresh fruit for dessert.”
Hauser, whom Keyes described as strikingly handsome in a brown turtlenecked sweater, was very strict. “He personally made sure that the French dressing was made with lemon juice,” Keyes reported.
She also testified that Garbo did not exude Hollywood glamour. “She was just a tall, pale girl, with a tiny suspicion of sunburn, with long straight hair hanging from beneath the huge hat, who looked as though she might have benefited by some of the roast beef rather than the vegetarian luncheon she was consuming.”
Garbo’s penchant for “intensive secrecy,” as Keyes put it, extended to not signing the restaurant’s guest book. After lunch, her party slipped out a side entrance, jumped into a taxi for a block, got out of the taxi and sped off in another waiting car, Keyes reported.
But they were soon found at the Whitehall hotel, where Garbo was seen lunching with Hauser and business manager Frey Brown in the hotel’s Jardin Royal room. (She had a stalk of celery, leek soup, and a mixed green salad with avocados, tomatoes and lemon dressing.)
According to the Miami Herald, she also shopped on Worth Avenue, and only received two guests at her hotel suite: Antoine, the first of the celebrity hairdressers, and A. Atwater Kent, an inventor whose company mass-produced radios.
Socialites weren’t on her list. But islanders apparently started getting wind of Garbo’s presence and the Jardin Royal was “thronged with visitors” hoping to get a glimpse, the Post reported. This didn’t go over well with Garbo.
Four days after arriving at what the Herald described as “one of Palm Beach’s flossiest hotels,” she, Hauser and Brown decamped for Miami and the Keys.
“”Maybe Garbo’s Here to Escape Ogling,“ the Herald headline stated on Feb. 13.
“Ironically, it was...Palm Beach’s sophisticated socialites, who themselves go to great lengths to stay out of range of the curious, that caused La Garbo to cancel her plans for a considerable stay and skip,” the paper reported.
“The Great Garbo,” United Press added, was “fed up with the stares of Palm Beach’s socially prominent.”
By Feb. 15, Garbo and Hauser were spotted on a boat in the Keys and later in Nassau. When her yacht returned to Miami near the end of the month, some 300 fans and waiting press cooled their heels for hours hoping to meet Garbo. She stayed true to her solitary self, and escaped the boat cloaked in secrecy.
Surprisingly, considering Garbo’s quick exit from Palm Beach, the Post’s Keyes reported months later that she was looking on the island for a vacation villa.
Garbo and Hauser: A love of ‘caloric restriction’
As for her reputed romance with Hauser, it may or may not have happened, and, if true, he was probably seeking attention more than love. Life magazine reported that Hauser told press outlets before he came to Florida that he would marry Garbo while here. One Garbo biographer said Hauser’s relentless courting of publicity on that trip angered the star.
Also, there was the fact that he was gay. According to many accounts, Hauser and business manager Frey Brown were romantic partners. So Hauser was probably Garbo’s beard and she his. They remained lifelong friends, though, and she often stayed at his home during trips to Los Angeles.
Author Rebecca Harrington, in an article for the cut.com, speculated that Garbo and Hauser were “bonded” not by romance, but “by their love of caloric restriction.”
Nevertheless, Garbo didn’t stick with his diet for long. One month after their visit to Palm Beach, gossip columnist Sheilah Graham wrote, “Garbo is completely off the Hauser diet of nuts and carrot juice (and) eats meat twice a day, but dissipates possible fat by exercising violently for an hour and a half every morning.”
Hauser is mostly forgotten today, but he’s one of those curious semi-celebrities that every century produces. He believed foods had “curative power,” according to the New York Times, claiming that a healthy diet had once helped rid him of tuberculosis of the hip. His diet plan, which came with unsupported promises of longer life, was heavy on so-called “wonder foods,” including wheat germ, yogurt and blackstrap molasses.
In his heyday, Hauser was popular on the lecture circuit, “a charismatic speaker with a Liberace-like flirtatiousness with his almost entirely female audience,” according to writer Shoshi Parks. Among his engagements was a three-day series of lectures in 1928 at the West Palm Beach Woman’s Club.
Hauser had a newspaper column and wrote many books, including the bestseller “Look Younger, Live Longer.” He counted not just Garbo, but Hollywood legends Marlene Dietrich, Grace Kelly, Gloria Swanson and Ingrid Bergman among his followers.
While some call him one of the earliest proponents of natural, healthy eating, much of the medical community discounted his theories, and the government required him to truthfully label his products and stop claiming to be a doctor or scientist. He was essentially accused of being a quack.
But he lived to 89 and proved to be smart in more than marketing — according to the New York Times, he and Garbo owned and developed property on Beverly Hills’ pricey Rodeo Drive, making them landlords on one of America’s most upscale shopping streets. And to this day, Hauser, who died in 1984 (six years before Garbo), has his name on a series of diet products.
Author Harrington once tried the Garbo-Hauser diet, later incorporating it into a book about celebrities’ fad eating habits. She skipped Garbo’s three-week, spinach-only fast, but dutifully downed other Hauser specialties: celery loaf, wild rice hamburgers, raw eggs mixed in orange juice, molasses with yeast, etc.
After 10 days, she lost four pounds — and her mind.
No wonder Garbo “vanted” to be alone, Harrington concluded; it was the only way “she could bear the pain of such an insane eating regimen.”

Texto completo: In the movie “Grand Hotel,” Greta Garbo uttered the line that came to define her: “I want to be alone.” But if that’s what she really wanted, she should have never come to Palm Beach.
Eighty years ago this month, the enigmatic Garbo — one of Hollywood’s most glamorous and mysterious
stars — arrived on the island accompanied by her diet guru and supposed love interest, Gayelord Hauser.
She planned a discreet sojourn at the height of see-and-be-seen Season. Naturally, it didn’t work out that way.
The reserved, privacy-obsessed Garbo — dubbed the Swedish Sphinx by a press that breathlessly tracked her every move — checked into the Whitehall Hotel, which then was a 300-room, ten-story add-on at the back of Henry Flagler’s landmark mansion along Cocoanut Row. Being Garbo, she commanded the best room, a penthouse suite with spacious terraces and stunning waterfront views.
But she fled the island four days later. Reports said she couldn‘t bear the attention of Palm Beach’s jewel-encrusted social set, proving that even jaded boldfacers can gawk like the rest of us when a luminous star shoots across their horizon.
Garbo had planned to stay here for two weeks. It would have overlapped with the announcement that she had received an Oscar nomination — her third —- for playing a Russian taskmaster softened up by a trip to Paris in Ernst Lubitsch’s exquisite comedy “Ninotchka.” (“Garbo Laughs!” went the ad campaign, one of the most famous in Hollywood history.)
Before arriving in Florida, gossip columnists were abuzz that Hauser, a Dr. Oz of his day but without a medical degree, had put Garbo on a vegetarian diet. And there was speculation that he would succeed where others had failed — wooing the reluctant star to the altar.
Well, the first mistake Garbo made in her quest for a quiet vacation was lunching at the same place as a Palm Beach Post reporter.
Garbo’s diet: Buttermilk and hot vegetables
Entertainment columnist Emelie C. Keyes was noshing with her hubby and friends at The Alibi restaurant on Worth Avenue (where the Tory Burch boutique now stands). They were enjoying an afternoon on the sun-drenched patio when a friend whispered in Keyes’ ear:
“Don’t look now, but there’s Greta Garbo!”
Keyes immediately dropped all pretense of journalistic objectivity. She definitely gawked.
“Almost nose-diving into my cold roast beef and turkey in my excitement,” Keyes wrote, “I murmured an excuse for exchanging places with my husband, who had a chair with a view, and trusted that (Garbo) couldn’t see me staring through my sunglasses.”
It was front page news the next day, Feb. 9, 1940, in The Palm Beach Post: “Greta Garbo Laughs, Diets As She Pays Palm Beach Her First Visit With Dr. Hauser.“ She shared top of the page space with reports of the widening war in Europe.
There’s no indication in the story that she actually laughed. It might have been hard to tell since Garbo’s face, the subject of many a rapturous photo, was covered by an enormous sun-hat. But she was adhering to Hauser’s eating regimen, which he had imposed on other famous clients, such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
“The stories about the health diet that Dr. Hauser has put her on are NOT press agent fabrication,” Keyes wrote. “Sitting in a typical mid-winter Palm Beach setting, she drank her buttermilk, ate her vegetable salad and hot vegetables, (along) with fresh fruit for dessert.”
Hauser, whom Keyes described as strikingly handsome in a brown turtlenecked sweater, was very strict. “He personally made sure that the French dressing was made with lemon juice,” Keyes reported.
She also testified that Garbo did not exude Hollywood glamour. “She was just a tall, pale girl, with a tiny suspicion of sunburn, with long straight hair hanging from beneath the huge hat, who looked as though she might have benefited by some of the roast beef rather than the vegetarian luncheon she was consuming.”
Garbo’s penchant for “intensive secrecy,” as Keyes put it, extended to not signing the restaurant’s guest book. After lunch, her party slipped out a side entrance, jumped into a taxi for a block, got out of the taxi and sped off in another waiting car, Keyes reported.

Texto completo: Orson Bean
LOS ANGELES - Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian who enlivened the game show "To Tell the Truth" and played a crotchety merchant on "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91.
The Los Angeles County coroner's office confirmed Bean's Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a "traffic-related" fatality. The coroner's office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from police.
A man was crossing the road outside of a crosswalk in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Drake Madison said. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene, neither was impaired and Bean's death was being treated as an accident, Madison said.
Bean appeared in a number of films - notably, "Anatomy of a Murder" and "Being John Malkovich" - and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Comden-Green musical "Subways Are for Sleeping." But fans remembered him most for his many TV appearances from the 1950s onward.
"Mr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar," The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, "The Blue Angel." It said he showed "a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat."
Born in Burlington, Vt., in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist. He had picked the stage name Orson Bean "because it sounded funny."
His father, George, was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Bean recalled later that his "house was filled with causes." But he left home at 16 after his mother died by suicide.
In a 1983 New York Times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of "me - master of ceremonies, comedian and magician - maybe a dog act, and a stripper." It was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing Dallas Burrows with some funny name like "Roger Duck" - or Orson Bean.
Bean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on "To Tell the Truth." The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: "Will the real (notable's name) please stand up?"
Bean's style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on "The Tonight Show" more than 200 times.
But his early career was hobbled for a time when he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist in the early years of the Cold War.
"Basically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend," he explained in a 2001 interview. "I stopped working on TV for a year."
The blacklist didn't stop him in the theater. Bean starred on Broadway as a timid fan magazine writer in George Axelrod's 1955 Hollywood spoof "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" alongside Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau. He also starred on Broadway with Maureen O'Sullivan in "Never Too Late" and with Melina Mercouri in "Illya Darling," based on her hit film "Never on Sunday."
Bean took a break from his career for a time in the 1970s when he dropped out and moved to Australia, where he lived a hippie lifestyle. But he returned to the U.S. and - after a period as a self-described "house-husband" - resumed his career.
"I got sick of contemplating my navel and staring up at the sky and telling myself how wonderful it was not to be doing anything," he explained in a 1983 interview with The New York Times.
In the 1990s, he played the shopkeeper Loren Bray on the long-running drama "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." He remained active on the screen in recent years with guest shots in such shows as "Desperate Housewives," "How I Met Your Mother" and "Modern Family."
Meanwhile, his politics turned more conservative. His daughter married leading right-wing commentator, Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart's eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.
Bean wrote a memoir called "Too Much Is Not Enough" and a book about a non-traditional therapy called "Me and the Orgone."
He had already shown his interest in non-traditional thinking in 1964 when he bought a building in Manhattan and opened up a school based on the philosophy of Summerhill, the progressive British school founded by A.S. Neill.
"I said to myself, we have to start with the children. Why not start a school?" he told The New York Times.
That same year, he co-founded the Sons of the Desert, an organization dedicated to comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, with chapters around the world.
More recently, income from "Dr. Quinn" and other voice and acting work allowed Bean to finance the Pacific Resident Theater Ensemble in Venice, where he appeared with his third wife, actress Alley Mills.
He had a daughter, Michele, from his first marriage to Jacqueline de Sibour, and sons Max and Ezekiel and daughter Susannah from his marriage to Carolyn Maxwell.

Texto completo: Roger Kahn
MAMARONECK, N.Y. - Roger Kahn, the writer who wove memoir and baseball and touched millions of readers through his romantic account of the Brooklyn Dodgers in "The Boys of Summer," has died. He was 92.
He died Thursday at a nursing facility in Mamaroneck, a Westchester County suburb, son Gordon Kahn said.
"Roger Kahn loved the game and earned a place in the pantheon of baseball literature long ago. He will be missed, but his words will live on," Major League Baseball said in a statement.
The author of 20 books and hundreds of articles, Kahn was best known for the 1972 best-seller that looked at his relationship with his father through their shared love of the Dodgers, an object of nostalgia for the many fans who mourned the team's move to Los Angeles after the 1957 season.
"At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams," Kahn wrote.
"The Boys of Summer" was a story of lost youth, right down to its title, later borrowed for a hit Don Henley song about a man longing for his past. Kahn's book moved back and forth between the early 1950s, when he covered the Dodgers for the New York Herald Tribune, and 20 years later, when some were ailing (Jackie Robinson), embittered (Carl Furillo) or in a wheelchair (Roy Campanella).
The book was an instant hit, although Kahn was criticized for sentimentalizing his story.
"Here is a book that succeeded for me despite almost everything about it," wrote Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, a late book critic for The New York Times.
Retired Dodgers broadcasting great Vin Scully knew Kahn well from their days with the team - Kahn was a beat writer covering the club, and the same age as Scully.
"You couldn't travel with them without getting emotionally involved. Roger captured that familial spirit of the players in those days," Scully told The Associated Press on Friday. "The feeling in Brooklyn was always us against the world - the world would be the lordly pinstripers in the Bronx and almost lordly Giants in Manhattan."
Scully said Kahn singularly distilled the essence of what it was like to be a Brooklyn player and fan of the team.
"He got it right," Scully said. "Every year in Brooklyn it was wait till next year. It was only right that in all their years they wound up winning only one World Series and then left."
Among those featured in the book was Carl Erskine, a star pitcher for those Dodgers.
"I turned 93 in December and for a lot of us who played with Brooklyn then and were in that book, I wouldn't say it gave us eternal life, but it certainly enhanced our careers," Erskine told the AP from his home in Anderson, Indiana.
Erskine said he and Kahn bonded over their love for poetry. That once came in particularly handy.
"It was still the early days of airplane travel for teams, and we were on one of those piston planes, flying over Pittsburgh on the way from Cincinnati back to New York," Erskine recalled. "It was pretty bumpy, and were sitting next to each other. To calm our nerves, I started reciting a poem from Robert Service, it was 'The Cremation of Sam McGee.' That was able to distract us from the anxiety of that rough plane ride."
Many years later, Erskine said they were together at a banquet in New York and Kahn mentioned he need to talk to the pitcher about something.
"So we went over to Toots Shor's and he told me a sad story. He told me he was dry, that he was working on a book but couldn't finish it and didn't know whether anyone would read it," Erskine said.
Hearing what the book was about - it was "The Boys of Summer" - Erskine spurred Kahn by invoking the name of a prominent New York newspaper writer from the Brooklyn era.
"How'd you like to wake up and find out that Dick Young had written your story?" Erskine prodded.
Erskine said he and Kahn stayed in touch over time, from letters in past days to emails in more recent times.
Kahn began his prolific career in 1948 as a copy boy for the Tribune, and soon became a baseball writer, working under famed sports editor Stanley Woodward. He recalled Woodward as "a wonder" who once cured a writer of using the cliche "spine-tingling" by telling him to "go out in the bleachers and ask every one of those fans if his spine actually tingled."
He started writing about the Dodgers in 1952, and by age 26 was the newspaper's prominent sports reporter, earning a salary of $10,000, and also covering the city's other teams, the Giants and the Yankees.
In 1956, he was named sports editor at Newsweek magazine, and served at the Saturday Evening Post from 1963 to 1969 as editor at large. He also wrote for Esquire, Time and Sports Illustrated.
Kahn's sports writing often drew on social issues, particularly race. He wrote at length about Robinson and his struggles in breaking baseball's color line, and the two formed a long friendship.
"By applauding Robinson, a man did not feel that he was taking a stand on school integration, or on open housing. But for an instant he had accepted Robinson simply as a hometown ball player," Kahn once wrote. "To disregard color, even for an instant, is to step away from the old prejudices, the old hatred. That is not a path on which many double back."
When Kahn was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig called him "an icon of our game."
Among Kahn's other sports books: 2004's "October Men: Reggie Jackson, George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and the Yankees' Miraculous Finish in 1978," 1986's "Joe and Marilyn: A Memory of Love," and 1999's "A Flame of Pure Fire: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring '20s."
One book caused lasting embarrassment: Kahn collaborated with Pete Rose on the 1989 authorized autobiography "Pete Rose: My Story." Rose, the major league's all-time hits leader, had recently been barred from baseball for betting on games and the book featured his insistence that the allegations were untrue.
But Rose acknowledged years later, in a subsequent memoir, that he did gamble. Kahn said his "first reaction was to reach for the barf bag."
"I regret I ever got involved in the book," Kahn told the Los Angeles Times in 2007. "It turns out that Pete Rose was the Vietnam of ballplayers. He once told me he was the best ambassador baseball ever had. I've thought about that and wondered why we haven't sent him to Iran."
Kahn also wrote two novels and two nonfiction books not related to sports: 1968's "The Passionate People: What it Means to be a Jew in America," and the 1970's "The Battle for Morningside Heights: Why Students Rebel." He maintained a friendship with the poet Robert Frost, whom he profiled in the Saturday Evening Post.
He later taught writing at several colleges and lectured at Yale, Princeton and Columbia. In 2004, he served a one-semester fellowship as the Ottaway Endowed Professor of Journalism at the State University of New York in New Paltz.
Kahn was born in Brooklyn in on Oct. 31, 1927, and inherited his love of baseball from his father, Gordon, who played third base for City College.
"There was nobody I enjoyed talking baseball with as much as this green-eyed, strong-armed, gentle, fierce, mustached, long-ball hitting, walking encyclopedia who was my father," he wrote in his 1997 "Memories of Summer."
Both of Kahn's parents were teachers in Brooklyn. His mother, Olga, taught English literature and composition in high school. In recalling the influences on his life as a writer, Kahn mentioned how at bedtime his mother would tell him stories of Greek mythology.
Kahn lived in Stone Ridge in New York's Hudson Valley.
In addition to his son, survivors include wife Katharine Kahn Johnson and daughter Alissa Kahn Keenan. Another son, Roger Laurence Kahn, died in 1987.
A funeral service is set for Monday in Katonah, New York.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
One of the many affecting strangers in Jeff Sharlet's new book of journalism and photography is Jared Miller, a heavily tattooed and baby-faced drug dealer in L.A.'s Skid Row neighborhood. Over just a few pages -- which alternate between hastily captured cellphone snapshots and micro-essays -- Sharlet sketches a portrait of Miller's life. We learn of his stint in the Army where he got hooked on heroin; we hear about his estranged toddler son; we see pictures of Miller's shirtless and vulnerable body, inked with birds and Bible verses and wicked grinning skulls.
For these few pages, Miller lives: a sweet kid whose potential dissipated into substance abuse and homelessness. And then suddenly he doesn't live, dead from an overdose after trying to get clean. Sharlet's portrait, we come to understand, is a eulogy.
Miller is just one of the many people whom Sharlet asks us to see in "This Brilliant Darkness: A Book of Strangers," his powerful new work of nonfiction. The book covers a two-year period when Sharlet, an award-winning journalist who has written for Esquire and the New York Times Magazine, wandered America's less-traveled corners after a professional and medical crisis. Having grown wary of his own journalistic writing, Sharlet began snapping unstudied smartphone pics of the people he met and writing paragraph-long essays to accompany the images, then posting both to Instagram.
The result is a collection of empathetic portraits of those enigmatic figures who haunt the edges of our vision: There are 2 a.m. bakers and midnight construction workers, junkies and junk store owners, lab techs and bartenders and other bored denizens of the dark hours. The book's loyalties are with the disenfranchised -- the rural poor, the runaways, those living with mental illness, and people who survive by doing sex work.
Sharlet is a reporter at heart. He presents his subjects' stories in punchy and direct prose, then leaves it to us whether to raise eyebrows or take people at their word. He is never interested in passing judgment or offering a moral -- these aren't people as object lessons, just people. Sharlet wants us to see their faces and spend a moment with their tragedies and triumphs.
"This Brilliant Darkness" ventures outside the borders of the U.S. a few times. A long and devastating section on the lives of persecuted gay Russians is a retelling of Sharlet's 2014 GQ article that won a National Magazine Award. A brief section set in Uganda is one of the book's only missteps; it feels like the trimmings from a longer journalistic piece and requires more cultural context to land. But lapses like this are rare. As a whole, the book is a humane and harrowing document of people set adrift in the wake of American capitalism.
At times I wondered what to call the book -- was it visual memoir? Guerrilla journalism? Social media critique? Yet while it sits somewhere in the world of nonfiction, "This Brilliant Darkness" most frequently reminded me of the short fiction of Raymond Carver and Denis Johnson, writing that insists the lives of blue-collar laborers and heroin-addicted misfits are worthy of representation.
Which returns us to Miller, the doomed Skid Row junkie. He wants to show Sharlet his Facebook page, wants to prove he exists in the modern world. Miller scrolls and scrolls past people with the same name, then finally stops and smiles: "There I am," he says.
Will McGrath is a writer and journalist in Minneapolis. His debut book, "Everything Lost Is Found Again," won the 2019 Bernard J. Brommel Award for Biography & Memoir.

Texto completo: Doris Easley has been banking at a U.S. Bank branch in suburban Nashville for years and is certain she can count on employees there to help her through a financial pinch.
She was alarmed when she heard that the company last month fired two workers at an Oregon call center who, in violation of a bank rule, helped a customer outside the premises on Christmas Eve. The customer's paycheck from a new company was held up in the bank's verification process and one of the workers met him at a gas station with $20 of her own cash to get him by.
"I hope something will happen that these people will not lose their jobs because I guarantee you that, if I had a transaction that was held up, I have two or three friends at the bank who would come and help me," Easley said.
By this weekend, it looked like they were getting their jobs back.
The firings spilled into the open when one of the employees told an Oregon newspaper about it. Last weekend, a New York Times columnist picked up on the episode and called it an example of "how some companies have lost their souls."
That led Andy Cecere, the chief executive of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, to get in touch with both of the fired workers and issue a statement saying the episode "does not reflect who we are as a company."
One of the fired workers, Abigail Gilbert, agreed to return to her supervisory role in the call center. The other, Emily James, who met the customer, was considering a new job that would help U.S. Bank improve customer service.
This weekend, the company planned to issue a statement that said, "U.S. Bank fell short of our and others' expectations and we sincerely apologize."
In an interview Friday, Cecere said, "This has shown me we have some larger issues we need to, as a team, examine and improve upon."
He said there are reasons for policies that set parameters around where and how employees interact with customers.
"But at the same time, I recognize we need at times to be more flexible and we have to understand the circumstances that are coming out," Cecere said. "I want to learn from this and get better. We can create circumstances and flexibility to empower the employee to put the customer first in terms of the way we act in situations that are a little more challenging or uncertain."
Usually a low-key bank
The episode marked a rare trip into the national spotlight for U.S. Bank. Though it is the nation's fifth-largest bank with a logo that tops skyscrapers in several cities and a stadium in downtown Minneapolis, U.S. Bank's national reputation is low key. Critics directed relatively less anger at it than other banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Like most banks, it relies on philanthropy and third-party assessments of corporate ethics to burnish its image.
But having a relatively ordinary labor decision thrust into the glare of social media and hot-take commenters forced U.S. Bank to confront the gray line between applying rules and using common sense. It immediately led the company to bend its policy of not talking publicly about employee matters.
And it happened at a complicated moment for the company and its employees. U.S. Bank is cutting both the number of its branches and jobs throughout all branches to adjust to customers who are increasingly turning to digital-banking services, some of which are supported by call-center workers like those in Oregon.
As well, the future of banks is an issue in the Democratic presidential primary, with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposing new restrictions on the industry. Some analysts speculate that more banks will merge this year if Sanders or Warren appear likely to become the nominee or win the presidency.
In his column on the firings, Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times gave a nod to the political stakes by asserting that hypocrisy at large companies is a reason "young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to 'socialism' than to 'capitalism.' "
Jiao Luo, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management who researches corporate reputation strategies, said the incident will require U.S. Bank to lean heavily on the goodwill it has built up over the years -- and protect it.
"Trust is something that's so fragile, especially with the backdrop of the generally low level of trust of banks," she said.
The company will likely change the way it enforces rules, Luo said, and she suggested an avenue for appeal and discussion will need to be formed. For an employee to rely on the media or external pressure, Luo said, "seems to be an extremely costly way to generate flexibility in the rules."
Cecere said the company will create an appeals process, though the form is still to be worked out.
"We are going to learn from this and do better," he said.
Every minute accounted for
Call centers at any business tend to be structured with many rules that employees must strictly follow. They exist to simplify entry to jobs that turn over frequently and to allow precise measurements of employees' work.
"Every minute of an agent's day is accounted for, every phone call recorded, every interaction can be reviewed," said Paul Stockford, an industry analyst at Saddletree Research in Scottsdale, Ariz. In the U.S. Bank case, he added, "It wouldn't surprise me if that wasn't some rule that got set down somewhere and just glossed over on the first day of work."
For the past several years, managers of call centers have been under pressure to ease up and give workers more flexibility. "There's really good data on how a lot of contact centers are dealing with a different attitude in the workforce," Stockford said. "Things are going to be turned on their ear in the industry."
To many observers, the U.S. Bank episode is simply a sign of how big companies develop policies to cope with size and create consistency, then lean on them to the point of stifling good work and creativity.
"It's so toxic to a culture. People don't take risks anymore," said Troy Selland, a former Northwest Airlines executive who later worked for smaller airlines and is now a consultant. "It's hard for me to see that. You say, 'Where did common sense go?' "
Easley, the U.S. Bank customer in Tennessee, said an assistant branch manager and some tellers helped her cope and manage affairs after her mother's death last year. She said she feels certain any of them would drive to a gas station with $20 if she needed it.
"That's the kind of relationship I want with my bank and anybody would want with their bank," she said.

Opinion: Iowa debacle may affect Florida

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential nominating contest got off to a disastrous start last week when the Iowa caucus experienced a complete meltdown, but the candidates don't have time to dwell on what happened in the caucus calamity.
New Hampshire votes Tuesday, and Democrats in other states – including Florida – already are casting early ballots.
Florida elections supervisors sent vote-by-mail ballots to military and overseas presidential primary voters at the beginning of February, and domestic ballots started going out last week.
More than 1.2 million Floridians voted absentee in the 2016 presidential primary, including 520,035 Democrats and 713,857 Republicans.
In Florida's Democratic president primary, absentee voters made up one-third of the electorate in 2016.
With a big presidential field that is attracting plenty of attention, and a deep feeling among Democrats that they need to find a strong challenger to take on President Donald Trump, many Democrats are eager to cast primary ballots this year. The number of Democrats requesting absentee ballots for the 2020 primary already is way up in some Florida counties.
Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections Ron Turner mailed out 30,607 absentee ballots to Democratic presidential primary voters last week, compared to 19,269 during the entire 2016 Democratic primary. The number of Manatee County Democrats requesting absentee ballots for the presidential primary this year is 25,621, up from 15,312 in 2016. The ballots will be mailed out Monday.
Turner expects that some people already will have filled out the ballots by today.
"The election has already started," he said.
While Florida's presidential primary is underway, it's still not clear what role the state ultimately will play in choosing the nominee.
Florida Democrats will see 16 names on their presidential primary ballot, including candidates who already have dropped out, such as Corey Booker and Julian Castro. More candidates likely will drop out before Florida's March 17 primary date, but the ballot had to be finalized back in December to allow time for printing.
Most of the candidates who are still in the race haven't had much of a presence in Florida so far, but a few have invested early and that could pay off if the state is competitive.
The four early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada – get most of the candidate attention early on because wins there can provide much-needed momentum and fundraising, while losses can cause support to collapse.
But if the race remains muddled deep into the primary calendar, Florida could play a key role in the nomination. That scenario looks more likely now, with Iowa's vote-counting problems resulting in the state failing to give the type of big lift or devastating defeat that can help winnow the field.
Former Vice President Joe Biden had a disappointing performance in Iowa, but it was overshadowed by the caucus dysfunction.
If Biden can rebound in some of the other early voting states, Florida could help propel him further. He consistently has led in the polls here, and likely is locking in absentee votes before other candidates have a chance to focus on targeting Florida voters.
"As vote-by-mail gears up across Florida, we feel energized by the growing support we have across the state," said Jackie Lee, the senior advisor for Biden's Florida campaign, in announcing five more endorsements from Florida elected officials last week, bringing the total to 50 endorsements in the state. "These legislators are well-known, influential leaders that know Joe Biden is the candidate best-positioned to beat Donald Trump in the critical state of Florida."
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also could benefit from the confusion in Iowa. Bloomberg got into the race late and is not competing in the early states. Instead, the billionaire is spending enormous sums in states that vote in March, including Florida.
Bloomberg already has spent millions on television advertising in Florida and has more than 100 campaign staffers working in field offices around the state. He is betting that no candidate will come out of the early nominating contests strong enough to match his resources, and Iowa's diminished influence helps that strategy.
Bloomberg told the New York Times last week he was doubling his ad spending in every market where he currently is on TV – which includes Florida – after the problems in Iowa.
Bloomberg's army of campaign workers, coupled with the heavy advertising, could help him amass absentee votes in Florida before other candidates have a chance to build a ground game.
"We have a lot of staff on the ground that is going to be communicating with voters, we're going to be talking to them at their doors and you're going to see a lot more ads from us through the election," said Scott Kosanovich, who is running Bloomberg's Florida campaign.
The other top tier candidates – Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar – all have a limited Florida campaigns right now and are banking on generating momentum in other primaries that will carry over into the state.
That strategy is still the best bet to win the nomination based on historical precedence, but if the race stays competitive the campaigns eventually will need to start ramping up in Florida.
Aside from Bloomberg, Warren and Biden may have the most robust Florida campaigns among the top tier candidates.
Biden has a network of supporters and donors that has been built up over many years. Warren opened a campaign office in Miami in September, opened a second office in the state, in Orlando, earlier this month and has been hiring Florida campaign workers.
"From the very beginning we invested in Florida before any other campaign has; we were the first to put staff on the ground," said Kim Diaz Scott, who is running Warren's Florida campaign with a staff of more than 20.
"Everything that we are doing is because we were well aware that a little under half of Florida's primary voting base will be voting before March 17," Scott added. "That's why we needed to invest early."
Sanders still has plenty of supporters in Florida who have been with him since his 2016 campaign. But he got crushed by Hillary Clinton in Florida's 2016 presidential primary and does not appear to be investing heavily in the state.
Buttigieg and Klobuchar also don't appear to have much campaign infrastructure in the state, although Klobuchar won satellite caucuses in St. Petersburg and Port Charlotte that the Iowa Democratic Party put on for the first time this cycle.
Whether Florida proves to be a pivotal battleground in the primary remains to be seen. Candidates who haven't invested in the state may not pay much of a price if they build up enough momentum before Floridians vote.
But the debacle in Iowa made it more likely that Florida's primary matters.
Local residents check in Monday after arriving at an Iowa Democratic caucus at Hoover High School in Des Moines.

The silly, tone-deaf, self-absorbed cult of Nike

Texto completo: Did you ever play, or watch your children play, in a youth basketball league where all the teams had the same, low-cost, generic uniform except for the colors, so that the yellow team could say it was the Lakers, the green team the Celtics, etc.?
Nike inflicted that on Duke-North Carolina Saturday.
Both teams wore the same uni, bland and awful, distinct from each other only by each school’s shade of blue and large letters on the chest, D for Blue Devils and NC for Tar Heels.
“(They are) characterized,’’ Nike said in a press release, “by the program logo and are absent of numbers, mirroring the teams' 1920 look."
So, nostalgia. That and maybe, um, diplomacy?
“These jerseys are so awful,’’ Sarah Suggs wrote on Twitter, “that they’ve somehow managed to bring Duke and Carolina fans together through a mutual hatred.’’
See, Twitter is good for something.
Honestly, there is just one explanation for this tone-deaf dumbness: Nike being Nike.
This is a company whose co-founder, chairman emeritus and figurehead Phil Knight admitted he was stunned and hurt by criticism of Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley for not wanting to wear U.S. Olympic warmups because they were provided by Reebok.
According to Jordan, Knight also once said, "Michael Jordan without Nike won't mean anything." He said that in a meeting, with Jordan in the room.
This is a company whose execs say things like, "Adidas people were the Huns. I would starve to death before I'd work for Adidas."
That once wrote in its annual report that, ''We will mature in tandem with the inexorable penetration of sports into the global psyche.''
Nike illustrated its feel for that psyche with a series of ads in France during the run-up to the 1998 World Cup that included images of Aryan-looking youth marching forward for sport, and slogans like, "Young people! Soccer calls you. Join us."
Critics called the images totalitarian, and Nike pulled them. The self-important tone-deafness lingered, and manifested itself in Chapel Hill Saturday.
"Because we're connected to sports, our success is perceived as something bad,’’ Nike public relations director Liz Dolan once told the New York Times. “If a computer company in the Silicon Valley grew so quickly that profits had doubled by the year, created thousands of new high-wage jobs and delivered buckets of money to its shareholders, the public would be thrilled."
I’m trying to recall a computer company’s success that thrilled the public, but never mind.
Nike doesn’t really think those uniforms are cool, and doesn’t expect anyone to like them. It’s a goofy cult that needs to think of itself as much more than an equipment provider.
Saturday’s message was that Nike is somehow behind Duke-North Carolina, playing an indefinable (because in truth it doesn’t exist) role no one else could.
Duke and North Carolina didn’t need to buy into it - don’t expect Penn State and Ohio State to face off in identical, 1920s-inspired football unis next fall - and neither does anyone else.
“People don’t concentrate their emotional energy on products in the way fans abandon themselves to the heroes of their games,” Don Katz wrote in his book on Nike, Just Do It, and that’s a truth Knight and his corporatist cultists can’t stand.
“The products needed,’’ Katz added, “to be tethered to something more compelling and profound.”
This is why Nike is more than an everyday modern annoyance. It pretends to aspire to something compelling and profound. Having fallen miles short of that, it has become a small, (relatively) benign example of the cultish tribalism that, more than ever, drags us down.

Texto completo: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the Democratic Party is considering revoking Iowa's first-in-nation caucus status following last week's delayed election results.
During a Sunday interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Perez said the party is going to reexamine the state's status after the current election cycle, just as it amended the presence of super delegates after the 2016 presidential election.
"That's the conversation that will absolutely happen after this election cycle," Perez said, later continuing, "I have no doubt about it. Because it's very necessary."
Perez took some responsibility for the Iowa Democratic Party after the state's caucus results were delayed because of glitches with an app. Pete Buttigieg eventually took home a razor-thin win.
"They gave us assurances that it was gonna work. It didn't work," Perez said, while later noting the state party did not sufficiently test the app. "Our partnership with our state parties — anytime something goes wrong, whether it's something that's run by the state party or not, we're all in this together."
Tweet
Some Democrats, including 2020 candidate Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, have called for the DNC chairman's resignation after Perez cast doubt on the results of the Iowa caucuses, more than two days after a botched rollout of the results.
"Enough is enough. In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results," he tweeted Thursday. "I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass."
Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, among others, said, "Tom Perez should be held accountable for this failure." However, the chairman said he is "absolutely not" going to resign.

White House mulls new trade weapon for EU talks: 'Carousel' tariffs

Texto completo: The Trump administration is reportedly considering a novel source of leverage against the European Union in seeking a trade deal: "carousel" retaliation, meaning tariffs applied to a shifting set of products.
The practice is rarely used but considered particularly disruptive because it would create uncertainty across a range of industries that would have to cope with the prospect of tariffs.
"Anything that creates significant chaos and uncertainty can have a significant chilling effect on trade," said Jennifer Hillman, a senior fellow for trade and international political economy at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Georgetown University Law Center professor. "Particularly if there is little advanced notice because the tariffs will apply to goods on the water, so shipping anything from the EU to the U.S. becomes risky."
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is contemplating using the practice if talks between the United States and the EU fail to produce results, Bloomberg reported Friday. A senior USTR official told reporters in October that the administration had the authority to periodically revise the retaliatory targets and tariff rates.
The administration is embroiled in a fight with the EU over airline industry subsidies and has placed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods. The tariffs range from 10% to 25%, but following a World Trade Organization ruling in its favor, the U.S. may raise several as high as 100%. The WTO ruling says the U.S. may retaliate but, as is standard in such cases, leaves the specific method to America's discretion.
Carousel retaliation has rarely been used by any country and never before by the U.S., though the Clinton administration did consider using it during a dispute with Europe in 1998 over beef imports. Mexico employed it against the U.S. a decade ago during a trucking dispute. But the number of cases are so few that trade policy experts contacted by the Washington Examiner said the idea still existed more in the realm of theory than practice.
"I don’t think they’ve actually been applied often enough to draw a conclusion about their effectiveness," said Bill Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They do manage to annoy business because they increase uncertainty and expand the universe of parties that are hurt."
Derek Scissors, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the carousel practice is allowed under WTO rulings such as the U.S.-EU airline one. "You are permitted to punish the offending country and don't want the tariff burden falling on a single group of your importers, so you rotate what goods and services face the tariffs," he said.
Simon Lester, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, was less certain of the practice's legality but said there was little to prevent the Trump administration from trying it. "There were questions about WTO legality, but it was never litigated," Lester said.
Hillman said carousel retaliation would most likely involve the White House simply announcing the latest tariffs rates. The items and the rates would be at the president's discretion.
The idea has apparently contemplated by the White House in other trade fights too. The administration considered carousel retaliation against Beijing last year, according to the New York Times.
A White House official referred questions to the USTR. A spokesperson for the agency could not be reached for comment.

The Oscars forgot that movies matter

Texto completo: I used to love the Oscars. The Oscars and election night were my “Super Bowls” growing up. I would print out the list of nominations, see all the movies with my cousin, and then vote for my favorites and which movies I thought would win. In sixth grade, I wrote that I wanted to be an executive producer — that’s how much I adored movies. I saw the medium of film not just as an end to be loved for its own sake but also as a means to change culture and direct people’s attention to the true, the good, and the beautiful. They say politics is downstream from culture. What moves culture better than movies?
And if Joker is this year’s most Oscar-nominated film, what does that then say about our culture?
Globally, Joker is now the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, but the highest-grossing domestic R-rated film is still The Passion of the Christ, which was not even nominated for best picture, best director, or best actor back in 2004. But did anyone make a fuss when Hollywood disenfranchised people of faith? Nope.
Did anyone even mention the snub of Martin Scorsese’s 2016 long-awaited Silence? No — because that was also a film that dealt with a serious question of faith.
Righteous outrage only seems to occur when people of color are statistically less represented in nominations and when women are left out of the best director category.
As a woman, I wouldn’t want to be nominated unless I made a movie believing it could "save the world,” as Greta Gerwig claims Quentin Tarantino movies do. “[To make a movie] like movies themselves matter — like they are both high art, which they are, and that they are populist art, which they are. A movie that speaks the most profound truth to the biggest crowds … and with the confidence that everybody will be changed for the better by the experience." Not because I'm a woman — hear me roar — but because I made a movie that mattered.
While I've already stressed how little I cared for Greta Gerwig’s version of Little Women, the film still has six Oscar nominations. Yet the film’s producer, Amy Pascal, has complained that men are not as interested in seeing the movie, which makes sense seeing that it is a film “by women, for women, about women.” But it’s not that all men don’t enjoy the story of Little Women. (Former President Theodore Roosevelt liked it, as did America’s youth.) In fact, in 1927, the New York Times published a poll that said Little Women beat out the Bible as the book that high school students found most interesting. Perhaps it was the movie version men didn’t want to see, a realization that might be too hard to bear for the film's backers and falls on deaf ears.
What really should be talked about is the ideological diversity that is consistently missing in Hollywood. This year’s missed opportunity for that was Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life, a thoroughly Catholic movie. While not particularly entertaining to watch due to Malick’s slow style and the film’s excessive length, as Brad Minor noted, the film dealt with heavy themes often ignored in mainstream cinema. The protagonist resists Adolf Hitler (you would think Hollywood would take the bait) and, similarly to St. Thomas More in A Man For All Seasons, will not swear an oath that goes against his conscience. It’s also an extraordinary story about a marriage centered on faith and enduring until death, which glorifies God.
In pale comparison, Marriage Story, nominated for best picture, is about a marriage centered on self-gratification and identity, love enduring until infatuation flees, and the glorification of divorce.
But in addition to a lack of ideological diversity, there’s also no comedic self-deprecation. The Oscars will not have a host. It’s amazing to me why anyone would still tune in to watch an industry awards show that promises to be missing what makes it relevant to pop culture. Let’s not forget that Ricky Gervais was the best part of the Golden Globes.
It was St. Pope John Paul II, a former playwright, who in his Letter to Artists offered an “initiation [for artists] to rediscover the depth of the spiritual and religious dimension which has been typical of art in its noblest forms in every age.”
Until that renaissance, I’ll be rooting for 1917.

Bret Stephens: Romney shows what political courage is like

Texto completo: To honor the memory of Kirk Douglas, who died this week at 103, I watched “Lonely Are the Brave” Thursday night. The 1962 classic is about a 20th century cowboy at mortal odds with modern life — a roaming spirit who won’t be stopped by wire fences, prison bars, search helicopters or sadistic lawmen.
The men and women in the film are short on talk but strong in character. In other words, the exact opposite of our politicians today.
It was good to see “Lonely Are the Brave” at a moment when the closest Washington had to the film’s hero was Mitt Romney, who, alone among Republicans, voted to convict and remove President Donald Trump from office for abuse of power.
Mitt?
Was this the same man who denounced Trump as a “con man” in March 2016 and then auditioned to be his secretary of state that November? Who, as governor of Massachusetts, pioneered a version of Obamacare in 2006 only to denounce Obamacare when he ran for president in 2012? Who by turns has called himself a “progressive” and “moderate” Republican, as well as a “severely conservative” one?
One and the same. Yet the senator from Utah finally seems to have found the hill he’s willing to die on. It’s courage that demands respect.
I’ve been reading and rereading Romney’s moving and masterly Senate floor speech Wednesday, in which he explained his vote. “I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial,” he said in his peroration. “They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong, grievously wrong.”
The central theme of Romney’s address is obligation: the things to which we are bound, and those to which we are not. Romney says, and clearly believes, that he is bound by the Constitution, his oath to God, the evidence, his conscience and the judgment of history.
What doesn’t bind him: loyalty to president and party, the opinions of his constituents, the need to “stand with the team” or — most specious of all — the idea that, whatever the facts, the Senate is obliged to acquit Trump so that voters can render their own verdict in November.
Yet there is no constitutional case to leave to voters decisions that belong only to Congress — the dark road Mitch McConnell went down when he denied Merrick Garland a confirmation hearing in 2016, on the theory that “the American people” should choose Antonin Scalia’s replacement. The whole concept of small-r republicanism rests on the idea that self-government works only when public opinion is filtered through multiple institutions and wiser heads, not merely flushed through Congress like sewage in a drain.
Conservatives used to believe this, just as they used to believe that the branches of government were coequal; that political dirty tricks should never be normalized; that embattled allies must not be enlisted in such tricks; that, as Judge Laurence Silberman once said, “The most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage is to use its law enforcement machinery for political ends”; that innocence isn’t established by the failure to get away with the intended crime; and that acquittal isn’t vindication. Among the things now permanently lost to Republicans amid their supposed victory in the impeachment saga is the hope of having a leg to stand on when, in the fullness of time, a future Democratic president behaves toward them exactly the way Trump behaved last year.
Also lost: that once deeply held American ideal that the person who says “no” when everyone else says “yes” (or vice versa) doesn’t defy democracy but ennobles it. The right-wing vituperations descending on Romney, directed by the president and amplified through his media minions, are no better than the left’s cancel-culture warriors, seeking to wreck the lives of anyone who falls short of expectations or doesn’t toe the ideological line.
To his credit, Romney knew this would come: Like Kirk Douglas’ cowboy in “Lonely Are the Brave,” nobody breaks out of prison, physical or ideological, without expecting a posse. “I’m sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,” Romney predicted, knowing that Trump never disappoints the meanest expectations.
But even Romney’s bitterest critics, left and right, ought to give him this: He voted without regard for personal advantage, without fear of partisan obloquy, and without an eye on the easy way out — all for the sake of his own self-respect.
The country would be a better place today if more people in positions of authority acted similarly.
A line frequently (if probably erroneously) attributed to Andrew Jackson is that “one man with courage makes a majority.” What happened in the Senate this week shows how wrong that line usually is. But if Mitt Romney’s lonely vote proves anything, it’s that political courage makes a patriot.

Texto completo: I gotta tell you, I am neck-deep in book revisions. I don’t know if you know this, but I write books for HarperCollins in my spare time, along with my current full-time job at the Utah Legislature, and my column at The Salt Lake Tribune.
Book revisions can be intense. Basically, what it comes down to is this: For all those times I took a shortcut, or produced lazy writing/plotting/typing, or steered clear of creativity to make things easier, my editor calls me out.
In fact, I write with two fellow authors, who call me out on a daily basis.
“Called out.” Did you know that that particular phrase comes from gambling? Specifically, poker. To “call someone out” is to put your money where your mouth is. It means, basically, to go all-in, and demand to see your opponent’s cards.
Wait. Now I’d have to explain where the phrase “put your money where your mouth is” comes from.
I always give first drafts of anything I write to my mom. This is the woman who taught me, when I was a 5-year-old, the wonderful game of: “Onomatopoeia.”
Let me explain the rules. We would jump on our trampoline (which had zero safety nets) and every time we jumped, we would have to say a word that fit within the guidelines for Onomatopoeia (the formation of a word from a sound associated with what that word means). “Splash!” “Slap!” “Blam! Whack!”
I have to tell you that I thought this game was extremely fun. I was wrong. Also, this might explain why I had no friends.
So when I recently got my revision letter from my editor for my latest book, I consulted my mother.
She told me to avoid clichés. I agreed. Using clichés is lazy writing.
Today, I complained to a friend about how much writing I have to do, and how many deadlines I have to meet. He said, “I’m sure you’ll step up to the occasion.”
But really, just once, I’d like to step down to the occasion. Or, more efficiently, slide down to the occasion. On a steep metal slide, where gravity is the only friend you have to count on. I’d even settle for sidling up without any physical exertion toward the occasion.
I have a sister who never gets clichés. One time when we were at a restaurant, she asked the waitress for more Diet Coke, and then she told her, “I have a wooden leg for that stuff.”
We took a while to explain that having a wooden leg for something is very different than having a hollow leg for something.
Send me some of your least favorite clichés. Because it’s now or never. Let’s circle the wagons and win one for the gipper.

Texto completo: Washington • Democrats: The only thing you have to fear is Trump himself.
You should be quaking. Our unhinged monarch had a very good week and your party had a very bad week — and that’s no BS.
A lot of you told me, with expletives, that while you were watching President Donald Trump’s carnival-barking this past week, you were thinking, “We’re going to freaking lose.”
Trump hollowed out the hallowed, Apprenticing one of Washington’s most august traditions Tuesday night, showing in the State of the Union how he has figured out how to use the levers of the presidency to amplify his flair for the dramatic.
There has always been political theater; now there’s Trump political theater, as he perfects the black art of turning Democrats into mincemeat.
What could be more flamboyantly offensive than the anti-bullying advocate, Melania, hanging a Medal of Freedom around the neck of one of the biggest bullies and hate preachers of all time, Rush Limbaugh? Talk about the bully pulpit.
The president even finally managed to send his classy nemesis, Nancy Pelosi, over the edge, as she became so agitated that she was driven to Trumpian tactics to rebut his lies.
The acquittal put an exclamation point on two facts: Trump has subsumed the Republican Party, except for the sole Republican lawmaker whose base would not kill him if he voted to throw the president out of office. And he has forged one of the most cynical and darkly productive alliances of all time with the poker-faced Mitch McConnell, sending his personal approval rating to an all-time high.
Iowa was a master class in Democratic dysfunction. The disarray kicked off the Saturday before the vote when the all-important Des Moines Register poll crashed and burned. After that, campaign staffers on the ground began spinning, pushing their own narratives based on internal polls, and the press corps became a dog chasing its own tail.
On the night of the vote, I went to a high school on the edge of Des Moines to watch Iowans caucus. The caucuses have always been screwy under the rubric of quaint, with people offering chocolates for votes and doing coin tosses to make final decisions. But after I watched a kerfuffle, where a woman in a pajama outfit threw a fit when her vote somehow got moved from Biden to Buttigieg, things seemed sketchier than ever.
That was just the start of Iowa’s auto-da-fé. Candidates jumped on planes to get out of dodgy Dodge, leaving lower-level staffers and the press corps in a cocktail party of confusion at the lobby bar at the Des Moines Marriott.
As one campaign staffer told New York magazine’s Olivia Nuzzi as he disappeared into the freezing cold Iowa night, the only thing left was to get soused and give himself over to concupiscence.
By the time I got to New Hampshire, the Democratic hysteria was rising — and a faltering Joe Biden disappeared in a crisis cloud — while internecine class war was intensifying. Pete Buttigieg was predeclaring victory, spurring Bernie Sanders supporters to dub him “Mayor Cheat” on Twitter. Sanders spoke Friday morning, tying Buttigieg to Wall Street and urging Democrats to decide if they were on the side of the working class or greed, “where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.” #PetesBillionaires began trending on Twitter.
James Carville, en route to New Hampshire with his Mardi Gras beads to campaign for Michael Bennet, went on viral rants about being “scared to death” for his party as it lurched toward the far left. “Let’s get relevant here, people, for sure,” he said on MSNBC, adding, “Do we want to be an ideological cult?”
As the Republicans stuck together, ruled by fear and self-interest, the Democrats shattered apart.
“Donald Trump is narrowcasting to African Americans and Latinos with his Super Bowl ad and at the State of the Union, and the economy’s doing well, and meanwhile we’re fiddling around with a socialist and Encyclopedia Brown,” moaned one top Democrat on the Hill.
Democrats from Congress to Los Angeles began whispering hopefully about Michael Bloomberg.
“There seems to be a groundswell of support, mostly based on the fact that he’ll spend whatever it takes and fight just as dirty as Trump — with more resources,” said David Israel, a writer in Hollywood.
Just as when he made his very imperfect call to the Ukrainian president the day after Robert Mueller testified, Trump began acting out right after his acquittal.
He launched a revenge mission, accusing Pelosi of a Xerox felony. He said ominously about the Pelosi rip heard around the world: “First of all, it’s an official document. You’re not allowed. It’s illegal what she did. She broke the law.”
Gordon Sondland, the bumbling ambassador to the European Union who tried to help Trump seal his dirty deal but gave oomph to the quid-pro-quo argument, was given the boot.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security official who testified against Trump in the impeachment hearings, and his twin brother were perp-walked out of the White House complex Friday. (They needed to make sure they had their man.)
“The most powerful man in the world — buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit — has decided to exact revenge,” said David Pressman, Vindman’s lawyer.
Democrats should be scared to death watching the president play to thuggish type, reenacting the chilling final payback scenes of “The Godfather,” when Michael Corleone took out all his enemies.
It’s not business. It’s strictly personal.

Texto completo: MADISON - Lois Cone Lurie, age 90, died peacefully at her home in Madison, Wis., on Jan. 18, 2020, a few weeks after celebrating the holidays with her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and friends. She was born Lois Irma Cohen on March 12, 1929, in Passaic, N.J., to Robert James and Ella Levinson Cohen (later changed to Cone). A child of the Great Depression, Lois left home at age 15 to attend a program for high school students at the University of Chicago, while her father was recuperating from tuberculosis in Asheville, N.C. After the University of Chicago, she reunited with her family in Boston's Beacon Hill and worked at her parents' thriving, mid-century modern jewelry business, The Silversmith Shop, located on Boylston Street in Boston's Back Bay. In Boston, she met her husband, Melvin, a scholar who was completing his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago. Lois and Melvin raised four children in Storrs, Conn., Kingston, R.I., and Middletown, Conn. before settling in Milwaukee, Wis.
Lois was a lifelong advocate for social justice causes. In the 1960s. she marched for civil rights with Father Groppi. In the 1970s, she was an active volunteer and supporter of Urban Day School, an experimental private school in Milwaukee's inner city that was ahead of its time to advance educational equity. In addition to making cookies for bake sales, Lois founded and operated Grass Roots, a plant shop that donated its proceeds to the school. Three of Lois's children graduated from Urban Day School. In the 1980s and 1990s, Lois worked as a consumer advocate in a bankruptcy law firm. She was never afraid to express her deeply-felt views on social issues and politics.
Lois was married to Melvin for 32 years until his passing in 1987. She moved to Madison, Wis. in 2002, where she enjoyed many years of retirement, living a few miles from her daughter, Susie, and her family. For the last 30 years of her life, Lois was focused on enriching the lives of her grandchildren and was engaged in every sporting event, graduation, wedding, theater production, concert, and other activity. Lois was an avid reader, world traveler, gardener, bird watcher, art collector, sports fan (mostly Badgers, Brewers and Bucks), and a master of New York Times crossword puzzles. Lois had a gift for making fast personal connections with others and was genuinely interested in everyone she knew.
Lois was preceded in death by her parents, Robert James and Ella Levinson Cone; husband, Melvin Lurie; and her brother, Herbert Richard Cone. She is survived by her four children, Jonathan (Pam) Lurie, Robert (Sara) Lurie, Alexander (Dorian Friedman) Lurie, and Susannah (Edward) Taylor; eight grandchildren, Samantha Lurie, Micah Hefty (Nicholas), Benjamin Lurie, Jennica Lurie, Jillian Lurie, Nicholas Taylor, Henry Taylor, and Mara Lurie; three great-grandchildren, Trevon Johnson, Cidney Nicholson, and Connor James; and two sisters-in-law, Syrul Lurie and Barbara Cone. She is also survived by Fiji, her loving Cairn-Doodle friend of 12 years, who brought her joy and unconditional love so long as her nightstand was well stocked with doggie treats.
Interment and graveside service was held on Friday, Jan. 24, 2020, at Sharon Memorial Park, 40 Dedham Street, Sharon, Mass. A celebration of Lois's life will be held at 12:00 noon, at the Memorial Union, 800 Langdon St., Madison, Wis. on Sunday, Feb. 16, 2020. Donations may be made to Show Me the World Project, founded by Lois's granddaughter, Samantha Lurie.

Trump se deshace de quienes testificaron contra él en ‘impeachment’, pese advertencias de republicanos

Texto completo: Varios senadores republicanos trataron de evitar que Donald Trump se saliera con la suya y despidiera al embajador en la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland , que testificó en su contra en la investigación de la Cámara de Representantes antes de que el juicio político al presidente llegara al Senado. Sin embargo, el mandatario hizo oídos sordos y consiguió su propósito.
Los legisladores trasladaron al presidente que sería perjudicial para su Gobierno ordenar la destitución del diplomático , según informaron fuentes de The New York Times. Además, le dijeron que ese movimiento era innecesario ya que el propio Sondland había hablado con otros altos cargos de dejar la embajada europea una vez que se resolviera el proceso político en el Senado. Los senadores estimaron conveniente que el ya exembajador fijara sus propias condiciones para dejar el cargo.
Sin embargo, es más que evidente que Trump no quería una salida tranquila y forzó a Sondland a dejar la embajada antes de que estuviese preparado para hacerlo. Según la información que publica el Times, cuando los funcionarios del Departamento de Estado le informaron al diplomático que tenía que presentar su renuncia, Sondland se negó bajo el argumento de que no quería participar en lo que parecía un purga contra los testigos del impeachment .
Ante esa negativa, el presidente ordenó el despido de Sondland el mismo viernes, horas después de que expulsaran de la Casa Blanca al teniente coronel Alexander Vindman y a su hermano gemelo -y también teniente coronel- Yevgeny Vindman y les dijeran que sus servicios ya no eran necesarios. Vindman también fue testigo en una de las audiencias que convocaron los demócratas de la cámara baja para recabar información y evidencias antes de someter a Trump al fallido juicio político.
Estas destituciones llegan dos días después de que el Senado absolviera al presidente de Estados Unidos en una votación cuasi partidista. Solo un republicano, Mitt Romney, votó a favor de condenar al presidente por abuso de poder. No obstante, el político conservador, no creía que el presidente hubiera obstruido la labor del Congreso y se alineó con sus compañeros de partido en este cargo.
Los demócratas atacaron al ejecutivo por ordenar estos despidos, que llamaron “La masacre del viernes noche” . Para el partido que inició el juicio político contra el presidente, el Gobierno se estaba vengando de los cargos que no tuvieron otra opción que responder al llamado institucional de declarar lo que sabían.
Entre los senadores republicanos que trataron de disuadir al presidente está la senadora Susan Collins, de Maine, que después de votar para absolver a Trump dijo que ella creía que el presidente había aprendido la lección. Otros que respaldaron su postura fueron Thom Tillis, de Carolina del Norte; Martha McSally, de Arizona, y Ron Johnson, de Wisconsin.

¡Ahora sí! Buttigieg se lleva de Iowa 14 delegados republicanos. Sanders pide nuevo recuento

Texto completo: El Partido Demócrata de Iowa desveló este domingo en un comunicado que Pete Buttigieg se llevó la mayor cantidad de delegados para la convención nacional. El exalcalde de South Bend (Indiana) consiguió 14, dos más que el izquierdista Bernie Sanders .
Tras casi una semana de caos y polémica por las “incongruencias” del conteo, el partido reconoció haber revisado un 95% de los distritos electorales para zanjar las desconfianzas que se habían ocasionado. El fiasco hizo también que se pusiera en duda la fiabilidad del proceso asambleario que se celebra en Iowa , que además, abre el ciclo electoral hacia las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Detrás de Buttigieg y Sanders, quedó la senadora Elizabeth Warren (con ocho delegados), el exvicepresidente Joe Biden (con seis) y la senadora por Minnesota Amy Klobuchar (con uno). El estado reparte un total de 41 delegados nacionales.
El partido aseguró haber compartido previamente la revisión de los resultados con los equipos de campaña y discutido las correcciones. “Se hicieron correcciones cuando los números reportados en los recintos contradecían los resultados oficiales “, explicó en su comunicado el partido.
Buttigieg fue la sorpresa en Iowa, donde las encuestas de las últimas semanas apuntaban el triunfo de Sanders. De ser elegido para enfrentarse a Trump y conseguir derrotarlo, el exalcalde de 37 años sería el presidente más joven de la historia estadounidense.
La directora de campaña de Sanders, Faiz Shaki, ha pedido que se repita parcialmente el conteo. Por su parte, Associated Press, que históricamente verifica los resultados y publica el resultado de la contienda, no le ha asignado el último delegado a Buttigieg no ha declarado un ganador debido a los errores en el escrutinio. Tampoco lo ha hecho The New York Times.

Ante esa negativa, el presidente ordenó el despido de Sondland el mismo viernes, horas después de que expulsaran de la Casa Blanca al teniente coronel Alexander Vindman y a su hermano gemelo -y también teniente coronel- Yevgeny Vindman y les dijeran que sus servicios ya no eran necesarios. Vindman también fue testigo en una de las audiencias que convocaron los demócratas de la cámara baja para recabar información y evidencias antes de someter a Trump al fallido juicio político.
Estas destituciones llegan dos días después de que el Senado absolviera al presidente de Estados Unidos en una votación cuasi partidista. Solo un republicano, Mitt Romney, votó a favor de condenar al presidente por abuso de poder. No obstante, el político conservador, no creía que el presidente hubiera obstruido la labor del Congreso y se alineó con sus compañeros de partido en este cargo.
Los demócratas atacaron al ejecutivo por ordenar estos despidos, que llamaron “La masacre del viernes noche” . Para el partido que inició el juicio político contra el presidente, el Gobierno se estaba vengando de los cargos que no tuvieron otra opción que responder al llamado institucional de declarar lo que sabían.
Entre los senadores republicanos que trataron de disuadir al presidente está la senadora Susan Collins, de Maine, que después de votar para absolver a Trump dijo que ella creía que el presidente había aprendido la lección. Otros que respaldaron su postura fueron Thom Tillis, de Carolina del Norte; Martha McSally, de Arizona, y Ron Johnson, de Wisconsin.

Texto completo: El Partido Demócrata de Iowa desveló este domingo en un comunicado que Pete Buttigieg se llevó la mayor cantidad de delegados para la convención nacional. El exalcalde de South Bend (Indiana) consiguió 14, dos más que el izquierdista Bernie Sanders .
Tras casi una semana de caos y polémica por las “incongruencias” del conteo, el partido reconoció haber revisado un 95% de los distritos electorales para zanjar las desconfianzas que se habían ocasionado. El fiasco hizo también que se pusiera en duda la fiabilidad del proceso asambleario que se celebra en Iowa , que además, abre el ciclo electoral hacia las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Detrás de Buttigieg y Sanders, quedó la senadora Elizabeth Warren (con ocho delegados), el exvicepresidente Joe Biden (con seis) y la senadora por Minnesota Amy Klobuchar (con uno). El estado reparte un total de 41 delegados nacionales.
El partido aseguró haber compartido previamente la revisión de los resultados con los equipos de campaña y discutido las correcciones. “Se hicieron correcciones cuando los números reportados en los recintos contradecían los resultados oficiales “, explicó en su comunicado el partido.
Buttigieg fue la sorpresa en Iowa, donde las encuestas de las últimas semanas apuntaban el triunfo de Sanders. De ser elegido para enfrentarse a Trump y conseguir derrotarlo, el exalcalde de 37 años sería el presidente más joven de la historia estadounidense.
La directora de campaña de Sanders, Faiz Shaki, ha pedido que se repita parcialmente el conteo. Por su parte, Associated Press, que históricamente verifica los resultados y publica el resultado de la contienda, no le ha asignado el último delegado a Buttigieg no ha declarado un ganador debido a los errores en el escrutinio.

Texto completo: Varios senadores republicanos trataron de evitar que Donald Trump se saliera con la suya y despidiera al embajador en la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland , que testificó en su contra en la investigación de la Cámara de Representantes antes de que el juicio político al presidente llegara al Senado. Sin embargo, el mandatario hizo oídos sordos y consiguió su propósito.
Los legisladores trasladaron al presidente que sería perjudicial para su Gobierno ordenar la destitución del diplomático , según informaron fuentes de The New York Times. Además, le dijeron que ese movimiento era innecesario ya que el propio Sondland había hablado con otros altos cargos de dejar la embajada europea una vez que se resolviera el proceso político en el Senado. Los senadores estimaron conveniente que el ya exembajador fijara sus propias condiciones para dejar el cargo.
Sin embargo, es más que evidente que Trump no quería una salida tranquila y forzó a Sondland a dejar la embajada antes de que estuviese preparado para hacerlo. Según la información que publica el Times, cuando los funcionarios del Departamento de Estado le informaron al diplomático que tenía que presentar su renuncia, Sondland se negó bajo el argumento de que no quería participar en lo que parecía un purga contra los testigos del impeachment .
Ante esa negativa, el presidente ordenó el despido de Sondland el mismo viernes, horas después de que expulsaran de la Casa Blanca al teniente coronel Alexander Vindman y a su hermano gemelo -y también teniente coronel- Yevgeny Vindman y les dijeran que sus servicios ya no eran necesarios. Vindman también fue testigo en una de las audiencias que convocaron los demócratas de la cámara baja para recabar información y evidencias antes de someter a Trump al fallido juicio político.
Estas destituciones llegan dos días después de que el Senado absolviera al presidente de Estados Unidos en una votación cuasi partidista. Solo un republicano, Mitt Romney, votó a favor de condenar al presidente por abuso de poder. No obstante, el político conservador, no creía que el presidente hubiera obstruido la labor del Congreso y se alineó con sus compañeros de partido en este cargo.

Smolens: Money isn’t the obstacle for Trump’s border wall

Texto completo: President Donald Trump seems to be getting the money to build his border wall. It may turn out that was the easy part.
The funding had been a big problem for the president, as Democrats in Congress blocked appropriations for building an expanded border barrier along much of the U.S. border with Mexico.
But a presidential emergency declaration, bureaucratic funding shifts and favorable court rulings have allowed the administration to sidestep Congress and opened up access to billions of dollars for the project.
A recent report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection placed an $11 billion price tag on the wall, and said that it would cost more than $20 million per mile to construct. More money, maybe a lot, will be needed.
As it stands, that easily makes it the most expensive border wall in the world, Reece Jones, a geographer at the University of Hawaii who studies border walls, told National Public Radio.
The scope of Trump’s wall has shifted over time. At the end of last year, Mark Morgan, the acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told reporters the goal was to complete 450 miles by the end of 2020.
“It’s hard right now to be able to say whether we’re still going to be able to meet that goal, but I’m confident that we’re going to be close,” he said.
As of mid-January, about 100 miles of fence had been built, but virtually all of that was to replace aging border barriers or otherwise bolster existing ones. Only 1 mile of new fence had been constructed where none existed.
There is no more identifiable campaign promise by Trump than to build the border wall. As the November election approaches, how well he delivers on that promise no doubt will be the subject of considerable analysis. Given he is moving ahead with it, it’s hard to imagine his political base fading on him even if he falls short this year.
The dispute over how valuable a wall is in securing the border predates Trump, but rarely has it been so intense. The president largely ignores that and vigorously pushes ahead.
“You’re going to have a wall like no other,” Trump said during a rally in Milwaukee last month. “It’s going to be a powerful, terrific wall. A very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed, and we are fully financed now, isn’t that nice?”
The efficacy of the wall may be open to debate. Whether it’s being built at “record speed” is another matter. It’s been a tough slog. Coming up with the money took some doing, and for some time Trump touted progress by pointing at replacement walls going up even though they were planned before he was elected. In reality, the Trump wall is behind schedule.
Construction of the first new section of border wall — where none existed previously — began near Donna, Texas, in late October. According to the New York Times, the 8-mile stretch of fencing was supposed to be started in February 2019.
Texas may be a red state that Trump won by 9% in 2016, but building a border barrier there will prove difficult, just as it was for Trump’s predecessors.
Owners of private property needed for the fencing have been adamant about not giving up their land. They took legal action when the administration of President George W. Bush tried to seize their land through eminent domain. At one point, there were hundreds of related cases being heard in Texas federal court. Ricky Garza, a lawyer with the Texas Civil Rights Project, told the Times that earlier in 2019 there were 60 Bush-era cases still pending.
Now, some landowners have sued the current administration.
Trump is building a more elaborate “border wall system” than Bush sought, and that’s reflected in the price tag. The Bush fence cost about $4 million per mile, according to Customs and Border Protection. Trump’s wall costs five times more than that.
But the two hardly compare. Under Bush, the fencing style varied as did the size, which topped out at 18 feet high in some areas. The Trump fence is 30 feet tall, with an “anti-climbing plate” to discourage people from scaling it.
Furthermore, the Trump system will have a broad enforcement zone that includes roads, lighting, cameras and other technology — to some degree, similar to sections of the border fence system that has been in place in San Diego for years.
Full cost estimates for the project ranged from $8 billion to $12 billion initially, and later up to $25 billion.
Trump inherited some 650 miles of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile border, put there by the administrations of Presidents Bush and Barack Obama. For all the outcry from Democrats over Trump’s wall, they rarely mention that Obama and Hillary Clinton, among other Democrats, supported funding for border fences when they were in the Senate.
Costs of specific portions of Trump’s fence vary depending on whether the government has to enter eminent domain proceedings to get the land, and the uniqueness of the soil and geography. For instance, the projected cost of a section of wall in Starr County, Texas, is $11.7 million per mile, according to National Public Radio, citing Customs and Border Protection figures. A segment in neighboring Hidalgo County is expected to be almost double that, $21 million per mile.
Jones, the University of Hawaii geographer, said there are about 60 border walls around the world and added that Israel’s on the West Bank is the second most expensive — ranging from about $1 million to $5 million a mile.
Walls, of course, will not completely stop illegal immigration or drug trafficking. Just recently, U.S. border authorities announced they had discovered a drug tunnel that stretched about a mile from Mexico into the United States under the border fence in Otay Mesa. Wendy Fry of the San Diego Union-Tribune said officials called it the “longest, most sophisticated cross-border drug tunnel in history.”
The next day, the Washington Post reported that Trump’s fence in rural Arizona likely will have to have flood gates that remain open for extended periods during the monsoon season. Otherwise, rising waters from flash floods could cause the wall to collapse.
The border fence in Calexico made national news after the Union-Tribune reported that high winds in California blew down new fence panels. Granted, part of the problem was that concrete anchoring the wall hadn’t fully set.
Still, given the amount of criticism of Trump’s wall coming out of the Golden State, that’s a handy metaphor.

Texto completo: When my family emigrated from our native South Africa to Southern California in the 1980s, my parents, my sister and I fell hard for this state’s endless suburban sprawl. To the four of us, the acres of subdivisions that had been mushrooming up across California since World War II were the embodiment of everything we’d been promised about America. A bigger-than-enough house, a two-car garage and a backyard of brilliant green lawn — this was the California Dream we’d seen on TV.
By the time I got to middle school, my immigrant family was able to afford a house with a yard of our own — back then, California really was the land of milk and honey — and I spent my youth in the sun-drenched suburbs. It was a fine place to grow up; in the mass-produced “little boxes made of ticky-tacky” that stretch across California and much of America, I found comfort, safety and a crucial sense of belonging in the American landscape.
And yet, wistful though I may remain for my suburban-sprawl childhood, these days I find myself continually amazed and befuddled by my state’s insane fetishization of an anachronistic model of urban development. Why — when the case for some better way of living has become so painfully obvious — can’t California quit propping up its endless rows of single-family houses? Why can’t so much of America? And what level of extreme unlivability is it going to take to finally convince us that there isn’t enough space for all of us to live as if space is infinite?
California lawmakers just rejected an effort to override restrictive zoning regulations across the state for the third year in a row. Most of the land available for residential development in California is zoned for single-family homes, according to researchers at UC Berkeley’s Turner Center for Housing Innovation; the typical California city allows multifamily developments like apartments, townhouses and duplexes on less than a quarter of its land. Senate Bill 50, devised by Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, would have allowed higher-density housing near public transportation lines and job centers, fostering affordability and sustainability in a state that desperately needs both.
In previous attempts, Wiener’s idea was criticized for exacerbating gentrification and handing over development plans from local officials to state bureaucrats. This year, Wiener significantly amended the bill to address the critics’ concerns. The latest version offered greater control to local officials and delayed the legislation’s effect in low-income areas sensitive to gentrification.
But again, the bill couldn’t make it through. SB 50 attracted fierce opposition from lawmakers representing some of the state’s ritziest suburbs and its largest cities. Even some of the bill’s putative supporters, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is falling well short of his campaign promise to spur the development of 3.5 million new housing units by 2025, offered only tepid endorsements.
I suspect that the reluctance stems from a reality that many politicians would prefer to avoid accepting: The reign of the single-family home is over. Whatever its habitable charms and nostalgic appeal, the single-family home is out of step with the future.
In an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. Much of California is straining under its own success: We have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. And the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: Make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.
Increasing density by replacing single-family homes with multifamily ones would be a boon to our efforts to address climate change, and it would help with affordability. But if that is too practical a selling point, let me offer a couple more politically salient ones.
First, there is nothing especially admirable about the development of single-family zoning in America. Though the policy is now defended as a way to maintain the ineffable “local character” of neighborhoods, single-family zoning has a history in segregation. As historian Richard Rothstein has documented, single-family zoning was one of the many ways white homeowners and politicians kept African Americans out of suburbs.
And second: We can move on from single-family housing to something better for everyone. A few years ago, shut out of the skyrocketing market for single-family homes in our Northern California suburb, my wife and I bought a townhouse. At first we thought of it as a starter home — we’d just had our second child, and it felt like we could slum it in a townhouse for a bit before we could move into the dream of a place with a backyard.
That dream now looks prohibitive: Houses with backyards in my neck of the woods require tech-IPO levels of insane wealth. But you know what? I don’t feel so bad. Our attached townhouse, on a piece of land a small fraction of the size of a single-family home, is less of a burden on the environment, and it is just the right size for the four of us. It’s also just as loving and pleasant a place for my kids to grow up in as my own suburban manse was for me.
At some point, recently, I realized that I no longer fantasized about ever having a backyard — my dream home is now a townhouse, and if it’s good enough for me, perhaps it could be good enough for others in my state, too.

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s reelection campaign will be centered around claims that he has done great things for the economy. And let’s be honest: The U.S. economy is running pretty hot these days. Growth in GDP and employment has been good, though not spectacular; the unemployment rate is near a historic low.
There are some shadows in the picture. Economic gains have been lopsided, with a large increase in corporate profits that mainly reflects giant tax breaks, while workers haven’t seen comparable gains (and gains for lower-wage workers have been driven in part by minimum-wage increases in blue states). The huge gains in health insurance coverage under President Barack Obama have stalled or gone into reverse, and there has been a sharp increase in the number of Americans who report delaying medical treatment because of costs.
Still, it is indeed a strong economy. But if we ask what lies behind that strength, the main answer is an explosion in the federal budget deficit, which exceeded $1 trillion last year. And the story of how that happened has deeply disturbing implications for the future of U.S. politics.
Let’s go back for a minute to early 2009, when the economy was imploding and desperately needed help in the form of deficit spending. The Obama administration did indeed propose a significant stimulus plan — but it was much too small relative to the size of the problem, largely because the administration wanted to win bipartisan support and wasn’t willing to use reconciliation to bypass the filibuster.
This isn’t hindsight. In January 2009, I was practically tearing my hair out over the inadequacy of the stimulus and warned of a scenario in which “the plan limits the rise in unemployment, but things are still pretty bad, with the rate peaking at something like 9% and coming down only slowly. And then Mitch McConnell says, ‘See, government spending doesn’t work.’ ” That is, of course, exactly what happened.
Then, in 2010, Republicans took control of the House and were in a position to force Obama into years of spending cuts that exerted a significant drag on economic growth. This drag wasn’t enough to prevent a sustained economic recovery, but the recovery could and should have been much faster. There was no economic reason we shouldn’t have returned to full employment by, say, 2013; instead, largely thanks to fiscal austerity, the average unemployment rate that year was still above 7%.
Now, Republicans claimed that they were demanding spending cuts because they were deeply concerned about budget deficits. And the news media, I’m sorry to say, both bought into the narrative that deficits were our most important problem — abandoning the usual conventions of reportorial neutrality — and took GOP claims of fiscal probity at face value.
By the way, whatever happened to the deficit scolds who were so prominent during the Obama years? They’re oddly quiet now.
Anyway, it was always obvious to anyone who really paid attention that people like Paul Ryan were fiscal hypocrites, who would suddenly lose all interest in deficits as soon as a Republican occupied the White House. And that’s what they did.
As I said, the budget deficit has exploded past $1 trillion under Trump, up from less than $600 billion in Obama’s last year. Most of that rise can be attributed to Trump’s policies, mainly a tax cut rammed through Congress using exactly the hyperpartisan tactics Obama balked at in 2009.
In a way, the surprising thing about Trump’s deficitpalooza is that it hasn’t boosted the economy even more, a shortfall that can be attributed to bad design. After all, the corporate tax cuts that were the biggest driver of rising deficits did nothing to increase business investment, which has actually declined over the past year.
And while the Obama stimulus included significant investments in the future, helping in particular to jump-start revolutionary progress in green energy, Trump has never delivered a penny on his promise to rebuild America’s infrastructure.
Still, Trump’s deficits have given the economy — and Trump’s political fortunes — a lift in the short term. And that fact should bother you, a lot.
Put it this way: Republicans used the pretense that they cared about fiscal responsibility to engage in de facto economic sabotage as long as a Democrat was in the White House. Then they abandoned the pretense and opened up the spending taps as soon as one of their own was in power. And far from paying a price for their duplicity, they are being politically rewarded.
The implications for party strategy are stark: Maximum cynicism is the best policy. Obstruct, disrupt, and hurt the economy as much as you can, deploying whatever hypocritical excuses you think the media will buy, when the other party holds the presidency. Then abandon all concerns for the future and buy votes once you’re back in control.
For whatever reason, Democrats haven’t been willing or able to behave that cynically. Republicans, however, have. And if Trump is reelected, that asymmetric cynicism will be the main reason.

Texto completo: Varios senadores republicanos trataron de evitar que Donald Trump se saliera con la suya y despidiera al embajador en la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland , que testificó en su contra en la investigación de la Cámara de Representantes antes de que el juicio político al presidente llegara al Senado. Sin embargo, el mandatario hizo oídos sordos y consiguió su propósito.
Los legisladores trasladaron al presidente que sería perjudicial para su Gobierno ordenar la destitución del diplomático , según informaron fuentes de The New York Times. Además, le dijeron que ese movimiento era innecesario ya que el propio Sondland había hablado con otros altos cargos de dejar la embajada europea una vez que se resolviera el proceso político en el Senado. Los senadores estimaron conveniente que el ya exembajador fijara sus propias condiciones para dejar el cargo.
Sin embargo, es más que evidente que Trump no quería una salida tranquila y forzó a Sondland a dejar la embajada antes de que estuviese preparado para hacerlo. Según la información que publica el Times, cuando los funcionarios del Departamento de Estado le informaron al diplomático que tenía que presentar su renuncia, Sondland se negó bajo el argumento de que no quería participar en lo que parecía un purga contra los testigos del impeachment .
Ante esa negativa, el presidente ordenó el despido de Sondland el mismo viernes, horas después de que expulsaran de la Casa Blanca al teniente coronel Alexander Vindman y a su hermano gemelo -y también teniente coronel- Yevgeny Vindman y les dijeran que sus servicios ya no eran necesarios. Vindman también fue testigo en una de las audiencias que convocaron los demócratas de la cámara baja para recabar información y evidencias antes de someter a Trump al fallido juicio político.
Estas destituciones llegan dos días después de que el Senado absolviera al presidente de Estados Unidos en una votación cuasi partidista. Solo un republicano, Mitt Romney, votó a favor de condenar al presidente por abuso de poder. No obstante, el político conservador, no creía que el presidente hubiera obstruido la labor del Congreso y se alineó con sus compañeros de partido en este cargo.
Los demócratas atacaron al ejecutivo por ordenar estos despidos, que llamaron “La masacre del viernes noche” . Para el partido que inició el juicio político contra el presidente, el Gobierno se estaba vengando de los cargos que no tuvieron otra opción que responder al llamado institucional de declarar lo que sabían.
Entre los senadores republicanos que trataron de disuadir al presidente está la senadora Susan Collins, de Maine, que después de votar para absolver a Trump dijo que ella creía que el presidente había aprendido la lección. Otros que respaldaron su postura fueron Thom Tillis, de Carolina del Norte; Martha McSally, de Arizona, y Ron Johnson, de Wisconsin.

Texto completo: El Partido Demócrata de Iowa desveló este domingo en un comunicado que Pete Buttigieg se llevó la mayor cantidad de delegados para la convención nacional. El exalcalde de South Bend (Indiana) consiguió 14, dos más que el izquierdista Bernie Sanders .
Tras casi una semana de caos y polémica por las “incongruencias” del conteo, el partido reconoció haber revisado un 95% de los distritos electorales para zanjar las desconfianzas que se habían ocasionado. El fiasco hizo también que se pusiera en duda la fiabilidad del proceso asambleario que se celebra en Iowa , que además, abre el ciclo electoral hacia las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Detrás de Buttigieg y Sanders, quedó la senadora Elizabeth Warren (con ocho delegados), el exvicepresidente Joe Biden (con seis) y la senadora por Minnesota Amy Klobuchar (con uno). El estado reparte un total de 41 delegados nacionales.
El partido aseguró haber compartido previamente la revisión de los resultados con los equipos de campaña y discutido las correcciones. “Se hicieron correcciones cuando los números reportados en los recintos contradecían los resultados oficiales “, explicó en su comunicado el partido.
Buttigieg fue la sorpresa en Iowa, donde las encuestas de las últimas semanas apuntaban el triunfo de Sanders. De ser elegido para enfrentarse a Trump y conseguir derrotarlo, el exalcalde de 37 años sería el presidente más joven de la historia estadounidense.
La directora de campaña de Sanders, Faiz Shaki, ha pedido que se repita parcialmente el conteo. Por su parte, Associated Press, que históricamente verifica los resultados y publica el resultado de la contienda, no le ha asignado el último delegado a Buttigieg no ha declarado un ganador debido a los errores en el escrutinio. Tampoco lo ha hecho The New York Times.

Market Phobia Comes to Cyberspace; What's behind the campaign to block the sale of a web registry?

Texto completo: Remember the panic over net neutrality? Pressure groups convinced millions that strengthening market competition in broadband would "end the internet as we know it," exposing web users to corporate exploitation and control. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai needed a security detail.
The policy went through and none of the abuses happened, but many who ginned up the hysteria have found a new capitalist threat to the internet. This time the targets are Ethos Capital, a private-equity firm that announced its intention to buy the .org web-registry, and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), which has to sign off on the sale. Antipathy to markets is again misleading the public and opening the door to regulatory abuses.
Some background: All websites have a domain name—a virtual address that allows them to be located online. The most familiar "top-level" domains include .com, .net, .org and .edu. Each is managed by a registry. The .org registry is owned by the Internet Society (ISOC), a nonprofit corporation that aims to expand internet access, among other causes.
In November ISOC announced it is selling the registry to Ethos. Some in the .org community, led by vocal left-leaning nonprofits, are outraged. Scores of articles and blog posts have denounced the "private-equity takeover" of .org. Icann has had protests outside its headquarters. Democrats in Congress asked Icann in a January letter to block the sale.
The most common concern is cost, as Ethos will seek a return on its $1.1 billion investment. Yet the current annual cost of owning a .org domain is about $10, and Ethos has committed not to raise prices more than 10% a year on average. A $1 per year cost increase is negligible even for the smallest nonprofit.
Even without this commitment, market pressure would contain the price. There are more than a thousand domain-name middlemen, like GoDaddy, which sell addresses directly to consumers. There are also dozens of competitor for-profit registries, and the largest, .com, faces regulatory caps on price increases. If Ethos jacked up the price, it would cause groups to leave .org and deter new ones from joining. Yet expanding .org's presence beyond the U.S. is key to Ethos' business strategy.
ISOC says it decided to sell .org partly because it was not equipped to deal with this business environment. New domains (like .us and .site) have come online, and more people are accessing the web through apps. ISOC hoped a for-profit could be a more versatile steward. To protect its investment, Ethos will need to invest in services to enhance .org's appeal to consumers.
Those most sensitive to price increases are speculators who own thousands of domains and sell them off. Nearly two million .org domains turn over each year, and the Internet Commerce Association, which represents domain holders, was one of the first to howl about the sale. It would be ironic if protests against the "capitalist-based internet industrial complex," as one nonprofit CEO told the New York Times, serve the interest of domain-name arbitrage.
Another irony comes from the appeals to free speech online from the likes of Elizabeth Warren. The Senator has made suppression of political speech on social media a tenet of her presidential campaign, demanding Facebook remove ads critical of Democrats she deems misleading. Yet her letter to Icann paints the Ethos acquisition as a free-speech threat, citing registries' intervention in trademark disputes.
Trademark infringements are covered by Icann's dispute-resolution policy which won't change when the .org registry is sold. Registries disable sites only in extraordinary circumstances—a contrast to the heavy-handed approach many on the left are demanding of Big Tech firms. In any case Ethos has less cause to suppress speech than a nonprofit and says it will create a "Stewardship Council" that will "ratify strong rules protecting freedom of expression."
There's a larger point here about "stakeholder capitalism," which is coming into fashion. Ethos emphasizes its commitment to all "stakeholders," not just its owners, and apparently will give some teeth to those commitments in its charter for the .org registry. Yet that's not enough for many activists, who see private capital as inherently exploitative rather than a source of value creation and technological progress enjoyed by all.
The nonprofits raising a fuss over Ethos are vehicles of political interests. The real danger is that Icann will be intimidated, hurting the reputation for political independence of what should be the web's honest broker.

Texto completo: Some Luzerne County residents have experienced harder hits to their wallets this year, as many municipalities are dealing with rising garbage and recycling rates.
In Nanticoke, the annual rate went up $38 - from $220 to $258. Mayor Kevin Coughlin said the rates were raised because it costs more money for the removal company to process everything.
The city’s current contract with J.P. Mascaro & Sons, its hauler, is done in 2021. Coughlin said the city will work to find a solution that will keep the rates low for residents.
According to Joe Valenti, the president of Waste Reduction Recycling & Transfer Inc., which handles garbage removal for businesses in Luzerne County, keeping rates low won’t be possible, unless something changes for the better in the recycling market.
According to a 2019 New York Times article, China’s refusal to accept used plastic or paper in January 2018 from the U.S. caused domestic recycling companies to charge more for processing to make up for lost profits. This, in turn, causes cities to charge their residents more to cushion their individual losses, even though recycling in the U.S. is a federal mandate.
For residents in Dallas Area Municipal Authority, the quarterly garbage rate went up to $63 per household this year after being $60 from 2017-19. DAMA executive director Thomas Keiper said that cost includes garbage, recycling, composting and yard waste removal.
Keiper said the increase was needed after looking at how many tons of recycling and garbage is collected, the tipping fees for both, the labor and benefits costs, and dividing that by the number of homes.
“It had to go up this year due to the cost of recycling,” Keiper said. “Recycling in 2016, 2017 and 2018, we were getting some money for every ton of recycling. It’s now costing us between $52-$58 to get rid of recycling.”
Keiper said DAMA had to budget $56 per ton to dispose of recycling in 2019, even though it received $30 per ton for recycling in 2018. Valenti shared the sentiment, saying while he used to receive $120 for every ton of recycling his company brought to the processing plant, he now has to pay the processing plant that same amount to take the recycling.
“The recycling stream is going right to the waste stream,” said Valenti, adding it’s cheaper that way. “If you put glass in your recycling container, it’s pulled out where they sort it and it’s taken directly to a landfill.
“It’s all supply and demand. Somebody has to eat that cost.”
Another reason for the rising rates for trash and recycling collection is the lack of individuals who want to come and work in the field. Dupont Mayor Dan Lello said there’s not many people anymore who want to pick up garbage in 90-degree weather or freezing conditions.
Valenti said the business also can’t offer competitive wages as incentives, as the costs of recycling have forced companies to lower their wages to save money. Lello said it’s a cycle, one Valenti said it’s only going to get worse.
In Dupont, a garbage sticker for senior citizens costs $95 per year, while families are charged $125 per year and commercial businesses are charged $160. Lello said those prices haven’t moved that much in the last decade, despite using in-house haulers.
“We were contemplating using a private hauler, but we didn’t do that,” Lello said. “Eventually, we may have to do that.”
Lello said they have held off on using outside collection companies because the borough has been able to handle the work itself. However, due to a lack of people with commercial driver’s licenses - which are needed to drive the trucks - and aging equipment, that might be something they have to consider doing again.
Although he said he will try to hold the rates steady, changes in trash collection fees and a lack of personnel might prompt a raise in the rates to cover the cost.
In smaller boroughs like Dupont and Warrior Run, it’s easier to hold the residents accountable for getting a sticker. Warrior Run councilman Richard Kratz said neighbors can see who has and has not paid for their garbage sticker, and Lello said the rates might be more manageable if everyone paid for the services.
Coughlin said Nanticoke is considering incorporating the garbage tax into the property tax and making landlords responsible for it.
“We’re trying any way we can to keep the rates down,” Coughlin said. “We’re looking into this where maybe we could save money and lower the fees for the residents of the city.”
When Kratz realized the other members of Warrior Run’s council were going to raise the garbage sticker price by $80 by Jan. 1, 2020, he encouraged residents to come out to the meeting to protest. Kratz, however, only succeeded in getting a handful more people to come out and the motion passed.
“They’re going to get shell-shocked when they go down to the borough building to buy their sticker and find out it’s $80 more this year,” Kratz said.
In 2019, Warrior Run residents paid only $170 annually to have a garbage sticker. Now they must pay $250 for the sticker, plus a $25 late fee if they failed to purchase a sticker by the end of January
In a perfect world, Kratz said, the system would be set up by household - the price for the sticker would fluctuate based on how many people comprise a single household in Warrior Run.
Kratz had proposed breaking the one-time payment of $250 into a payment of $125 every six months to make it easier on families and those who live on fixed incomes. Kratz added he would have only charged households $200 the first year and $220 the next three years to transition into the increased payment.
“It’s just all kinds of money that the people are getting charged for,” Kratz said. “It’s not right.”

Texto completo: Democrats' drive to impeach and remove President Trump was destined to fail. But more than fail, it has backfired on them - strengthening Trump for the 2020 campaign and increasing his odds of winning a second term.
First, impeachment appears to have raised Trump's approval rating to the highest point of his presidency. In mid-October, just before the House impeachment hearings began, Trump's Gallup approval rating was just 39% - a few points above his all-time low. Last week, as his Senate trial wound up, Gallup reported that Trump's approval has risen a 10 full points to 49% - his all-time personal best. The number of Americans who want Trump removed has plummeted. In October, a 52% majority of Americans supported his removal, today a 52% majority opposes it. For Democrats, this is the very definition of failure.
Far from advancing their case for removing Trump, Democrats have convinced more Americans that he deserves a second term. Before the 2018 midterms that put Democrats in control of the House, just 41% of the country said Trump should be re-elected; today, after the Democratic House's failed impeachment effort, 50% want to give him four more years. Since impeachment began, Trump's standing with the voters has improved by almost every measure.
Second, impeachment has energized Trump's base. According to Gallup, the president's approval among Republicans is now a record 94% - up 6 percentage points since January. The more Democrats tried to take him down, the more Republicans have united behind the president.
Third, the failure of their impeachment drive has dispirited the Democratic base. An Associated Press poll finds that just 33% of Democrats are excited about the 2020 election. At the Iowa caucuses, where Democratic voters had their first chance to show their enthusiasm for replacing Trump, turnout was a dismal 170,000 - a 30% decline from 2008, when 240,000 Iowans turned out to give Barack Obama his first presidential primary victory.
Fourth, impeachment has put moderate House Democrats in grave peril. A New York Times/Sienna College poll recently found that almost two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, but then voted for House Democrats in 2018, plan to back Trump again in 2020. That's bad news for the 31 House Democrats elected in Trump districts in the midterms. How many people are going to vote to give Trump a second term and vote for the Democrats who tried to take away their right to do so? Not many.
Fifth, impeachment forced Democrats to unlock the legislative floodgates and give Trump major victories. Democrats knew that voters saw them focusing on impeachment at the expense of getting things done, so as they voted to approve articles of impeachment, they also voted to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump's tax bill that repealed three Obamacare taxes, and Trump's $738billion defense spending bill that created his Space Force and enacted his parental leave policy for federal workers, without restricting his use of defense dollars to build a border wall. The effect was the opposite of what Democrats intended, creating the impression that while Democrats were busy impeaching, Trump was busy governing.
Finally, impeachment has helped Trump raise an enormous war chest. In the last three months of 2019 - the period during which the House conducted its impeachment inquiry - Trump raised $46million, giving him $102.7 million in the bank. The Senate trial will likely have a similar impact on his fundraising in the first quarter of 2020. Impeachment not only energized Republican voters, it has energized Republican donors.
And the Democrats' self-inflicted wounds keep coming. During Trump's State of the Union address, the House impeachment managers sat together in the chamber, sullen and stone-faced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., broke protocol and refused to utter the traditional words of introduction - "It is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce the president of the United States" - and then dramatically tore up Trump's address on national television when he concluded. The image Democrats projected to the country was that of a bunch of sore losers.
Trump now goes into the 2020 election strengthened and emboldened - the first president in U.S. history to carry an impeachment acquittal into a general election. For three years, Democrats threw everything they had at Trump. They accused him of bribery, extortion, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress, abuse of power, conspiracy and even treason. Three years later, he's still standing - and thanks to impeachment, he may still be standing after the dust settles in November.

PEOPLE
Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian who enlivened the game show "To Tell the Truth" and played a crotchety merchant on "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91.
The Los Angeles County coroner's office confirmed Bean's Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a "traffic-related" fatality. The coroner's office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from police.
A man was crossing the road outside of a crosswalk in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Drake Madison said. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene, neither was impaired and Bean's death was being treated as an accident, Madison said.
Bean appeared in a number of films - notably, "Anatomy of a Murder" and "Being John Malkovich" - and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Betty Comden-Adolph Green musical "Subways Are for Sleeping." But fans remembered him most for his many TV appearances from the 1950s onward.
"Mr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar," the New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, "The Blue Angel." It said he showed "a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat."
Bean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on "To Tell the Truth." The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: "Will the real (notable's name) please stand up?"
Bean's style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on "The Tonight Show" more than 200 times.
Platt youngest winner
of Hasty Pudding honor
Award-winning actor and musician Ben Platt took a quick jab at President Donald Trump late Friday while being honored by Harvard University's famed Hasty Pudding Theatricals as its 2020 Man of the Year.
Students dressed in drag and elaborate costumes bestowed the golden pudding pot - and a sparkly bra - on Platt, but not before Hasty Pudding members poked fun at his various roles in theater, television and film.
Platt sang Nina Simone's classic "Feeling Good" and later gave a political speech about whether a hot dog is also a sandwich.
It was during this speech that Platt proclaimed "Anyone but Trump 2020!" as the celebratory roast neared its end.
The 26-year-old is the youngest recipient of the award in its 54-year history, handed out annually by the troupe that dates to the late 18th century.

Texto completo: When I was a girl in the 1980s, my parents took me to visit Orchard House, Louisa May Alcott's home in Concord, Massachusetts. This trip inspired me as a young writer. Through her autobiographical novel "Little Women," Alcott showed what it was like to be a professional author with her "genius cap" on, scribbling away in a loud and bustling home.
I also felt an affinity for her because I'm part of a family configuration rarely seen except in our household, the pages of "Little Women" and the Alcott home: four sisters and no brothers (I'm the youngest, "Amy").
At Orchard House, built circa 1650, it is estimated that 80% of the furnishings were owned by the Alcotts. There, Alcott wrote "Little Women" at a desk her father, noted abolitionist and transcendentalist Amos Bronson Alcott, built for her. "The rooms she's describing in the book are actually the rooms in Orchard House," says the home's executive director, Jan Turnquist. "A lot of people tell me they feel like they're walking through the book."
Alcott died in 1888, two days after her father, and Orchard House opened as a museum in 1911.
Alcott's half-moon-shaped desk, affixed to the space of wall between two windows of her bedroom, is modest, barely large enough to hold an inkwell and a few pieces of paper. Yet a spirit of creativity still seems to emanate from it. "I've had young women ask me if they can sit in the room and write a little bit," Turnquist says. If circumstances allow and the home is not busy, she will occasionally grant the request.
That long-ago visit showed me that in a small house with narrow staircases, Alcott pulled off writing a novel that is in print more than 150 years later, that has been read by the millions, that got her featured in a card game we owned called Authors and that has inspired multiple film versions. The 2019 production, nominated for six Oscars including best picture, already has increased tourism at Orchard House, which Turnquist says has had to hire more docents and stay open longer each day.
Writing at her simple shelf desk led Alcott to international bestsellerdom. I'm not the only one who has felt that touring the home of an author made such a career seem possible for oneself. Following are a list of six American female writers' homes to visit, to inspire a new generation of young authors.
If you go: 399 Lexington Road, Concord, Mass.; (978) 369-4118; louisamayalcott.org. Hours vary by season but are often 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m. $5 children 6 and older, $10 adults.
Emily Dickinson's home
Amherst, Massachusetts
A visit here includes the Homestead, the poet's home, with a museum on the ground floor, and the Evergreens, her brother's home next door. Dickinson was reclusive, so her home was her world. See the window from which she lowered baskets of fresh-baked cookies to the neighbor children she was too shy to speak with, and the door she walked past slowly to constitute an "examination" for the doctor seated inside the room. Dickinson's poetry, with its much-studied hyphenation and stunning leaps of imagination, has fueled admiration for over 100 years, nearly all of it after her 1886 death, when her sister found her poems in her dresser drawer. Dickinson had been only lightly published during her lifetime, and that anonymously. The Homestead opened for tours in 1965, while the Evergreens opened in the early 2000s.
If you go: 280 Main St., Amherst, Mass.; (413) 542-8161; emilydickinsonmuseum.org. Hours vary by season, but the home is closed in January and February. Typical hours are 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Adults 18 and older, $15. Children, free.
Edith Wharton's home,
the Mount
Lenox, Massachusetts
Wharton, whose 40-plus books include classic novels such as "The Age of Innocence" as well as nonfiction works, was the first female Pulitzer Prize winner. In 1902 she designed the Mount and its formal gardens, calling upon her architectural and design expertise. She and her husband lived in the home until 1911, and during that time she wrote "The House of Mirth" and "Ethan Frome." The home's 2,700-volume library contains books in which she made personal annotations.
If you go: 2 Plunkett St., Lenox, Mass.; (413) 551-5111; edithwharton.org. Open daily May-October, and weekends only November-February, 10:45 a.m.-4 p.m. Adults 19 and older, $20. Children, free.
Pearl S. Buck House
Perkasie, Pennsylvania
A champion for social justice, Buck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for her novel "The Good Earth," a portrayal of a Chinese farming family, and six years later won the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. The child of West Virginian missionaries, Buck spent much of her life in China, but the stone farmhouse in Pennsylvania, formerly called Green Hills Farm, was her home from 1934 to 1969. Her moss-green Royal typewriter, used for writing "The Good Earth," is on display.
If you go: 520 Dublin Road, Perkasie, Penn.; (215) 249-0100; pearlsbuck.org. Adults, $15. Students, $7. Prices rise in winter months. Two types of tours take place once or twice a day.
Laura Ingalls Wilder
Historic Home & Museum
Mansfield, Missouri
Anyone who read the nine-volume autobiographical "Little House on the Prairie" series knows that the Ingalls family moved around constantly. While places where young Laura lived can be found in six states, some consist of reproduction cabins or land where homestead shanties or dugouts once stood. In Missouri, however, you can tour the Rocky Ridge Farm, where Laura and her husband, Almanzo, lived and farmed starting in 1896. After the stock market crash of 1929 ruined their prospects, she began writing about her youth at a small wooden desk with pigeon holes in the home's study. Financial success and fame ensued as readers warmed to the tales of a covered-wagon family's adventures.
If you go: 3060 Highway A, Mansfield, Mo.; (877) 924-7126; lauraingallswilderhome.com. Open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily March through mid-November, with limited Sunday hours. Adults, $14. Children 6-17, $7.
Eudora Welty's home
Jackson, Mississippi
Welty lived here from 1925 until her death in 2001, and it is where she wrote most of her fiction and essays. The furnishings are completely authentic, as Welty decided to bequeath the home to the state of Mississippi in 1986, well before she died. Nearly every wall is lined with books, a testament to her love of literature - as a child, she read two library books a day. Outside, heirloom gardens established by her mother are still tended. Welty is known as a short-story writer but won the Pulitzer for her novel "The Optimist's Daughter." She was the first living writer to be included in the Library of America series "of works by United States literary giants," reported the New York Times in its obituary.
If you go: 1109 Pinehurst St., Jackson, Miss.; (601) 353-7762; mdah.ms.gov/welty. Open Tuesday-Friday and second Saturdays, with tours at 9 and 11 a.m., and 1 and 3 p.m. Adults, $5. Children under 6, free. Students, $3.

Texto completo: I would like to thank Binyamin Appelbaum, whose opinion column in The New York Times on Jan. 26 thrust historic preservation onto the national stage.

It was headlined "When Historic Preservation Hurts Cities: The madness of prohibiting solar panels on the rooftops of historic buildings illustrates how preservation culture has run amok."

While I disagree with many of his assertions, I appreciate the scrutiny Appelbaum has directed toward historic preservation efforts.

I found Appelbaum's assertion that very few buildings deserve preservation most disappointing. His position is stated baldly as he describes where he lives in Washington. "It's not historic in the sense that anything especially important happened here -- certainly not in the modest rowhouses that make up the bulk of the neighborhood."

Appelbaum merely channeled a commonly held misconception of what historic preservation is all about.

Here is what I understand about historic preservation: it provides tangible economic value, it is inherently green, it strengthens neighborhoods and it uncovers and memorializes the stories of communities through the voices that built them.

It's no secret the voices most at risk for erasure by the passage of time are the voices of the marginalized and underrepresented. It's the work of historic preservation to protect those voices -- our collective story -- from obscurity.

Preserving the visual landscape measurably contributes to our quality of life, historic neighborhoods have more stable property values in a downturn and foster more positive growth and private investment.

But while my nonprofit has a mission to "promote the preservation of the architectural, historical and archaeological heritage of Florida," too often when I meet with lawmakers what I hear about is the "paint police."

Preservationists need to all be spokespeople for smart and progressive preservation policy. We should emphasize the thousands of successful adaptive reuse projects around the country, from Starbucks housed in old banks to historic prisons converted into hotels, that find creative solutions to reuse old buildings.

Oversight regulations for historic homes should be flexible.

As many as 15 years ago I sat on a historic preservation board that reviewed and allowed solar panels on a historic church in a historic district in Nashville. A solution was found: put panels on a section of the roof that doesn't face the street and doesn't hamper the overall experience of walking down a historic street in a historic city.

Every day local preservation boards and nonprofits find solutions that balance growth, innovation, technology and historic preservation.

It is important for historic preservation design guidelines to be regularly updated and reconsidered in light of changing times. However, the core reasoning should remain constant: to provide basic protections for historic properties as part of an integrated urban plan.

For someone who condemns elitism, it's curious the author states nothing important can happen in a modest rowhouse. One of the most important lessons we can learn from the past is that very often the people who make profound marks on human history are not those who lived in big houses.

Our movement seeks not to preserve a building for its own sake, but to use historic preservation to build, engage and strengthen communities.

We do that here in Tallahassee where our nonprofit is headquartered in a 110-year-old Victorian house. We work in the building and are responsible for its maintenance, but every time we host a community event, I am reminded it belongs to many.

It is fascinating to hear about people's experiences with the house: laughing over where on the back porch a dad liked to smoke his pipe, seeing where on the front porch a granddaughter sat in a rocking chair to cool off in pre-air-conditioned Florida, hearing ghost stories about the upstairs remembered from a childhood long past, looking out the window where a man sat for prom pictures 50 years ago (and then later married his prom date).

Or, in the case of a woman who stopped by on a recent workday, learning how a building can hold a place in our hearts. She told me her daughter said every time they passed that one day she would live here.

Not long ago that daughter passed away -- she never even saw the inside of the building -- but I took her mother on a tour of the house that day. We talked about her daughter and her loss, and I realized once again this building is far more than just the place I work.

We do not truly ever own historic buildings, we are only stewards protecting their stories.

Melissa Wyllie is the CEO and president of the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation, Florida's nonprofit in Tallahassee dedicated to protecting the state's irreplaceable historic resources.

Book Festival celebrates authors, readers

Texto completo: whichever title they prefer, for those with a love for reading and the written word, the Savannah Book Festival is the biggest event of the year.
The 13th annual festival runs Thursday through Feb. 16, with keynote speakers at Trustees Theater each day and its popular book festival on Saturday.
Festival Saturday will bring more than 40 authors to seven venues in and around Telfair Square and draw an estimated 10,000 people to downtown Savannah, according to festival information. The Saturday festival runs 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and is free and open to the public.
Throughout the festival, avid book fans get a chance to hear their favorite authors speak on their works and meet afterward for a book-signing opportunity.
It's a great way to connect literary fans and authors, offering the chance to see a range of writers up close and personal, said Erika Dongre, executive director of the Savannah Book Festival.
"It's important to the city. I think Savannah has a lot of readers who love to meet with the authors and find their inspiration," Dongre shared. "The festival is all about
supporting civil conversation and celebrating the written word."
The opening address kicks off Feb. 13 at Trustees Theater, featuring award-winning author Joseph Kanon speaking about his latest book "The Accomplice," which follows a Nazi hunter in the 1960s who tracks his target from Germany to South America.
On Feb. 14, widely-popular crime and legal author John Grisham gives an address on his latest book, "The Guardians," a New York Times bestseller, which follows the murder of a young lawyer in Florida and the ensuing investigation. Grisham's keynote address sold out quickly once tickets went on sale earlier this year.
The festival's closing address Feb. 16 features culinary authors John Becker and Megan Scott, delving into their 2019 edition of "Joy of Cooking." Becker is the great-grandson of original "Joy of Cooking" author Irma Rombauer and recently took on the family mantle. He is accompanied by Scott, who joined the "Joy of Cooking" team in 2010 and is a culinary director for a marketing agency.
On Festival Saturday, each of the 45 authors speaks with audiences for about 40 to 50 minutes followed by a 20-minute meet-and-greet book sale, at seven locations sprinkled throughout downtown. Looking up the schedule ahead of time and having a plan is key, festival officials advise.
Speaking engagements are first come, first serve and fill up quickly, so make sure you've got alternate speaking engagements on your list in case a first choice fills up, Dongre noted.
"Look at your schedule ahead of time. It is difficult if you want to get your booked signed and go to each session," Dongre said. "After the session is when the author is signing their book, so plan your day accordingly and factor in if you want wait in line to get your book signed."
This year's festival features a wide range of authors and subjects, spanning fiction and nonfiction; historical and biographical works; mystery, crime and thrillers; memoirs and more. Festival officials say half the fun is discovering new subjects and stumbling upon talented authors from across the country.
The Grey Market and Leopold's Ice Cream have partnered with the event to offer food dishes inspired by the Savannah Book Festival, while nearly a dozen food trucks will be posted around Telfair Square to offer an array of food, snacks and desserts to passersby.
The learning and fun are not only for festival goers. Since 2010, SBF in Schools has linked the festival's authors with public and private schools, allowing them to speak with students and share what they have learned about writing, what inspires them to write and living the writing life.
The Savannah Book Festival is a great way to see your favorite authors in person, and discover new and rising authors, Dongre added. It's all about keeping books alive and sharing what makes reading so wonderful in the first place.
"I love how it brings Savannah together. We have people coming from all over to interact with these authors," Dongre said. "I like to see the authors loving how the attendees have read their books and are interested in what they have written and celebrating these wonderful works."

Texto completo: ‘We love our art! It gives us so much joy. That’s what we love the most. That’s what we want to share.”
Rachna Nivas and Rina Mehta are on the line from San Francisco, taking questions about “Speak,” the Leela Dance Collective’s one-of-a-kind tour de force coming this week to the Castle Theater at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center. Both Indian Americans, they practice the ancient, endangered and thoroughly mesmerizing Indian dance form known as Kathak. Good luck telling their voices apart.
Video of the 15-minute finale or even the two-minute trailer posted on the MACC website offers ample promise the 90-minute show will deliver in spades. The “collective” label suggests more bodies than the four we see, but those four dance up a storm, each a star in her own right. Complementing Mehta and Nivas will be Josette Wiggan-Freund, filling in for Michelle Dorrance, and Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, divas from the faraway realm of American tap.
Classy as well as gorgeous, the gold-trimmed white costumes, no two alike, help the eye appreciate the natures of two distinct dance worlds. The Kathakas, in fitted bodices and flaring ankle-length skirts over leggings, capture a viewer’s eye with the majestic, sculpted movement of their arms and upper bodies, with their swirling turns and arrow-sharp stop-action poses. The hoofers, in leggings plus tunics cut to midthigh, fling their limbs with a zinging abandon.
“Barefoot, we can’t do the light things they do with their shoes,” says Mehta. “We’re lifted in the upper body, but at the same time we’re very deep into the earth, very grounded.” The stylistic contrast between the disciplines of tap and Kathak is as radical as the contrast between women’s steps and men’s in a spicy Magyar folk dance like the czardas — yet also as compatible.
“We don’t call this show ‘fusion,’” says Nivas. “When we’re on tour, Rina and I take Michelle and Dormeshia’s master classes, and they take ours. But in performance we don’t put on tap shoes, and Michelle and Dormeshia don’t put on ankle bells. We’re all on the purist side, but we embrace our differences and similarities.”
Which brings us, none too soon, to the element of sound. “Speak” involves live music from a classical Indian trio of sitar, vocals and tabla as well as a modern-jazz combo consisting of piano, drums and bass. But the defining acoustic element is the magic carpet of sound the dancers roll out for themselves in layers every step of the way.
Like flamenco, both Kathak and tap fall under the heading of “percussive dancing,” inseparable from the nonstop staccato or rolling thunder of footwork that is often too quick for the eye yet never for the ear. For a hoofer, tap shoes are musical instruments. So are the bare feet in Kathak, along with their “ghungroo,” or cuffs of jangling ankle bells.
“Oh, yes,” says Mehta. “Our bells are very special to us. We actually string our own. We use them and think of them the way a sitar player will treat the sitar.”
At its origins, Kathak was a medium for enacting epics of gods and heroes, with an emphasis on dramatic gesture and facial expression. “In fact, ‘katha’ means story,” says Nivas. “In the first version of ‘Speak,’ we included a dance that told a story, but in the end we decided not to touch it. The classic aspect we focus on is rhythm. Our approach to rhythm is very different from the approach in tap. Western rhythm is linear. For us, rhythm is cyclical. Sometimes we’ll work with a 16-beat cycle. Sometimes, for extra fun, we’ll work with a 9-1/2-beat cycle.”
After a while, a linear Western ear starts hearing the patterns of wave upon wave.
Formal considerations aside, “Speak” is informed by ongoing historical reflection. Before “Speak” there was “Upaj” (documented on a video of the same name), which spun off from the serendipitous encounter of Nivas and Mehta’s Kathak guru Pandit Chitresh Das and the electrifying tap star Jason Samuels Smith, nearly four decades his junior. Having met more or less by chance at a dance festival, these unlikely collaborators spent years exploring potential common ground.
Nivas and Mehta think of “Speak” as the next step in the dialogue, this one initiated “by the ladies,” addressing a new set of questions.
“Dormeshia and Jason have educated us so much about the origins of tap — how it was born out of slavery, how it went through marginalization and deprivation. Everyone knows who Fred Astaire is, but what about all the underground masters?
“Kathak, too, has gone through an incredible struggle. Under British rule it went underground for 150 years. Many lineages disappeared. Property was confiscated, public performances were banned. Underground lineages kept it alive. But even now the Indian masses are completely disconnected from the art. Like tap, Kathak has been eclipsed by more recent pop forms.”
Think Bollywood. “Today both Kathak and tap are very much struggling.”
Advocacy is the work of the angels, but in the end the crusade can only be as powerful as the love it kindles. Isn’t that always the way? In the blaze of performance, the spirit of the moment incinerates the agenda. What’s that the dancers said 16 or 9-1/2 beats ago?
“We love our art! It gives us so much joy. That’s what we love the most. That’s what we want to share.”
And they do.

Texto completo: Re: "Democrats are a house divided ahead of election," Jan. 26:
We should remember the great electoral successes in 2008 and again in 2018, both occurring after two disastrous Republican administrations. The 2018 midterm elections resulted in 400 seats switching from red to blue. The Democratic winners appealed to moderates and independents while running campaigns on traditional Democratic values.
Very few of these winners wanted a Bernie Sanders anywhere near their campaigns. Most of the Democratic winners in the general election had beaten primary opponents to the left.
Conservative media and the left-leaning mainstream media joined forces in peddling the myth that the 2018 mid-term elections were a huge win for the Democratic left with its handful of primary wins in urban minority districts.
Medicare for All and the Green New Deal have been breathlessly touted as the solutions to our problems, and liberals like Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and even Tom Steyer have been falling all over each other using leftist talking points to compete with Bernie Sanders.
Unsurprisingly a late November poll in the New York Times showed that two-thirds of 2016 Trump voters who switched to Democrats in 2018 are planning to vote for Trump again in 2020.
With only 60,000 actual Democratic Socialists in the U.S., much of Bernie Sanders' support is based on the myth that the Nordic countries are examples of democratic socialism.
In 2015, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the then-prime minister of Denmark, objected strongly to the comparison. Scandinavian social democrats do not write books about the revolution or claim that billionaires should not exist because when they go, so does opportunity and wealth for the rest of us. Norway and Sweden have a higher ratio of billionaires than the U.S., and both Forbes and Business Insider rate Denmark a better country to conduct business in than the U.S..
Due to their thriving free enterprise systems, Sweden, Finland and Denmark all place higher than the U.S. on the 2019 International Innovation Index.
Advanced countries from New Zealand to Canada to Finland to France have curbed and regulated the free enterprise system with great success so that since 1980, the incomes of their lower-income citizens have increased three to four times, according to the World Inequality Report — unlike their American counterparts.
The reason for lower income stagnation in the U.S. lies squarely with blue-collar working class voters who started voting against their own interest around 1980.
They began voting for tax cuts primarily benefiting the very wealthy, and scrapping rules and regulations to prevent corporate abuse.
Bernie Sanders; constantly repeated assertion that billionaires should not exist places him squarely with Hugo Chavez.
The democratic election win by the Venezuelan socialist in 1998 has resulted in massive chaos and deep poverty in a once-flourishing economy.
If Sanders is nominated, we can expect an endless supply of horror stories of what socialism has lead to just 1,600 miles south of Florida — and a Trump win in November.

'Cyber flashing': Tip of toxic sexual culture

Texto completo: If you've waded into the jungle of online dating, chances are you've been exposed to a graphic image that you never wanted to see – especially if you're a young woman.
Over half of women ages 18 to 29 have received an explicit image they never asked for, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study. Among all women, 32% have, while 30% of men have.
It's so widespread a problem that one internet user, Kelsey Bressler, working with a friend, developed a filter that would allow women to not see explicit images sent to their messages. Bressler's actions, she wrote in Huffington Post, came after she received a photo on her phone of a man's penis and the message, "Why don't you talk to me?"
Now lawmakers are starting to consider making "cyber flashing," as it's dubbed, a crime:
In January, California state Sen. Ling Ling Chang, a Republican, introduced legislation that would make it illegal to send unsolicited nude images, punishable by a fine.
Just last year, Texas became one of the first states to ban such behavior, instituting fines up to $500.
In 2018, as New York female subway passengers dealt with unwanted sexual images sent via AirDrop to their phones, several city council members introduced legislation to discourage the practice, recommending up to a year in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.
As Joseph Borelli, a Republican council member and a co-sponsor of the legislation, told The New York Times, "Technology has made it significantly easier to be a creep."
#MeToo is failing The fact that this is a real enough problem to warrant lawmaker attention shows how little #MeToo has made inroads in our culture.
Similarly, the new focus on consent in recent years seems to be a band-aid, not a comprehensive solution. There are contracts for college students to sign to indicate consent to sexual activity, and there are even apps for people to sign a consent contract before sex.
While a renewed attention to consent is welcome, it's also just the most basic human decency when it comes to sexual encounters and sharing explicit images. Consider resigned Rep. Katie Hill's comments in The Times regarding the sexual images of her that circulated online: "I was overwhelmed by everything – by how many people had seen my naked body, by the comments, the articles, the millions of opinions, the texts, the calls. I would start shaking, crying, throwing up."
While the California Democrat's case raises interesting questions about transparency, and voters' rights to know about the character of their lawmaker, shouldn't we be able to agree that such measures should be accomplished without exposing private images to the whole internet?
Ultimately, the problem in our culture right now seems to be rooted in a me-first mindset of so many – an attitude that prioritizes personal sexual gratification over honoring and respecting the human dignity of others, including would-be sexual partners.
Researchers in a July article for the Journal of Sex Research found that "men who reported having sent unsolicited (penis pictures) demonstrated higher levels of narcissism and endorsed greater ambivalent and hostile sexism than their nonsending counterparts."
In other words: Pair focus on self with little respect for women, and you've got the formula for the kind of jerk who think it's a swell idea to send explicit images without consent.
The modern sexual revolution is generally depicted as a welcome liberation, the beginning of a new era of pleasure. But is that interpretation correct?
Reconsider 'Little Women' Watching "Little Women" – the hit Oscar-nominated movie from brilliant director Greta Gerwig – it is easy to be wistful for an era where men sought to improve themselves to win women's hearts, and where a tender gesture of love was secretly holding onto a lady's glove, not sending her a graphic sexual image. Sure, I wouldn't like the dauntingly limited career prospects of the "Little Women" heroines, but are we so confident their romantic lives were more stifling than ours?
Undergirding our modern sexual mores is the notion that sexual intimacy can be achieved, and achieved without pain to either partner, without actual personal intimacy – the kind that can only be acquired by communication and companionship over a period of time, not a few hours at a bar. In fact, that same Journal of Sex Research article found that "the most frequently reported motivational category for sending genital images was a transactional mindset (i.e., motivated by hopes of receiving images in return), while the most commonly desired reaction from recipients was that of sexual excitement." Sending these pictures may just be a way to cut short the conversation and go straight to the sexual activity.
Curbing the sending of inappropriate sexual images to strangers is a good first step. But when it comes to healing the toxic, often selfish norms of our sexual culture, much more is needed.

Be like Picasso and you'll master your craft

Texto completo: No one represents mastery more than Pablo Picasso.
His masterpiece "Women of Algiers" sold at auction in New York for over $179 million in 2015, shattering all previous records. His most famous works are instantly recognizable, and he pioneered several styles and genres of modern art throughout his prolific career.
We think of Picasso's creative brilliance as a heavenly gift.
Certainly, he had natural talent.
But the real secret to his mastery was the sheer volume he created. Over his 78 years as a professional artist, Picasso created 147,800 pieces including 13,500 paintings, 100,000 prints and engravings, 300 sculptures and ceramics and 34,000 illustrations. He even penned 300 poems.
In other words, Picasso did the reps. His skill was harnessed through consistent output and thousands of hours toiling away at his beloved craft.
Of the staggering 147,800 original works he created, only 44 are considered truly famous. That's just 0.0298% of his total work product that's recognizable to all but the most sophisticated experts.
To me, this is liberating. We put so much pressure on ourselves to deliver legendary work — every time — and then get disappointed when we inevitably fall short. If Picasso's win rate under three-tenths of one percent, can't we all accept a few stumbles on the way to greatness?
The truth is that any skill worth pursuing is mastered through repetition far more than natural talent. Which means that we mere mortals can develop mad skills in the things that matter most to us, as long as we're willing to do the reps.
Whether your passion is sports or business, science or the arts, realize that your skills are directly linked to the consistency and persistence of your practice. We can all become the masters of our craft if we're willing to endure relentless training.
As Tony Robbins puts it, "Repetition is the mother of skill." Master your skill through grit and determination, and before long.... you'll be considered a "natural."

Texto completo: Complete a first marathon and rejuvenate a major artery. That is the message of an inspiring new study of novice runners and their aortas.
The study finds that training for and finishing a marathon can spruce up arteries, leaving them more flexible, healthy and biologically younger than before, even if runners are older or slow.
But the study also raises some pointed questions about whether a lone marathon is the ideal goal for people hoping to improve their arterial health over the long term.
Inside most of us who are middle-aged or older, arteries are hardening. Our arteries, of course, carry oxygenated blood from our hearts and, when healthy and pliable, expand and contract like bellows as blood pulses through them, keeping the flow smooth and steady.
But with age, our arteries' elasticity declines and they stiffen. Blood begins to jostle and crowd against the vessels' inflexible walls, blood pressure rises, and organs that require an even, gentle stream of blood, like the kidneys and brain, can be affected.
Helpfully, some past research hints that exercise might alter this age-related arterial stiffening. Longtime older athletes, for instance, tend to have relatively supple, responsive arteries.
But most people are not longtime, competitive athletes, and it has not been clear if sedentary people can start to exercise and still improve the state of their arteries.
So, for the new study, which was published in January in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers at University College London and other institutions decided to track the arteries of a group of people who were new to exercise, targeting first-time entrants in an upcoming London Marathon.
The researchers zeroed in on race participants who had reported on entry forms that they were newcomers to the sport and to exercise in general, rarely working out before signing up. The scientists found more than 200 of these men and women, most of them middle-aged and all sedentary, and contacted them six months before race time.
These soon-to-be marathoners agreed to visit the university's lab, completing health and fitness tests and a sophisticated scan of their aorta, designed to measure its flexibility. None of the group showed signs of heart disease or other serious health problems.
Each runner then began his or her preferred marathon-training program, with most jogging a few times a week. This training continued for six months, although some developed injuries or other concerns and dropped out. Ultimately, 136 men and women completed the race, in an average finishing time of 4.5 hours for the men and 5.5 hours for the women. A week or two later, they returned to the lab to repeat the tests.
Their aortas proved to be more flexible now. In fact, their arteries seemed to have shed the equivalent of about four years, in functional terms. The aorta of a 60-year-old marathoner in the study now expanded and contracted about as lithely as that of a 56-year-old participant did at the study's start, and the 56-year-old's arteries worked like those of a prerace 52-year-old, and so on.
These improvements were most marked in older male runners and those whose finishing times had been slowest. They did not depend on changes in runners' fitness or weight, which, in most cases, had been negligible. All that had mattered was that people had kept up with their training and raced.
These findings gratified the researchers, said Dr. Charlotte Manisty, a consulting cardiologist at University College London and the Barts Heart Center, who oversaw the new study. "We had not really known" whether the arteries of sedentary people "could or would benefit" from exercise training, she said, especially if the people were older or notably out of shape. "We just didn't know how much plasticity their arteries still had."
The answer seems to have been plenty, however, she said. "Almost everyone benefited," Manisty said, "and those people whose arteries needed the most help benefited the most."
But these results do not consider the large number of would-be marathon racers in the study who did not make it to the start line. It is also unknown whether the rejuvenation of runners' aortas is likely to last or if the benefits will be lost if they do not continue to run.
"Exercise is great for the entire body, including the arteries," said Dr. Julio Chirinos, an associate professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study.
It's also uncertain whether someone must go the full 26.2 miles to improve arterial health, Chirinos said. "Is this the best dose" of exercise to produce healthier, more-youthful arteries, he asked. Perhaps less training would be sufficient, or different exercises of varying intensities, or any routine people will continue for the long haul.
Manisty agreed. "We really do not know the threshold amount of exercise needed" to gain the benefits seen in her study, she said.
But she and her colleagues expect in the future to study the effects of training for other, shorter events and also include people who have existing heart disease, high blood pressure and other health concerns.

Texto completo: The most enjoyable part of the Treasures of the Sea of Cortez cruise — the inaugural sailing from Puerto Peñasco, Mexico, departed in January — is the itinerary.
The 11-night, seven-port cruise was on Cruise and Maritime Voyages' storied MV Astoria ship. It showed passengers a variety of seaside communities, from small towns like Santa Rosalia, which welcomed its first cruise ship in 10 years, to the bustling tourist town of Cabo San Lucas, known for its celebrity spottings as well as being a staple of cruise-to-Mexico itineraries.
Here are highlights of each port I visited. I was on the ship for six nights, joining in Cabo San Lucas just in time for the ship to set sail and disembarking in Puerto Peñasco at the end of the itinerary.
La Paz We docked in La Paz, about 98 miles north of Cabo San Lucas. It's gaining popularity as a low-key alternative to Cabo. An appealing alternative to nature lovers, La Paz was recently named to New York Times Travel's 52 Places to travel in 2020 thanks to its "reimagined waterfront and sustainable sensibility."
You'll see what they mean with a simple stroll along the renovated Malecón, the walkway that winds along the water's edge. It has sculptures and plenty of seaside playgrounds for kids. Would you rather bike than walk? The city offers free eBikes to borrow. You'll just need to download the app to your phone to unlock one.
Astoria passengers had the choice of taking a shuttle from the dock to either the heart of La Paz or to the beach. You won't find chain hotels or mega shopping. Nature lovers come here to enjoy the famous Balandra Beach as well as spot sea lions and other wildlife.
Loreto We rode a tender from the Astoria to Loreto, where Jesuit missionaries settled in 1697. If you want to lounge on the beach, there's one right as you walk off the boat. From the dock you can easily walk into the heart of the city.
Jesuit missionaries built Nuestra Señora de Loreto, which has transferred among the Jesuit, Franciscan and Dominican orders. A museum next to the mission provides a look at the history of missionaries in Baja California. From there, you can stroll down the cobblestone streets, enjoying the restaurants and shops.
You also can take an excursion up a mountain to nearby San Javier, where Franciscan missionaries built Mision San Francisco Javier de Vigge-Biaundo. Outside are Valencia orange trees and olive trees brought from Spain by the missionaries.
Fair warning: To get to this mission, you'll drive a winding road through the mountains. It's a beautiful drive, but probably not for those who easily get car sick.
Santa Rosalia We also tendered from the ship to Santa Rosalia. I think this was my favorite port. The town of 15,000 people held a meeting to plan for the arrival of the first cruise ship in 10 years. Their preparation showed. They had information booths placed around town and held a farmers market to share the work of local artisans with passengers.
The French-influenced town is easy to walk around and the center city is a short walk from the dock where the tenders arrive. Iglesia de Santa Bárbara reportedly was designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel, the designer and namesake of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It's created from stamped steel squares. (In the 1990s, a scholar challenged whether the church was indeed a product of Eiffel. Neither side could produce definitive proof.)
Panaderia el Boleo has been baking bread and pastries in its wood-fired stove since 1901. Enjoy a sweet treat from here as you walk around town.
Walk up the hill for a view of the city and the Sea of Cortez. There you will find the historic Hotel Frances as well as the Museo el Boleo, which once served as the bookkeeping offices for the El Boleo mining operation.
The Astoria offered a whale-watching tour from this port. You'll take a bus for a couple hours to the point where you'll board a boat to head out and see these spectacular mammals in the wild.
Guaymas In Guaymas, we docked and then boarded a shuttle that dropped us off about a block from the town square. Dancers and musicians performed for people strolling through the market in Plaza de Armas 13 de Julio in front of San Fernando Church.
Casa de los 3 Frentes is a coffee shop and museum about a block from the plaza. Along with good coffee and cakes, it has exhibits that pay tribute to the three Mexican presidents who have come from Guaymas.
You can also take a wildlife cruise along the shore. A bus will take you to nearby San Carlos, where you can spot some of the beautiful homes overlooking the Sea of Cortez before learning more about the geology of the region, which sits along a fault line. Your tour guide will point out the birds and fauna as well as take you to spot dolphins.
About the other ports I joined the cruise in Cabo San Lucas, so there were three ports I didn't get to experience first hand. Here are a few things to know about them.
Topolobampo: The termination point for the Chihuahua-Pacific Railroad (which goes through nearby Copper Canyon), the small town is a natural deep-water port. Topolobampo's beaches also draw tourists. And people I spoke with on the cruise raved about the excursion to see El Pechocho, a friendly dolphin who has lived in the cove for more than 20 years.
Mazatlán: A popular tourist destination already, Mazatlán boasts beautiful beaches and architecture, with its historic downtown dispaying neoclassical and French Baroque finishings. Check out USA Today's list of excursions you can do in this town.
Cabo San Lucas: As big as Cabo San Lucas is, you'll still have to take a tender to the shore. From there, it's an easy to walk to restaurants and shops. There's a lot of tourist development, which increased once Mexico completed the Transpeninsular Highway. From beaches and fishing to dining, there's a lot to do in this popular destination.

Texto completo: A musical premiered on Broadway in 1978 called "Ballroom," starring Dorothy Loudon and Vincent Gardenia. It was directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett, who had just come off a wave of success after "A Chorus Line."
Set in New York, "Ballroom" follows a widow named Bea who is convinced by her friend Angie to start experiencing the highs of life again at the Stardust Ballroom, where many escape on the weekend and let loose dancing to cha-cha, merengue and waltz. Bea agrees and ends up meeting a man named Al, who she falls for.
Even though Bennett won a Tony Award for the choreography, the show didn't draw audiences and closed after a few months. The only memory of "Ballroom" is the song "Fifty Percent," which is popular in cabaret.
But CVRep in Cathedral City is out to change that. The 11-year-old theater company bought the rights to the original musical, rewrote the script and worked with the original composer Billy Goldenberg and original lyricist Alan Bergman on the music.
According to CVRep's founding Artistic Director Ron Celona, this is the biggest production the theater has taken on, costing the small company $225,000 that has to be recouped through ticket sales. The show comprises a cast of 26 people, nine musicians and several stagehands.
"I promised my board this won't become a habit, and this is an opportunity," Celona told The Desert Sun. "I have to commend my board for that. They really supported the dream of this project and understood that, but the size of this production is risky."
It all started with 'Fifty Percent' Celona had interest in reviving "Ballroom" after seeing Lucie Arnaz perform "Fifty Percent" at local photographer Michael Childers' "One Night Only" fundraiser for the Barbara Sinatra Center for Abused Children at the McCallum Theatre last May. A fan of the 1975 TV movie "Queen of the Stardust Ballroom" starring Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning, which the musical adaptation is based on, Celona wondered, "Whatever happened to 'Ballroom?'"
"I saw that movie when I was a little kid and the movie also had music in it. I remember it being a sentimental, wonderful, warm, fuzzy experience that was a big sensation," Celona said.
Through a mutual friend in Indian Wells, Celona made contact with Goldenberg, the original composer, last June. Celona met with the 84-year old in a coffee shop in New York City to find out what went wrong with the original Broadway production, and to see if there was any way for CVRep to revive it.
"(Director) Michael Bennett basically came off 'A Chorus Line' as a huge success and bought the rights to the show. He made it a dance show," Celona said. "The story line got minimized. There were these big, flashy, beautiful dance production numbers done by two band singers that had no relationship to the people in the story. I think that was a major flaw in the original. There wasn't enough substance and the audience didn't have a relationship with the characters."
Goldenberg told The Desert Sun it was a "huge disappointment" to him, as well as to the original lyricists.
"It was nowhere near the version we expected," Goldenberg said. "Through the years, the only script that has been sent to theaters is the original script, so we never had a chance to see it in its full-blown form, and (writer Jerome Kass) brewed on this script since we did it on Broadway and unfortunately passed away."
Film producer John Breglio, who wrote the book "I Wanna Be a Producer: How to Make a Killing on Broadway...or Get Killed," said during a 2016 interview that collaboration among creatives behind the show "failed."
"The collaboration among the writer, the composer, the lyricist and Michael (Bennett) never gelled," said Breglio, who was put in charge of Bennett's estate after his death in 1987, according to the New York Times. "Marilyn Bergman, who was a great Academy Award lyricist started being a mother figure to Michael and ended up despising him. Michael didn't respect anybody working on the show because they didn't do what he to do. Jerome Kass was running the book and it was his story, and he was upset because Michael wanted more humor in the piece and Jerome didn't want any humor, so Michael brought in (director) Mike Nichols to write some stuff. It just got worse and worse."
But before CVRep could move ahead with a new version, they had to attain the rights, which were owned by Samuel French, Inc., a publisher of plays. Goldenberg didn't think it would be possible, but Celona knew Samuel French had been purchased by Concord Music, owned by composer and theater director Andrew Lloyd Weber, in 2018.
CVRep's attorney attained the rights last June from Kass' widow, the Michael Bennett estate and Concord Music, Celona said. It required a large deposit as insurance until final box office figures are reported, but Celona would not disclose the cost of the deposit.
Concord Music did not respond to The Desert Sun's requests for comment.
"They looked at the history of how many people are producing Ballroom, next to zero. No one wants to do it because it's a problem script," Celona said. "If I can make it a better script and musical the way they see it as, it then becomes a marketable product to sell to regional theaters all over the world and it makes money,"
'I wanted to make this feel like real life' Once they attained the rights to the musical, CVRep musical director Scott Storr, Bergman and Goldenberg started collaborating on new songs for the production.
But casting "Ballroom" was difficult because it requires older actors and actresses who can sing and dance, as well as look and act like working-class people. Celona searched for people in Los Angeles and New York.
"I didn't want them to have the body or looks of a stereotype and I didn't want a beautiful chorus. That's not what this is show should be in my head and I wanted to make this feel like real life," Celona said.
Actress, singer and dancer Melodie Wolford, who has also been in a production of "La Cage aux Folles" and had roles on the TV shows "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," "The Perfect Murder" and "New Amsterdam," was cast as Bea.
Broadway veteran Bill Nolte, who has performed in productions of "Cats," the early '90s revival of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," "La Cage aux Folles," "1776" and "The Producers," was cast as Al, Bea's love interest.
Like Celona, Nolte is familiar with the story and saw it on Broadway in 1979. He jumped at the chance to play the male lead because of the music and the song "Fifty Percent."
"'Fifty Percent' became an anthem for women in New York because it's so well written," Nolte said. "I always wondered why 'Ballroom' didn't fly, and this is a chance to tweak it and see if we can find what will make it fly. I think we're off to a good start. The fact that we're working with the actual living composer and lyricist is exciting."
Playing Al also comes with the challenge of the character's secret. Nolte described the role as "problematic," and one that starts off as awkward.
"He doesn't really dance with anyone because he can't find a partner," Nolte said. "He's a mailman from the Bronx who is rather ordinary, and when he meets Bea and she finally agrees to dance with them, they discover they're both kind of awkward in this Stardust Ballroom and together they make a good team."
Wolford said "Ballroom" is her dream role. She listened to the Broadway recording with friends while attending University of Southern Mississippi 40 years ago and proclaimed she would one day play the role of Bea on Broadway.
But, as a singer, it has come with a challenge.
"(Original cast member) Dorothy Loudon, who was spectacular, had five songs. I have 10 songs. I'm a soprano and this is not a soprano role. It's been a challenge, but I'm working very hard," Wolford said.
The cast also includes Teri Ralston, one of the original stars of the Broadway musical "Company," playing the role of Angie, a waitress and friend to Bea.

Facial recognition gets scrutiny in NJ

Texto completo: Private companies create huge databases of images from social media. Ring doorbell cameras give police intimate access to citizens' front porches. And now New Jersey leaders are weighing what to do about the use of your pictures in face-matching programs.
Amid local and national concerns over privacy rights, the state's top cop, the attorney general, is working on a policy that would dictate when prosecutors and police across the state can use facial recognition technology.
At least one state lawmaker says it's time to put a pause on use of the technology, a moratorium that would allow lawmakers to work out rules or decide whether it should be banned entirely.
And this is happening as an unanswered question looms: How widely is the technology used in New Jersey?
"We don't know who is using it, we don't know how they're using it," said Assemblyman Andrew Zwicker, D-Mercer. In fact there's a bevy of questions surrounding the relatively new technology, he said.
"Who is using it?" he said. "Is it accurate? What are they doing with that information? Who are they sharing that information with? What's the impact on someone's life who has now been identified?"
Zwicker introduced a bill that would require law enforcement agencies to hold public hearings before using facial recognition technology. But after a nearly two-hour hearing earlier this week when experts raised concern about accuracy of the technology and individual privacy, Zwicker said he's exploring what more may need to be done.
"Making sure we're in front of this now is critically important," he said, noting the rapid pace at which technology advances.
Facial recognition software compares two images for similarities. It can be used to verify someone's identity as a security measure by comparing just two images, or to identify one picture among a group of images, such as comparing a suspect photograph with a group of mugshots. It can unlock your iPhone or iPad and will be used this year to identify athletes competing in the Tokyo Olympics, the first time facial recognition has been used in Olympic history.
While the technology has been around for decades, advancements have made it more affordable and more accessible for private sector use, said Jake Parker, a lobbyist for the industry group Security Industry Association, whose members include facial recognition developers and security companies.
Images used for comparison can come from in-house databases, like a police department's mugshot collection, or more controversially, private companies like Clearview AI, an app that says it pulled billions of photos from across the web, including social sites like Facebook.
One in two American adults were in a law enforcement picture database in 2016, according to a nationwide analysis by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology. The analysis urged governments to regulate use of the technology, which it said was less accurate than fingerprint analysis, to protect individuals' rights and civil liberties.
Yet it is the collection of images by Clearview AI that has sparked a fire recently in New Jersey. Earlier this month, after The New York Times revealed the extensive cache of images collected by Clearview AI, and that it was working with more than 600 police departments across the country, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal told law enforcement officers across the state to stop using it.
Grewal's office is working on issuing a statewide directive to law enforcement about when and how they can use facial recognition technology, Assistant Attorney General B. Stephan Finkel told lawmakers this week. Also underway is a survey to understand which departments were using Clearview AI, Deputy Director of the Division of Criminal Justice Christine Hoffman told lawmakers. Clifton and Livingston police used the program, according to testimony at the hearing.
"We still have only preliminary results but the majority of the counties that have reported in were exploring it on a trial basis and in many cases simply ran officers' photos through the system," Hoffman said. "So I would not characterize this as extensive use at this point in time based upon those results."
But that's just for Clearview AI, not the hundreds of other private companies now offering facial recognition services.
It's not clear how extensively the technology is being used in New Jersey. A spokesman for the attorney general declined to answer questions about which police departments use it.
In Newark, the state's largest city, officials confirmed police use facial recognition to help identify possible suspects. "It has worked well for us over the past few years, especially in cases of robberies and burglaries where surveillance cameras are typically available to capture good quality, up-close suspect images," Newark Department of Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose said in a statement.
Newark police keep their own database of images for comparison and can also access one maintained by New Jersey State Police, he said. A spokeswoman said police do not use facial recognition on the citywide system of publicly accessible surveillance cameras known as Citizens Virtual Patrol.
The state Department of Motor Vehicles has used the technology for years, scouring their in-house database of more than 23 million driver photographs to detect duplicates that could signal fraud. More than 100 people were brought up on criminal charges as a result, the state announced in 2014.
The technology is not used by law enforcement in many of the state's largest cities, including Camden, Edison, Jersey City, Lakewood and Toms River, according to police officials or spokespeople in each of those jurisdictions. At least 30 police departments in New Jersey have agreements with Amazon-owned Ring doorbell cameras to access videos, though it's unclear if they're also using facial recognition technology.
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey says facial recognition shouldn't be used anywhere, pointing to severe consequences including wrongful arrest that could come based on an incorrect identification.
Six cities in California and Massachusetts have banned the use of facial recognition technology, according to Molly Linhorst, a law fellow at the ACLU of New Jersey. Three states — California, Oregon and New Hampshire — have banned its use only for body-worn cameras, but none have banned it completely, she said.
A federal government study in December evaluated the accuracy of nearly 200 algorithms used in facial recognition software and found vast disparities in results, including that a single algorithm could have different accuracy rates for different demographic groups. For example, some algorithms had higher false positive rates when identifying images of African American women among a group of comparison images, according to the report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
"There is a lot about today's technology and its limits that we do not understand," Linhorst told lawmakers this week. "The fact that this technology proves so unreliable, and is more likely to harm communities that already experience significant discrimination and bias provides reason for us to stop acquiring and using facial recognition technology."
Zwicker suggested the technology could lead to widespread government surveillance, citing the classic dystopian novel by George Orwell.
"The biggest area of concern I have, an Orwellian '1984' scenario is the government having a surveillance state," he said. "We're in a place where our entire lives just about are happening online."

Texto completo: Our series "How I became a ..." digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From her beginnings working in the restaurant scene to becoming a cook with viral recipes such as #TheCookies and #TheStew, Alison Roman is quite the culinary jill-of-all-trades. As the bestselling author of cookbooks "Dining In" and "Nothing Fancy" as well as a columnist for New York Times Cooking and Bon Appétit, Roman always has her hands on a keyboard or working on a stovetop.
USA TODAY caught up with the food writer and chef extraordinaire to talk about everything from Joan Didion and oat milk to learning to say no and consistently cultivating staying power in everything she does.
Question: How did you get your start?
Alison Roman: I started by working in kitchens, working in restaurants as a pastry cook. That looks very different than my life does now, but I was working in restaurants and doing service and coming up with dishes that went on menus, things like that.
It basically all relates to each other. I don't think that I would have been as strong of a writer about food had I not cooked professionally and had that background experience. It also teaches you a ridiculous work ethic that is challenging to find elsewhere.
Q: What does a typical day look like for you?
Roman: A typical day is super atypical. It really depends – if I'm shooting photos or videos or shopping for those things, or I'm doing neither and I'm writing or traveling or running errands and trying to stay on top of my general life administration. I feel like I do so many different things all the time that there truly is no typical day, which makes things very challenging.
Q: What's your favorite part about your job?
Roman: It's different all the time; it pushes me creatively and intellectually, and I get to have contact with people and teach them things and have an impact on their lives. It's a completely unique experience to be in people's homes and be a part of their lives, even if it feels one-sided because I don't actually know them. But, just to have a lasting impact that feels a bit different than, say, cooking for them in a restaurant (which can obviously have a really deep impact, but it's just a different style).
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Roman: Really hard work, and not letting things that I find challenging deter me. I think that I have come up against a lot of things that I struggled with, but I've never thought that meant I shouldn't be doing what I wanted to be doing.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule?
Roman: That's something I'm working on. I think that as I get more secure in my career and more successful, it's much easier for me to kind of say no to things and to make time for myself, my friends, and protect my space and personal life. I find that to be easier and easier, and I think I'm getting there. But, just understanding that I'm not going to be very good at my job or to anyone else if I am feeling run ragged because I haven't set aside any time for myself.
Q: What have been some career highlights?
Roman: I'll never forget the first time I was published in Bon Appetit, I'll never forget the first time I got a job as a pastry chef, I'll never forget being recognized for the things that I was putting on menus in restaurants, I'll never forget my first column in The New York Times or making The New York Times bestseller's list, or these milestones that I feel like only happen once that truly do feel so, so special.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Roman: Try different things. Always say yes. Push yourself. Just know that it's not going to be easy. Nothing just falls into your lap, and if it does it's not going to last for very long. You have to constantly be thinking about how to make something secure and stable. Things will come your way, and you may achieve a small amount of success by accident, but in order to really keep it and have staying power, you have to actually work at it, and work really hard. It's like a plant that you have to water and feed and take care of.
Quick hits
What's your coffee order? Oat milk cortado, iced black, or a regular black.
What's your favorite book? I'm really bad at favorites, but I'm rereading "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" right now, which is so good.
What's your favorite song at the moment? I've been listening to a lot of King Princess.
Who have been your biggest mentors? I've been really lucky to have many mentors in the various stages of my career, but I have two chefs I worked for – Ron Mendoza and William Werner – who really helped shape a lot of my work ethic and basic understanding of pastry, cooking, and baking. As I moved more into editorial, I had a lot of really great champions. Christine Muhlke and Adam Rapoport were both so wonderful at championing me and pursuing my own thing.
What's the coolest thing you've ever done? My whole life is really cool. I feel very fortunate and happy to have done several cool things. I was actually just thinking that today while we were shooting videos for The New York Times. I find as much joy in that as if I'm recording [a podcast] with NPR or going on a vacation to Mexico. The coolest thing I've done is shape my life to be able to do a bunch of cool things.

Opinion: Iowa debacle might impact Florida

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential nominating contest got off to a disastrous start last week when the Iowa caucus experienced a complete meltdown, but the candidates don't have time to dwell on what happened in the caucus calamity.
New Hampshire votes Tuesday, and Democrats in other states – including Florida – already are casting early ballots.
Florida elections supervisors sent vote-by-mail ballots to military and overseas presidential primary voters at the beginning of February, and domestic ballots started going out last week.
More than 1.2 million Floridians voted absentee in the 2016 presidential primary, including 520,035 Democrats and 713,857 Republicans.
In Florida's Democratic president primary, absentee voters made up one-third of the electorate in 2016.
With a big presidential field that is attracting plenty of attention, and a deep feeling among Democrats that they need to find a strong challenger to take on President Donald Trump, many Democrats are eager to cast primary ballots this year. The number of Democrats requesting absentee ballots for the 2020 primary already is way up in some Florida counties.
Brevard County Supervisor of Elections Lori Scott said 1,994 mail ballots were sent out on Jan. 31 to overseas military and overseas civilian voters for the March 17 presidential primary. In addition, her office is scheduled to mail an additional 82,352 domestic mail ballots on Feb. 13.
As of Friday, there were 182,286 registered Republicans and 133,365 registered Democrats in Brevard.
While Florida's presidential primary is underway, it's still not clear what role the state ultimately will play in choosing the nominee.
Florida Democrats will see 16 names on their presidential primary ballot, including candidates who already have dropped out, such as Corey Booker and Julian Castro. More candidates likely will drop out before Florida's March 17 primary date, but the ballot had to be finalized back in December to allow time for printing.
Most of the candidates who are still in the race haven't had much of a presence in Florida so far, but a few have invested early and that could pay off if the state is competitive.
The four early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada – get most of the candidate attention early on because wins there can provide much-needed momentum and fundraising, while losses can cause support to collapse.
But if the race remains muddled deep into the primary calendar, Florida could play a key role in the nomination. That scenario looks more likely now, with Iowa's vote-counting problems resulting in the state failing to give the type of big lift or devastating defeat that can help winnow the field.
Former Vice President Joe Biden had a disappointing performance in Iowa, but it was overshadowed by the caucus dysfunction.
If Biden can rebound in some of the other early voting states, Florida could help propel him further. He consistently has led in the polls here, and likely is locking in absentee votes before other candidates have a chance to focus on targeting Florida voters.
"As vote-by-mail gears up across Florida, we feel energized by the growing support we have across the state," said Jackie Lee, the senior advisor for Biden's Florida campaign, in announcing five more endorsements from Florida elected officials last week, bringing the total to 50 endorsements in the state. "These legislators are well-known, influential leaders that know Joe Biden is the candidate best-positioned to beat Donald Trump in the critical state of Florida."
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also could benefit from the confusion in Iowa. Bloomberg got into the race late and is not competing in the early states. Instead, the billionaire is spending enormous sums in states that vote in March, including Florida.
Bloomberg already has spent millions on television advertising in Florida and has more than 100 campaign staffers working in field offices around the state. He is betting that no candidate will come out of the early nominating contests strong enough to match his resources, and Iowa's diminished influence helps that strategy.
Bloomberg told the New York Times last week he was doubling his ad spending in every market where he currently is on TV – which includes Florida – after the problems in Iowa.
Bloomberg's army of campaign workers, coupled with the heavy advertising, could help him amass absentee votes in Florida before other candidates have a chance to build a ground game.
"We have a lot of staff on the ground that is going to be communicating with voters, we're going to be talking to them at their doors and you're going to see a lot more ads from us through the election," said Scott Kosanovich, who is running Bloomberg's Florida campaign.
The other top tier candidates – Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar – all have a limited Florida campaigns right now and are banking on generating momentum in other primaries that will carry over into the state.
That strategy is still the best bet to win the nomination based on historical precedence, but if the race stays competitive the campaigns eventually will need to start ramping up in Florida.
Aside from Bloomberg, Warren and Biden may have the most robust Florida campaigns among the top tier candidates.
Biden has a network of supporters and donors that has been built up over many years. Warren opened a campaign office in Miami in September, opened a second office in the state, in Orlando, earlier this month and has been hiring Florida campaign workers.
"From the very beginning we invested in Florida before any other campaign has; we were the first to put staff on the ground," said Kim Diaz Scott, who is running Warren's Florida campaign with a staff of more than 20.
"Everything that we are doing is because we were well aware that a little under half of Florida's primary voting base will be voting before March 17," Scott added. "That's why we needed to invest early."
Sanders still has plenty of supporters in Florida who have been with him since his 2016 campaign. But he got crushed by Hillary Clinton in Florida's 2016 presidential primary and does not appear to be investing heavily in the state so far this cycle, although he recently hired a Florida field director.
Buttigieg and Klobuchar also don't appear to have much campaign infrastructure in the state, although Klobuchar won satellite caucuses in St. Petersburg and Port Charlotte that the Iowa Democratic Party put on for the first time this cycle.
Whether Florida proves to be a pivotal battleground in the primary remains to be seen.
Candidates who haven't invested in the state may not pay much of a price if they build up enough momentum before Floridians vote.
But the debacle in Iowa made it more likely that Florida's primary matters.

Texto completo: In "A Tale of Two Cities," Charles Dickens opened with "It was the best of times ..." Truly that describes the "Coachellafest for the mind," also known as the 2020 Rancho Mirage Writers Festival.
At the seventh annual "Angel Night" dinner on Tuesday, Jan. 28, which proceeds the three-day festival at the Rancho Mirage Library and Observatory, 600 bibliophiles and members of the fourth estate attended. The 2020 theme was "The Election and the Anniversary of Women's Right to Vote," and guests were eager to soak up their yearly allotment of literary knowledge at the Super Bowl of Writers Festivals, which took place a few days before the Iowa Caucus.
Festival founder Jamie Kabler and his team — which includes Debbie Green Miller, Deborah Dejah and the library's director Aaron Espinosa — plan the festival two years in advance, and their meticulousness showed in every detail. "Organized" best describes the event; attendees were greeted by a phalanx of valet attendants and Mariachis. Offerings were plentiful, with stations for coffee, pastries, water, mixed candies and ample boxed lunches. Writers and speakers were able to meet and greet, thus fulfilling one of the festival's missions.
The mind-stimulating festival was made possible by Founding Angel Helene Galen, joined by Platinum Angels Sherrie Auen, Catharine Reed and Harold Matzner. These generous donors, in addition to other Angels, helped to underwrite the festival so that there was no increase in price.
"The Rancho Mirage Writers Festival is an amazing opportunity to hear from dynamic authors on a variety of topics," Reed said. "This year, we're excited that the Auen Foundation's sponsorship will make every presentation available online." (For information, visit rmwritersfest.org.)
James Patterson, the world's best-selling author and the literary equivalent of a rock star, graced the stage to the delight of the attendees. His presentation began the 2020 literary journey, where more than 1,300 readers were intrigued by presenters who rotated every 45 minutes with often seven diverse presentations daily.
Patterson was interviewed by journalist Carl Hiassen, and each shared their great sense of humor. Patterson opened, describing the desert as "a place where I am not the oldest in the room." Patterson's latest novel about Jeffrey Epstein, "Filthy Rich," was one of several books gifted to attendees.
Some notables in the crowd were Angels Patty Newman, G. Aubrey and Lori Serfling, Jan Salta, Bryn and Dick Debeikes, Bob and Wendy Goodfriend, Anne Holland, Marion Rosenthal, Edye Broad and Dan Clivner and Lori and Mike Milken.
Dr. Barry and Gale Hackshaw, Patty Newman, G. Aubrey and Lori Serfling, Bruce Fessier, Carol Scherger, Dr. Joe Scherger, co-chair Dr. Bart Ketover and attorney Steve Quintinalla, who handles the festival's legal work.
Some of the laudatory festival descriptions heard were from Dave Barry, who commented it was "the best writers festival in the universe." Bret Stephens of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal said: "The Writers Festival is the best of its kind and will soon be a landmark institution of the literate American culture."
The festival pulsed with inspiring and diverse panels and conversations. Among the selections were "America's First War" with Dr. Lynne Cheney and Jon Meacham; "Is America a Country at War With Itself?" with James Fallows, Senator Jeff Flake, Karl Rove and Bret Stephens; "The Fan and the Commissioner" with Dr. Doris Kearns Goodwin and Bud Selig; "No Safe Spaces" with congresswoman Jackie Speier; "The End of Alzheimers" with Dr. Dale Bredesen, interviewed by Eisenhower 360's Scherger; "Presidential Politics and the Media" with ABC's Dan Abrams and "Happiness Revisited" by Dennis Prager.
If guests expected to be spoiled, they were not disappointed. Among those departing with smiling faces, from what surely will be the talk of the desert until next year's event on January 26-29, 2021, were Connie and Bob Lurie, Donna MacMillan, Mary Hart, Iris and Thom Smotrich, Bruce Konheim, Michael Landes, Sharon Davis and former governor of California Gray Davis.
Dale Gribow is a trial lawyer representing the injured and criminally accused. He has been named Man of the Year seven times (City of Palm Desert and the City of Hope) and had Dale Gribow Day declared four times. He was selected as a "Top Lawyer" by Palm Springs Life and Inland Empire magazines. He serves as president of 12 nonprofits and is a member of 40 boards.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING – Michigan State University President Samuel Stanley said staff at the Wharton Center is being restructured after a gift shop display of dolls depicting black historical figures hanging from a rack resembling a tree led to widespread outrage.
In a letter he sent to the MSU community on Thursday and posted on the president's website, Stanley apologized for the display. He promised the university is taking the situation seriously and taking steps to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.
"This was a disturbing reminder of our country's history of terror and unrelenting brutality that targeted individuals based on their race," Stanley wrote. "Members of our community were hurt. Though this display was created to honor prominent African Americans during Black History Month, we cannot ignore the historical context that made it exceedingly painful and traumatic to our community members.
"This display was unacceptable and should never have been put up. I'm sorry that this happened. It has been taken down. We can, and must, do better as Spartans. We need to do the necessary work that better informs our thinking and deepens our understanding of how our actions affect others."
"The center is undergoing a full restructuring of staff, including management," Stanley wrote in the letter. More details were not in the letter, but Dan Olsen, an MSU spokesman, said the reorganization will be confined to gift shop staff.
Stanley wrote that diversity within the center's workforce would be a priority.
All staff and volunteers also will go through mandatory racial-bias education and development starting Wednesday in coordination with the MSU Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives.
Olsen said the Wharton Center will reevaluate the roles and responsibilities for gift shop workers and volunteers. A final determination will be made once those employees and volunteers complete the racial-bias education and development.
Additional plans are in the works to make a diversity, equity, and inclusion committee consisting of faculty, staff, students, volunteers and other community members to "bring a diverse range of identities and perspectives to the Wharton Center," according to Stanley.
"There is no denying this happened on our campus, at a location that was meant to recognize the contributions of MSU's past president, Clifton R. Wharton Jr., a great American and MSU leader and his wife, Dolores Wharton, who both came to campus with a deep appreciation for the arts," Stanley wrote in the letter. "We have work to do."
Wharton, 93, served as MSU's president from 1970 to 1978. His tenure at MSU marked the first time a black president was selected by a major university where the majority of students were white, the New York Times reported. Wharton left MSU to serve as chancellor of the State University of New York and later held business and diplomatic roles, including Under Secretary of State in the Clinton Administration.
While at MSU, Wharton and his wife Dolores promoted the plan to build a new performance venue to replace the aging MSU Auditorium. They also headed the successful fundraising campaign. When the new performing arts center opened in 1982, it was named in their honor.
The display in the gift shop was discovered last week. It featured a rack resembling a tree to hang felt ornaments resembling Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Prince and other African-American leaders.
Krystal Rose Davis-Dunn, a 31-year-old black graduate student at MSU, came across the displays after a jazz concert she had attended with a friend who wanted to check out the gift shop after the show. The dolls hanging from the tree was one of the first things she noticed when they walked in.
They kept walking around and she spotted four or five similar trees and a larger tree with "a lot more" black leaders.
"The Wharton Center recognizes the need for greater diversity among its staff and volunteers and for creating an environment that reflects our best efforts. However, they are not alone in that need," Stanley wrote. "Our entire campus must view this as an opportunity to learn and reflect on what we can and should do to create a safe and inclusive culture, and we must hold ourselves accountable for achieving these goals."

Texto completo: Since October, Republican Jason Church has outraised Tom Tiffany in the GOP primary race for the 7th Congressional District, nearly closing the gap on the state senator's early fundraising lead.
That's according to the numbers released by the Federal Elections Commission on Thursday. The reports also show that in the Democratic primary for the 7th Disrtict, Tricia Zunker has raised over $145,000, while her opponent, Lawrence Dale, hadn't filed a finance report as of Friday afternoon.
USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin examined campaign finances reports for the candidates in the special election for the 7th District. The reports cover the current election cycle, which runs through Jan. 29. The totals include individual donations as well as money received from PACs, loans and offsets to operating expenditures, such as rebates.
The four candidates are vying to replace former Rep. Sean Duffy. The Republican lawmaker stepped down at the end of September, forcing a special election. The primary is Feb. 18 and the election is May 12.
Republican candidates Church, of Hudson, raised all of his money — $658,000 in contributions — since Sept. 24, according to his FEC filings. State Sen. Tiffany, of Minocqua, brought in about $477,000 in donations since Oct. 1, bringing his total to more than $719,000, according to his FEC filings.
Church's donors came from 35 states and Washington, D.C. Among his donors were Michael Heyer, the owner of Racine Danish Kringle, who gave $1,000; William Hsu of Hsu's Ginseng in Wausau, who gave $2,800; and John Kemmerer, an owner of Jackson Hole Mountain resort in Wyoming, who gave $2,800. Church also received over $261,000 in donations from WinRed, an online fundraising platform created by the Republican Party.
Tiffany's donors came from 20 states and Washington, D.C. Among his donors were Duffy, who gave $2,000; Ashley Furniture president Todd Wanek, who gave $2,000; Kwik Trip executive Don Zietlow, who gave $2,000; and Menard's founder and owner John Menard, who gave $2,800. Tiffany also received over $98,000 in donations from WinRed.
In past filings, Tiffany has recorded donations from Stormy Kromer CEO Robert J. Jacquart; John M. Tonne, from owner of Paul Bunyan's Cook Shanty in Minocqua; John E. Link, owner of Jack Link's Protein Snacks in Minong. Tiffany also received a large donation from Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, the leaders of the Pleasant Prairie packaging company Uline Corporation. The Uihleins have invested heavily in conservative politics. Richard Uihlein is a descendant of the Schlitz beer empire, according to the New York Times.
Tiffany was the only candidate to file with the FEC in October, reporting over $240,000 raised in the first month of his campaign.
Tiffany, 62, has served as a state senator since 2013 and spent two decades running Wilderness Cruises on the Willow Flowage. He was the first to declare his candidacy in the 7th District.
Church, 30, is a wounded Army veteran and after his deployment spent six years working for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.
The limit for contributions to campaigns for the special election is $2,800 for the primary and $2,800 for the special election, according to the FEC. Donors will also be able to commit money to a campaign in the district at the end of 2020 for the general election.
One source of spending for the candidates has been television commercials. Church has produced several, with his latest showing him shooting a shotgun while talking about how Democrats were trying to impeach Trump "one day after he was elected."
Tiffany has also paid for TV commercials, including one showing him shoveling manure in a dairy barn that aired on Jan. 12, during the Green Bay Packers' playoff game against Seattle.
Democratic candidates Zunker brought in over $145,000 in contributions since her candidacy announcement last fall. Most of her contributions came from Wisconsin residents, though some donations came in from California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Colorado, according to donation records.
Notable among her donors were the host of liberal news site Crooked Media, Erin Ryan, who gave $400; and Lynde Bradley Uihlein, a Wisconsin philanthropist, liberal donor and heir to the Schlitz beer fortune, who gave $5,600. Lynde Uhliein is a cousin of Richard Uihlein, according to thebadgerproject.org.
Zunker also received over $56,00 in donations from ActBlue, a technology company that helps gather donations for Democratic candidates.
Zunker, 39, is the president of the Wausau School Board and an associate justice for the Ho-Chunk Nation Supreme Court.
Dale, 71, previously conducted research on slaughter and meat processing and worked as a union organizer. He ran for the 7th Congressional District seat in 2014 as a Green Party member, but lost to Duffy.
The 7th Congressional District is the largest geographically in Wisconsin, spanning 21 whole counties and covering portions of five others. The district is home to over 710,000 people, according to census data.

Trump took best punch

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Democrats' drive to impeach and remove President Trump was destined to fail. But more than fail, it has backfired on them — strengthening Trump for the 2020 campaign and increasing his odds of winning a second term.
First, impeachment appears to have raised Trump's approval rating to the highest point of his presidency. In mid-October, just before the House impeachment hearings began, Trump's Gallup approval rating was just 39% — a few points above his all-time low. This week, as his Senate trial wound up, Gallup reported that Trump's approval has risen a 10 full points to 49% — his all-time personal best. The number of Americans who want Trump removed has plummeted. In October, a 52% majority of Americans supported his removal, today a 52% majority opposes it. For Democrats, this is the very definition of failure.
Far from advancing their case for removing Trump, Democrats have convinced more Americans that he deserves a second term. Before the 2018 midterms that put Democrats in control of the House, just 41% of the country said Trump should be reelected; today, after the Democratic House's failed impeachment effort, 50% want to give him four more years. Since impeachment began, Trump's standing with the voters has improved by almost every measure.
Second, impeachment has energized Trump's base. According to Gallup, the president's approval among Republicans is now a record 94% — up six percentage points since January. The more Democrats tried to take him down, the more Republicans have united behind the president.
Third, the failure of their impeachment drive has dispirited the Democratic base. An Associated Press poll finds that just 33% of Democrats are excited about the 2020 election. At the Iowa caucuses, where Democratic voters had their first chance to show their enthusiasm for replacing Trump, turnout was a dismal 170,000 — a 30% decline from 2008, when 240,000 Iowans turned out to give Barack Obama his first presidential primary victory.
Fourth, impeachment has put moderate House Democrats in grave peril. A New York Times/Sienna College poll recently found that almost two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, but then voted for House Democrats in 2018, plan to back Trump again in 2020. That's bad news for the 31 House Democrats elected in Trump districts in the midterms. How many people are going to vote to give Trump a second term and vote for the Democrats who tried to take away their right to do so? Not many.
Fifth, impeachment forced Democrats to unlock the legislative floodgates and give Trump major victories. Democrats knew that voters saw them focusing on impeachment at the expense of getting things done, so as they voted to approve articles of impeachment, they also voted to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump's tax bill that repealed three Obamacare taxes, and Trump's $738 billion defense spending bill that created his Space Force and enacted his parental leave policy for federal workers, without restricting his use of defense dollars to build a border wall. The effect was the opposite of what Democrats intended, creating the impression that while Democrats were busy impeaching, Trump was busy governing.
Finally, impeachment has helped Trump raise an enormous war chest. In the last three months of 2019 — the period during which the House conducted its impeachment inquiry — Trump raised $46 million, giving him $102.7 million in the bank. The Senate trial will likely have a similar impact on his fundraising in the first quarter of 2020. Impeachment not only energized Republican voters, it has energized Republican donors.
And the Democrats' self-inflicted wounds keep coming. During Trump's State of the Union address, the House impeachment managers sat together in the chamber, sullen and stone-faced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., broke protocol and refused to utter the traditional words of introduction — "it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce the president of the United States" — and then dramatically tore up Trump's address on national television when he concluded. The image Democrats projected to the country was that of a bunch of sore losers.
Trump now goes into the 2020 election strengthened and emboldened — the first president in U.S. history to carry an impeachment acquittal into a general election. For three years, Democrats threw everything they had at Trump. They accused him of bribery, extortion, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress, abuse of power, conspiracy and even treason. Three years later, he's still standing — and thanks to impeachment, he may still be standing after the dust settles in November.

Constitution is working in Trump era, even as the press comes under attack

Texto completo: When your country is mired in the middle of a nasty political and constitutional battle and your leader is crazily tweeting 142 times in one day, it is difficult to not be depressed – and alarmed. Counselors call it "Trump anxiety disorder." They are seeing more and more patients with psychological issues from President Trump's rhetoric and policies.
Many people say they just can't watch the news. That's never good in a self-governing society.
"There is a fear of the world ending," says Elisabeth LaMotte, the founder of a counseling DC Counseling & Psychotherapy Center in Washington, D.C. "It's very disorienting and constantly unsettling."
I can't make the chaos go away – in fact, I suffer from it – but I can assert that what is happening now is exactly how the framers of the Constitution meant it to be. The parts of the constitutional puzzle are actually working.
We can nitpick on strategies by either side, debate emerging questions about media behavior, and bemoan the outcomes. But the system is, for now, holding. The democratic world is not falling apart ... yet. And, no surprise, the media is in the middle of the unfolding drama of impeachment.
Back in 1787, the framers knew that a president might attempt "high crimes and misdemeanors," so they established a careful constitutional process of impeachment, as we have seen. Four years later, in 1791, they added 10 amendments, a Bill of Rights.
The First Amendment was to protect citizens in their ability to squawk to their heart's content about government. And they clearly protected the press – the media in the middle – understanding that the party in power, given the chance, would try to stifle and censor its opposition. The press needed shielding so it could report to the citizens without interference from government. So here we are – the press reporting and the authorities trying to discredit the reporting.
I called Buddy Stein, a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York City editorial writer who has been a keen observer of the press for many years and a journalism professor. Stein was not as optimistic as I about all being hunky-dory. He wondered about the House of Representatives' strategy to rush through impeachment, although he understood that if the Senate or the president challenged the attempt to seek witnesses and documents, impeachment might grind to a dangerous halt.
But when it came to the press, Stein was more gleeful, saying "the exposés, the accountability reporting" have been "absolutely superb." For a year or more, Stein points out, the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal have been "carrying a heavy load and doing it very well."
The story actually began in September last year when the Washington Post revealed pressure on the president of Ukraine to mount an investigation of the Bidens or get no American financial aid. "We're reliably told that the president has a venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election." The startling words came in an editorial!
Editorials usually express the opinion of the publication's management; they don't break news or reveal new facts. But all the press tools have been on display in this historical episode – editorials, breaking news, anonymous sources, leaked documents and testimony, revealing and damning books, TV interviews that startle, wall-to-wall coverage of events.
On Sept. 9, the intelligence community's inspector general said privately he received a complaint of "urgent concern" about the President's infamous phone call. On Sept. 18, using unnamed sources, the Post revealed to an astounded nation that a whistleblower had given damning information to the government. The media in the middle! A mad rush of exposés pushed the story furiously forward.
Predictably, the president called it "fake news," his pet phrase for anything that criticizes him. And that is why the First Amendment becomes so important. The press is still the crucible, the block to avoiding a leap to authoritarianism. Just watch the behaviors we are seeing every day.
CNN's Manu Raju recently asked Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, "Should the Senate consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial?" A straightforward question. Granted, she was walking down a hall and it was a yelled-out query. But her answer speaks volumes. "I won't answer you. You are a liberal hack."
A classic response. The press is the liberal enemy. It's an old cry, dating back at least to when Richard Nixon in 1969 sent his vice president, Spiro Agnew (he later pleaded guilty to accepting bribes), on a cross-country, televised tour to attack "the liberal eastern establishment" press. If you oppose us, you must be "liberal."
Stein calls such charges "baloney," adding, "I come from he left. I don't see a monolith. There are all sorts of reasons to be critical of the big media for being insufficiently critical or skeptical on so many issues." But being liberal is just trite and wrong-headed. Stein said he thought National Public Radio – publicly funded in part by the government – has been particularly namby-pamby in its Ukraine coverage.
And yet, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, under great pressure to talk about the scandal, recently was interviewed by an NPR reporter who pushed him on Ukraine ... of course. He ended up screaming at her, claiming she broke their interview agreement rules. "Another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt" the president, he declared.
NPR's Mary Louise Kelly responded: "Journalists don't sit down with senior government officials in the service of scoring political points. We do it in the service of asking tough questions." And that's what the press does at its constitutional best: it's in the middle, contrarians, gadflies, pains in the butt, poking holes, digging into the swamp.
Nonetheless, the president applauded Pompeo's harsh words, saying with a big smile: "I think you did a good job on her, actually." The State Department then threw an NPR reporter off a press plane as punishment, arguably an unconstitutional move.
Trump's language is remarkably similar to his threatening talk about the press at rallies, words that have made reporters literally fear for their safety. The framers of the Constitution envisioned tension and an adversarial relationship, but not the bullying that this President has consistently shown.
But the hostility goes on. During the impeachment hearing, the Republican majority cordoned off the press, literally, and strictly controlled cameras. It was Soviet Union-like. New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich complained: "To place limitations on the press is to place limitations on the American people's ability to learn about the character and conduct of their elected leaders."
The last formal White House press briefing was March 19! The president is threatening to sue to stop publication of John Bolton's book. Last week he banned CNN from an annual TV anchors briefing.
The press belongs in the middle – reporting back to the citizenry, not being roped off. And our goal – as the Constitution insisted – is simple: keep the president's hands off the press.

Texto completo: By the time I arrived at the now defunct Times-Union in 1980, there were people of color in the newsroom, though certainly not many. Most of the reporters and all of the editors were white, like me.
When she died, Gwen Ifill received tribute after tribute for her work as a journalist.
Her portrait, released on the eve of Black History Month, is even on a Forever Stamp now as part of the U.S. Postal Service's Black Heritage series. She joins the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Robinson, Ella Fitzgerald and other luminaries in the series.
At the time of her death in 2016 at age 61, Ifill was a news anchor on PBS. Before that she had been a political reporter at the New York Times and other newspapers. Most impressively, she rose to the top in a profession that was predominately male and white.
There have been journalists like Ifill in Rochester, as well — the pioneers and ground-breakers who made their way against real odds.
Certainly we think of Frederick Douglass, the former slave who is perhaps the most prominent journalist to have lived here.
Later, there was Howard Coles, an African American born near Caledonia, Livingston County, who for years edited The Voice (later The Frederick Douglass Voice), reporting on a black community that was often ignored by the mainstream press. Earl Caldwell was with the Democrat and Chronicle in the 1960s and went on to be a force in New York City journalism.
By the time I arrived at the now defunct Times-Union in 1980, there were people of color in the newsroom, though certainly not many. Most of the reporters and all of the editors were white, like me.
My desk mate, Jim Mitchell, was African American, as was Dolores Orman, who covered crime and courts. Jim went on to other papers fairly soon. Dolores, who is retired and still living in Rochester, was valued in the newsroom for her memory, her contacts, her persistence.
A native of Kansas, Dolores graduated from the University of Kansas and then joined the Herald and News Tribune in Duluth, Minnesota, as that paper's first black reporter. She came to the Times-Union in 1968, becoming one of that paper's first black reporters.
"I felt at home," Dolores says, "welcomed and accepted by whites, both in the newsroom and in the community." At the same time, she remembers black staff members advocating for more black editors and black reporters to ensure that there would be "truly fair and full coverage of the Rochester area."
Over the years, I was lucky to work with other colleagues who were African American. But certainly, the number of African American reporters and editors, though it increased over the years, did not reflect the diversity of the community. I was once in management, so a portion of the blame for this gap falls upon me.
Last year, some of the black journalists working at the Democrat and Chronicle wrote about what inspired them to become reporters and editors.
James Johnson, who has covered high school sports for years, remembered a summer internship at the Times-Union while he was a student at Edison Tech. (He recently wrote more about that in a call for applications to the Democrat and Chronicle's summer academy for students interested in journalism.)
Cynthia Benjamin, the community content editor, wrote with gratitude about how her career in journalism had fulfilled a childhood dream.
But Cynthia also recalled a time in Rochester when she was spat upon, and a time when the N-word was written on her car. (She tweeted about that and was overwhelmed by kind and supportive reactions from people of all races.)
Cynthia and some of the other people mentioned here are members of the Rochester Association of Black Journalists, which was named the 2019 winner of the Chapter of the Year award from the National Association of Black Journalists.
It's not surprising that the group, which includes members from a variety of media, was honored, given the talent in Rochester.
Like Gwen Ifill, all of the journalists have been fighting the good fight, both inspiring and informing. We owe them thanks.
Sad update Mary Gooley, a longtime advocate for people with hemophilia who is on this column's list of Remarkable Rochesterians, died on Dec. 30, 2019. She was 94.

Remarkable Rochesterians
Let's add the name of the champion for social justice to the list of Remarkable Rochesterians that can be found at rochester.nydatabases.com:
James M. McCuller (1940-1992): The executive director of the Rochester anti-poverty agency Action for a Better Community for 25 years, the Arkansas native was hailed at the time of his death as a "gallant crusader" for the poor and members of minority communities. A graduate of what is now Central State University in Ohio, he was also a board member of the Rochester Health Network and a member of the Black Political Caucus, as well as an organizer of several groups that advocated non-violent solutions to social problems.
Journalist Gwen Ifill has been honored on a U.S. postage stamp.

Texto completo: 'The Girl With the Louding Voice'
By Abi Dare, Dutton, 384 pages, $26
The inspiration for Abi Dare's first book struck when one of her daughters, then 8, didn't feel like unloading the dishwasher.
Dare, who lives in London but grew up in Lagos, told her that there were girls her age in Nigeria who did housework for a living.
"She stopped and said, 'But what do you mean, Mom? Do you mean like working, like doing the day's work in an office, and they get paid? That's really cool they get paid. Can I get paid?' " Dare recalled in an interview.
The conversation gave her a new perspective on something that was common among middle-class families like the one in which she was raised: employing young girls as so-called housemaids.
That night, Dare started doing research. She searched "housemaids in Nigeria" and came across articles detailing the violence, mistreatment and low or nonexistent pay that are often part of their working conditions. One account of a 13-year-old girl whose employer scalded her with boiling water stood out. "The report was harrowing," Dare said, "but what also made it quite painful for me was that her face was a blur, and it just felt like another statistic to report."
Her debut novel, "The Girl With the Louding Voice," out last Tuesday, gives voice to one such girl. Raised in poverty, 14-year-old Adunni finds work as a housemaid for a rich Lagos family, enduring abuse and exploitation while she yearns to go to school.
Dare, 38, who works in project management for an academic publisher, talked about the novel's focus on education, writing about class in Nigeria and how she tried to find Adunni's voice. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Why did you decide to write the book in broken English?
A: I felt that I needed to break her English down and break myself down in the process to understand her, so that she could be understood by anyone else who's reading it. When I was writing it, I did not think it would get published. So I was really telling myself a story.
Many of the maids I knew or that my husband knew, they didn't speak good English. I found that I couldn't use any metaphors that I was used to, and I found myself constantly thinking of the character and saying, "How would she say it?"
Q: How did you tap into that? What were some of the challenges of writing in that voice?
A: Nigerians speak something called pidgin English, and I knew I didn't want to write in pidgin English because even the very educated people speak pidgin English. So I knew it wasn't going to be that. I wanted it to be nonstandard English, whatever that meant. I thought by doing that, I could make it Adunni's. It could be her own English, so to speak.
So the first thing I did was to watch as many Nigerian movies as I could. I was watching these movies of people in the market, and they would describe the political situation in Nigeria with broken English but with frustration at not being able to get out what they're trying to say. I watched a lot of that.
I looked through Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" over and over again. I know it's not the same, but it was very helpful to see how Alice Walker did that, because I thought, "OK, she's very educated, so how did she get that out?"
Q: Despite the broken English, you can really tell how bright and feisty Adunni is.
A: I wanted to explore the amount of talent and dreams and intelligence that we kill and waste when we don't allow these girls to go to school, when we hire these young girls and get them to work. I wanted to show that this was a girl who dreamed. She is more than just a girl that needs to be up at 4 in the morning. She's intelligent, and if she was given a chance, and other young girls in the world, they will shine and they will thrive. I really wanted her to come across as someone that was more than a girl that could not speak English. And this is why she makes that realization somewhere in the book that, look, it's just a language. It's not a measure of intelligence.
Q: When Adunni arrives in Lagos, she has a hard time understanding class -- she asks why she can't talk to Big Madam, her employer, directly. I wonder if you could speak a little bit about that class distinction and why she might not have been attuned to what it meant.
A: She's from a village where everyone is kind of the same class. Then once she gets to Lagos and sees this wealth, I mean, that was a huge chasm. There's a huge divide between the poor and the rich, and I saw that growing up. The people that work for families would be treated as if they were second-class citizens. She couldn't understand it because she'd only known a society where everyone could speak to everyone. It's just very strange to her. And also her personality as well. She loves to speak and she loves to be heard.
Q: You used a fictional book called "The Big Book of Nigerian Facts" in the novel, and I found it interesting that Adunni has lived in Nigeria her whole life, but she was learning about it from a book. What do you make of the Nigeria that she knows versus the Nigeria that she's learning about in this big book?
A: Nigeria is such a huge country that I have never even been to many of the states. There are things about Nigeria that I'm still discovering, and that's just the vastness of the country. I wanted to reflect that, especially for a character like Adunni that has come from not being fully educated and being shielded by her village.
Q: The book hinges on her desire for an education; it's what drives her throughout the book. Can you talk about that particular choice?
A: I was about 14 or 15, I was just discovering that I was pretty, and I was getting a bit of attention, having crushes on guys. And one evening, I was going to meet up with one guy -- I was meeting him downstairs. We had agreed to meet at a certain time, at 8 o'clock.
I took the dustbin, and I pretended to go empty the trash, and as I was going downstairs, my mother walked behind me. I was like, "Why is she coming with me?" And so I got downstairs, and then she said, "Come here. Let's have a chat." She said, "I know you're not going to empty the trash. I know you're going to meet a guy."
She said, "Listen, all of this is going to pass away. You're going to leave. You're going to get older. Beauty will fade. Everything will fade, but the only thing that will not fade is your intelligence, and what is in your head, your education."
She also said to me, as I got older: "The only reason why I've been able to educate yourself and your brother is because I invested in my own education and made something out of my life. If I hadn't, you both would not be where you are today."
That really resonated with me, the importance of education. I'd seen it in my mother's life, and then I grasped onto it myself. I think that conversation that night was life-changing for me. In Nigeria as a whole, education is very valued, but sadly there's not enough of it to go around because of poverty. And so I wanted to drive that home.
A lot of people are very educated and not all of them get jobs, especially in this day and age. But for someone like Adunni, education was the first step to anything else. I think that it is an essential foundation for any life, especially for girls.

First American dies of coronavirus

Texto completo: A U.S. citizen died from the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, American officials said on Saturday. It was the first known American death from the illness, and was likely to add to diplomatic friction over Beijing's response to the epidemic.
The death is also certain to raise questions over whether the Trump administration and the State Department in particular have taken sufficient action to ensure the safety of Americans in China and to aid in the evacuation of those who want to leave.
In a statement, the State Department took a defensive tone, saying that since Jan. 29 it had evacuated around 850 people, most of them Americans, on five charter flights out of Wuhan.
The agency said it had "no higher priority than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad," but there are no current plans to conduct additional evacuation flights, even as some Americans in other parts of China have been asking for the U.S. government to evacuate them.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have been tense for years over issues including trade, technology and human rights. While Chinese officials have touted the importance of international cooperation to combat the virus, doubts have arisen in recent days about China's willingness to accept a helping hand -- particularly from the United States.
Although some Trump administration officials have privately expressed skepticism over China's handling of the outbreak, President Donald Trump himself lavished praise on Chinese leaders Friday. Trump told reporters in Washington that he had spoken with President Xi Jinping of China on the telephone late Thursday. "They're working really hard, and I think they're doing a very professional job," he said.
Trump has said often that he likes and admires Xi, and he has toned down his attacks on China since the two sides signed an agreement last month to halt a damaging trade war that Trump started in 2018.
Few details about the American, who died Thursday, were immediately available. According to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the person was 60 years old and died at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, the inland metropolis at the center of the epidemic. Two people familiar with the matter said the person was a woman and had underlying health conditions.
It was not clear whether the woman had tried to leave the city on any of the flights organized by the State Department, which have evacuated diplomats and other American citizens from Wuhan, Beijing and other parts of China.
"We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss," a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said. "Out of respect for the family's privacy, we have no further comment."
Word of the death spread as frustrations over Beijing's handling of the epidemic mounted within China and surfaced at the diplomatic level as well. The virus has killed at least 811 people, mostly in China, sickened more than 37,000 and spread across the globe.
For more than a month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been offering to send a team of experts to China to observe the outbreak and help if possible. But no invitation has come.
The World Health Organization, which made a similar offer about two weeks ago, appeared to have faced the same cold shoulder. But the agency said Saturday that it had identified a team of experts to go to China and that the team's leader would go Monday or Tuesday, with the rest of the team following later.
Current and former health officials and diplomats said they believed the reluctance came from China's top leaders, who do not want the world to think they need outside help.
Within China, public discontent about the government's response to the crisis reached an extraordinary peak on Friday after the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, who had warned his colleagues early on about the new virus but was reprimanded for illegally spreading rumors.
After Li's death, grieving internet users posted messages expressing anger over his treatment and demanding freedom of speech -- unheard-of in China's authoritarian political system.
Communist Party officials said Friday that they would send a team from the powerful anti-corruption committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding Li's death. Chinese state news media reported Saturday that the government was also sending two senior officials to Wuhan to reinforce efforts to bring the outbreak under control.
It was not immediately clear if the appointments on Saturday amounted to a reshuffling of the local leadership or were simply an effort to reinforce officials on the front line. Still, it appeared to be an acknowledgment that authorities in Wuhan had been overwhelmed.
Japan said Saturday that one of its citizens had died in a Wuhan hospital from a suspected case of the coronavirus. But the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that based on information it received from Chinese authorities, it could not confirm whether the man, who was in his 60s, had been infected with the new virus. The ministry called the cause of death viral pneumonia.

Texto completo: As it races to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus, the Chinese government is seeing potential in a cocktail of antiviral drugs. It is also recommending the Peaceful Palace Bovine Pill, a traditional Chinese medicine made with the gallstones of cattle, buffalo horn, jasmine and pearl.
There is no known cure for the coronavirus that has sickened tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds in China. The country's National Health Commission said doctors should try treating patients mainly with a combination of Western drugs used to treat HIV and fight viruses, depending on the severity of illness.
But the government is also looking at ways to supplement the treatment with remedies that are integral to its national identity -- traditional Chinese medicine.
It has its supporters.
"I think it is the correct approach," said Cheng Yung-chi, a professor of pharmacology at Yale University School of Medicine. "The evidence is going to come, and we have to give it the benefit of the doubt."
There is no clinical proof that the roots of various plants, licorice and the Peaceful Palace Bovine Pill can help combat the deadly disease. Practitioners said the regimen could help ease symptoms, such as swelling in the lungs, with fewer side effects.
Critics said the use of such concoctions could raise concerns about patient safety.
The use of these ancient Chinese remedies dovetails with a push by President Xi Jinping to harness them as a source of national pride. He has said that officials should place as much importance on traditional Chinese medicines as they do on Western medicines. His government has called for the remedies to be promoted in its "Belt and Road" trade route, China's push to build ports, rail lines and other infrastructure around the world.
In turning to traditional medicine, China is relying on past experience.
During the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2002 and 2003, doctors found that steroids prescribed to reduce inflammation had harmful side effects such as bone destruction. Chinese medicine, they said, would mitigate some of these adverse reactions.
In its treatment plan for the coronavirus released last week, the National Health Commission recommended traditional Chinese medicine remedies that could be used with antiretroviral HIV drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir. The national health department suggested trying the Peaceful Palace Bovine Pill for severe symptoms such as wheezing and respiratory distress.
Some hospitals are already using a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.
In recent weeks, Beijing's health department reported that two patients who were discharged had been treated with traditional Chinese medicines together with other unspecified drugs. And in Guangzhou, a major city in the south, health officials said 50 patients reported having no more fever and half of them said their coughs went away after using traditional Chinese medicines and other drugs.
Doctors are conducting clinical trials to test the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, said Cheng, who is also chair of the Consortium for the Globalization of Chinese Medicine, a group of academics in the field.
Jiang Xianfeng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner at United Family Health, a top hospital for the affluent in Beijing, said these medicines are safe, effective and easy to get.
"Western medicine does not have better answers to this virus," Jiang said. "The Chinese people have experienced these sort of plagues many times in our thousands of years of history. If traditional Chinese medicine was not effective, the Chinese people would already be destroyed."
After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization studied the use of traditional Chinese medicine during that period and determined they were safe and showed some potential in relieving symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. Researchers from the United States and Taiwan found that certain herbs could suppress the virus if prescribed at specific concentration levels, while other studies said their findings were inconclusive.
That scientific uncertainty is not stopping the Chinese government.
Since the second version of its treatment plan, the health commission has added more traditional Chinese medicines to the mix. Authorities in Wuhan said coronavirus patients with light or moderate symptoms should be treated with traditional Chinese medicine, the state-run Beijing News reported.
Zhu Mao, a representative of a traditional Chinese medicine manufacturer in Hubei, said he was producing more than 20,000 prescriptions per day at the request of the government. On Jan. 25, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine dispatched 25 teams of Chinese healers to Wuhan.
Traditional Chinese medicine teaches that disease arises from imbalances in the body and that some people have "hot" constitutions, therefore making them vulnerable to fevers and inflammations. When someone gets a fever or a respiratory illness, it is not uncommon to have Chinese people say, "You are on fire."
Practitioners have determined the coronavirus is a "hot" disease, and therefore, medicines should be prescribed to "clear the heat."
It is unclear how the science works behind these medicines. Compounding the problem: There is no standardization for these herbs and regulation is poor.
Traditional Chinese medicine has also been linked to the consumption of exotic wild meats, though it is unclear whether the eating of the meats is really based on the practice.
But some people, particularly in the south, believe that the way to achieving a balanced body is through eating certain meats. Wildlife markets such as the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the site that is believed to be the origin of the coronavirus, proliferated because of the demand for such meats.
Laurie Garrett, a member of the World Economic Forum's global health security advisory board who covered the SARS outbreak in China, said that using traditional Chinese medicine in the new coronavirus outbreak could be risky because the approach is not rigorously backed by research.
"There's no such thing as dosing," she said. "It's like being a chef in a kitchen."
The science journal Nature pointed out that dozens of women who had taken Chinese herbs as part of a weight-loss program ended up with kidney failure in the 1990s. Proponents of traditional Chinese medicine said the herbs were misused. Still, Nature argued in a 2017 editorial, "Hundreds of years of use in clinics that don't standardize or analyze the clinical data are no match for blinded, controlled studies."
Doctors in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, are not convinced that traditional Chinese medicines can help.
"I am not trying to devalue their treatment, but this is not something we practice," said Arisina Ma, president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors Association.
In China, people have searched anxiously for ways to protect themselves. In many Chinese cities, some stood in line for hours to buy "Shuanghuanglian" -- a herbal concoction that mixes flowers such as honeysuckle and forsythia, among other ingredients -- after two government-backed research institutes published a study that said it was effective in preventing the coronavirus.
Chen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, urged Chinese news media to be more careful in its reporting, saying the potential for traditional Chinese medicine to inhibit a virus is not equivalent to a form of prevention or treatment.
"If incidents like Shuanghuanglian happen again and again, it will lose the public trust, cause more panic and go against the authorities' advice to avoid crowd gathering," Chen wrote.
Qin Xi, a manager of a pharmacy in Beijing, said sales of some of his traditional medicines, including "Shuanghuanglian," have been off the charts.
"As for whether it works, who knows?" he said.

Texto completo: Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" is less a movie about the murderous Manson family than it is an homage to Tinseltown itself, every scene a love letter to the Los Angeles of a half century ago. With the film earning 10 nominations up and down the Oscar ballot, it is fair to ask: Does Hollywood love films about itself?
After all, early in the last decade, there were back-to-back best picture victories for films centered on making movies. "The Artist" (2011) won using precious few words to tell the story of a pair of actors struggling to make the transition from silents to talkies. A year later, "Argo" (2012) took the crown for its based-on-real-life tale of CIA agents working with silver-screen producers to camouflage a dangerous mission as an innocent motion picture. And for years, awards-season pundits have repeated the old saw that the academy votes for films that remind voters of themselves.
Yet, an analysis of all 91 best picture winners reveals only two (as previously noted) with major plot points about filmmaking. If this analysis is expanded to all 563 best picture nominees, only nine fit the bill: "Once Upon a Time," "The Artist" and "Argo," along with the 1937 version of "A Star Is Born," "Sunset Boulevard" (1950), "All That Jazz" (1979), "The Aviator" (2004), "Hugo" (2011) and "La La Land" (2016). (The 2018 rendition of "A Star Is Born" swapped out film stars for pop stars, and the other versions weren't nominated for best picture.)
That adds up to 1.6% of all nominated films primarily focused on moviemaking. And among those nominees, only 25% went on to win the award (not counting this year's contender, whose fate remains unknown).
Granted, classifying movies this way is an inherently subjective exercise. The data set could be expanded to include stories that use filmmaking as a framing device, like "Titanic" (1997), which opened with the narration of documentary footage. In examples like "Birdman" (2014), as well as this year's nominee "Marriage Story," a significant character was once in Hollywood but is not shown there onscreen. And "The Godfather" (1972) famously featured a plot thread about a producer facing a death threat (conveyed via a horse's head in his bed), but that is surely not the dominant plot of the film. I drew the line at homemade movies, so the video of the floating plastic bag in "American Beauty" (1999) did not make the cut.
Even with an expanded definition that includes these borderline cases, there are still only 23 best picture nominees that dealt with film production, or 4.1% of all nominees in history. That larger sample had a similar winning rate: 24% of those pre-2020 nominees were winners: "The Artist," "Argo," "Titanic," "Birdman" and "The Godfather."
But while this data shows Oscar voters aren't obsessed with recognizing their own endeavors, there is some evidence to suggest that the Academy Awards may be trending in that direction. Through 2003, only 2.3% of films met the broader criteria; since 2004, 10.2% of nominees do.
Starting in 2003, there was a three-year stretch of nominees that at least mention movies in the plot description. Bill Murray plays a movie star in "Lost in Translation" (2003). Leonardo DiCaprio brings producer Howard Hughes to life in "The Aviator" (2004). In "Capote" (2005), the title character (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) attends the premiere of "To Kill a Mockingbird," the film version of the novel by his friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener).
Before this awards season, featuring "Once Upon a Time" and "Marriage Story," only one other race ever involved multiple Hollywood-based contenders: 2012, when "The Artist" won best picture, "Hugo" was nominated for its tribute to filmmaking pioneer Georges Meliès, and "Midnight in Paris" received a nod for the story of a frustrated screenwriter seeking refuge in the past.
Plenty of films more squarely about cinema than "Marriage Story" or "Midnight in Paris" were not even nominated for best picture. "Sullivan's Travels" (1941), "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952), "The Stunt Man" (1980), "Barton Fink" (1991), "Adaptation" (2002) and many other well-regarded films did not make the best-picture cut. In more recent years, movies like "Saving Mr. Banks" (2013) and "The Disaster Artist" (2017) were left off the academy list despite the category's size expansion.
Most spectacularly of all, "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) was never up for best picture and yet is now considered one of the greatest films of all time, clocking in at No. 5 on the American Film Institute's Top 100 list. What did win best picture instead of "Singin' in the Rain"? "The Greatest Show on Earth," which focused on a different type of entertainment: circus, not cinema.
Even this year's list of films provides evidence to suggest that the academy does not automatically nominate plots about its own work. While "Once Upon a Time" did make the cut, others dealing with filmmaking like "Dolemite Is My Name" and "Pain and Glory" did not.
Many factors go into the academy's decision on nominating a film for best picture. So while the data does not prove a lack of interest in awarding movies about Hollywood, it certainly is not convincing that such an interest does exist.
But if the modest trend since the mid-2000s continues -- a trend that could be sped up by a "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" win at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday -- then perhaps the future of film awards will demonstrate a greater interest in film itself.

New publisher has strong instincts

Texto completo: Sonny Mehta, who had been at the helm of the Knopf publishing group since 1987, died in December. Many, including me, believe Knopf to be the premier literary imprint in American publishing.
Under Mehta's leadership, Knopf published both literary heavyweights, such as Toni Morrison and John Updike, as well as high-quality, popular entertainments, such as "Jurassic Park" and "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."
In photographs, Mehta looks like he comes from another time: a dashing figure with a cigarette often crooked between his fingers, somehow being allowed to smoke in his office long after such things were strictly legal. When my good friend Kevin Guilfoile sold his first novel, "Cast of Shadows," to Knopf, I was excited for him. When I found out he got to meet with Mehta personally, I was intensely jealous.
The New York Times described Mehta as a "voracious reader and an instinctive decision maker."
Perhaps even more surprising than Mehta being allowed to smoke in his office was that fact that he was allowed to act on instinct in running a publishing group that would, for example, pay a record-setting $15 million advance for Bill Clinton's post-presidency memoir, "My Life."
Regular readers know that I'm a big believer in instinct when it comes to how we relate to books. My weekly recommendations are purely driven by instinct. It's what makes them fun, surprising and, occasionally, total flops. It would all be less interesting to believe I had to follow some kind of science to tell people what they should read.
But as a culture, we seem to be heading toward a world where people believe data can reveal the secrets to life, the universe and everything. (Apologies to Douglas Adams.)
Hollywood studios have embraced algorithms to tell them which movies make the best box-office bets. There are similar, less promising, attempts for books, but there is no doubt some people believe these things can be reduced to a formula to maximize return -- and to make sure there aren't any interesting flops.
What a joyless, frankly inhuman process this all would be if we are not allowed to trust our instincts, even though they may occasionally lead us astray.
This is why I am heartened to see the news that Reagan Arthur, most recently publisher of Little, Brown, will succeed Mehta as the head of Knopf. You may not know Arthur's name, but you have read her authors: David Sedaris, Kate Atkinson, Malcolm Gladwell, Megan Abbott and James Patterson.
Granted, I am a professional book nerd, but for years I've looked at a Reagan Arthur book as one likely worthy of my time. I couldn't think of a better successor.
Apparently Mehta couldn't either, arranging for Arthur to take the job in his final months of work.
Obviously, publishing has changed since Mehta started at Knopf in 1987. The whole apparatus feels a little more tenuous and uncertain as new media compete for our time. It is tougher for the average writer to make a living, as the industry has become more beholden to booming sales from a limited number of titles.
But as long as there are real people, real voracious readers like Sonny Mehta and Reagan Arthur at the head of these institutions, maybe we have a few good years left.

New migrants? Not if Croatia has way

Texto completo: The hills on the Bosnian-Croatian border have not been a battleground since the end of the Bosnian war a quarter-century ago. But to some farmers in remote parts of the Bosnian side, it sometimes still resembles a conflict zone.
By night, they hear the screams. By day, they see the Croatian police beating unauthorized migrants back into Bosnia. Sometimes they can even hear shooting.
And then, a few minutes later, a knock at the door, as the migrants, nursing bruised or broken limbs, beg for food and clothes.
"It reminds me of the war," said a farmer living yards from the border, Merima Cuturic, once a refugee herself. "Especially at night, when the shouting starts."
This unlikely gantlet in the western Balkans is what remains of the great migration of 2015, when more than 1 million migrants landed in Europe. At the time, most crossed the sea between Turkey and Greece and then made their way through Hungary to wealthier destinations like Germany.
But Turkey, Greece and Hungary have since made it far more difficult to make such a journey, reducing unauthorized migration by more than 90%. Those still risking the trip tend to take a new route through Bosnia-Herzegovina, a country virtually untouched by the crisis in 2015. These days its border is less tightly controlled than others, making illegal entry less challenging.
Two years ago, just 750 migrants were recorded passing through Bosnia. In 2019, that figure rose to about 29,000 -- most of them fleeing conflict or poverty in Afghanistan, Iraq, Morocco or Pakistan.
"It's the only route currently open if you want to get from Greece to the other parts of the European Union," said Peter Van Der Auweraert, head of mission for the International Organization for Migration, a department of the United Nations.
But that depends on one's definition of open.
To leave Bosnia, migrants must cross the icy hills and mountains that line the northern border with Croatia. Former battlefields, the slopes still contain land mines from the Balkan wars.
Migrants who make it safely through the snow are usually met with a brutal response by the Croatian authorities.
In Northern Europe, the 2015 crisis is over -- and the Croatians are determined to keep it that way.
For more than a year, the Croatian police have systematically seized migrants spotted entering the country from Bosnia and forced them back across the border without letting them apply for asylum.
In interviews in Bosnia last month, dozens of migrants, residents, doctors and aid workers provided a consistent account of migrants being deported without due process -- and often beaten and robbed before being dumped in remote areas like Glinica.
"When they catch you, they take everything," said Sajid Khan, who fled Kunduz, Afghanistan, in 2015, when the Taliban captured the city.
"They take your jacket, shoes, socks," said Khan, 24. "They just leave your trousers and T-shirt."
The detritus in the woods near Glinica gives credibility to these assertions. A stream runs through the woods, under a small footbridge that connects Bosnia to Croatia. The Bosnian bank is covered with jackets, trousers, sweatshirts and shoes.
Here and there are smashed phones and ripped-out SIM cards. Also sardine tins, a toothbrush and an olive jar.
According to villagers and shepherds, this is one of the places where the Croatian police briefly enter Bosnia, dumping migrants rounded up along the border and stripping them of their belongings. It is also where police officers fired bullets to scare migrants in October 2018, nearly hitting Cuturic's son, she said.
"We have a significant amount of patients who've experienced violence," said François Giddey, who leads local operations for Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity that treats wounded migrants.
That violence includes being burned with lighters and being submerged in the icy river, Giddey said. But "the most common" thing, he added, is being beaten with sticks.
"It could be all over the body," he said, "especially legs and feet, to prevent them from walking."
A Times journalist interviewed two Afghan men with recently broken wrists. Both said the fractures were caused by beatings from the Croatian police.
The Croatian police are so eager to deport unauthorized migrants that they have even expelled at least three Nigerians who entered Croatia legally. Two of them were in the country to compete in a table-tennis tournament in November, while the third had a visa that was valid until next March. None had previously visited Bosnia, and all were arrested in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, far from the Bosnian border.
In an emailed statement, the Croatian Interior Ministry dismissed claims of violence as "fabrications," denied playing any role in the Nigerians' expulsions, and said Croatian officials had never illegally entered Bosnian territory to deport migrants.
One reason the migrants attempt to enter Croatia is because the situation in Bosnia is often not much better than what they left behind.
Until early December, hundreds were housed in a remote camp erected on the site of an old dump, halfway up a snow-capped mountain. The camp was surrounded by a minefield that was never properly cleared after the war. At night, wild boars snuffled outside the tents, searching for food scraps. Inside the tents, the floors were often soaked with rainwater.
Drinking water was supplied only in the morning. With no working toilets, most migrants relieved themselves in the mud on the edge of the camp. The ground there was strewn with feces.
"This place is not for the human," Khan, the Afghan from Kunduz, said the day before the camp closed.
Starving, thirsty and desperate, migrants would scour a nearby village for food and water, sometimes breaking into houses and scaring the few villagers still living there.
In a historical irony, the villagers had fled their homes 25 years ago, when the mountainside was contested by Bosniak, Serb and Croat troops. Some never returned, and many of the houses stand empty to this day.
Those who remain often find common cause with the migrants, giving them fruit and bread. But several residents have also grown fearful and now lock their doors for the first time in their lives.
"We identify with them, and that's why we feed them," said Kata Majstorovic, 79. "But at the same time, there are so many!"

Texto completo: MEERUT, India - Under the shade of a banyan tree, a group of worshippers recite Sanskrit mantras. A couple of men step forward and light a fire. Then they start walking, hands folded, as if in a trance, toward a statue.
Some drape flowers over it. Others sing songs of valor to the statue. It is of Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the revered father of Indian independence and a symbol of nonviolent resistance the world over.
Indians consider Gandhi one of the fathers of their nation. But the rise of a Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has uncorked many extremist beliefs, and admiration for Gandhi's killer, among some, has become more open. It is a sign of how much India has changed in the 5 1/2 years since Modi took power.
"Gandhi was a traitor," said Pooja Shakun Pandey, who blames Gandhi for partition and who participated in a recent ceremony worshipping Godse on the anniversary of Gandhi's assassination. "He deserved to be shot in the head."
Prominent Hindu nationalists still invoke Gandhi, but in many cases they are trying to co-opt his legacy - presenting their policies, however divisive, as congruent with his beliefs. One example: a recent citizenship law pushed by Modi's government that, critics say, discriminates against Muslims and threatens the secular state that Gandhi had envisioned.
Other Hindu nationalists, though, continue to vilify the man admired worldwide as an apostle of peace.
The ceremony at the statue venerating his killer, in Meerut, in the north of the country, is not the only sign of respect for Godse in India these days.
Across the country, more than a dozen statues of Gandhi's killer have been erected. Several Hindu temples are being converted into Godse temples.
Last year the government of Uttar Pradesh state, which is led by a firebrand Hindu monk, Yogi Adityanath, proposed changing the name of Meerut to Godse City. One of the first Godse statues was unveiled there about three years ago. Officials now say they have been overwhelmed by demands for more Godse memorials.
Ramachandra Guha, a preeminent biographer of Gandhi, said that fans of Gandhi's killer were no longer a fringe group. Instead, he said, Godse admiration has found a place among what he considers a worryingly large segment of the population.
"It is foul, despicable, but it is real and widespread," Guha said.
In recent months, vandals with links to right-wing groups have defaced pictures of Gandhi, attacked his memorials and scrawled the word traitor on his picture. In June last year, a statue of Gandhi was decapitated in eastern India.
The growing cult around Godse seems rooted in the same militant brand of Hindu nationalism that inspired Gandhi's killer to shoot him one January evening in 1948.
That day, Gandhi walked slowly across a stately lawn in New Delhi, India's capital, leaning on the shoulders of two young women. Godse stepped out from a crowd, greeted him and touched his feet. He then pulled out a Beretta and shot the frail 78-year-old three times in the upper body.
Godse was born in a small village in central India to an upper-caste family. Three of their older sons died from an unknown illness. Thinking it would protect their new child to treat him as a girl, they pierced the young Godse's nose and made him wear a nose ring until they had another son.
For wearing the nose ring, Godse was called Nathuram, meaning a man with pierced nose.
When he was a young man, Godse joined the RSS, a Hindu nationalist group that many members of India's governing party, including Modi, have been part of.
Godse believed Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims and by allowing Pakistan to break off during the partition of India in 1947. That line is still echoed by many Hindu nationalists who see Godse as a national hero and Gandhi as a traitor.
Technology has helped spread the revisionist attitude toward Godse.
The availability of cheap data in much of the countryside has helped create an ecosystem of disinformation in which it is difficult to sift fact from fiction. WhatsApp messages shared widely in rural areas say that if Godse had not killed Gandhi, India would have fallen apart as the Soviet Union did. Other messages call Gandhi a womanizer.
Public meetings eulogizing Gandhi's killer are also used to spread lies and justify the murder.
Amit Jaiswal Jain, an advertising professional in the town of Agra, believes Godse is a hero because he tried to stop Gandhi's push for India to help the newly formed Pakistan.
"Gandhi should be respected," Jain, 38, said. "But the new India should not tolerate the castigation of Godse."
Jain, along with some of his Hindu nationalist friends, are urging the Uttar Pradesh government to insert a special chapter in school textbooks on Godse. The idea is to present Godse as a visionary for Hindu nationalism and one of the drivers behind the creation of a Hindu nation.
Hindu nationalism - an ideology that animates Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party - is premised on the idea that India is a Hindu nation and that minorities, especially Muslims, must subscribe to Hindu primacy.
Pandey, who was visiting Godse's statue in Meerut recently, is one of the most educated people in her village in northwestern India, earning a doctorate in mathematics and teaching at a local university. She is also a leader of Hindu Mahasabha, a group formed more than 100 years ago that espouses militant Hindu nationalism.
Last year, she was arrested at the scene of Gandhi's killing. In a video that brought her national fame, she is seen shooting Gandhi's effigy.
Pandey runs the Meerut chapter of Hindu Mahasabha with Ashok Sharma. They hold prayer meetings in temples across Uttar Pradesh and exhort people on why this is the time, under Modi, to turn India into a Hindu nation.
On a recent morning in Meerut, Sharma sat for a ritual petitioning Lord Hanuman, the monkey God of Hindu mythology, to ward off Gandhi's spirit.
"Hey, son of the wind," Sharma prayed toward the fire, referring to Lord Hanuman, "remove Gandhi's filthy soul from this pure land."
Pandey said that if Godse were alive she would drink the water used to wash his feet.
"Our hero stopped Gandhi's poison from spreading in this pure land," she said. "If I was born before Godse, I would have shot Gandhi myself."

Texto completo: Privacy advocates worry that law enforcement monitors innocent residents, and is 1 of only 2 states that won't reveal whether it's using this advanced technology.

Maine State Police may be using powerful new technologies to scan your face and intercept your cellphone signals, but officials say an unusual provision in state law means police don’t have to tell the public.
Government use of such technologies to investigate crimes or monitor citizens is a growing source of concern around the country and the world. And Maine’s secrecy is raising alarms among privacy advocates, who worry that law enforcement could be using advanced technology to monitor residents, including those who are not suspected of any crime.
“It means the public doesn’t even know what it doesn’t know,” said Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s speech, privacy and technology project. “It has no idea whether there is a potential question about whether there’s unconstitutional use of a surveillance technology.”
An investigation by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram has found:
• Maine is one of two states to have a specific law, which was inspired by Cold War-era secrets kept from the Soviets, that officials say allows the state to neither confirm nor deny the use of digital technologies that might help solve crimes, but that also raises fears of abuse, privacy violations and the surveillance of citizens.
• Despite evidence that the Maine State Police has worked for years with federal agencies to develop its use of digital surveillance technology, the agency now uses that law to refuse to answer any questions about such efforts, or even acknowledge that they exist.
• The secrecy about investigative or surveillance technology extends to the Maine Information and Analysis Center — a so-called fusion center that brings the State Police together with other federal and state agencies to foster information sharing and does not reveal its activities.
• The State Police, and its partners in the fusion center, may soon have access to Mainers’ Real ID photos, which are especially suited for face-scanning technology. State law currently prohibits use of license photos for facial recognition searches, but a bill now moving through the Legislature would allow state officials to conduct such searches and provide information to outside law enforcement agencies.
The lack of disclosure prevents public oversight to ensure that people’s privacy and constitutional rights are being respected. Advanced technologies make it possible for authorities to conduct mass surveillance, including collecting cellphone information and comparing the images of suspected criminals against databases of people who are not suspected of committing any crimes. The technology can track people’s movements and help determine groups and individuals with whom a person associates.
And the lack of transparency does not allow the public to know whether the government is being a good steward of tax dollars.
“It’s just an extremely broad power of secrecy,” said Wessler. “It just completely hobbles the opportunity for public debate on very important subjects.”
“It’s a per se mandate on the agency to clam up even before the process gets going,” he added. “And that, I think, is particularly pernicious and dangerous to our tradition of democratic government, because it cuts transparency completely off at the knees.”

POWERFUL NEW TOOLS The lack of disclosure comes as communities across the United States are trying to regulate technology that allows local law enforcement to conduct sweeping surveillance of the public, including people who are not suspected of crimes.
Police departments are getting more sophisticated as technologies originally designed to enhance national security are deployed to state and local police departments to solve everyday crimes. And in some cases it’s being done without a robust public discussion about what limits, if any, should be placed on its use.
Two types of surveillance technology have come under the most scrutiny from civil liberties advocates and elected officials: facial recognition and cell site simulators. Both are capable of gathering large caches of personal information.
Brendan McQuade, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of Southern Maine who has written a book about secretive fusion centers, said the government has the ability to gather vast amounts of information using a variety of technology, including software to monitor social media, E-ZPasses used to pay highway tolls and automated license plate readers, among others.
“The fact that we don’t know what agencies have what technology, I think, should be very troubling,” McQuade said. “They’re bought in secret. They’re used in secret. And unless there’s concerted political action and legislative actions, there’s nothing preventing police departments from doing very aggressive, warrantless surveillance.”
Facial recognition technology can map an individual’s face using a high-resolution digital image or surveillance video and then compare that image to an existing database of known people.
It works by essentially mapping a person’s dominant facial features, such as eye shape and spacing, as well as jaw and nose lines. The software measures the distances between dozens of reference points, creating a unique profile similar to a fingerprint. The profile is then compared to the faces in existing databases, such as those that contain driver’s licenses, state IDs, immigration records, passport photos or police mug shots.
More advanced programs can also conduct an analysis of skin texture to increase accuracy and, in some cases, account for different facial expressions, facial hair or eyeglasses. Some technology can provide real-time identification of people captured on video.
The New York Times recently reported that more than 600 local police agencies are using a new facial recognition cellphone app created by the private company Clearview AI to search a cache of 3 billion images scraped from such sites as Facebook, Venmo and YouTube to identify potential suspects.
Other technological tools used by police include cell site simulators, also known as IMSI catchers or Stingrays, that can essentially turn the cellphone you carry into a real-time tracking device.
A cell site simulator can be the size of a briefcase and carried in a police cruiser or on an airplane to ping cellphones. It sends out a signal that tricks nearby cellphones into connecting with the simulator, rather than a cellphone tower. The signal is then passed to a tower, and it happens without the user knowing.
Authorities can either search for and track a specific cellphone number or collect data from all of the cellphones within a certain area. That data can include the IMSI — or International Mobile Subscriber Identity — and metadata about whom a person communicates with and for how long. And some advanced simulators can intercept the content of messages, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Groups, including the ACLU, have raised concerns about both forms of technology, saying that widespread use infringes on constitutional rights that protect people from unlawful searches and guarantee the right to peacefully assemble and associate with groups of people.
Privacy advocates point to China as an example of the dangers posed by unrestricted use of such technologies. The Chinese government is using facial recognition to monitor and oppress the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority ethnic population. China is also working on technology that can identify people by the way they walk, so that they can be tracked even if their faces are obscured. The New York Times reported that Chinese officials are using the technology to shame people who wear pajamas in public, for example, while police in London are going to use it to identify people captured on video in real time.
McQuade is among those concerned.
“It’s akin to having close personal surveillance on someone for a long time and reading their diary about who they’re calling and who they’re visiting,” he said.
A handful of communities in the United States have restricted or banned the use of facial recognition technology, both because of constitutional concerns and a high error rate when trying to identify people of color and women. The state of California has enacted a three-year ban on using facial recognition in conjunction with cameras worn by police officers.
A study published in December by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found the rate of false positive identifications, which could make an innocent person a criminal suspect, occurred 10 to 100 times more frequently among African-Americans and Asians than with Caucasians.
In Portland, the City Council has twice postponed a vote on a proposal from City Councilor Pious Ali that would prohibit city officials, including its police force, from obtaining, retaining, accessing or using any facial recognition technology or information provided by such technology.
The proposed ban comes as Maine’s largest city has embraced so-called smart-city technology, which includes traffic monitoring and has stoked fears about government’s increasing ability to watch over citizens. And Portland’s police officers are now equipped with cameras mounted on their chests to capture video of each person an officer interacts with, another source of concern about privacy.
Portland’s smart-city efforts so far include LED streetlights that can double as WiFi routers, and sophisticated traffic management systems that can read and adjust signals in response to real-time traffic. Portland officials have expressed interest in other “public safety functions,” but so far, officials say that has not included facial recognition technology.
City officials, including Police Chief Frank Clark, said they are not currently using facial recognition technology and opposed restricting any future use of technology that might enhance public safety. The chief said he would alert the city manager or the council if the department ever planned to use it.
Clark highlighted the technologies’ potential to help solve crimes and identify exploited children, crime victims and people suffering from dementia.
“While we do not have any immediate plans to acquire facial recognition, I am an advocate of taking advantage of contemporary 21st century technologies to drive better public safety outcomes,” Clark said in a memo to councilors, adding that strong policies can prevent misuse and infringement on constitutional rights. “A ban on facial recognition technology would only take away a potential tool that is helping to increase efficiencies and provide assistance for crime victims and people in crisis in other jurisdictions.”
And the city also has said it does not use any cell site simulators. A request for internal public records pertaining to the technology produced no relevant documents, a city spokesperson said.
Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce has said his agency began using facial recognition technology in 2012 to search its database of mug shots to identify people who refused to give their names or were suspected of having fake IDs. Joyce said they stopped using the technology because it only worked when the photo of a subject’s face was taken at the correct angle and in good lighting.
While both the Portland police chief and the Cumberland County sheriff have been willing to talk about whether the technology is in use, the Maine State Police are not as forthcoming.

GLOMAR: COLD WAR SECRECY The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram requested a range of public documents relating to facial recognition technology and cell site simulators from the Maine State Police under Maine’s Freedom of Access Act. The documents included any requests for proposals, contracts, payments, policies governing usage, evaluations of the technology and communications about the use of such technology.
Christopher Parr, staff attorney for the Maine State Police, issued formal denials to both requests, citing a provision of Maine law enacted in 2013 that appears to be unique in the United States.
“Answering your inquiry would require us to confirm the existence or nonexistence of records and information relating to the type of technology that is the subject of your email,” Parr said in November. “As a matter of law, we are unable to confirm the existence or nonexistence of such records and information.”
Sigmund Schutz, an attorney for the Press Herald and Telegram, is challenging that interpretation and asking the state to reconsider its denial. He noted that the request does not pertain to a specific investigation or person, nor does it pertain to a type of technology that is unknown to the public.
“Based on the nature of the records sought, it is not plausible that disclosure of any or all of the requested records would cause any of the harms that would warrant confidentiality,” Schutz wrote.
Parr’s response to records requests is often referred to in legal circles as a Glomar, a nonanswer created by the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1970s in response to public inquiries about a covert operation to recover a sunken Soviet submarine.
After a Soviet submarine mysteriously sank in 1968, the U.S. located the disabled sub and launched a covert mission to retrieve it, believing it contained nuclear missiles or nuclear codes, or both. The U.S. hired the Global Marine company, which was owned by Howard Hughes, to build a special ship to try to retrieve the sub. The ship was named the Hughes Glomar Explorer.
The U.S. was unable to surface the sub. Once news began to spread about the failed mission in 1975, the Central Intelligence Agency drafted a response that was truthful without confirming or denying the existence of the covert operation.
The response became known as Glomar.

MAINE’S SECRECY STANDS OUT The ACLU says Maine is one of only two states to give law enforcement the ability in state statute to neither confirm nor deny a broad range of public records relating to investigatory methods and technologies.
Wessler, the ACLU staff attorney, said Maine’s law is more sweeping than a similar law in Indiana, the only other state he’s found to have codified a Glomar response in state law. He said Indiana’s law requires proof that disclosing the information would harm an investigation or an individual, whereas Maine’s does not.
“In Maine, it doesn’t have to hurt anybody,” Wessler said. “It could be information that’s completely in the public interest and that wouldn’t interfere with any law enforcement investigation and the police department still has to withhold any mention of whether they have documents or don’t have documents.”
The state police interpretation of the statute highlights what may be an unintended consequence of a 2013 rewrite of state laws pertaining to criminal history records and intelligence and investigative materials.
It’s only one line in a 20-plus-page rewrite, but it has broad implications on the public’s ability to understand the type of technologies police are deploying, the cost of that technology and what policies are in place to prevent misuse.
A section titled “Confirming the existence or nonexistence of confidential intelligence and investigative record information” states: “A Maine criminal justice agency may not confirm the existence or nonexistence of intelligence and investigative record information confidential under section 804 to any person or public or private entity that is not eligible to receive the information itself.”
A review of the legislative file does not suggest that section of the bill received much discussion. It was pitched as a way to clarify and improve an existing law.
Marc Malon, the legislative and press liaison for the Maine Attorney General’s Office, referred all questions about the 2013 law change to Charles Leadbetter, a retired assistant to the attorney general who was the point person for the rewrite.
Leadbetter said in a brief interview that the lengthy summary of the bill spoke for itself. That summary says that section of the law had no previous counterpart, but was modeled after a similar provision intended to protect confidential information about a specific person.
Malon did not respond to requests to speak to any other officials in the AG’s office and whether state police were interpreting the law correctly.
Representatives of Gov. Janet Mills, who was the attorney general in 2013, did not respond to interview requests. And Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck requested that questions be submitted in writing and has yet to respond to questions sent on Jan. 22.
Maine’s sweeping use of that exemption is raising concerns among civil liberties advocates.
McQuade, the assistant professor, said the lack of disclosure prevents any meaningful oversight of the technology and allows law enforcement to establish a pattern of behavior before lawmakers and the public can have a discussion about whether or even how to use it. And any policies that come after the fact can be greatly influenced by the pattern of behavior already established, he said.
“We see how police practice actually molds the law,” McQuade said. “It should be very threatening if you take the Constitution seriously. This is a big imbalance of power that gives the executive branch powers that are reserved on paper for the legislative bodies.”
Clare Garvie, a researcher at Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology, said that only two states would neither confirm nor deny use of facial recognition technology while she was conducting research for a 2016 report titled “The Perpetual Line-up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America.” Those states were Maine and Massachusetts, she said.
That study, which sought records from 106 law enforcement agencies, found that 26 to 30 states allow law enforcement to run or request searches against their driver’s license and state identification databases and roughly one in two American adults have their photos searched this way. Despite the state’s refusal to provide information, Maine was listed as being capable of searching FBI mug shots — information gleaned from a U.S. Government Accountability Office report.
Wessler, of the ACLU, said privacy advocates got a similar response while researching the use of cell site simulators by law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Wessler said that only Maine and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would neither confirm nor deny the use of cell site simulators in response to public records requests from either the ACLU, privacy researchers or the press.
Both technologies have been the subject of inquiry by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which has generally called for more transparency and more privacy protections for innocent civilians.
“Police departments have a lot of power and we expect them to use that power responsibly to protect us,” Wessler said. “But American history is replete with examples of abuses by police and that’s why there needs to be strong oversight and transparency into their practices.”

SIGNS POINTING TO USE Despite the secrecy, there is evidence that Maine may be using some of this technology.
Three years ago, Parr, the state police attorney, acknowledged in emails with Georgetown Law researchers that the agency was working with the FBI to conduct “considerable testing” of facial recognition technology.
The acknowledgement came five months after Maine had been listed in a 2016 report by the GAO as one of seven states to have an agreement with the FBI to conduct facial recognition searches on its federal database. The other states were Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas and Arkansas.
The report — “Facial Recognition Technology: FBI Should Better Ensure Privacy and Accuracy” — said Maine was one of 15 states plus the District of Columbia that had the technical ability to conduct facial recognition searches of the FBI’s Next Generation Identification-Interstate Photo System. That database has over over 90 million civil and criminal photos and images of scars, marks and tattoos, according to a follow-up report in 2019. Of the 93 million photos, 38 million were criminal photos. And law enforcement has the ability to add photos of unknown individuals who are part of a federal investigation.
Maine State Police entered into an agreement to search that database back in 2012. The 2016 GAO report states that from the beginning of the pilot program in 2011 through 2015, search requests from each participating state ranged from under 20 by one state to 14,000 by another state. The report does not say how many search requests came from Maine.
In response to public records requests submitted by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology, Parr told researchers that Maine was currently testing the technology, but had made no decision about how or whether to use it in the future. His response came after both the GAO and the Georgetown reports were published.
“For some time Maine has been working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Systems Division to implement the use of facial recognition technology,” Parr wrote. “Although at this point we technically are capable of using the technology, we have been in no hurry to do so without considerable testing, which we still are conducting.”
More than three years later, it is still not clear to what extent Maine is searching this database and what policies guide those searches.
At the time, Parr noted that the state had received the FBI’s policy and implementation guide and that the state would likely draft its own. In 2018, Parr told researchers that the state’s position had not changed.
But, in 2019, Parr told the Press Herald and Telegram even less.
“As a matter of law, we are unable to confirm the existence or nonexistence of records or information responsive to the request. See 16 M.R.S.A. § 807,” Parr wrote.
Knowing whether State Police are using facial recognition could become more important this year.
Maine is in the midst of rolling out new driver’s licenses and state identification cards that are compliant with the federal Real ID program — a move that could greatly expand the number of photos that can be searched using facial recognition.

USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION FOR REAL ID Beginning in October, Mainers will need to have a Real ID or a passport if they want to board an airplane or enter a secure federal facility. Getting that form of identification requires a photo that can be more effectively used in a facial recognition system. That could greatly expand the number of photos law enforcement can search.
Real ID photos are especially suited for facial recognition searches, because of their high resolution. In 2017, the state said “Real ID applicants must … submit to a photograph using facial recognition technology.”
And while Maine law currently prevents state officials from outside agencies, including the FBI, from searching its database, an effort is underway to change that.
A bill submitted by the Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, would allow the bureau’s investigators to conduct searches of its Real ID database for outside agencies.
Secretary of State Matt Dunlap said his office is still developing rules for conducting those searches. But he said the state would continue to prohibit outside agencies, such as the FBI, from having open-ended access to the database.
“Nobody is going to have wholesale access to the database,” Dunlap said. “We’ve never allowed that and we’re not proposing it now.”
Dunlap said the bill is intended to allow the BMV to help police identify specific individuals.
Dunlap cited a police standoff as an example. Police could provide BMV with a person’s name and other information, and the BMV would provide police with a license photo so they can locate the correct person. It’s a practice that occurs with the old license system, he said.
Dunlap said the state “would never” allow an outside agency to search the database to identify individuals who were captured on camera attending a public rally or demonstration.
However, the Real ID system and the proposed legislation would open up a new avenue of searches by allowing police to submit a photo of an unknown person to the BMV so it can run a facial recognition search in hopes of digging up a positive ID. That would essentially put anyone who has a Real ID into a virtual lineup.
Dunlap said those types of searches could be allowed under certain circumstances if the bill passes. But he stressed facial recognition alone is not enough to establish a positive identification and that additional verification is needed.
“You don’t ascertain identity with only one element,” he said.
The bill, L.D. 1899, “An Act to Amend Certain Motor Vehicle Laws,” received a public hearing on Jan. 23 before the Legislature’s Committee on Transportation.
Michael Kebede, policy counsel for the ACLU of Maine, spoke in opposition to the bill as drafted. He asked the committee to consider an amendment that would restrict facial recognition searches only to emergency situations where there is an imminent threat to life.
Kebede said the technology poses “grave risks” for black people, especially black women, transgender people and immigrant communities, because it misidentifies these groups at higher rates than it does Caucasians.
“Persistent identification and tracking can have a chilling effect, as people will be less likely to exercise their rights if they know the government is tracking and identifying them everywhere they go,” Kebede said. “Mainers must be able to visit substance use clinics, churches and synagogues, friends and family, political protests and doctors’ offices without fear that a government agent is secretly keeping tabs on their every movement.”
During a Feb. 6 work session, the Transportation Committee amended the bill to include the ACLU of Maine’s amendment, as well as requiring the BMV to draft “major substantive rules for other authorized uses of facial recognition technology.”
Dunlap said he shares the concerns of privacy advocates who worry about misuse. The state resisted complying with the Real ID program for years, he said, but lawmakers changed course when the federal government announced that people would no longer be able to fly on a commercial airliner or enter a federal building without a non-Real ID-compliant form of identification or passport.
He said that each time the database is searched, it logs a record of who searched it and when. It’s unclear whether those records would be public because the rules are still being considered.
“Facial recognition really scares a lot of people and I think it really should,” Dunlap said. “I think people have good reason to be freaked out about that.”
Although Dunlap stressed that searches could only be conducted by BMV staff on behalf of other agencies, those employees already work closely with other federal, state and local law enforcement officials.
The BMV is one of 12 agencies that provide staffing and support for the Maine Information and Analysis Center, one of roughly 80 so-called fusion centers created in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks whose specific activities are also kept under wraps.

FUSION CENTER Maine State Police oversee operations at the Maine Information and Analysis Center.
The center’s 12-member staff includes federal, state and local officials, among them representatives of the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the BMV, which is building a database that could be searched with facial recognition technologies through the Real ID program.
Its activities are overseen by a 12-member advisory board. It includes one civilian and a private attorney, while the other 10 members include four members from the Maine State Police, Attorney General Aaron Frey, Douglas Farnham, adjutant general of the Maine National Guard, and a representative from Central Maine Power Co. Maine State Police Lt. Michael Johnston, the fusion center’s director, said that a CMP representative is on the board because part of the center’s mission is to protect critical infrastructure, including utilities.
Little is known about the activities of Maine’s fusion center. Its investigations involve counterterrorism, felony drug crimes, violent crimes, including domestic violence, and property crimes, among others, Johnston said.
Johnston would not say what types of technologies are available to state and local police agencies, which submit daily inquiries to the center, and he would not provide a detailed budget, meeting minutes from an advisory committee tasked with oversight, or any audits of the center’s operation without first conferring with Parr, the attorney. Parr has not yet indicated whether any documents would be released in response to the request.
Johnston said the center receives inquiries from local police and other agencies on a regular basis. But he would not point to any cases in which the information or the analysis from the center helped apprehend a suspect.
“We have small victories every day,” he said. “We’re just a piece of the puzzle.”
When asked about protecting citizens’ privacy, Johnston said the fusion center operates within the constraints of the Constitution, as well as state and federal laws, policies and directives. The center is assessed annually by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and undergoes a regular audit, as well as being overseen by the advisory board, which is supposed to meet at least once a year.
Those audits and other records, however, were not immediately available.
The center’s privacy policy is online. It does not reveal what types of technologies are used at the center, but it does lay out the ground rules for acquiring, storing and retaining information.
The policy states that the center may only seek, acquire and retain information that relates to a possible threat or criminal predicate, based on reasonable suspicion and that comes from a reliable source, among other requirements. However, it also states that the center “may retain information that is based on a level of suspicion that is less than ‘reasonable suspicion,’ such as tips and leads or a suspicious activity report.”
The policy says that methods of acquiring information must be legal and the center shall not directly or indirectly seek, acquire or retain information from a nongovernmental partner if it suspects that partner is legally prohibited from having or disclosing that information, acquired that information through a method that the center itself could not legally use, or if the information itself could not be legally obtained by the center. Outside partners must certify in writing that they comply with laws and their methods are not based on misleading information-gathering practices.
“There are multi-layers of oversight for the fusion center,” Johnston said. “While we’re protecting them (citizens) from physical threats and harms, we have to make sure we’re protecting their civil rights and liberties and that we’re balancing the two.”

Texto completo: In "Star Trek: Picard," Patrick Stewart reprises his iconic role as Jean-Luc Picard, a character he played for seven seasons on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and in four feature films.
It almost didn't happen. Stewart, who hadn't played Picard since the 2002 movie "Star Trek: Nemesis," long resisted a return, believing he had completed his job as one of the franchise's most popular captains.
But he changed his mind after reading a lengthy proposal put together by Berkeley author (and diehard "Trek" devotee) Michael Chabon, Alex Kurtzman and a few others. Now he's on board for a possible three-season run. (The show already has been renewed for a second season on CBS All Access).
Stewart recently fielded questions during a TV industry event.

Q: Had you gone through the process of saying goodbye to the character for good?
A: Oh, yes, years ago. But the context in which the work was done, the fact that we were then, as we are now, an ensemble and not a star-led series, it has been far easier than I expected to make this transition nearly 20 years later. But because ... the man exists inside me, the interesting question for me is ... what happened in those 20 years? So now I have a very, very clear vision, and little snippets of that backstory will creep into the series.

Q: Has this role been a career burden at times?
A: Yes. I've been honest about this. I found quite soon after we wrapped the fourth of our movies, "Nemesis," that I had hung a, kind of, albatross around my neck. And so I went out of my way to try to find as many diverse roles as possible, and that was fun. It has taken a while for me to truly absorb the impact of this work. And being with a new ensemble you've seen already some of it, a brilliant ensemble I feel, once again, the sense of pride of being ... not the leader, but in a sense, I'm a kind of symbol.

Q: Jonathan Frakes and Brent Spiner appear in "Picard." Is there anybody else from "Next Generation" who is going to appear in the series?
A: We actually talk all the time. The whole "Next Generation" cast are very, very close. I love all of them, and they are dear, dear friends. Jonathan, Marina Sirtis, Jonathan Del Arco, and Brent, of course, do appear in Season 1. It is my hope that whenever that point arrives in which we are wrapping the series, that we will have encountered all of the principal actors from "Next Generation."

Q: Why do you think "Star Trek" has endured as a franchise for all these years?
A: Hope. It is the dominant emotion behind everything that we did on "Next Generation" and, as I'm beginning to discover, on "Picard" too. It has always been part of the content of "Star Trek" that it will be attempting to create a better future with the certain belief that a better future is possible if the right kind of work and the right kind of people are engaged in that. And my feeling was ... there has never been a more important moment when entertainment and show business can address some of the issues that are potentially damaging our world today.

A DOSE OF BUFFALO HORN? China stirs debate in urging mix of traditional remedies, antiviral drugs to fight virus

Texto completo: As it races to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus, the Chinese government is seeing potential in a cocktail of antiviral drugs. It is also recommending the Peaceful Palace Bovine Pill, a traditional Chinese medicine made with the gallstones of cattle, buffalo horn, jasmine and pearl.
There is no known cure for the coronavirus that has sickened tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds in China. The country's National Health Commission said doctors should try treating patients mainly with a combination of Western drugs used to treat HIV and fight viruses, depending on the severity of illness.
But the government is also looking at ways to supplement the treatment with remedies that are integral to its national identity - traditional Chinese medicine.
It has its supporters.
"I think it is the correct approach," said Cheng Yung-chi, a professor of pharmacology at Yale University School of Medicine. "The evidence is going to come, and we have to give it the benefit of the doubt."
There is no clinical proof that the roots of various plants, licorice and the Peaceful Palace Bovine Pill can help combat the deadly disease. Practitioners said the regimen could help ease symptoms, such as swelling in the lungs, with fewer side effects.
Critics said the use of such concoctions could raise concerns about patient safety.
The use of these ancient Chinese remedies dovetails with a push by President Xi Jinping to harness them as a source of national pride. He has said that officials should place as much importance on traditional Chinese medicines as they do on Western medicines. His government has called for the remedies to be promoted in its "Belt and Road" trade route, China's push to build ports, rail lines and other infrastructure around the world.
In turning to traditional medicine, China is relying on past experience.
During the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2002 and 2003, doctors found that steroids prescribed to reduce inflammation had harmful side effects such as bone destruction. Chinese medicine, they said, would mitigate some of these adverse reactions.
In its treatment plan for the coronavirus released last week, the National Health Commission recommended traditional Chinese medicine remedies that could be used with antiretroviral HIV drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir. The national health department suggested trying the Peaceful Palace Bovine Pill for severe symptoms such as wheezing and respiratory distress.
Some hospitals are already using a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.
In recent weeks, Beijing's health department reported that two patients who were discharged had been treated with traditional Chinese medicines together with other unspecified drugs. And in Guangzhou, a major city in the south, health officials said 50 patients reported having no more fever and half of them said their coughs went away after using traditional Chinese medicines and other drugs.
Doctors are conducting clinical trials to test the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, said Cheng, who is also chair of the Consortium for the Globalization of Chinese Medicine, a group of academics in the field.
Jiang Xianfeng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner at United Family Health, a top hospital for the affluent in Beijing, said these medicines are safe, effective and easy to get.
"Western medicine does not have better answers to this virus," Jiang said. "The Chinese people have experienced these sort of plagues many times in our thousands of years of history. If traditional Chinese medicine was not effective, the Chinese people would already be destroyed."
After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization studied the use of traditional Chinese medicine during that period and determined they were safe and showed some potential in relieving symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. Researchers from the United States and Taiwan found that certain herbs could suppress the virus if prescribed at specific concentration levels, while other studies said their findings were inconclusive.
That scientific uncertainty is not stopping the Chinese government.
Since the second version of its treatment plan, the health commission has added more traditional Chinese medicines to the mix. Authorities in Wuhan said coronavirus patients with light or moderate symptoms should be treated with traditional Chinese medicine, the state-run Beijing News reported.
Zhu Mao, a representative of a traditional Chinese medicine manufacturer in Hubei, said he was producing more than 20,000 prescriptions per day at the request of the government. On Jan. 25, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine dispatched 25 teams of Chinese healers to Wuhan.
Traditional Chinese medicine teaches that disease arises from imbalances in the body and that some people have "hot" constitutions, therefore making them vulnerable to fevers and inflammations. When someone gets a fever or a respiratory illness, it is not uncommon to have Chinese people say, "You are on fire."
Practitioners have determined the coronavirus is a "hot" disease, and therefore, medicines should be prescribed to "clear the heat."
It is unclear how the science works behind these medicines. Compounding the problem: There is no standardization for these herbs and regulation is poor.
Traditional Chinese medicine has also been linked to the consumption of exotic wild meats, though it is unclear whether the eating of the meats is really based on the practice.
But some people, particularly in the south, believe that the way to achieving a balanced body is through eating certain meats. Wildlife markets such as the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the site that is believed to be the origin of the coronavirus, proliferated because of the demand for such meats.
Laurie Garrett, a member of the World Economic Forum's global health security advisory board who covered the SARS outbreak in China, said that using traditional Chinese medicine in the new coronavirus outbreak could be risky because the approach is not rigorously backed by research.
"There's no such thing as dosing," she said. "It's like being a chef in a kitchen."
The science journal Nature pointed out that dozens of women who had taken Chinese herbs as part of a weight-loss program ended up with kidney failure in the 1990s. Proponents of traditional Chinese medicine said the herbs were misused. Still, Nature argued in a 2017 editorial, "Hundreds of years of use in clinics that don't standardize or analyze the clinical data are no match for blinded, controlled studies."
Doctors in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, are not convinced that traditional Chinese medicines can help.
"I am not trying to devalue their treatment, but this is not something we practice," said Arisina Ma, president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors Association.
In China, people have searched anxiously for ways to protect themselves. In many Chinese cities, some stood in line for hours to buy "Shuanghuanglian" - a herbal concoction that mixes flowers such as honeysuckle and forsythia, among other ingredients - after two government-backed research institutes published a study that said it was effective in preventing the coronavirus.
Chen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, urged Chinese news media to be more careful in its reporting, saying the potential for traditional Chinese medicine to inhibit a virus is not equivalent to a form of prevention or treatment.
"If incidents like Shuanghuanglian happen again and again, it will lose the public trust, cause more panic and go against the authorities' advice to avoid crowd gathering," Chen wrote.
Qin Xi, a manager of a pharmacy in Beijing, said sales of some of his traditional medicines, including "Shuanghuanglian," have been off the charts.
"As for whether it works, who knows?" he said.

Aging population finds needs aren't being met There's a rising demand for geriatricians, but few doctors are attracted to specialty

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
"I was not doing well emotionally," she recalled. "Physically, I didn't have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn't getting to work."
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn't seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, "Mommy needs an intervention."
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels "full of spirit" and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. "She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don't do anymore," Poskanzer said. "And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of."
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what's most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can't easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation's older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. "It's basically stagnation," said Aldis Petriceks, the study's lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
"These are smart people looking at economic reality," said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. "Having patience, having good communication skills, it's a different personality than being a surgeon," Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true "when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85," said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
"She's had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another," said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. "I thought, 'Let's see if there's a way to make her life easier.' "
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
"It's less of 'Let's order this med, let's order that procedure,' more of a holistic approach," Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, "we're not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians," Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they're also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as "a small, elite workforce" who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
"The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues" understand these patients' needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.

Texto completo: A handful of senators reached out to the White House to warn the president not to dismiss Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who testified in the House hearings. But Mr. Trump went ahead anyway.
WASHINGTON -- A handful of Republican senators tried to stop President Trump from firing Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who testified in the House impeachment hearings, but the president relieved the diplomat of his post anyway, according to people briefed on the discussions.
The senators were concerned that it would look bad for Mr. Trump to dismiss Mr. Sondland and argued that it was unnecessary, since the ambassador was already talking with senior officials about leaving after the Senate trial, the people said. The senators told White House officials that Mr. Sondland should be allowed to depart on his own terms, which would have reduced any political backlash.
But Mr. Trump evidently was not interested in a quiet departure, choosing instead to make a point by forcing Mr. Sondland out before the ambassador was ready to go. When State Department officials called Mr. Sondland on Friday to tell him that he had to resign that day, he resisted, saying that he did not want to be included in what seemed like a larger purge of impeachment witnesses, according to the people informed about the matter.
Mr. Sondland conveyed to the State Department officials that if they wanted him gone that day, they would have to fire him. And so the president did, ordering the ambassador recalled from his post effective immediately. Mr. Sondland's dismissal was announced just hours after another impeachment witness, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, and his twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, were marched out of the White House by security officers and told their services were no longer needed.
The ousters came two days after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on two articles of impeachment stemming from his effort to pressure Ukraine to incriminate Democratic rivals. Outraged Democrats called the firings a "Friday night massacre" aimed at taking revenge against government officials who had no choice but to testify under subpoena about what they knew.
Among the Republicans who warned the White House was Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who after voting to acquit Mr. Trump said she thought he had learned a lesson. Others included Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Martha McSally of Arizona and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday but a senior administration official confirmed the senators' outreach on behalf of Mr. Sondland, a donor to Mr. Tillis and other Republicans.
Ms. Collins said Saturday that her lesson comment had been misinterpreted and that she had earlier noted that she did not support retribution. "The lesson that I hoped the president had learned was that he should not enlist the help of a foreign government in investigating a political rival," she said in a statement to The New York Times. "It had absolutely nothing to do with whether or not he should fire people who testified in a way that he perceived as harmful to him."
The senators did not express the same concern about Colonel Vindman, who is viewed less sympathetically by the president's allies. Republicans considered some of Colonel Vindman's comments during his testimony overtly political and, in any case, believed it was untenable for him to remain on the staff of a president with whom he broke so publicly.
Other witnesses who testified have quietly left their positions in recent days. Jennifer Williams, a career official working for Vice President Mike Pence, asked to return early to the Defense Department. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine removed from her post last spring because she was seen as an obstacle to the president and his associates, retired from the Foreign Service. And her acting successor, William B. Taylor Jr., returned home as well.
Some of these witnesses may begin to speak out. Mr. Taylor has given a series of news media interviews in recent days. And Ms. Yovanovitch has enlisted the Javelin literary agency, picking the same agents who represent John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, among others.
Mr. Trump on Saturday defended his decision to fire Colonel Vindman, calling the decorated Iraq war veteran "very insubordinate."
"Fake News @CNN & MSDNC keep talking about 'Lt. Col.' Vindman as though I should think only how wonderful he was," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, without explaining why he put the colonel's rank in quote marks.
"Actually, I don't know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don't believe!)," he continued, "but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly, & was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, 'OUT'."
Mr. Trump offered no explanation for why Colonel Vindman's twin brother, Yevgeny Vindman, who is also an Army lieutenant colonel and who worked as a lawyer on the National Security Council staff, was fired and escorted out of the White House complex at the same time even though he did not participate in the House hearings. Nor did the president mention his decision to recall Mr. Sondland, a hotel magnate who donated $ 1 million to Mr. Trump's inaugural festivities before receiving his ambassadorial appointment.
Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman were key witnesses in the House hearings. Mr. Sondland, who was deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine, testified that "we followed the president's orders" and that "everyone was in the loop." Colonel Vindman, who was on Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, testified that it was "improper for the president" to coerce a foreign country to investigate political opponents.
Colonel Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council staff, and his brother were scheduled to remain at the White House until July but will now be sent back to the Defense Department. Mr. Sondland, a political appointee, will return to the United States and presumably leave government service.
A lawyer for Colonel Vindman said Mr. Trump's Twitter messages contained "obviously false statements" about his client.
"They conflict with the clear personnel record and the entirety of the impeachment record of which the president is well aware," said the lawyer, David Pressman. "While the most powerful man in the world continues his campaign of intimidation, while too many entrusted with political office continue to remain silent, Lt. Col. Vindman continues his service to our country as a decorated, active duty member of our military."
Mr. Trump's tweets misstated or overstated testimony about Colonel Vindman. Tim Morrison, who supervised him at the National Security Council for just three months, told the House that he had concerns about Colonel Vindman's judgment and believed he did not always adhere to the chain of command. But when Mr. Morrison said he had originally heard such concerns from his predecessor, Fiona Hill, she disputed his account.
Ms. Hill, who supervised Colonel Vindman for two years, testified that she had a much narrower concern that he did not have "the political antenna" to deal with matters related to domestic politics. "That does not mean in any way that I was questioning his overall judgment, nor was I questioning in any way his substantive expertise," she said. "He is excellent on issues related to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, on Russian defense issues."
In fact, Colonel Vindman read from Dr. Hill's personnel evaluation at his own hearing: "Alex is a top 1 percent military officer and the best Army officer I have worked with in my 15 years of government service. He is brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment."
Democrats on Saturday denounced Mr. Trump's actions. "By firing Lt. Col. Vindman and Ambassador Sondland like this, the Trump administration signaled it won't tolerate people who tell the truth," said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. "The fact that Lt. Col. Vindman's brother was also removed from the N.S.C., as well as the transfer of Ms. Williams from Vice President Pence's staff, are signals that the president places blind loyalty above all else, including testimony under oath."
Peter Baker and Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Catie Edmondson and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington, and Danny Hakim from New York.

Texto completo: Early last year, I received a disturbing text message about a childhood friend. In an attempt to escape the civil war brewing in the English-speaking region of Cameroon, he had left our hometown and was on his way to Libya to get on a boat to Europe. My first reaction was, "Oh no, please no." It was, of course, too late for me to plead with him not to do it -- by the time I got the message, he was already trekking and taking buses across the continent, doing whatever he could to make the 2,000-mile journey. I did not talk to him until the summer. By then, he had made it to Italy and was sitting in an immigration detention center.
"If I were to tell you what I've been through ... " he said, trailing off. I did not ask him to tell me. How could I, when he was still in the depths of his suffering, bereft of his freedom and pining for home? Only later would I find out from a relative that the boat on which he was crossing the Mediterranean to Italy from Libya had been on the verge of capsizing -- he was minutes away from drowning -- when a rescue organization arrived and saved him and his fellow passengers.
They were all arrested by the Italian government, and while in detention they were interviewed by representatives from various European Union countries to gauge the strength of their asylum petitions. My friend was interviewed by the German government and told to wait, perhaps for all bureaucratic steps to be completed. I spoke to him during that monthslong wait, and I could tell he was digging into the recesses of his spirit to find whatever hope was left after all that he'd endured. I could do little besides send him a bit of money to buy his first winter jacket as the temperature dropped. Five days before Christmas, I received a picture of him well dressed and smiling in a German airport. I rejoiced, thinking he was about to start living his dream. Alas, he was merely on his way to another detention center in Germany, where he is right now.
I think of my friend as I look at the photo from the celebratory event held the day after Cameroon got its independence. Men and women with eyes aglow. Watching something delightful in their country. Stretching forward as if to grasp a bountiful destiny. What a glorious day it must have been. Such joy. Such hope. Their country was finally theirs. Imagine the possibilities. Imagine how wonderful their lives would be.
Did any of them imagine a day would come when Cameroonians would risk their lives to flee their independent nation for Europe? Did any of them imagine that 60 years after independence, Cameroon would have had only two presidents, both of them dictators, one for 22 years, one now in his 38th year? No, I don't suppose they did. And I don't suppose anyone on that day thought independence would come at such a hefty price -- a price imposed by whom? By the powers that partitioned and pillaged the continent? Or by the powers that took the reins on Independence Day and said to themselves, "Why not continue the pillaging?" Which is worse -- what they did to us or what we're doing to ourselves? I don't know. What I know is that my country is broken, and my heart is broken at the sight of it.
Africa in miniature, our teachers said to us -- that is what Cameroon is. How my schoolmates and I took pride in that. Everything that was present in Africa could be found in Cameroon. Dry seasons and rainy seasons, elephants and gorillas, jungles and savannahs -- we had it all. We had Christians and Muslims and the most fearsome witch doctors. As a child I danced to music by Yvonne Chaka Chaka from South Africa, Angélique Kidjo from Benin, Papa Wemba from Congo. We had a bar in town named after Abidjan, the biggest city in the Ivory Coast. And whenever I went out in a T-shirt bearing the face of Thomas Sankara, the great revolutionary from Burkina Faso, people stopped me to gaze at his picture and worship him. We were so proudly African we did not consider the Ghanaians and Nigerians and Liberians in town to be foreigners.
Our country was beautiful, and we were proud to share it.
Sure, we had a dictator, but he kept the country peaceful. Those of us who spoke English in a predominantly French-speaking country were marginalized, but our country was the rare African nation with English and French as official languages, and that distinction made us special.
Until it didn't.
Until a separatist movement sprang up three years ago to create a new country for the English speakers, having decided a bilingual country did not serve those who did not speak the language of the ruling class. The government responded swiftly by unleashing its soldiers to slaughter protesters and burn down villages where rebels might be hiding. Overnight, panic arose in the English-speaking regions as innocents fell in the crossfire. Families from obliterated villages fled into jungles, schools closed down and unemployment skyrocketed, causing those like my friend to risk his life on the Mediterranean.
Cameroon will be beautiful again. I will not give in to despair. But in this year of celebration, I must admit that the load history has wrought upon us is enough to shatter any country. How long will it take us to unburden ourselves?
We are encumbered by three distinct colonial legacies. First we were ruled by the Germans, who terrorized and plundered before relinquishing us to the French and British after losing World War I. The French took the majority of the country and massacred civilians, and the British took a minority of the country and neglected it, before both countries decided to grant us independence, making it possible for us to unify ourselves under one flag.
But from whom are we independent?
What good is independence in the age of neocolonialism? Europe still plays the flute and our government dances. We owe billions to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Western nonprofits arrive at a steady speed to improve our education and health care systems. Chinese interests have descended on our resources, taking away the livelihoods of many.
Across my part of Cameroon, the violence rages on, and the hopelessness grows. A village in which I lived as a little girl is now deserted. A town in which I spent several formative years is now overrun by criminals taking advantage of the chaos. I watch music videos from my childhood and choke up. "Don't come to Cameroon right now," I've been advised by friends and relatives. I'm taking their advice. I'm staying away for a while even as I dream of the day when our country will truly be ours.

THE GOLD STANDARD; The right award? 'Parasite' will win, but not best picture. The solution to better choices isn't more categories. It's fewer.

Texto completo: Nearly two decades ago, DreamWorks was on a roll at the Oscars, winning two best picture trophies in a row -- "American Beauty" and "Gladiator" -- and believing it had another surefire nominee with the computer-animated hit "Shrek," a film that studio co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg loved so much he premiered it in competition at Cannes, the first animated film since 1953's "Peter Pan" to do so.
"Shrek" didn't win the Palme d'Or. And it didn't earn a best picture nomination either, a shocking outcome for a movie that DreamWorks campaigned for relentlessly. (When asked why DreamWorks ran three "Shrek" ads in the L.A. Times and New York Times weekly for a month before the nominations, studio marketing chief Terry Press said: "Because everyone else ran two.")
The "Shrek" snub stung. But, in retrospect, it shouldn't have been much of a surprise. It coincided with the same year that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave animated feature films their own Oscar. Guaranteed a place in this separate, though less prestigious category, academy members could go ahead and ignore the green ogre and vote instead for movies like "A Beautiful Mind," "Gosford Park" and "In the Bedroom."

No animated movie has ever won the best picture Oscar. In fact, since the academy gave the form its own category, just "Up" and "Toy Story 3" have been nominated there, both coming in the only two years in the expanded best picture era in which academy members could vote for 10 movies on their ballots.
This is what happens when you add more Oscar categories. Movies are marginalized, excluded from the category everyone cares most about -- best picture -- and shunted aside to the kids table.
Filmmakers still earn an Oscar, yes. But the awards aren't on an equal footing. Basically, it's the equivalent of a participation trophy in youth sports, a pat on the head and a juice box.
I'm thinking about this in a year in which Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece, "Parasite," could become the first foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for best picture. And it probably would win if there wasn't a separate Oscar category for foreign-language movies, the newly rechristened "international feature film," that "Parasite" will almost assuredly take.
"I really like 'Parasite,' but I love 'The Irishman' too," one Oscar voter told me. "If there weren't two categories, I guess I'd have a harder choice. But the way it stands now, I can vote for both and hopefully see Bong Joon Ho and Martin Scorsese on the stage."
It makes you wonder how many people felt the same way last year when Alfonso Cuaron's "Roma" won Oscars for foreign-language feature, cinematography and director, but lost to "Green Book" for best picture.
Now, I know some voters who couldn't get past the four-minute opening sequence of Yalitza Aparicio mopping the private courtyard. But given Cuaron's two key victories, it's not a leap to imagine that it might have won best picture as well had some voters decided that taking home one feature film Oscar was reward enough.
Every year, there's talk of adding more Oscar categories. In 2018, the film academy announced plans to create an Oscar for "outstanding achievement in popular film" that would stand apart from the traditional best picture award. The idea of a popular film Oscar proved so unpopular that it was quickly shelved.
And, lo and behold, voters nominated several commercial hits for best picture, including "Black Panther," "A Star Is Born" and "Bohemian Rhapsody."
This year, in the wake of the directors branch failing (again) to nominate women, the idea was floated that the Oscars should mirror the Directors Guild of America and create an award for best director of a first feature. The DGA's 2020 first-timer class included three women, two of them women of color and two foreign-born.
And while I understand the impulse to make Oscar voters expand their ideas about what constitutes an awards-worthy movie, I don't think the solution is to create a separate, lesser award.
Jordan Peele won the DGA's first-feature prize two years ago for "Get Out." He was also nominated in the main category. Which trophy do you think he really wanted to take home?
Animators didn't want a separate Oscar in 2001. Katzenberg was livid when "Shrek" failed to earn a best picture nomination. Last year, the producers of Sony Pictures Animation's hit "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" thought their movie was good enough to earn a best picture nomination. I told them I agreed -- but that if the academy ignored Pixar's daring, inventive "Inside Out," what chance did Spidey have?
The answer to pushing the academy to make better choices isn't more Oscar categories. It's fewer. That way, maybe "Parasite's" Bong could take the stage at the Dolby on Feb. 9 not in the middle of the ceremony, but at the very end, when everyone's paying attention.

Texto completo: Duplantis of Louisiana is the world's best pole-vaulter, but he will represent Sweden instead of the United States at the Olympics.
Armand Duplantis, a 20-year-old Louisiana native who has been as shrewd in choosing the nation he represents as he has been in choosing his fiberglass poles, broke the world record in the pole vault on Saturday with a jump of 20 feet 2 ¾ inches, or 6.17 meters.
At an indoor meet in Torun, Poland, Duplantis edged by a centimeter the previous record set in 2014 by Renaud Lavillenie of France, the 2012 Olympic champion.
Duplantis, known widely as Mondo, has already been selected to compete at the Tokyo Games, where he will be a favorite to win gold. But he will wear the blue and gold uniform of Sweden, his mother's home country, instead of the red, white and blue of the United States.
Among other things, Duplantis's decision is a cunning bit of strategy.
If he had sought to represent the United States at the Olympics, Duplantis would have had to finish among the top three vaulters at the Olympic track and field trials in June. One bad day, trouble with his technique or adverse weather conditions would present the risk of having to wait another four years to compete in the Summer Games.
Sweden, along with many countries, has a more forgiving Olympic selection process that is not determined by a single trials performance.
A number of top American vaulters have been left heartbroken by a disappointing performance at the trials. Famously, the decathlete Dan O'Brien, who was an Olympic gold-medal favorite in 1992, failed to qualify for the 10-event discipline at the Barcelona Games when he could not clear a height in the pole vault at the Olympic trials in New Orleans. O'Brien recovered to win the gold medal in 1996.
Duplantis, who is from a family of elite athletes, all of whom attended Louisiana State University, spent his boyhood summers in his mother's native Sweden, competing for a track and field club there. His mother, Helena, was a heptathlete and volleyball player at L.S.U.
A vaulting phenom from the age of 7 with dual citizenship, Duplantis had to choose which country to represent in international competitions. In part, he was swayed by wanting to follow in his mother's footsteps. But he also understood the risks of trying to qualify for the Olympics for the United States with its trials format.
"I can't say that wasn't in the back of my mind," Greg Duplantis, Mondo's father and coach, said on Saturday in a telephone interview from Lafayette, La. "Every time, there's a disaster or someone comes up that no one knows about."
Greg Duplantis, who was an All-American pole-vaulter at L.S.U., said most people he had encountered had been fine with Mondo's decision, though "you get a few disgruntled people."
"I'm expecting some backlash for the Olympics," he said. "I don't quite get it. He's following in his mom's footsteps. There shouldn't be anything wrong with that."
Sam Kendricks of Oxford, Miss., the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist and a two-time world champion, told The New York Times in 2017 that Mondo Duplantis's decision was a "very professional way of looking at it."
"I know a lot of people are going to say, 'Why don't you compete for the United States?"' Kendricks said. "But that's not the point of it for him. The point is to jump high and elevate the sport."
On Saturday, Duplantis told the website of track's world governing body that the record was "something that I wanted since I was 3 years old. It's a big year, but it's a good way to start it."

Texto completo: It's 5:35 a.m. in Ghana's capital of Accra. The day is dawning, born out of the receding blue-black night. I'm looking out at the horizon where the ocean meets the sky to see if I can spot the first cracks of sunlight. All I see are the remaining twinkling night stars fading slowly, as the ocean waves crash at my feet and bury them, cementing me into the sand of this land. The water and air are warm, and the breeze kisses my face with familiarity. An instant later, a bigger wave wraps its white crest around my knees and draws me closer, moving me farther into the water. I can feel the pull, like a rhythm that undulates with my pulse. Boom boom crash. Boom boom crash.
There's another pull, this time from my daughter, Lael. She's laughing with her mouth wide open, one arm raised toward the dawn, the other intertwined with my own, tugging me farther into the tide. I look at her joyful face and see generations who have come and gone. I see those who were stolen by force 400 years ago across these same waters as they cried out in fear and wished for salvation on these same twinkling stars. I see those who left willingly for a better future on distant shores, like Lael's grandfather who, as a Fulbright scholar in 1977, went to Wesleyan University, where he earned Ph.D.s in anthropology and ethnomusicology. I see our hope for the future for Africa, even as we're locked in a global fight for our proper place after centuries of deliberate depression.
Lael's laughter reaches her eyes, and they twinkle -- like the stars -- with a bit of mischief. I can't resist her pull or the ocean's tug to come closer, to go farther. It was the first day of the year, the official end of the "Year of Return," declared by Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, which brought hundreds of thousands of people of African descent to this country over the past year.
When I first met him, he asked me to help him with his mission to engage the African diaspora, specifically the Ghanaian diaspora. We created the "Full Circle Festival," a week-long cultural gathering to finish out the Year of Return. Both events are rooted in the Ghanaian adinkra symbol "sankofa." Adinkra symbols are an ancient communication mechanism often linked to proverbs. Sankofa means to "go back and get it," and the proverb in which it's rooted says, "It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten."
As the festival draws to a close, I'm thinking of a 1957 photo of 13 men -- founding fathers of Ghana, including Kwame Nkrumah -- from The New York Times's archives, taken a month before independence. The men are proudly wearing their traditional kente cloth, and I imagine that the yards of fabric were weighted with purpose -- woven with threads of black, for the people; red, for the blood of our forefathers and foremothers; yellow, for our precious gold; and green, for the richness of the land. These men wore the cloth as our people --including royalty on important occasions -- had for hundreds of years.
As I picture them with their serious smiles and determination, I wonder: Could they imagine the scene I am seeing today? Did they dream of even bigger things? Were they worried for their own mission, fearful that decades later we'd still be fighting for economic freedom? Are they proud of their daughter standing among strangers and friends on this Atlantic shore in a white dress embroidered with pearls from this very ocean? Can they see my heart racing beneath the black star I've tattooed in the middle of my chest?
My mother told me about her march into Black Star Square in the center of Accra on July 1, 1960, when she was 9 years old. Thousands of people crowded around Independence Arch to celebrate the Republic of Ghana. She recalled the stiff starch of her school uniform, her freshly cropped hair, the sounds of the soldiers' feet hitting the pavement in unison as she did her best to emulate their rhythm. What a day that must have been! The pride of so many gathered, watching the flag flying high, with Mr. Nkrumah waving to the people, as my mother looked up, hoping to catch his eye.
As I search the sky for the last remaining stars, looking for the brightest one upon which to wish, I am struck by a yearning. I instead look down at my feet. They are the deep brown color of my ancestors, with red undertones like Ghanaian soil, and they contrast with the white sand being pushed and pulled by the tide.

Texto completo: The March 19, 1927, Portland Press Herald features a photograph of three men: lawyer Clarence Darrow, Maine Supreme Judicial Court Justice William R. Pattangall and Dr. Clifton Daggett Gray, president of Bates College.
Who were they, and what were they up to?
They were preparing to engage in a two-hour philosophical debate about the nature of God and man in front of a paying audience at City Hall auditorium. And while it might be unthinkable in today's media environment, back then it was Page 1 news.
Darrow is the best remembered of the three today. In the 1920s, he was a household name.
The Press Herald called him "the famous criminal lawyer"; the Boston Herald, "one of the country's foremost." Once a corporate railroad lawyer, he switched sides to defending unions and radicals like Pullman strike organizer Eugene Debs. Almost 100 years later, Darrow is best remembered for defending Tennessee school teacher John Scopes against the 1925 "monkey" prosecution, challenging a statute that outlawed the teaching of evolution. Darrow succeeded in embarrassing expert prosecution witness William Jennings Bryan (President Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state and three times a candidate for president), by putting him on the witness stand and questioning him whether every story in the Bible is literally true. The 1960 movie "Inherit the Wind," starring Spencer Tracy, along with several later television remakes, has kept the Scopes trial alive in our collective memories.
Darrow had other famous cases - for example, his 12-hour sentencing argument in 1924 before Cook County (Illinois) Circuit Court Judge John R. Caverly, which saved wealthy Chicago college students Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb from hanging (they had murdered 14-year-old Bobby Franks to prove they could commit the perfect crime and get away with it). Meyer Levin's 1956 play "Compulsion" and the 1959 movie with Orson Welles and E.G. Marshall prolonged the notoriety of that case.
Then, in 1925-'26, the NAACP hired Darrow to defend African American Dr. Ossian Sweet, his family members and friends against murder charges. Sweet's house and family were attacked by a Detroit mob because they had moved into a previously white neighborhood. Shots were exchanged in both directions and a white man in the mob was killed. In a criminal trial against eight African American defendants, an all-white jury could not agree on a unanimous verdict. In a second trial, solely against Sweet's brother Henry and again with an all-white jury, Darrow obtained an acquittal, and the prosecutor dropped all charges against the remaining defendants. Kevin Boyle's "Arc of Justice" won the 2004 National Book Award for nonfiction for its account of the incident.
Those are just a sample of Darrow's famous cases. Aside from renowned lawyering, Darrow unabashedly trumpeted his agnosticism, and enthusiastically engaged in debates outside the courtroom - about free will with a University of Chicago Divinity School theologian (1917); about religion with the famous Catholic apologist G.K. Chesterton in New York City (1931: "Will the World Return to Religion?"), and in general about the nature of humankind.
In the 1920s, Bates College in Lewiston was also in the news.
In 1922, The New York Times pronounced Bates "the power centre of college debating in America" and recounted its many victories over other American colleges. That same year, the world-famous Oxford Union challenged the Bates debate team to cross the Atlantic to debate at Oxford, and then in 1923 Oxford came to Lewiston to debate Bates here. Bates' third president, Gray, was energetic and successful in promoting his college and raising money. In 1926, while speaking to Bates alumni in Chicago (Darrow's home turf), Gray could not resist boasting that the Bates debate team was good enough to debate the agnostic Darrow on the question "Is Man a Mechanism?" (As a Baptist clergyman and theologian, Gray obviously thought the answer was "no.") When Darrow heard of the boast, Darrow issued a debate challenge - not to the Bates debate team, but to Gray himself!
Of course, Gray had to accept. He and Darrow agreed on a two-phase debate for 1927, first in Boston's Symphony Hall on March 16 and second in Portland City Hall's Municipal Auditorium (now known as the Merrill) on March 18.
They chose as their topic the title of a recent popular book by Richard La Rue Swain, "What and Why is Man?" The project attracted a lot of attention. The Feb. 27 Boston Herald recounted a lengthy interview with Gray. The newspaper called Darrow "one of the country's foremost criminal lawyers" and Gray "a thoroughly red-blooded, normal and conservative defender of the faith." It added: "Mr. Darrow will be meeting as a forensic adversary what the Bates boys would tell you is a two-fisted, straight-talking he-president of a college."
The preliminary two-hour debate took place at Symphony Hall on March 16 as scheduled. The next day The New York Times reported that professor Kirkland F. Mather of Harvard's department of geology and geography presided, but "there were no judges and no decision." The March 17 Press Herald was more colorful: "A doubting lawyer, Clarence Darrow of Chicago, arch agnostic of the day, and a college preacher, President Clifton D. Gray of Bates ... crossed forensic lances ... . Though they drove at one another for two hours with logic, wit and evidence, neither was unhorsed nor was decision rendered. If the scholarly shield of Dr. Gray shone with a higher polish, the ironic lance of Mr. Darrow smote with a sharper point."
The next day an advertisement in the March 18 morning Press Herald announced ticket prices ($1-$2, plus tax) and speaking sequence for that evening's debate in Portland.
The succeeding morning's edition, March 19, gave prominent, above-the-fold, Page 1 coverage to what occurred. Next to the photograph it began: "Clarence S. Darrow, bowed with the tragedy of civilization, and Dr. Clifton D. Gray, alert to the glory of civilization, debated the origin and nature of mankind for two hours Friday evening before an audience presided over in the City Hall auditorium by William R. Pattangall, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Maine." The newspaper described Darrow as "the man who fought the late William Jennings Bryan on the right to believe in Evolution."
And Darrow's performance in Portland? According to the newspaper, "the audience leaned forward, tense and expectant, when the famous criminal lawyer, searcher for loop-holes in the law, shuffled forward to the center of the platform. For 40 minutes the listeners sat spell-bound, docile to the persuasion of the master."
Another description: "Coming forward in his turn, after Dr. Gray had outlined the case as he proposed to argue it, Darrow, the defender of cornered criminals, seemed all too inadequate for his part. He allowed the audience to believe him crushed, beaten by the weight of a superior antagonist's argument. If this feeling penetrated, as it apparently did, it was then that the great lawyer in him had scored its first point of many during the evening. Sympathy he sought and he came near, before he uttered a word of plea, to obtaining it. So, he would have played on the feelings of a jury . . . . Had the audience wished to visualize Darrow as he pleaded for Leopold and Loeb before Judge Caverly in Chicago, they had their desire. No art of the lawyer was missing, no attempt to drive home a telling point with emphasis."
High praise, indeed. But at the end of the evening, the Press Herald reported, "The contest of wit and logic rested at the conclusion without decision."
Darrow died in 1938, age 81. He is best captured by a lawyer who practiced with him, but then chose the life of a poet instead. Edgar Lee Masters (of "Spoon River Anthology" fame) said:
"This is Darrow, Inadequately scrawled
With his young, old heart,
And his drawl, his infinite paradox,
And his sadness, and his kindness,
And his artist sense that drives him to shape his life
To something harmonious, even against the schemes of God."
Gray retired as Bates College president in 1944 and died in 1948, age 73. Time magazine's obituary mentioned Gray's 1927 debate with Darrow, saying that Gray "emerged undefeated."
And that is what happened when Clarence Darrow came to Maine.

Texto completo: There are around 3.85 billion women in the world, about half the population. And only five of them have ever been nominated for the directing Oscar.
It's no secret there are no female director nominees this year. There has been only one in the last 11 years (Greta Gerwig for "Lady Bird"). This despite the recent finding of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative that a record number of women made major films in 2019 (the study only concerned the 100 top-grossing films of each of the last 13 years; 1,300 total movies).
Gerwig's "Little Women," Lulu Wang's "The Farewell," Olivia Wilde's "Booksmart," Celine Sciamma's "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," Lorene Scafaria's "Hustlers," Mati Diop's "Atlantics," Alma Har'el's "Honey Boy," Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre's "The Mustang" and Marielle Heller's "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" were among last year's crop of female-directed films to make critics' groups' best-of lists and collect major prizes. But not a directing nomination from the academy.

It's no fluke: 2018 saw Debra Granik's "Leave No Trace," Chloe Zhao's "The Rider," Heller's "Can You Ever Forgive Me?," Tamara Jenkins' "Private Life" and Lynne Ramsay's "You Were Never Really Here," among others, also passed over for Oscar directing love.
Annenberg found that 10.6% of last year's top 100-grossing films were made by women -- a far cry from the 50% that would be representative, but an improvement over the 4.8% average the study found over a 13-year period. The Times wondered if there might be a link between academy voters' perception of women making "Oscar-worthy" films and directors who work with "Oscar-worthy" talent.
We examined the filmographies of the 23 male actors nominated for leading roles in the last five years. We found that out of about 875 theatrical releases (not counting animation or voice-over work) in 38 years, the actors worked with only 60 female directors. Or 6.7%.
So the average performer to reach the height of a lead actor nomination has made more than 40 live-action theatrical features, of which fewer than three were directed by women.
Running the numbers for lead actress nominees from the same period provides a result double the lead actors' average: 12.6% of their films were by female directors. But the nominees' collective resumes differ in notable ways. Three lead actress nominees have appeared in five or fewer films to date -- Cynthia Erivo, Lady Gaga and Yalitza Aparicio. British veteran Charlotte Rampling and French titan Isabelle Huppert have worked primarily in Europe, where Rampling has made 10 of her 95 films with female directors. Huppert has worked on 27 female-directed films out of 120 films. Otherwise, the tallies range from Meryl Streep and Frances McDormand, who each made seven films with female directors, to Ruth Negga and Glenn Close, who have made one apiece.
To be clear, this admittedly limited sample is not meant as an indictment of the actors: It can take decades to reach the point in a career at which an actor can get a movie made, much less select its creative team. And even those blessed with the industry's highest honor have less say over what films get made, and who makes them, than studio executives.
Still, opportunities to encourage change are available for those who look for them. When Tom Hanks read a 2015 article in the New York Times detailing the struggles women directors face, he resolved to seek out more material with female filmmakers. This year his turn as Mr. Rogers in Heller's "Beautiful Day" is the only male performance nominated from a female-directed film. (He's previously worked with Penny Marshall, Nora Ephron, Meg Ryan and Lilly and Lana Wachowski.)
Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio, Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Willem Dafoe, Jonathan Pryce and Daniel Day-Lewis have all worked with Martin Scorsese. Christopher Nolan worked with Casey Affleck, Timothee Chalamet and Matt Damon on "Interstellar" alone. (And with DiCaprio, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman on other films.)
The woman who made the most films featuring a recent lead actor nominee is singer-writer-composer and award-nominated director Giada Colagrande, whose three films therein all star her husband, Dafoe.
One positive thing the data suggests, in line with USC's study: The number of movies made by female directors working with eventual Oscar-nominated male actors is trending upward over time, though at a very slow and extremely inconsistent pace.
The Annenberg findings are encouraging in this regard, and studios such as Universal and STX can boast that 25% of their entire 2019 slates examined by the study were female-directed. Netflix's gigantic roster was 20% female-directed (20% of a lot is a lot). The more female-directed movies, the more chances those directors (and the actors in them) have to impress academy voters.
And the more chances for academy voters to improve on the organization's own five-in-460, or 1.9%, record.

Texto completo: It's a tale of two Orlando no-shows: Jeremy Kittel and the Siberian State Symphony Orchestra. Kittel, the acclaimed violinist, finally made it to Central Florida last weekend. But the Siberian musicians? Well, that's a mystery.
Kittel was scheduled to perform with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra back in April 2018 but had to cancel. It was for a good reason: The musician broke his arm two weeks before the planned concert, and it's no fun fiddling in that condition.
Music director Eric Jacobsen rebooked him in this season's lineup, and Kittel debuted his work "Stones River" at the orchestra's "Sounds of Freedom, Revolution and Joy" concert last weekend. I sat in on a rehearsal before the program so I was among the first to hear "Stones River" - along with the musicians themselves who had played it for the first time the previous evening.
Jacobsen was complimentary of the work, which hauntingly and beautifully weaves classic melodies dating to the Revolutionary War into the composition.
"Jeremy wrote a piece that was absolutely playable immediately," Jacobsen said.
The concerto for orchestra and solo fiddle evokes a sense of nostalgia with a modern edge. In the fiddling, you can hear the rugged outdoors and the tears and pride of the early Americans who made this untamed continent their home.
With Kittel in town, it provided the orchestra with a rare opportunity to get immediate feedback from the composer, a bonus when presenting a world premiere.
"Thoughts?" Jacobsen asked Kittel, after leading the musicians through one section. Kittel advised on the volume of different sections. Later, he helped Jacobsen set the tempo for the piece, calling on the percussionists to propel the beat. "Maybe I'm not doing this right?" Jacobsen asked during a particularly tricky part.
Against the backdrop of the presidential impeachment, "Stones River" seemed to ask deep questions. With Revolution-era piping and the Civil War anthem "Battle Hymn of the Republic" wafting through the air, the thought lingered: What were those Americans fighting for? What does it even mean to fight for freedom? To be American? Powerful stuff from a moving and uniquely American composition.
Meanwhile, John Scott was among those surprised when they arrived at the Bob Carr Theatre on Jan. 25 for a concert by the Siberian State Symphony Orchestra - only to find the musicians weren't there.
"We drove down from Maitland, had dinner and were bummed when the show was cancelled," said Scott, who was attending with his wife. He estimated up to 50 people showed up hoping to hear Tchaikovsky but in vain.
The decision to cancel had just been made a few days before, and seemingly resulted from visa problems, said a spokeswoman for the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, which manages the Bob Carr. Most patrons had learned of the cancellation ahead of time.
Here's what the arts center said happened:
CAMI Music, the orchestra's tour agent, had tried to secure visas for the musicians in November 2019 for a U.S. tour. But in mid-January, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services requested additional documentation, which was provided. As of Jan. 21, however, CAMI still hadn't been given a definitive go-ahead so decided to cancel the beginning dates of the tour, which has dates scheduled through the spring. Among the cancellations: Stops in Opelika and Anniston, Alabama, as well as at The Villages and in Fort Myers.
Representatives from CAMI Music did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages left over several days; perhaps they are still smarting over a 2011 New York Times article pointing out that management companies often "assemble" overseas orchestras with an ever-shifting roster of players who might not represent the best of what a country has to offer.
At any rate, the Dr. Phillips Center said it updated its website, posted notices on social media, emailed and even called some ticket buyers to spread the word.
That doesn't explain why Scott and others didn't get the message, but technology - like the world of touring orchestras - is full of mysteries.

No, Trump is not going to be a dictator

Texto completo: Maybe the most ridiculous if also the most common progressive complaint about Republicans refusing to impeach President Donald Trump is that he now really, truly will see himself as king, that he will behave like a dictator, that he will know he can get away with anything.
What's more, it's said, future presidents will figure on indulging in the same privileges, Congress will be a nothing branch of government, the Constitution will be meaningless and the rule of law will fear to ever enter the Oval Office.
I see this as wrong in several respects and intend to list them. First, let's consider the fact that Trump is maybe the most closely watched president in the history of the country. A book and countless commentaries and news stories have told us how staffers surrounding him on a daily basis don't trust him and try to hem him in. It almost seems like every other person in the White House leaks classified material that could damage him and maybe the nation. In the latest impeachment quest, officials who listen into his phone calls ratted on him to someone who then mistakenly called himself a whistleblower.
Second, we come to something that also intervenes with the supposed boss, namely the administrative state, the bureaucracy that is awfully close in some respects to being the real government of the United States, whoever the president is or whatever Congress does. Here we have people who can sometimes get away with ignoring the president or doing the opposite of what he wants or at least muddling up the implementation.
This is nothing new. It got going with great energy under President Woodrow Wilson, who thought technocrats and intellectuals had all the answers, especially himself. The new way of things was solidified by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Both of these presidents did some pretty horrible things, by the way: Wilson helped get a political opponent imprisoned as he quelled free speech, and FDR stuck American citizens in detention centers for the crime of Japanese heritage.
The great tool of the administrative state is regulations. Some are necessary, of course, but they should be limited and Congress should review them. We now have so many no one can count them and President Barack Obama, far more an autocrat than Trump, loved them as much as executive orders. He set records in the writing of major ones and Trump set records in reducing their number. Congress, which let the regulation overkill happen, has gotten a little more attentive to the issue but its legislative control remains a fraction of what it should be. One Democratic presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren, helped set up a massively interventionist consumer finance agency that got its money from the Federal Reserve, meaning that, when it came to oversight, Congress had no power of the purse.
Courts have the muscle to stymie presidential overreach, and Obama set another record as the Supreme Court kept saying sorry, but you're not getting away with that. Lower federal courts have gone after Trump with a vengeance that too often has had more to do with politics than the law. Here is another means by which his power is limited, if unconstitutionally. One of his greatest achievements, however, is to have given us a bunch of judges who actually believe in the Constitution, both on the Supreme Court and lower courts. It is also said that he has abused executive privilege, but understand that here is a right as precious in many ways as Congress's right to impeach, and courts could have decided the matter.
Understand finally that Democrats in Congress are in no way going to start taking it easy on Trump, looking the other way if they smell something funny. They will come at him on every other move he makes, as will CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post and other aggressive media players that are not about to grow timid because their sense of righteousness has been assaulted. Trump himself may have at last learned a lesson - that you have to stop and listen and learn from others and try to avoid carelessness.

A vaping ban goes up in smoke

Texto completo: THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION'S ban on some of the most popular types of flavored e-cigarettes came into force on Thursday. Except FDA officials want to be clear that it is not technically a ban " it is a 'guidance' on how federal regulators will wield their wide-ranging enforcement powers " which means that the potentially deadly gaps in the policy are not really 'loopholes,' they argue. The FDA, they stress, can use its powers anytime it wants to crack down on any e-cigarette product that seems to be marketed to or hooking children, whether or not it was specifically mentioned in the enforcement policy.
They will have to do just that " and soon " because teenagers could drive a truck full of Juul cartridges through the exceptions and limitations in the FDA's 'guidance.'
Originally, back in September, President Trump indicated that the FDA would halt sales of e-cigarette products in every flavor but tobacco. Along with a shockingly rapid spike in teenage vaping, recent surveys showed that youths were drawn to fruit and candy flavorings. As e-cigarette manufacturers such as Juul began withdrawing products so obviously designed to appeal to children, teenagers took up vaping mint-flavored e-cigarette pods. Mr. Trump's initial proposal to permit the sale only of tobacco-flavored products, which would repel teenage palates but be acceptable to adult smokers trying to quit, was a suitably aggressive move to keep some e-cigarette options open to quitters without attracting millions of curious children.
Then Mr. Trump reversed course after conservative activists and industry representatives complained " and as political advisers warned him not to anger a passionate vaping community. The FDA revealed last month that it would continue to allow tobacco- and menthol-flavored pods to be sold. More concerning, whole classes of vaping products would be exempt. Vape shops could continue to sell e-liquids for refillable e-cigarettes in any flavor. Disposable e-cigarette manufacturers, too, would have wide latitude.
At the time, the FDA argued that its policy would crack down on the products that regulators knew teenagers were using. But preferences can change quickly. The New York Times reported in January anecdotal accounts of teenagers ditching Juul devices and moving en masse to disposable devices packed with e-liquids in flavors such as banana ice, sour gummy and cool mint. The question is whether federal regulators will keep up with changing preferences.
The FDA should not have allowed disposable, candy-flavored e-cigarettes to continue to be sold. Regulators should not wait until there is enough youth survey data telling them what should have been obvious in the first place: Easy-to-use, easy-to-conceal products such as disposable vapes in candy flavorings will attract children " and create new addicts. Waiting for more evidence that these products are hooking children would imply that it is acceptable for public health officials to sit back and watch while new addictions multiply.
It is already time for the FDA to announce a stronger crackdown.

Africa, the Motherland

Texto completo: It is the continent that is most maligned, misunderstood and mocked. To a lot of the world, it is the "dark continent." But to me, it is a home of hope. On the 60th anniversary of the Year of Africa, I'm reflecting on this.
Sixty years ago was yesterday. When we think of history, we tend to picture a long time ago, before planes and cars and electricity. We think of grainy black-and-white photos and muskets.
The fact that countries all over Africa will be celebrating 60 years of independence in 2020 is mind-boggling. My mother is turning 65 this year, 18 days after Nigeria, my motherland. She's older than the country she's from! She's older than the green-white-green flag, the anthem, the coat of arms. (No shade, Mom! You still look super young.)
History is yesterday and now, especially regarding racism, colonialism and apartheid. And as we commemorate this year, I remember that the place considered the birthplace of humankind has some of the youngest independent countries in the world. That's a mind scam.
What I think of is the unmitigated gall of imperialism, colonialism and white supremacy. For a long time, Africa was seen as a place to be conquered -- and Europeans ran through it, drawing arbitrary borders and planting flags. History is crowded with people who showed up and grabbed land, like a Monopoly game with real-life countries. But those countries eventually fought back and insisted on their own autonomy -- and succeeded in getting it.
Over 12 months, 17 countries on the continent became free of their European colonizers. Four countries -- Benin, Niger, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast -- became independent in the course of a single week (Aug. 1 to Aug. 7). That's a continental independence festival! It was an Afro-pendence party! A decolonization soirée!
I am inspired by seeing how swiftly change can happen, when we unite as a Voltron squad of noir pixie dust. When we think about the forces we face today and the systems of oppression that cuff us, they seem too big to fight at times.
Unfortunately, the effects of white supremacy lingered after the laws that codified it had been repealed. Independence did not mark the end of imperialism on the continent, of course. France and Britain didn't pack their duffels and leave the keys on the counter. They kept their grasp on the economies of many of the countries they had just "released."
Such lingering effects -- not to mention white supremacy -- aren't exclusive to black people in Africa, though.
In his book "The Fate of Africa," Martin Meredith recounts a story from the Ghanaian independence celebration in 1957, which was attended by Richard M. Nixon, the American vice president at the time. According to Mr. Meredith, Mr. Nixon slapped a black man on the shoulder and asked him what it was like to be free. The man replied: "I wouldn't know, sir. I'm from Alabama."
So, wherever we are, we should fight for each other, celebrate each other and share the lessons we're learning when we win. We are all still struggling for our basic rights, in different corners of the world we inhabit.
In that spirit, I was excited to see Pan-Africanism take center stage in 2019, as it did in the 1960s. Last year was declared the Year of Return, in which hundreds of thousands of people around the world traveled to Ghana to commemorate 400 years since the first ship with enslaved Africans arrived in what is now Virginia.
Then as now, Pan-Africanism beats the drum of insisting that no matter where we are around the world, people of African descent have parallel struggles, shared culture and an obligation to come together for our greater good. It is especially relevant when we realize that, from the United States to South Africa to Brazil, black people are constantly fighting for equality.
The drum is beating once more.
I choose to be as optimistic as the people in these pictures, brimming with anticipation of a new day, full of potential for progress. My girl in this polka-dot dress and peep-toe shoes is a whole mood, and the people around her are the party posse of promise. That's how I look at the future of the various lands in Africa. Even through the hills and valleys, the wars and the times of peace.

Texto completo: SHANGHAI - A U.S. citizen died from the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, American officials said Saturday. It was the first known American death from the illness and was likely to add to diplomatic friction over Beijing's response to the epidemic.
The death is also certain to raise questions over whether the Trump administration and the State Department in particular have taken sufficient action to ensure the safety of Americans in China and to aid in the evacuation of those who want to leave.
In a statement, the State Department took a defensive tone, saying that since Jan. 29, it had evacuated about 850 people, mostly Americans, on five charter flights out of Wuhan.
The agency said it had "no higher priority than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad," but there are no current plans to conduct additional evacuation flights, even as some Americans in other parts of China have been asking for the U.S. government to evacuate them.
Mainland China reported the virus death toll has risen to 811, surpassing SARS fatalities in the 2002-03 outbreak.
China's National Health Commission said the total cases of the new virus have increased to to 37,198.
The outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 worldwide. Like the new virus, it also originated in China.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have been tense for years over issues including trade, technology and human rights. While Chinese officials have touted the importance of international cooperation to combat the virus, doubts have arisen in recent days about China's willingness to accept a helping hand - particularly from the United States.
Although some Trump administration officials have privately expressed skepticism over China's handling of the outbreak, President Donald Trump himself lavished praise on Chinese leaders Friday. He told reporters in Washington that he had spoken with President Xi Jinping of China on the telephone late Thursday.
"They're working really hard, and I think they're doing a very professional job," Mr. Trump said.
Few details about the American, who died on Thursday, were immediately available. According to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the person was 60 years old and died at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, the inland metropolis at the center of the epidemic. Two people familiar with the matter said the person was a woman and had underlying health conditions.
It was not clear whether the woman had tried to leave the city on any of the flights organized by the State Department.

Texto completo: The recipe for a best picture Oscar nomination couldn't be simpler. Step one: Craft a movie that positively idolizes or mythologizes the film industry and . . . that's it! One instruction. Fewer than required to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Dig through the nine movies up for the top prize this year, and you'll find two with a direct relationship to Tinseltown. Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' might present an alternate history of the Manson Family murders, but make no mistake that it's a straight ode to old Hollywood, fueled by a 1966 Cadillac Coupe de Ville's tankful of nostalgia. Meanwhile, in its own roundabout way, Noah Baumbach's 'Marriage Story' lauds the idea of following the acting bug across the country to Los Angeles despite how complicated life might become as a result.
The academy body has long had a squishy spot for movies about movies and moviemaking, one that has softened so much as of late it's become downright marshmallowian. As Ben Zauzmer noted in the New York Times, before 2003, 2.3-percent of Oscar-nominated films were about Hollywood in some capacity; since then, 10.2 percent have been . Recent history is full of examples: 2012's best picture winner 'The Artist,' 2013's top crown 'Argo'; and 2017's runner-up 'La La Land.' Bathe the town in a nice light these days, and, as the analogy goes, the academy transforms into a helpless moth.
While the sheer magnitude of the academy's love of self-mythologizing films might be a product of this millennium, Hollywood's love affair with itself spans more than a century.
'Since the nineteen-teens, since the beginning of Hollywood, we've had films about Hollywood,' said Jonathan Kuntz, film historian and lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Theater, Film and Television, adding that the silent era was peppered with films about people trying to break into the industry. The trend has continued ever since. That, Kuntz noted, is not surprising. 'It's what they know best. You're supposed to write what you know.'
It certainly doesn't hurt that audiences also tend to fall for movies about Tinseltown. The place is 'a glamour capitol of the world, so it's an attractive subject,' Kuntz said. 'And Hollywood filmmakers can at least purport to give an insider's view of how the whole thing actually works.'
The industry eventually began to treat movies about movies as a mirror to (mostly) admire and (occasionally) criticize itself. By the 1950s, 'reverential' biopics of Hollywood icons were all the rage, Kuntz said, while the 1970s and 1980s brought a 'more cynical view' with movies including 'Hollywood Shuffle,' 'The Day of the Locust' and 'The Stunt Man.'
But, perhaps accounting for the emphatic return to self-adulating films, critical looks at Hollywood aren't usually nominated for Oscars. Robert Altman's 1992 satire 'The Player' probably came closest, earning a best director nod, though there's a solid chance the honor had little to do with the movie itself. Though it was critically acclaimed, so were many of Altman's films. The academy appeared to be playing catch-up, trying to reward someone it had mostly ignored.
And there's certainly a lot of material to work with. Like any institution, the academy and the body it represents " Hollywood " have a complicated history, to use everyone's favorite euphemism for 'deeply problematic.' In just this past decade, #OscarsSoWhite called the academy out for a shocking lack of racial representation, while #MeToo exposed Hollywood's fostering of a culture of sexual abuse and harassment.
The frustrating irony is that these are the exact sort of difficult and complicated issues artists often interrogate through film. The academy loves movies exposing corrupt or problematic practices, unless those movies happen to focus on corrupt or problematic practices in Hollywood . Take 'Bombshell,' which explores the Fox News sexual harassment scandal that ousted founder Roger Ailes, for example. It's up for three Oscars this year.
Movies like 'Bombshell' will probably be made (at least, eventually) about both Hollywood's and the academy's recent controversies, but will they be recognized at the Oscars? It seems unlikely. These days, after all, movies like 'La La Land,' 'Hugo' and 'Argo' " ones that venerate the industry " receive the attention.
Perhaps no film sums this up better than 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.' The movie deserves to be rewarded for its excellent craft, but what probably compelled the academy to nominate it for 10 Oscars is how it presents Hollywood. The movie spends more than two hours romanticizing the movie industry of the 1960s before ending with a drunken has-been actor stopping a tragedy that's long been a stain on the town's reputation: the murders of Sharon Tate and four others.
A movie that both sentimentalizes Tinseltown and erases one of its darkest tragedies? Well, that's just a recipe well made.

Texto completo: WEATHER
By Jenny Offill
Knopf, 224 pp. $23.95
Jenny Offill's experimental 2014 novel, “Department of Speculation," catapulted her from relative obscurity to the rarefied world of fame and acclaim. Named one of the top 10 books of the year by the New York Times Book Review, nominated for numerous awards, a national bestseller, “Speculation" was a most improbable, and delightful, of literary success stories. Offill's new novel, “Weather," is similarly tiny in size and immense in scope, radically disorienting yet reassuringly humane, strikingly eccentric and completely irresistible.
Offill's novels are slim and spare, told in bursts and fragments and bits. They lack conventional structures, traditional suspense or straightforward characterization. Their narrative style is casual and seemingly incidental. They are comprised of everything from jokes to excerpts from other books to random observations about the subway, people's clothing, and the weather.
“Weather" is deployed in the full panoply of its literal and figurative meanings here. Trump's election signals an ominous change in the weather. Climate change looms large as an enormous source of anxiety. Clouds of worry, fear, and pessimism flit across the character's minds. Sudden storms and tempests large and small upend their sense of self, threaten to destroy their relationships, destabilize them. In the midst of this tumult, there is also the unexpected sunlight of empathy, connection, and tenderness.
“Weather" is narrated by Lizzie, a middle-aged New York City librarian who dropped out of graduate school with half a completed dissertation in order to care for her drug-addicted brother, Henry. Her former academic mentor, Sylvia, pulled strings to get Lizzie the library position even though she lacked the proper credentials. Through her job and her apartment building, Lizzie engages with a host of colorful characters: “cranky professors" — from a recovering alcoholic with tenure to a “doomed adjunct" who sells his plasma to pay the bills — from the drug-dealer in Apt 5C to the New York Times-loathing and hate-mongering Mrs. Kovinski , from homeless people to a kindly car service driver whose business she may be single-handedly keeping afloat. “Regular life [has] become more fragmented and bewildering" for all of them.
Used as an expert, a confessor, a “fake shrink" by her patrons, her neighbors, and her family members, Lizzie is used to doling out advice, bolstering depressives, assuaging fear, solving problems. So when Sylvia, an expert on climate change who's launched a podcast called “Hell and High Water," asks her to take on the job of answering her e-mail, the position seems like a natural fit. Soon she is contending with an onslaught of letters, from left-wingers terrified about climate change to right-wingers certain the end of the world is near.
But if Lizzie is a competent and compassionate caretaker, she's also anxious and struggling, oppressed and exhausted. Her “#1 fear is the acceleration of days"; parenting her young son, Eli, involves “trying to undo the rush" of his growing up in a culture of ambitious striving and a cutthroat educational system. She's got a bum knee, an aging mother with infected and crumbling teeth whose generosity to the less fortunate exceeds her small “fixed income," and a classicist husband who couldn't get an academic job so ended up designing educational video games. Her brother has been doing better, but a hasty marriage to his pregnant girlfriend and the birth of their daughter have threatened his fragile equilibrium.
Offill's characters turn to an array of coping strategies — some genuinely helpful and restorative, others counterproductive and addictive — for the dreariness and dread, anxiety and anguish that permeate their days. Lizzie binge-watches disaster movies and reality shows, Googles “prepper things" and makes plans for her doomstead, and reluctantly begins attending a meditation class. (Offill is brilliant on the allure and hypocrisies of commodified Buddhism.) Ben turns to the classical literature he once studied and takes to intricate woodworking. Henry attends 12-step meetings, plays video games, and relapses, getting high and cheating on his wife with an ex-girlfriend.
Eventually, Lizzie falls into an emotional affair with a sexy, free-spirited journalist named Will, who's just back from Syria, “firmly in the school of whatever gets you through the night," and a patient listener to her rants about “the coming chaos" and riffs on useful skills to survive the apocalypse. As she “blather[s] on about Zazen," he offers her a naturally Zen outlook and rakish nonchalance that are increasingly rare in her turbulent and troubled world.
Lizzie is what we might call a co-dependent, or a hypochondriac, or a paranoid worrier. She's chided for her “enmeshment" with her brother, and Ben grows increasingly weary as his wife tips into obsession. But she is also all of us; she embodies in exaggerated or extreme form the fears, consuming preoccupations, and anxieties that beset so many in this most uncertain and frightening of times. And her kindness, her generosity of spirit, her desire to help despite being uneasy with typical modes of activism endear her to us again and again.
A narrator and a novel that hum with anxiety and pulse with dread are nonetheless hilarious, warm, and lovable. Both ruefully mordant and strangely consoling, “Weather" is at once brutal in its unsparing honesty and utterly exhilarating in its wit and intelligence. It radiates with the beleaguered yet buoyant optimism, the luminous integrity, of a supple and fearless writer.

Texto completo: The clothing company fired the photographer after comments he made about a 2018 bridge collapse that killed 43 people raised protests.
For decades, the photographer Oliviero Toscani helped make Benetton clothing a huge name. He did it with so-called shockvertising: provocative, socially progressive ads that spurred outrage and drew headlines, whether they involved an AIDS patient on his deathbed, Mafia vendettas, horses copulating or two actors depicting a priest and a nun kissing.
But on Thursday, Benetton decided that Mr. Toscani, who had returned in 2017 as the creative director after a hiatus in the early 2000s, had gone too far.
The company fired Mr. Toscani, 77, over comments he made about the 2018 collapse of the Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, that killed 43 people.
The company and its chairman, Luciano Benetton, "completely disassociates itself from Mr. Toscani's remarks," the brand said in statement, while "renewing their sincere closeness to the families of the victims and to all those who have been involved in this terrible tragedy."
Benetton is the principal shareholder in Atlantia, the holding company that controls Autostrade per l'Italia, or Highways for Italy, which managed the bridge as well as more than half of Italy's 4,000 miles of toll roads.
During a radio interview earlier this week, Mr. Toscani said, "Who cares that a bridge collapsed?" He was explaining why Fabrica, Benetton's creative studio in the Veneto, should not be conflated with Autostrade. "Enough already."
The radio's host quickly intervened, noting: "The people who died, for example, cared." Mr. Toscani added, "This story doesn't interest me."
Two days later, an unusually contrite Mr. Toscani said on Twitter that his comments had been taken out of context. In an interview on another radio program he said that he was "destroyed and truly sorry."
That did little to quell the anger at the photographer from families of the victims, lawmakers of all political stripes and many other Italians.
"Forty-three innocent victims may have counted little for him, but for us they were everything," Egle Possetti, the president of a committee commemorating the Morandi Bridge victims, told the news agency ANSA this week.
The hashtag #ANointeressa, or #Wecare, hit social media along with calls to boycott Benetton.
Soon afterward, the Benetton Group issued the statement, acknowledging "the impossibility of continuing the professional relationship with its creative director."
The Benetton family had come under fire after the bridge collapsed on Aug. 14, 2018, for what was perceived as indifference to the tragedy: They waited two days and then responded through Edizione, the family holding company, with a statement expressing "deep sympathy" for the victims.
Gilberto Benetton, one of the founders of the company, said in one of his last interviews -- he died in October 2018 -- that the silence had been a sign of respect.
But the absence of immediate response was seen as a rare misstep by the media-savvy family, and may have prompted Mr. Toscani's abrupt dismissal Thursday.
For much of the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Toscani's shock-and-thought-provoking ads helped turn the small family company into an international powerhouse with thousands of stores throughout the world. He was not worried about pushing the envelope.
"Creativity is not based on security," Mr. Toscani said in a 1995 interview with The New York Times. "Once you're secure, you're doing something that's already been done."
But even as the company broke barriers, by using images of racially diverse couples and gay families, Mr. Toscani's ads frequently crossed lines. He left the company in 2000 after an ad campaign with photographs of American inmates on death row caused an uproar, especially in the United States.
He returned as art director of Benetton in 2017 and lost no time regaining notoriety after the company repurposed two photographs from 2018 migrant rescue operations by the Franco-German charity SOS Méditerranée for an advertising campaign.
Coming at a time when migration had become a contentious topic throughout Europe, the ad campaign drew protests and criticism that Benetton was insensitive to the thousands of migrants who drown each year during the perilous Mediterranean crossing.
Though Mr. Toscani courted controversy for years, in the end he appeared to have been ousted not for one of his provocative campaigns but because of a spontaneous remark. One made at a time when fashion brands are increasingly being called out on social media for perceived bad behavior, and many consumers are no longer willing to tolerate what they see as insensitivity.
The #Wecare campaign had been spearheaded by Giovanni Toti, the president of the Liguria Region, of which Genoa is the capital, who had been outraged by Mr. Toscani's "obscene words."
"We did it because families of the 43 victims deserve respect and justice," he wrote in a statement issued Thursday evening.

Texto completo: THE WORLD OF fiction is obsessed with things that actually happened.
A good deal of movies contending for the 2020 Oscars are based on historical events, keeping with a seemingly ever-growing trend in the entertainment industry. Martin Scorsese's “The Irishman" depicts a legendary mobster, “Ford v. Ferrari" narrates the competition between two automobile giants, and “Bombshell" is based on the accounts of several women at Fox News who were sexually harassed by the late Roger Ailes.
In “Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino mixes fictional and historical characters. Cynthia Erivo received two nominations for “Harriet," a biopic about the abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman. “The Two Popes" dramatizes a succession at the helm of the Catholic Church whose real consequences are still unfolding. Greta Gerwig injected a bit of realism in her adaption of Louisa May Alcott's “Little Women" by turning the movie into a meta-fiction (technically a poioumenon) about the process of creating the novel itself. Sam Mendes's war movie “1917" relates to historical events in an even more intimate way: Core parts of the story come from tales that the director heard from his grandfather, a World War I veteran.
An unfathomable number of movies, TV series, and plays based on actual events have flooded the market, matching a burgeoning appetite for plots hinged on historical facts. Even Terrence Malick, arguably one of the most abstract directors around, made a 2019 movie based on the real story of an Austrian peasant refusing to serve in the Nazi army during World War II.
From the beginning, Hollywood has relied on events that really occurred. The silent movie “Saved from the Titanic " was released in the United States just 29 days after the ocean liner sank. It featured a survivor of the tragedy, the actress Dorothy Gibson, playing a fictionalized version of herself. The “based on a true story" trope was familiar enough in 1996 that the Coen Brothers mocked it by claiming that their movie “Fargo" was based on an actual criminal case and that they told it “exactly as it occurred." Although two aspects of the movie (including the unforgettable wood-chipper episode) had real-life inspirations, the story was made up. The Coens said they just wanted to make something “in the genre of a true story movie."
But lately the based-on-a-true-story genre has risen to a new level of sophistication. Works of art rely on documentary techniques, claiming to accurately portray historical events. Distributors and publishers take great care to inform viewers about the factuality of a movie or TV show. The standard note on film posters is often enhanced with qualifiers: based on the “incredible," “harrowing," “impossible," “triumphant" true story, as if this very fact increases the work's intrinsic value. No producer sells a plot by saying it's “based on an incredibly ingenious fictional story." Some relationship to veracity is a highly marketable feature.
Why do we care so much whether a story is rooted in real events or is purely fictional? What difference does it make if a narrative intended for artistic purposes relies on facts or is entirely the result of a creative process?
Sarah Doole, director of global drama at Fremantle, a London-based TV production company, says the public's hunger for true stories is reshaping her company's strategy for the dramas it produces. She suggests that demand is surging because of the concurrent rise of fake news and disinformation. “People are looking for some truth in life, and they trust TV drama to deliver that," Doole said.
The success of the based-on-a-true-story model hints at a paradox, because the great invasion of reality could be fueling our inability to grasp the truth. We all know that based-on-a-true-story movies take a lot of liberties with the facts. But if we value stories more, or differently, if they have even a loose connection with circumstances that actually occurred, we're flattening the notion of truth and diminishing the power of fiction.
Strictly speaking, to say a narrative is “true" means that it sticks to a set of facts that can be independently established and described. Freddy Mercury's life is a historical reality that may be examined through documents and witnesses, and then turned into a biopic aiming to adhere as much as possible to the main facts, as director Bryan Singer did in his visually magnificent “Bohemian Rhapsody." This definition of the truth is akin to the one used in scientific inquiry.
In a larger sense, however, the term “true" alludes to the meaning of a story. A great novel is also true in that it communicates meaningful things about the human experience. Literature masterpieces stand the test of time precisely because they convey those things through generations and changing social circumstances. This conception of the truth has to do with “the old verities and truths of the heart" William Faulkner referred to in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1950. Without these “universal truths," Faulkner stated, “any story is ephemeral and doomed." Historical accuracy is utterly irrelevant to this notion of the truth.
In some ways the “based on a true story" fetish is old-fashioned. In the 19th century, Western literature mostly leaned on realism. When Faulkner and other novelists of the 20th century abandoned that literary paradigm, they did not surrender their quest for truth. As Salman Rushdie noted, artists who broke with the realist consensus “created stranger, more surreal texts, telling the truth by means of obvious untruth, creating a new kind of reality, as if by magic." The based-on-a-true-story ecosystem emphasizes a shallow connection with reality while depressing the deeper, symbolical association with meaning.
There's a predictable objection to these arguments. How does the supposed resurgence of realism fit with the Marvel phenomenon and the endless flow of franchise movies? One possible answer hints at a peculiar sort of polarization. Like the political spectrum, the narrative landscape is sharply split into two camps. On one side stands narrow realism; on the other, pure fantasy. And just like in politics, extremes hold some concealed commonalities. What “true" stories and the Avengers have in common is the tendency to downplay the dimension of meaning, either by focusing on mindless entertainment or by appealing to factuality as the main source of artistic value.
In a widely discussed op-ed in The New York Times, Martin Scorsese argued that franchise movies are not cinema: “What's not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes," he wrote. But a similar case could be made about some films based on true stories. “Tolkien" a biopic about the author of “The Lord of the Rings," meticulously retraced the formative years of his life, and the director, Dome Karukoski, conducted extensive research on the subject before filming. And yet, “the result doesn't rise above the insight of a Wikipedia page," as David Sims charitably wrote in The Atlantic. An accurately researched biopic can be as meaningless as the latest Spider-Man sequel (or prequel). The difference is that Tolkien's film comes off as naturally endowed with higher cinematic dignity because it traffics in actual events.
That's not to say true stories are necessarily hollow or evanescent. While some of them are “ephemeral and doomed," as Faulkner put it, others touch the most intimate depths of the human soul, and they will undoubtedly last. It's just that the fact they are historically based does not say much about their artistic value. Instead, the implicit tenet of today's realist resurgence is that factuality is in and of itself a virtue, and it claims as proof that viewers' engagement increases when they know they are exposed to a real-life narrative.
A movie that doesn't aim for the “verities of the heart" and is content with the veracity of the story is an impoverished form of art. It's closer to the spirit of superheroes and CGI fiction than is generally thought. After all, what's the most superficial, predictable, trivial, and disposable form of TV entertainment? It's called a reality show.

Texto completo: In a first, videos outnumbered photos in reports to the authorities last year. Facebook found the most imagery, the bulk of it on its Messenger app.
The number of reported photos, videos and other materials related to online child sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent last year, an indication that many of the world's biggest technology platforms remain infested with the illegal content.
Nearly 70 million images and videos were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for the imagery that works with law enforcement agencies.
The record number was driven by a surge in illegal videos, which have always been popular among sexual predators but are now more readily detected by some companies. Over 41 million videos were reported; the number five years ago was under 350,000. The companies flagged many of the same images and videos multiple times as they were shared among users.
The center identified to The New York Times the companies that had detected the imagery, the first time detailed company information had been released.
Facebook reported nearly 60 million photos and videos, more than 85 percent of the total. The number reflects both its immense user base and its aggressive approach to routing out the material, but shows that offenders continue to exploit the platform. About half of the content was not necessarily illegal, according to the company, and was reported to help law enforcement with investigations. Instagram, owned by Facebook, was responsible for an additional 1.7 million photos and videos.
In a statement, Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, said "the size and expertise of our team, together with our sophisticated technology, have made us industry leaders in detecting, removing and reporting these images, and thwarting people from sharing them."
"We will continue to develop the best solutions to keep more children safe," she added.
Snapchat, Twitter and other social media companies also submitted reports of imagery. So did companies whose services include search engines and cloud storage, including Google and Microsoft. Apple, Dropbox and the chat platform Discord also detected the illegal content.
In all, 164 companies submitted reports.
"These numbers show that any service provider that allows individuals to host images and videos are susceptible to child sexual exploitation material being posted," said John Shehan, a vice president at the national center.
He confirmed the numbers released on Friday reflected all content reported to the center, including material that "may not meet the legal definition of child pornography."
Still, the numbers do not paint a complete picture of the problem: The industry has been plagued by uneven and inconsistent detection practices, as The Times reported last year. Some cloud storage services, including those owned by Amazon and Microsoft, do not scan for any of the illegal content at all, while other companies, like Snap, scans for photos but not videos.
The data shows broad disparities in the tech industry. Google reported more than 3.5 million combined images and videos; Yahoo more than two million; and Imgur, a photo-sharing site, more than 260,000. Dropbox, Microsoft, Snap and Twitter are the only other companies that reported more than 100,000 images and videos last year.
Apple reported dramatically fewer images than most other tech giants, just over 3,000 in total, and zero videos. These figures reflect the company's inability to scan material sent through its messaging app, which is encrypted, as well as the fact that it does not scan its file storage service, iCloud. Amazon, whose cloud services handle millions of uploads and downloads every second, sent no images or videos to the national center.
Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who has sponsored child protection legislation and was recently part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who asked 36 tech companies to detail their efforts in this area, called the numbers "appalling and astonishing."
"The disparate data reported here shows that we clearly cannot rely on tech companies to self-police," he said.
Alex Stamos, who served as chief of information security at both Facebook and Yahoo, said the numbers were a reflection of companies that have put more effort into finding and removing the material from their platforms.
"I hope these numbers encourage people to do more, not less," Mr. Stamos said.
Last year, there was actually a decrease in the total number of reports filed with the national center, falling to 16.9 million from 18.4 million in 2018. That was at least in part because tech companies improved their reporting process by bundling photos and videos instead of flagging them individually.
A single report usually includes multiple photos and videos -- for example, when the material is found in someone's email account -- so the overall growth in reported imagery may signal "those that are sharing it are sharing in larger volumes," said Mr. Shehan of the national center.
Some companies that made a small number of reports ended up finding a large volume of imagery. Dropbox, for instance, made roughly 5,000 reports last year but found over 250,000 photos and videos. For victims of child sexual abuse, the recirculating imagery can cause lasting trauma. Online offenders are known to seek out children in the photos and videos, even into adulthood. Victims, or the parents of abused minors, also receive legal notices when their images are found during investigations, serving as constant reminders of their pain.
"To know that these images are online and that other people are enjoying your degradation for sexual gratification in some ways means you are forever being abused," said Alicia Kozakiewicz, a survivor of child sexual abuse who has been a longtime internet safety educator.
The growth in reported imagery, however, does not offer insights into whether more of the illegal content is being newly produced and posted online. Most imagery is detected by tech companies through automated scans that only recognize previously flagged material. And detecting videos, which last year for the first time surpassed the number of photos, is particularly difficult because the industry lacks a common standard for identifying them.
The number of reported videos spiked in 2018 when Facebook ramped up its detection efforts. The company was responsible for more than 90 percent of reports that year, according to law enforcement officials.
The continued growth in reported images from Facebook is sure to increase pressure on the company, which has been generally lauded for finding and reporting the content, but announced last year that it intended to encrypt its Messenger app. In 2019, Messenger was responsible for over 80 percent of all reports made by Facebook. Encryption would make it much more difficult to detect the illegal imagery on Messenger, which was also the largest source of reported material in 2018.
In September, The Times reported that the number of reports to the national center had grown exponentially, and that the federal response was lacking despite a 2008 law meant to address what was then called an "epidemic." Throughout the country, law enforcement groups charged with investigating the crimes have been overwhelmed.
Legislation introduced in December would extend the length of time companies are required to retain information about illegal imagery in order to give law enforcement more opportunity to investigate. A bipartisan group of lawmakers said the bill was in response to a Times investigation revealing that cases often went cold after companies deleted the data. A draft of other proposed legislation is aimed at making companies follow a set of best practices to police imagery on their platforms or risk greater legal liability.
Even as the number of reported images and videos continues to grow, it remains difficult to assess the scope of the problem. While more companies are making efforts to detect the content, encrypted technologies and the dark web allow predators to continue trading imagery in secret.
"If all of the companies involved were looking as aggressively as Facebook, that number of reports could be 50 million or 100 million," Mr. Stamos said.

Texto completo: 17 African countries declared independence in 1960. Archival photographs capture the mood of the period 60 years later.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Seventeen African countries shed their colonial status in 1960, what's known as The Year of Africa. Sixty years later, a special section from Past Tense, an archival storytelling project at The Times, looked at the birth of a new era. "A Continent Remade" paired photography from The Times's archive and other collections with writers and thinkers of African descent.
Below is a conversation with Veronica Chambers, the editor of Past Tense, which has been lightly condensed and edited.
The portraiture and news photography are so expressive and layered. What is your favorite photo of the collection?

I have several favorites. I think the mother and baby picture on Page 6 and the Miss Independence picture on Page 51 were really important to me because those were the two I found first, in October 2018. I held onto those two pictures as a kind of proof of concept. It wasn't really until about three months ago that we really dug into the project. I also love the picture at the United Nations by Sam Falk on Page 41. He's so special to the history of The Times and just to know what it must have meant for those men to be able to go and represent new nations. To say, "Our country is three months old and here we are. Let's talk about how we fit into the rest of the world." I think that's pretty powerful.

Can you speak to the decision to have more youthful writers be a part of the project -- people that may not have experienced the independence movement but benefited from it?

We really wanted a certain dynamism to the conversation. And we thought that it would be interesting to ask youngish people who are really connected to the continent in interesting ways and who have a sense of pride about it. David Adjaye, for example, spent years cataloging the architecture of Africa in a way that had never been done before. But he grew up half his life off the continent. There's always a period of discovery for someone who has a foot in a country, but didn't necessarily grow up there. And especially because the countries are so young, it felt like it'd be interesting to ask these young people who in some ways really benefited from all of the good of independence -- their lives were shaped by everything that came after -- to look at the pictures and respond.

There's no visual representation of conflict in the section, despite some of these countries still being entrenched in conflict. Can you talk about the decision to focus on the celebration of independence rather than the hardships?

I think that because of the photos that we found, like the photo of the mother and baby, Miss Independence, and photos like Kwame Nkrumah (the first president of Ghana) dancing with Queen Elizabeth II, there was a slow snowball into an aesthetic. And the aesthetic of the portraits is really well known. Photographers like Malick Sidibé have gotten such acclaim. So I felt like marrying the portraits with more news photography; it felt like a balance. And in some ways the news photographs are also portraits. We see Jackie Kennedy, John F. Kennedy and Dag Hammarskjöld -- the leaders of the time, which is really interesting. So portraits became a theme as opposed to conflict photography, which would have been something else entirely.

What's something you learned throughout putting the project together?
As we went along, we asked, why was there such rich photography from this moment? Does it correlate with the Kodak camera and all that sort of stuff? A lot of the studios really popped up around the idea that if you have a new nation, you need an ID card for the new nation. So people would go get an ID card, but then the photographer would have other props. I like this sense of, O.K., we're here to do something very rudimentary and quotidian like get an ID but we're going to make a moment of it. To me, that shows so much of the style and energy of the continent, which I think is pretty extraordinary.

What do you hope readers take away from the section?

Well, a couple of things. We are really hoping that people on the continent will read the digital version and we've worked really hard on the interactive. When you look at the news photographs, it was a time when very few New York Times readers would have been to the continent. And so when we look at where we are at 60 years later, there's still a lot of people who have never been and may never go. And it's really hard to make good news the news that leads. And so what I hope that readers will take from it is a sense of possibility on the continent that I believe continues to this day. A sense of beauty, a sense of community. And I hope, interest: I hope they will continue to read some of the writers that we have. It's really hard to capture a continent, and 17 countries and 50 pages, but I hope that it whets readers' appetites for more.

Texto completo: PHANTOM LADY: Hollywood Producer Joan Harrison, the Forgotten Woman Behind Hitchcock by Christina Lane (Chicago Review Press, 400 pp., $30)
A ghost comes to vibrant life in Christina Lane's "Phantom Lady: Hollywood Producer Joan Harrison, the Forgotten Woman Behind Hitchcock."
Harrison is the ghost, or the titular phantom. Aside from film buffs and scholars, few know of her work. Yet Lane, chairwoman of the cinema department at the University of Miami, claims Harrison is "one of the last great untold stories of the classical Hollywood era." Lane's keenly observed and illuminating biography backs that assertion.
Nothing was spectral about Harrison's life and career. Growing up in Guildford, Surrey, after World War I, she was an energetic, assertive and talented young Englishwoman. At 15, she published film reviews. After schooling at the Sorbonne, then Oxford University, she wrote short stories. She also read voraciously - mysteries, horror stories and true crime tales.
In late 1933, Harrison, then 26, answered an ad for an assistant that rising film director Alfred Hitchcock had posted. After a brief interview, Hitchcock hired Harrison to join him at Gaumont-British Picture Corporation.
While she may occasionally have poured Hitchcock tea and jotted notes, Harrison from the start played an active role in shaping his films. A master of control as well as suspense, Hitchcock nevertheless drew upon Harrison's keen sense of film narratives. "Her sensibilities," Lane writes, "would help lay the foundation for Hitchcock's overall cinematic approach."
Working with the director's wife, Alma Reville, Harrison bolstered the female roles in "Young and Innocent" (1937) and "The Lady Vanishes" (1938), turning the films into tales of "spirited heroines who seek adventure, truth, and justice and are willing to act on their convictions."
Hitchcock insisted Harrison stay beside him when he came to the United States. Here she challenged producer David O. Selznick to transform the heroine of "Rebecca" (1940) played by Joan Fontaine from a mousy naif to an often assertive heroine. Not only did Harrison earn a screenwriting Oscar nomination that year for "Rebecca," but a second nod for Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent" (1940).
However happy Harrison was as part of the Hitchcock entourage, she struck out on her own in 1943, to produce and write screenplays. She signed on at Universal Pictures, thus becoming the first woman producer at a major studio.
Note of Harrison's achievement suggested that stereotypes die hard. Harrison, The New York Times wrote, was "'the only producer anywhere, with dimples and a 24-inch waistline.' "
Harrison worked almost exclusively with film noir as the form peaked in the 1940s and early '50s. But on noir's shadowy, rain-slicked streets, she effected a major thematic change: her scripts replaced noir's treacherous femmes fatales with appealing, productive women. Thus, a female gumshoe becomes vital to helping clear a man unjustly accused of murder in "Phantom Lady" (1944).
Lane follows Harrison's solo career, detailing the novels and stories she was drawn to and the first-rate teams she gathered to realize her visions. Lane's analyses of performances and images in Harrison's films - "The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry" (1945), "Nocturne" (1946)," and 1947's double shot of "Ride the Pink Horse" and "They Won't Believe Me" - sharply delineate the films' styles and themes.
With television eclipsing film in the 1950s, Harrison went full circle, signing on as producer of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and, in effect, importing her noir style to the small screen.
Along the way, Harrison led a personal life as alluring and mysterious as her career. She loved creating diverse images with fashion, hairstyles and makeup while pursuing equally romantic affairs. There were liaisons with actors Clark Gable and Kirk Douglas and writer Irwin Shaw. Eventually she married spy novelist Eric Ambler. An unidentified woman, though, was said to be the love of her life.
Lane's rich portrait of Harrison virtually contradicts this book's title. Harrison was not "the woman behind Hitchcock"; she was beside him and sometimes ahead of him. On her own, she made her own distinctive contributions to American film. Now, we have that stor

Texto completo: Whether you're firing up Netflix or a Spotify playlist, streaming has become the en vogue mode of disseminating and consuming entertainment. What you binge-watch or bop your head to is a matter of subjectivity and personal preference. The same holds true for sports opinions.
So, it's time for a sports stream of consciousness. I'm sharing thoughts occupying bandwidth in my brain, starting with the Celtics changing my mind.
1. The Celtics are making me a believer that Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Gordon Hayward can function and flourish as players with overlapping skill sets and All-Star performance aspirations.
For much of this season, I've been skeptical of the fit as the trio has treated the season like a relay race, taking turns with the basketball baton. The idea of dealing Hayward, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer, for a less-talented player capable of filling a more pressing need, say a rim-protecting big man, held appeal. The failure of last season's Kyrie Irving-led collection of talent that never coalesced left scars. But since Boston's blowout of LeBron James and the Lakers at TD Garden on Jan. 20, we've gotten a tantalizing taste of what the triumvirate can deliver together, piquing interest in what heights the Celtics can reach with Tatum, Brown, Hayward, Marcus Smart, and Kemba Walker, whom Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge called Boston's best player.
The trio of Tatum, Brown, and Hayward has a 16-7 record and a 13.6 net rating in 387 minutes of court time. But since Jan. 20, the trio's net rating is 34.8 in 86 minutes with a 5-0 record. That net rating was No. 1 in the NBA among all three-man lineups that had played 80 or more minutes from Jan. 20 through Feb. 7.
The question is, can the Green extract the full potential from their top five players when they're all healthy, a rarity this season? Walker, Tatum, Brown, Hayward, and Smart have shared the court for just 13 minutes.
While the Celtics' inactivity at Thursday's NBA trade deadline was disappointing (more on that later), the upside of this group is undeniably intriguing — and worth exploring. If the Celtics can maximize and synergize the talents and the contributions of their three wings, they can challenge for Eastern Conference supremacy.
2. The Celtics didn't need any seismic deals at the deadline. Keeping the core intact made sense. But . . . it would have been nice if Danny the Dealer had dipped into his passel of draft picks to upgrade Boston's bench. Instead, he was Danny the Dormant at the deadline again. Entering Friday, the Celtics were 27th in bench scoring, ahead of only Philadelphia, Portland, and Houston. The 76ers augmented their bench with Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III, and the Rockets changed their mix by adding Robert Covington.
There's debate as to whether two first-round picks would have gotten a deal done with Washington for sharpshooter Davis Bertans, an impending free agent. While its value has tanked, it would've been difficult to mortgage the Memphis pick for a rental. But it's hard to believe that Ainge couldn't have wrangled another bench piece using one of the three first-rounders the Celtics own in the 2020 draft — theirs, Milwaukee's, and the Memphis pick.
Ainge told “Toucher & Rich" on 98.5 The Sports Hub that he didn't want to give up too much for a rental player who would have been Boston's ninth man in the rotation. That seems like a stretch. Rookie Grant Williams has played well lately, but a bench booster would have slotted ahead of him and, possibly, Enes Kanter. We're really talking about the seventh or eighth guy. Ainge and the Celtics have a history of overvaluing draft picks or wasting them on players such as J.R. Giddens, JaJuan Johnson, and Guerschon Yabusele. This year's draft is weak. The Celtics' picks are all slated to land outside the lottery, and they don't have room for three rookies. This was a lost opportunity for Ainge.
3. There was a premature rush to bestow franchise quarterback status on former Patriot Jimmy Garoppolo, perhaps, out of a desire to claim one Patriots victory this postseason. Jimmy G was a passenger for the San Francisco 49ers' playoff run, and when they needed him to take the wheel and drive a fourth-quarter comeback in the Super Bowl, he posted the worst fourth-quarter passer rating in Super Bowl history (2.8). When pressured last Sunday, he was a disastrous 1 of 9 for 20 yards with two interceptions, two batted passes, and a sack, according to Pro Football Focus.
Garoppolo has the talent, smarts, and elan to be an elite quarterback. But he still has the training wheels on, as evidenced by how 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan managed him like a stage mom in the playoffs. Like Lamar Jackson, who is 0-2 in the postseason, Garoppolo has to prove he can conquer the postseason proving ground.
4. One of the best story lines of the Kansas City Chiefs' comeback victory in the Super Bowl was that Patrick Mahomes's ethnicity wasn't a major story line. Mahomes, the son of African-American former Red Sox reliever Pat Mahomes, became the third Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Doug Williams and Russell Wilson. But the talk wasn't about a Black QB lifting the Lombardi Trophy as Super Bowl MVP. It was simply about one of the game's transcendent QBs taking his place atop the throne. That Mahomes's status as one of the NFL's best pure passers superseded his race is progress. So, is this: According to the New York Times, this past season featured the most starts ever by Black quarterbacks, 138.
5. While the fallout from the Houston Astros' illicit electronic sign-stealing scandal continues, with the Wall Street Journal reporting the Astros employed an Excel-based program to steal signs from 2016–18, one of the game's all-time greats took a swing at Major League Baseball's handling of the cheating. Count baseball's true home run king, Hank Aaron, among those who think commissioner Rob Manfred whiffed by failing to punish the players involved.
Aaron said on NBC's “Today" show he felt the punishment, or lack thereof, didn't fit the crime.
“I think whoever did that should be out of baseball for the rest of their lives," said Aaron.
It remains baffling that Manfred agreed to give the players complete immunity, especially because he stated Thursday at an owners' meeting that he believed, “We have the right to discipline players right now. I'm absolutely convinced of that fact."
He said it wasn't done in the Astros investigation because to ascertain the facts, MLB had to grant somebody immunity.
The flaw here is that there is zero deterrent moving forward for players — who can win more games and get paid more money — to refrain from engaging in a sign-stealing scheme, especially if they know that if they're caught, it will all fall on their manager and their front office.
Bonus tracks: A 17-game NFL regular season is player health and safety hypocrisy . . . What's next for the Red Sox in this offseason of discontent, locusts? . . . Trying to equal Michael Jordan would have discouraged most athletes. It inspired Kobe Bryant. In the end, he was more than a spiritual heir to His Airness. He became something iconic all his own.

For Warren and Klobuchar, a Test of Winning Records

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren would have liked more speaking time at the debate. Amy Klobuchar said she had a home-field advantage at an ice arena. Both spent the day after making the case that they're the ones to defeat President Trump.
HANOVER, N.H. -- There is some disagreement on whether the post-debate glow of Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota should be called "Klomentum" or a "Klobucharge," but whatever the terminology -- she had it Saturday afternoon.
On the Democratic debate stage the previous evening, Ms. Klobuchar had made a pitch for herself as a "fresh face" and had criticized former Mayor Pete Buttigieg as a "cool newcomer."
She had also enjoyed herself.
"We had so much fun at that debate last night," she said. "I felt I had a home-field advantage because it was in an ice arena."
That was a rosier post-debate analysis than her rival Senator Elizabeth Warren offered of her own performance, where one of her most memorable lines -- "we cannot just say criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race" -- didn't come until later in the evening.
In a post-debate interview, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell asked her whether there was anything she wished she had said.
"I just didn't say enough, didn't fight hard enough, didn't tell you how bad I want this and how good we could make it if we just come together," Ms. Warren responded, in a moment of introspection.
While a diminished former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who finished fourth in Iowa, entered Friday's debate under the most scrutiny, both Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar also arrived facing significant pressure.
Ms. Klobuchar's fifth-place finish in Iowa left her surprisingly close to Mr. Biden, but that story line was all but swallowed by the inability of Iowa Democrats to actually tally the vote. Ms. Warren's third-place showing was a disappointment for a candidate who was once a front-runner there with a political organization that was the envy of the field.
The debate was a final chance to reach a large audience before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, where both women are looking to surpass expectations and break into a political conversation at risk of becoming dominated by the men in the race. It was also an opportunity to draw contrasts with other Democrats, especially their shared political rival in Mr. Buttigieg, who has surged in the early-voting states by occupying lanes that both Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren once hoped would be theirs.
Gerrie and Barry Rock, a couple who saw Ms. Klobuchar speak in Durham, N.H., said they were torn between other moderate candidates such as Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden before the recent debate, but that Ms. Klobuchar's performance had swayed them.
Mr. Rock said that Mr. Biden was "a little older than I'd like to see" and Ms. Rock said she liked that Ms. Klobuchar "has a little more behind her than he does," alluding to Mr. Buttigieg's lack of political experience.
"I was flickering but now I'm there," Ms. Rock added.
Ms. Warren is seeking do better than her third-place standing in Iowa, helping create momentum for later states and supplant Mr. Buttigieg as the candidate pitching "unity" to a frightened Democratic electorate.
Some of Ms. Klobuchar's supporters quietly dream of a top-four finish, possibly besting Ms. Warren or Mr. Biden. But her campaign has claimed success at previous debates, and has yet to see that confidence translate to a significant bump in polling.
"I know we're not the candidate that's No. 1 right now but we're surging," she told a cheering crowd at Dartmouth College. "I have won every race, every place and every time."
That argument -- winning in every place, every time -- is one that both Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar have made, emphasizing and elevating each other's electoral successes on the debate stage. Often, this was explicitly or implicitly in response to the subject of electability and whether a woman could win the White House, which came up frequently with the historically large number of women in the 2020 field.
Throughout last year, Ms. Warren rose in polls as the primary focused on policy and ideology, and voters seemed to embrace her plan-focused progressive candidacy. As the contest has shifted, and all candidates have started to focus less on policy and more on how they will beat President Trump, Ms. Warren has seen her standing fall among primary voters in national and state surveys.
That polling picture heightened the stakes Friday evening, and some Warren allies were disappointed with a relatively flat performance at so crucial a juncture.
But the Working Families Party, the progressive group that has endorsed Ms. Warren, sent an email Saturday noting that Ms. Warren had "absolutely killed it" at the debate, despite getting "20 percent less speaking time than the leading male candidates onstage -- including Joe Biden," whom, it noted, she defeated in Iowa.
During the debate, the Warren campaign said it had "the most donations processing simultaneously" than it had ever had, though it declined to release any actual fund-raising figures.
The Klobuchar campaign also trumpeted its fund-raising numbers: $ 2 million by 1 p.m. on Saturday. That announcement meant that she had accounted for a sizable share -- nearly one-third -- of all the online Democratic fund-raising since the debate began, according to an online ticker maintained by ActBlue, the party's online donation-processing platform.
Other signs of "Klomentum" -- in addition to the term itself -- were apparent at Ms. Klobuchar's events Saturday.
Ms. Klobuchar packed a room at Dartmouth College, with more than 200 people in attendance. Her campaign team had to turn away some residents for an earlier event in Durham, after police officials said it had reached capacity.
In a photo line, people repeatedly thanked her for her commanding debate performance, highlighting Mr. Buttigieg's political inexperience and defending, by name, New Hampshire's two senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, who voted for the recent trade agreement signed by Mr. Trump. Staff members handed out copies of newspaper editorials endorsing Ms. Klobuchar, hailing her winning record in Minnesota.
Ms. Klobuchar said her willingness to directly chide opponents onstage is a sign of her ability to take on the president.
"I don't agree with everything that's said on that debate stage," Ms. Klobuchar said Saturday. "When they asked should a socialist lead the ticket, I raised my hand and said 'no.' "
On Saturday afternoon, Ms. Warren held a brief motivational rally for hundreds of supporters, including people who came from out of state to help get out the vote, and she also addressed her ability to defeat Mr. Trump.
"Here's the thing: There's still a lot of folks out there who are really starting to get worried," she said. "Worried this fight against Donald Trump may not be winnable. The way I look at this, I've been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life."
Lizzie Williamson, a 31-year-old who drove up from North Easton, Mass., to knock on doors for Ms. Warren, had watched the debate and was frustrated with how little speaking time Ms. Warren received. (She had the fifth highest speaking time on Friday -- ahead of just Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang -- according to The New York Times's analysis.)
"I thought she was fantastic but she talked the same amount as Steyer," Ms. Williamson said. "Why?"
After the event, Ms. Warren spent part of Saturday afternoon knocking on doors in a Manchester neighborhood, holding hands with her husband, Bruce Mann, as they canvassed for votes with their dog, Bailey.
"I thought it went well," Ms. Warren said of the debate. "It was a good debate. Good debate. A lot of back and forth. But you know still. I got to cover issues I care about. Obviously, there's more I would have liked to have talked about."
Could she have spoken more?
"I had my hand up a lot," she said. "But, you know, I know all the candidates want more airtime."
Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Durham.

Texto completo: When I was a girl in the 1980s, my parents took me to visit Orchard House, Louisa May Alcott's home in Concord, Mass. This trip inspired me as a young writer. Through her autobiographical novel 'Little Women,' Alcott showed what it was like to be a professional author with her 'genius cap' on, scribbling away in a loud and bustling home.
I also felt an affinity for her because I'm part of a family configuration rarely seen except in our household, the pages of 'Little Women' and the Alcott home: four sisters and no brothers (I'm the youngest, 'Amy').
At Orchard House, built circa 1650, it is estimated that 80-percent of the furnishings were owned by the Alcotts. There, Alcott wrote 'Little Women' at a desk her father, noted abolitionist and transcendentalist Amos Bronson Alcott, built for her. 'The rooms she's describing in the book are actually the rooms in Orchard House,' says the home's executive director, Jan Turnquist. 'A lot of people tell me they feel like they're walking through the book.'
Alcott died in 1888, two days after her father, and Orchard House opened as a museum in 1911.
Alcott's half-moon-shaped desk, affixed to the space of wall between two windows of her bedroom, is modest, barely large enough to hold an inkwell and a few pieces of paper. Yet a spirit of creativity still seems to emanate from it. 'I've had young women ask me if they can sit in the room and write a little bit,' Turnquist says. If circumstances allow and the home is not busy, she will occasionally grant the request.
That long-ago visit showed me that in a small house with narrow staircases, Alcott pulled off writing a novel that is in print hundreds of years later, that has been read by the millions, that got her featured in a card game we owned called Authors and that has inspired multiple film versions. The 2019 production, nominated for six Oscars including best picture, has increased tourism at Orchard House, which Turnquist says has had to hire more docents and stay open longer each day.
Writing at her simple shelf desk led Alcott to international bestsellerdom. I'm not the only one who has felt that touring the home of an author made such a career seem possible for oneself. Following is a list of other American female writers' homes to visit, to inspire a new generation of young authors.





Emily Dickinson MuseumAmherst, Mass. A visit includes the Homestead, the poet's home, with a museum on the ground floor, and the Evergreens, her brother's home next door. Dickinson was reclusive, so her home was her world. See the window from which she lowered baskets of fresh-baked cookies to the neighbor children she was too shy to speak with, and the door she walked past slowly to constitute an 'examination' for the doctor seated inside the room. Dickinson's poetry, with its much-studied hyphenation and stunning leaps of imagination, has fueled admiration for centuries, nearly all of it after her 1886 death, when her sister found her poems in her dresser drawer. Dickinson had been only lightly published during her lifetime, and that anonymously. The Homestead opened for tours in 1965, while the Evergreens opened in the early 2000s.




Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home - MuseumMansfield, Mo. Anyone who read the nine-volume autobiographical 'Little House on the Prairie' series knows that the Ingalls family moved around constantly. While places where young Laura lived can be found in six states, some consist of reproduction cabins or land where homestead shanties or dugouts once stood. In Mansfield, however, you can tour the Rocky Ridge Farm, where Laura and her husband Almanzo lived and farmed starting in 1896. After the stock market crash of 1929 ruined their prospects, she began writing about her youth at a small wooden desk with pigeon holes in the home's study. Financial success and fame ensued as readers warmed to the tales of a covered-wagon family's adventures.






Pearl S. Buck HousePerkasie, Penn. A champion for social justice, Buck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for her novel 'The Good Earth,' a portrayal of a Chinese farming family, and six years later won the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. The child of West Virginian missionaries, Buck spent much of her life in China, but the stone farmhouse in Pennsylvania, formerly called Green Hills Farm, was her home from 1934 to 1969. Her moss-green Royal typewriter, used for writing 'The Good Earth,' is on display.





The Mount, Edith Wharton's HomeLenox, Mass. Wharton, whose 40-plus books include novels such as 'The Age of Innocence' as well as nonfiction, was the first female Pulitzer Prize winner. In 1902 she designed the Mount and its formal gardens, calling upon her architectural and design expertise. She and her husband lived in the home until 1911, and during that time she wrote 'The House of Mirth' and 'Ethan Frome.' The home's 2,700-volume library contains books in which she made personal annotations.






Eudora Welty House and GardenJackson, Miss. Welty lived here from 1925 until her death in 2001, and it is where she wrote most of her fiction and essays. The furnishings are completely authentic, as Welty decided to bequeath the home to the state of Mississippi in 1986, well before she died. Nearly every wall is lined with books, a testament to her love of literature " as a child, she read two library books a day. Outside, heirloom gardens established by her mother are still tended. Welty is known as a short-story writer but won the Pulitzer for her novel 'The Optimist's Daughter.' She was the first living writer to be included in the Library of America series 'of works by United States literary giants,' reported the New York Times in its obituary.

Texto completo: A little over a year ago, the archival storytelling group came across a photo of a woman carrying on her back a baby holding a tiny Nigerian flag. The year was 1960. It was a powerful illustration of how new independence felt for so many African nations. Seventeen countries declared independence that year, which became known as the Year of Africa. And with the coming of its 60th anniversary, the idea for this section was born.
We know that 1960 was both a celebratory ending to colonial rule and the complicated beginning of a new chapter in the continent's history. So we asked Adom Getachew, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, to lead the package.
As we worked on this section, the term Afropolitan -- popularized by the British writer Taiye Selasi -- also came up. Ms. Selasi used it to describe her peers who had grown up both on the continent and abroad, spoke multiple languages and described themselves as "not citizens, but Africans of the world."
In her 2005 essay, Ms. Selasi wrote: "This one lives in London but was raised in Toronto and born in Accra; that one works in Lagos but grew up in Houston, Texas. 'Home' for this lot is many things: where their parents are from; where they go for vacation; where they went to school; where they see old friends; where they live (or live this year). Like so many African young people working and living in cities around the globe, they belong to no single geography, but feel at home in many."
With all of these things in mind, we selected images -- some from The New York Times's archive and others from various collections around the world -- to tell the story of the heady days around the Year of Africa. Each of the 17 countries that gained independence that year is represented here, but there are also images from countries, like Ghana, with especially rich photographic traditions.
Nostalgia tends to tip toward the positive, and this edit does the same. But we were moved and inspired to present a collection of images of a hopeful continent and a generation on the brink of change.
We then invited a group of creative people of African descent to give us their personal reactions to these images. The contributors in this section are the children of the children of independence. Their parents saw the countries of their birth change names, flags and leadership; wrestled with the resulting political and economic crises; suffered through and survived famines and wars. But they took the inheritance of independence and crafted it into a kind of global belonging and potential that was and is changing culture all over the world: from fine art and architecture; to music, television and film; to literature and sports.
The responses varied, but all of the contributors saw glimpses of home and family in these photographs. All of them, in their own way, were moved by the sparks of power and possibility that are as much a part of their individual stories as of the collective history of a continent being reimagined and redefined.

'Mad Mike' headed army of mercenaries in Congo

Texto completo: To his legions of admirers, Mike Hoare was a poetry-reading soldier of fortune who led an army of white mercenaries in Congo, freed missionaries from certain death and beat back a growing communist threat.
He served with the British army in India and Myanmar, also known as Burma, during World War II, worked as an accountant in peacetime London and decamped to apartheid-era South Africa in search of ad ven ture. He organized safaris, embarked on motorcycle expeditions that spanned the continent and searched for a legendary lost city in the Kalahari Desert.
Mr. Hoare, who was 100 when he died Feb.-2, eventually found his calling as a mercenary, leading two 1960s campaigns in Congo. Covertly backed by the CIA, he and his men stifled a ragtag rebellion that U.S. policymakers deemed a Cold War menace. But while his soldiers were glamorized by the American press, other reports indicated they were little more than rifle-wielding thugs " guilty of 'serious excesses,' as one CIA cable put it, that included 'robbery, rape, murder and beatings.'
Those accusations did little to damage the public image of Mr. Hoare, who sometimes went by the military rank of colonel and said he had little tolerance for war crimes, even as he likened African nationalists to animals. His mercenary career ended two decades later after he spearheaded a failed coup in the Seychelles that landed him in a South African prison.
'I think I'd like to have been born in the time of Sir Francis Drake,' he once told The Washington Post. 'Yes, out sailing, robbing the Spaniards, and when you brought the booty back to Queen Elizabeth, you knelt before her and she made you a knight. You were respectable " even though you were a thief.'
Along with Bob Denard of France and Jean Schramme of Belgium, Mr. Hoare was one of several white mercenaries who made international headlines in post-colonial Africa, selling their services to rebel factions and anti-communist regimes. His death was announced by his son and biographer, Chris Hoare, who said Mr. Hoare died at a care facility in Durban, South Africa, but did not give a cause.
' 'Mad Mike' was an officer and a gentleman " with a bit of brigand thrown in,' Chris Hoare said in a statement. Indeed, Mr. Hoare partly inspired a Richard Burton war film, said he shot the toes off a rapist mercenary, and boasted to reporters that he worked only with cleanshaven professionals. In Congo, he had at least one other work requirement as well, once telling an aspiring black gunslinger, 'We only engage white mercenaries.'
Mr. Hoare's commercial soldiering began in 1961, when he traveled to Congo to fight for Moise Tshombe, who sought to establish a breakaway state in the wealthy Katanga province. The revolt failed " Mr. Hoare later said two of his men were cannibalized by enemy forces " but three years later, Tshombe rose to become the country's prime minister, positioning himself as a staunch American ally and anti-communist crusader.
Tshombe took office amid a growing rebellion led by fighters known as Simbas (the Swahili word for lions), who were reportedly backed by the Soviet and Chinese governments and later joined by Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara. Treating Congo as a Cold War battleground, U.S. authorities encouraged Tshombe to hire mercenaries such as those led by Mr. Hoare, who called communism 'the greatest cancer the world has ever known.'
Working alongside Congolese military leader Mobutu Sese Seko, who later ruled the country for three bloody decades, Mr. Hoare assembled a force of several hundred men known as 5 Commando and nicknamed the Wild Geese " a centuries-old term for Irish soldiers and mercenaries, reflecting Mr. Hoare's own Irish heritage.
'I believe . . . we have a great mission here,' he told a fellow mercenary, according to a history of the Simba rebellion by Johns Hopkins professor Piero Gleijeses. 'The Africans have gotten used to the idea that they can do what they like to us whites, that they can trample on us and spit on us.'
Dubbed 'the white giants,' Mr. Hoare's men swept through the country, mowing down untrained and outnumbered Simba forces who believed that witchcraft made them impervious to bullets. In total, the mercenary unit was paid about $300,000 a month by U.S. authorities, according to a Post report, and backed by what the New York Times described as an 'instant air force' created by the CIA.
In November 1964, Mr. Hoare's men closed in on Stanleyville (now Kisangani), a Simba stronghold where about 1,600 missionaries, Europeans and Americans had been taken hostage. Belgian paratroopers rained down on the city and the mercenaries swooped in to provide support. Almost all of the hostages were freed and evacuated by plane.
Mr. Hoare was lionized for his exploits even as accounts of wartime atrocities trickled out of Congo. A Post correspondent recalled that the soldiers were usually orderly, but when Mr. Hoare 'wasn't there, they killed a lot of people and hit the bank.' In an off-the-record conversation with a British journalist, Mr. Hoare called his men 'appalling thugs,' according to Gleijeses's book 'Conflicting Missions.'
'Killing communists is like killing vermin; killing African nationalists is as if one is killing an animal,' Mr. Hoare told journalists, according to the Guardian. 'My men and I have killed between 5,000 to 10,000 Congo rebels in the 20 months that I have spent in the Congo. But that's not enough. There are 20 million Congolese you know, and I assume that about half of them at one time or another were rebels whilst I was down here.'
Mr. Hoare took a break from soldiering to embark on a worldwide cruise aboard his 38-foot yacht. He also returned to accounting and, in 1978, attracted wider renown with the release of 'The Wild Geese,' a British-Swiss movie that starred Burton as a mercenary loosely modeled after Mr. Hoare, a technical adviser for the film.
Three years later, at age 62, he led more than 40 men in a failed effort to overthrow the socialist government of the Seychelles, an archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean.
Armed with AK-47 assault rifles concealed in false-bottom bags, they posed as rugby players and adopted the name of a drinking club, Ye Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers.
The plan fell apart as the men passed through airport customs on the island of Mahé, where authorities uncovered one man's rifle, resulting in a firefight that left a mercenary and a Seychelles army officer dead.
Mr. Hoare's men commandeered an Air India plane and ordered the crew to fly more than 2,000 miles to Durban, South Africa, where the hijackers were subsequently arrested. At trial, Mr. Hoare testified that the South African government had approved the coup and supplied his men with weapons; Prime Minister P.W. Botha later denied having authorized the attack, although a U.N. investigation found that the South African government probably had advance knowledge of the plot.
All but one of the mercenaries were convicted of hijacking, and Mr. Hoare was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released less than three years later under a 1985 presidential amnesty and rebuffed questions about his potential retirement. 'This is all a question of opportunity,' he told the Associated Press. 'Mercenary opportunities exist now mainly in films and books.'
Thomas Michael Bernard Hoare was born in what was then Calcutta, in British colonial India, on March 17, 1919.
His father was an assistant dock master, and Mr. Hoare spent much of his youth in England before serving with the London Irish Rifles and the Royal Armoured Corps during World War II. He mustered out as a major and emigrated to South Africa in 1948.
Mr. Hoare burnished his legacy in a slew of memoirs, and late in life spent two decades in France, studying a medieval Christian sect known as the Cathars that he chronicled in a historical novel. He returned to South Africa in 2009.
His marriage to Elizabeth Stott ended in divorce, and in 1961 he married Phyllis Sims. She died in 2009. Survivors include two sons and a daughter from his first marriage; two sons from his second; two brothers; two sisters; and eight grandchildren.
Mr. Hoare said it was not simply money or ideology that led him to become a mercenary.
'The mystique is unexplainable " the mystique about soldiering with strong men,' he told The Post in 1978. 'It's something more than just soldiering for money. The moment of truth comes at 3 a.m. in a hole. Your buddy's been killed or wounded, and no money can compensate . . . But there's an indescribable exhilaration being part of a well-disciplined unit that holds its position.'

Texto completo: Ganus's reform effortsfor banned nation spur death threats
MOSCOW " A poster in the office of Yuri Ganus, Russia's anti-doping chief, shows a hulking ship plowing through a thick slab of ice under a violent, fiery sky. Athletes holding trophies high follow the vessel.
Ganus commissioned the image as a sort of mission statement.
'We're breaking many years' ice of tolerance to doping. We are clearing a road for clean athletes,' he explained. 'We're working under fire from different sides.'
As head of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), Ganus is at the center of Russia's years-long scandal over state-sponsored doping, which has led to the country's ban from this summer's Tokyo Olympics and all other international competitions for four years " including the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.
Ganus also stands alone among Russia's anti-doping officials calling for an overhaul of Russia's sports oversight.
The country's sports leadership denied it manipulated a database of its athletes' old drug-test results from a Moscow anti-doping laboratory. But Ganus has brazenly asserted that Russian officials attempted to mislead investigators from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the watchdog group for international sports. WADA imposed the four-year ban on Russia in December.
In another country, he might be hailed as a truth-teller. But public dissent is rare and discouraged in the Russia of President Vladi mir Putin. It also can stir worries of possible retaliation.

Whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of the Moscow anti-doping lab, fled Russia in 2015 and is in the U.S. witness protection program.
Ganus said he has been on the receiving end of death threats.
'I'm disturbed about it,' Ganus said. 'When somebody tried to [pressure] me, I said, 'I'm working for the national interests. Which interests are you working for?' '
The 55-year-old Ganus doesn't consider this a job but 'a mission' to preserve the reputation of Russian athletics for future generations, he said.
Outside of playing handball as a boy, his background was more business than sports.
He studied marine engineering, the inspiration for the icebreaker ship metaphor he turned into a poster. But Ganus was distressed that the doping controversy kept Russia from participating in the 2016 Summer Paralympics, a particular passion of his. That's what prompted him to apply for the post of RUSADA's director general.
Russia was banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeong Chang, South Korea, for its doping saga. Athletes deemed clean competed under a neutral flag, as they will in Tokyo this summer. WADA offered Russia a path to reinstatement, but a condition was turning over a database from its old Moscow lab. WADA investigators later said the data was inconsistent from the whistleblower's copy they received in 2017.
Ganus claims he didn't have a role in fudging the data, but he said he has 'many, many, many times thought about' why Russia might have done it. Perhaps, he has said, it was to protect results from the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which saw the country win 29-medals, tying for the most of any participant.
During a conference in Colorado Springs in October, Ganus admitted in an interview with the New York Times that the database had been changed " two weeks before a WADA committee even met to discuss potentially levying harsher penalties against Russia.
Ganus said that shortly after his comments were published, he fielded calls from Russian politicians accusing him of trying to drum up some personal publicity.
He rejected that notion and said that after his internal memos about replacing the country's top sports officials and rejecting their 'old-school approaches' had been ignored, he hoped to get their attention through the media. He said he has been blacklisted from Russia's state-run television.
'I understand that I involve big negative on myself,' Ganus said. 'I received calls when I was in Colorado Springs, 'Do you want to go back to Russia?' Why do I even have to think about it? The truth is on my side.'
For Russian leaders, however, the anti-doping sanctions have been labeled as a conspiracy against the country. Putin said in December that the ban is 'not fair' and 'an attempt to get rid of competition.' Dmitry Medvedev, at the time the prime minister, said that WADA's decision 'makes one think that this is just a continuation of that anti-Russian hysteria that has become chronic.'
RUSADA appealed the four-year ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Ganus said he disagreed with the appeal but was overruled, so he attached a personal note of protest with it. A decision is expected by the end of March.
But trust in Russia's sports officials has eroded to the point that the international community is wary of Ganus, too.
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said he 'affectionately' refers to Ganus as 'fancy bear,' a reference to the Russian cyber espionage group that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.
'On the one hand, you really want to support him and embrace him for some of the positions he's taken,' Tygart said. 'On the flip side, you want to be very cautious that the powers that he reports to, as you're embracing him, aren't reaching in your back pocket and stealing your wallet.'
Tygart, who has called for stiffer penalties for Russian doping offenses in the past, is concerned that Russia may be allowing Ganus to speak out for different motives. It would allow Russia to argue that RUSADA has no control over the sports ministry. That gets to a legal question of whether the international anti-doping agency can hold RUSADA responsible for government actions.
Ganus said he won't be participating in the Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal.
'If he is speaking truth to power, we're concerned about his safety,' Tygart said.
Ganus said the death threats have stopped and it's 'not in the interest of Russia to make a problem' for him.
In his two-plus years on the job, he has overturned 90 percent of RUSADA's staff and secured a bit more independence by getting funding from the finance ministry rather than the sports ministry. The office's hallways are lined with handwritten notes from other anti-doping agencies around the world, encouraging Ganus and Russia's athletes to fight for clean competition.
Along with the first icebreaker poster, his office put out another drawing with a mirror dividing two sides " the 'good' with athletes holding aloft the Russian flag vs. the 'bad' with demonic-looking creatures with medals around their necks.
'Look at yourself in the mirror of human values,' it reads. 'Decide which side you're on.'
As his loyalty to Russia has been questioned by Russians, he has responded with an Abraham Lincoln quote " that 'true patriotism is better than the wrong kind of piety.'
'Patriotism is not loyalty to officials,' Ganus said. 'It's not loyalty to the president. It's loyalty to the country.'

Texto completo: Only 8 percent of high school seniors can identify slavery as a central cause of the Civil War, according to a recent Southern Poverty Law Center survey. The average American has grown up believing a slew of myths about the institution. As scholars of slavery and its aftermath, we've identified a few of the many misconceptions we have encountered in the classroom and in public spaces over the years.
Myth No. 1 The first Africans came to America in 1619. U.S. history textbooks commonly introduce 1619 as the year Africans arrived in America.-This date has appeared in sources such as the-Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Associated Press, and it has become even more entrenched in the popular imagination thanks to the New York Times Magazine's-1619 Project, commemorating the anniversary of the '20 And Odd. Negroes' who landed at Point Comfort, Va., 400 years ago.
While this date is indeed significant to British arrival and settlement, Africans came to America well earlier. Some, such as Juan Garrido and-Esteban, came as explorers with the Spanish in 1503 and 1528, respectively. Because of their mobility and influence among the conquistadors, historians offer differing interpretations on whether they were ever enslaved, but at some point, both men were considered free. Another example is Isabel de Olvera, a free woman of African descent, who in 1600 went on an expedition to New Spain (a region comprising present-day New Mexico, Arizona, Florida and other parts of North and South America), in search of trade goods and new places to settle. These stories, too, are important to U.S. history: They place the starting point of African American history in freedom, as well as enslavement.
Myth No. 2 Enslaved people who worked in the house had easier lives. In a 1963 speech, Malcolm X strongly-distinguished-enslaved people who worked in the house from those who worked in the fields, claiming that the former enjoyed greater privileges and comforts and that some even identified with their enslavers. Texts-designed to teach children-about-slavery-also often assert that people forced into domestic labor had more comfortable and pleasant lives than those forced into agricultural labor.
But the distinction is not that simple. While a few of the very largest plantations had-entirely separate labor pools, says historian Greg Downs, in most households, laborers moved between tasks depending on their age or the season. And working indoors had its own physical and psychological hardships. Enslaved people were on call 24 hours a day, mostly on their feet and in close proximity to their enslavers, which led to greater scrutiny of their work, according to historian-Deborah Gray White. Some of this labor included helping their enslavers dress, bathe, style their hair and fan flies, in addition to cooking, cleaning and running errands " intimate interactions involving personal touch and knowledge of people's innermost lives. In these settings, writes historian-Thavolia Glymph,-domestic laborers often experienced physical and sexual abuse.
Myth No. 3 Slavery was limited to the South. When people think about slavery in the United States, they often picture large cotton plantations in the Deep South.-One popular textbook claims that while cotton 'enriched planters in the South, as well as bankers and shipowners in the North,' the latter still relied on a 'free labor system.' Similarly, the College Board's curriculum for Advanced Placement U.S. history states that 'the North's expanding manufacturing economy relied on free labor in contrast to the Southern economy's dependence on slave labor.'
But these accounts, which simplistically oppose 'free' Northern states with 'slave' Southern states, neglect to mention the long-standing presence of enslaved labor in the North.
Slavery touched nearly every corner of this country. Northern communities supported and benefited from Southern slavery through the shipbuilding, textile and shoemaking industries. In Rhode Island alone, traders shipped more than 100,000 African captives to the Caribbean and American colonies, according to 'People Not Property,' an online documentary. Plantations along the Connecticut, Delaware and Hudson rivers relied on enslaved workers to produce wheat and process it into flour. Slavery was-widespread at universities: Georgetown University sold enslaved laborers to pay off debts to keep the school in operation, and early presidents of-Harvard-brought enslaved labor to work on campus. Enslaved laborers built the structure in Lower Manhattan for which Wall Street is named.
Myth No. 4 Women were not as involved in slave-owning as men were. The 1939 blockbuster 'Gone With the Wind' cemented the myth of the essentially innocent Southern belle, who only passively benefited from slavery.-Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, historians who studied female slaveholders tended to portray them as ambivalent about a role inherited from their fathers or husbands, making the best of a situation over which they had no control.
In fact, white women actively participated in the institution of slavery. In 'They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South,' historian Stephanie Jones-Rogers shows that white women had a deep economic investment in slavery and exercised extraordinary control over the enslaved people in their households. Many learned this-practice-from birth, receiving enslaved people as gifts when they were children or even infants. Women bought and sold people at auction, and-successfully sued-their male family members for control of their laborers. Women supervised plantations and brutally punished their human 'property': One mistress crushed the jaw of 8-year-old Henrietta King under the weight of her rocking chair because Henrietta had taken a piece of candy; the woman who enslaved-Harriet Jacobs-spit in the kettles and pans to keep her from eating leftover scraps.
Myth No. 5 The Civil War ended slavery. Many Americans have internalized the idea that slavery ended shortly after the Civil War.-A National Geographic educational guide, for example, marks Dec. 18, 1865 as the day the United States abolished slavery by adopting the 13th Amendment. Senate Majority Leader-Mitch McConnell-(R-Ky.), recently arguing against reparations, called slavery 'something that happened 150 years ago.'
But in effect, slavery continued into the 20th century, under a system known as-convict leasing. This practice, in which private enterprises leased felony prisoners from the state for a fee,-primarily targeted black men, women and youth.-African Americans were incarcerated for trivial offenses such as loitering, stealing farm animals, breaking into railroad cars, spitting on the sidewalk and vagrancy. Some were individually-auctioned-at county courthouses, while others were rented in groups. Convict leasing involved holding people against their will, separating them from their families, working them from sunup to sundown, beating and whipping them regularly, and severely punishing them for minor infractions. It also involved sexual violence-against incarcerated women and, often, the permanent loss of freedom: Many leased prisoners were held for life, and mortality rates were high. In 1873 in Alabama,-25 percent of black leased convicts died.
Though convict leasing was legally abolished in 1928, at least 37 states still permit contracting prison labor out to private companies. Today, incarcerated workers manufacture military equipment and uniforms, build office furniture, fight fires, answer customer service calls and sow crops. Most receive pennies per hour for their labor, while others receive no compensation at all.

Are they spying on you? In Maine, officials won't say Powerful technologies let authorities track everyone - even citizens who aren't suspected of crimes. And Maine is one of only two states in which the public's right to know about it doesn't exist.

Texto completo: Maine State Police may be using powerful new technologies to scan your face and intercept your cellphone signals, but officials say an unusual provision in state law means police don't have to tell the public.
Government use of such technologies to investigate crimes or monitor citizens is a growing source of concern around the country and the world. And Maine's secrecy is raising alarms among privacy advocates, who worry that law enforcement could be using advanced technology to monitor residents, including those who are not suspected of any crime.
"It means the public doesn't even know what it doesn't know," said Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's speech, privacy and technology project. "It has no idea whether there is a potential question about whether there's unconstitutional use of a surveillance technology."
An investigation by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram has found:
n
Maine is one of two states to have a specific law, which was inspired by Cold War-era secrets kept from the Soviets, that officials say allows the state to neither confirm nor deny the use of digital technologies that might help solve crimes, but that also raises fears of abuse, privacy violations and the surveillance of citizens.
n
Despite evidence that the Maine State Police has worked for years with federal agencies to develop its use of digital surveillance technology, the agency now uses that law to refuse to answer any questions about such efforts, or even acknowledge that they exist.
n
The secrecy about investigative or surveillance technology extends to the Maine Information and Analysis Center - a so-called fusion center that brings the state police together with other federal and state agencies to foster information sharing and does not reveal its activities.
n
The state police, and its partners in the fusion center, may soon have access to Mainers' Real ID photos, which are especially suited for face-scanning technology. State law currently prohibits use of license photos for facial recognition searches, but a bill now moving through the Legislature would allow state officials to conduct such searches and provide information to outside law enforcement agencies.
The lack of disclosure prevents public oversight to ensure that people's privacy and constitutional rights are being respected. Advanced technologies make it possible for authorities to conduct mass surveillance, including collecting cellphone information and comparing the images of suspected criminals against databases of people who are not suspected of committing any crimes. The technology can track people's movements and help determine groups and individuals with whom a person associates.
And the lack of transparency does not allow the public to know whether the government is being a good steward of tax dollars.
"It's just an extremely broad power of secrecy," said Wessler. "It just completely hobbles the opportunity for public debate on very important subjects."
"It's a per se mandate on the agency to clam up even before the process gets going," he added. "And that, I think, is particularly pernicious and dangerous to our tradition of democratic government, because it cuts transparency completely off at the knees."
POWERFUL NEW TOOLS
The lack of disclosure comes as communities across the United States are trying to regulate technology that allows local law enforcement to conduct sweeping surveillance of the public, including people who are not suspected of crimes.
Police departments are getting more sophisticated as technologies originally designed to enhance national security are deployed to state and local police departments to solve everyday crimes. And in some cases it's being done without a robust public discussion about what limits, if any, should be placed on its use.
Two types of surveillance technology have come under the most scrutiny from civil liberties advocates and elected officials: facial recognition and cell site simulators. Both are capable of gathering large caches of personal information.
Brendan McQuade, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of Southern Maine who has written a book about secretive fusion centers, said the government has the ability to gather vast amounts of information using a variety of technology, including software to monitor social media, E-ZPasses used to pay highway tolls, and automated license plate readers, among others.
"The fact that we don't know what agencies have what technology, I think, should be very troubling," McQuade said. "They're bought in secret. They're used in secret. And unless there's concerted political action and legislative actions, there's nothing preventing police departments from doing very aggressive, warrantless surveillance."
Facial recognition technology can map an individual's face using a high-resolution digital image or surveillance video and then compare that image to an existing database of known people.
It works by essentially mapping a person's dominant facial features, such as eye shape and spacing, as well as jaw and nose lines. The software measures the distances between dozens of reference points, creating a unique profile similar to a fingerprint. The profile is then compared to the faces in existing databases, such as those that contain driver's licenses, state IDs, immigration records, passport photos or police mug shots.
More advanced programs can also conduct an analysis of skin texture to increase accuracy and, in some cases, account for different facial expressions, facial hair or eyeglasses. Some technology can provide real-time identification of people captured on video.
The New York Times recently reported that more than 600 local police agencies are using a new facial recognition cellphone app created by the private company Clearview AI to search a cache of 3 billion images scraped from such sites as Facebook, Venmo and YouTube to identify potential suspects.
Other technological tools used by police include cell site simulators, also known as IMSI catchers or Stingrays, that can essentially turn the cellphone you carry into a real-time tracking device.
A cell site simulator can be the size of a briefcase and carried in a police cruiser or on an airplane to ping cellphones. It sends out a signal that tricks nearby cellphones into connecting with the simulator, rather than a cellphone tower. The signal is then passed to a tower, and it happens without the user knowing.
Authorities can either search for and track a specific cellphone number or collect data from all of the cellphones within a certain area. That data can include the IMSI - or International Mobile Subscriber Identity - and metadata about whom a person communicates with and for how long. And some advanced simulators can intercept the content of messages, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Groups including the ACLU have raised concerns about both forms of technology, saying that widespread use infringes on constitutional rights that protect people from unlawful searches and guarantee the right to peacefully assemble and associate with groups of people.
concerns over facial recognition
Privacy advocates point to China as an example of the dangers posed by unrestricted use of such technologies. The Chinese government is using facial recognition to monitor and oppress the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority ethnic population.
China is also working on technology that can identify people by the way they walk, so that they can be tracked even if their faces are obscured. The New York Times reported that Chinese officials are using the technology to shame people who wear pajamas in public, for example, while police in London are going to use it to identify people captured on video in real time.
McQuade is among those concerned.
"It's akin to having close personal surveillance on someone for a long time and reading their diary about who they're calling and who they're visiting," he said.
A handful of communities in the United States have restricted or banned the use of facial recognition technology, both because of constitutional concerns and a high error rate when trying to identify people of color and women. The state of California has enacted a three-year ban on using facial recognition in conjunction with cameras worn by police officers.
A study published in December by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found the rate of false positive identifications, which could make an innocent person a criminal suspect, occurred 10 to 100 times more frequently among African-Americans and Asians than with Caucasians. The study tested 189 algorithms from 99 developers to compare photos in four federal databases containing 18.27 million images of 8.49 million people.
In Portland, the City Council has twice postponed a vote on a proposal from City Councilor Pious Ali that would prohibit city officials, including its police force, from obtaining, retaining, accessing or using any facial recognition technology or information provided by such technology.
The proposed ban comes as Maine's largest city has embraced so-called smart-city technology, which includes traffic monitoring and has stoked fears about government's increasing ability to watch over citizens. And Portland's police officers are now equipped with cameras mounted on their chests to capture video of each person an officer interacts with, another source of concern about privacy.
Portland's smart-city efforts so far include LED streetlights that can double as WiFi routers, and sophisticated traffic management systems that can read and adjust signals in response to real-time traffic. Portland officials have expressed interest in other "public safety functions," but so far, officials say that has not included facial recognition technology.
City officials, including Police Chief Frank Clark, said they are not currently using facial recognition technology and opposed restricting any future use of technology that might enhance public safety. The chief said he would alert the city manager or the council if the department ever planned to use it.
Clark highlighted the technologies' potential to help solve crimes and identify exploited children, crime victims and people suffering from dementia.
"While we do not have any immediate plans to acquire facial recognition, I am an advocate of taking advantage of contemporary 21st century technologies to drive better public safety outcomes," Clark said in a memo to councilors, adding that strong policies can prevent misuse and infringement on constitutional rights. "A ban on facial recognition technology would only take away a potential tool that is helping to increase efficiencies and provide assistance for crime victims and people in crisis in other jurisdictions."
And the city also has said it does not use any cell site simulators. A request for internal public records pertaining to the technology produced no relevant documents, a city spokesperson said.
Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce has said his agency began using facial recognition technology in 2012 to search its database of mug shots to identify people who refused to give their names or were suspected of having fake IDs. Joyce said they stopped using the technology because it only worked when the photo of a subject's face was taken at the correct angle and in good lighting.
While both the Portland police chief and the Cumberland County sheriff have been willing to talk about whether the technology is in use, the Maine State Police are not as forthcoming.
COLD WAR-era SECRECY
The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram requested a range of public documents relating to facial recognition technology and cell site simulators from the Maine State Police under Maine's Freedom of Access Act. The documents included any requests for proposals, contracts, payments, policies governing usage, evaluations of the technology and communications about the use of such technology.
Christopher Parr, staff attorney for the Maine State Police, issued formal denials to both requests, citing a provision of Maine law enacted in 2013 that appears to be unique in the United States.
"Answering your inquiry would require us to confirm the existence or nonexistence of records and information relating to the type of technology that is the subject of your email," Parr said in November. "As a matter of law, we are unable to confirm the existence or nonexistence of such records and information."
Sigmund Schutz, an attorney for the Press Herald and Telegram, is challenging that interpretation and asking the state to reconsider its denial. He noted that the request does not pertain to a specific investigation or person, nor does it pertain to a type of technology that is unknown to the public.
"Based on the nature of the records sought, it is not plausible that disclosure of any or all of the requested records would cause any of the harms that would warrant confidentiality," Schutz wrote.
Parr's response to records requests is often referred to in legal circles as a Glomar, a non-answer created by the CIA in the 1970s in response to public inquiries about a covert operation to recover a sunken Soviet submarine.
After a Soviet submarine mysteriously sank in 1968, the U.S. located the disabled sub and launched a covert mission to retrieve it, believing it contained nuclear missiles or nuclear codes, or both. The U.S. hired the Global Marine company, which was owned by Howard Hughes, to build a special ship to try to retrieve the sub. The ship was named the Hughes Glomar Explorer.
The U.S. was unable to surface the sub. Once news began to spread about the failed mission in 1975, the Central Intelligence Agency drafted a response that was truthful without confirming or denying the existence of the covert operation.
The response became known as Glomar.
MAINE'S SECRECY STANDS OUT
The ACLU says Maine is one of only two states to give law enforcement the ability in state statute to neither confirm nor deny a broad range of public records relating to investigatory methods and technologies.
Wessler, the ACLU staff attorney, said Maine's law is more sweeping than a similar law in Indiana, the only other state he's found to have codified a Glomar response in state law. He said Indiana's law requires proof that disclosing the information would harm an investigation or an individual, whereas Maine's does not.
"In Maine, it doesn't have to hurt anybody," Wessler said. "It could be information that's completely in the public interest and that wouldn't interfere with any law enforcement investigation and the police department still has to withhold any mention of whether they have documents or don't have documents."
The state police interpretation of the statute highlights what may be an unintended consequence of a 2013 rewrite of state laws pertaining to criminal history records and intelligence and investigative materials.
It's only one line in a 20-plus-page rewrite, but it has broad implications on the public's ability to understand the type of technologies police are deploying, the cost of that technology and what policies are in place to prevent misuse.
A section titled "Confirming the existence or nonexistence of confidential intelligence and investigative record information" states: "A Maine criminal justice agency may not confirm the existence or nonexistence of intelligence and investigative record information confidential under section 804 to any person or public or private entity that is not eligible to receive the information itself."
A review of the legislative file does not suggest that section of the bill received much discussion. It was pitched as a way to clarify and improve an existing law.
Marc Malon, the legislative and press liaison for the Maine Attorney General's Office, referred all questions about the 2013 law change to Charles Leadbetter, a retired assistant to the attorney general who was the point person for the rewrite.
Leadbetter said in a brief interview that the lengthy summary of the bill spoke for itself. That summary says that section of the law had no previous counterpart, but was modeled after a similar provision intended to protect confidential information about a specific person.
Malon did not respond to requests to speak to any other officials in the AG's office and whether state police were interpreting the law correctly.
Representatives of Gov. Janet Mills, who was the attorney general in 2013, did not respond to interview requests. And Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck requested that questions be submitted in writing and has yet to respond to questions sent on Jan. 22.
Maine's sweeping use of that exemption is raising concerns among civil liberties advocates.
McQuade, the assistant professor, said the lack of disclosure prevents any meaningful oversight of the technology and allows law enforcement to establish a pattern of behavior before lawmakers and the public can have a discussion about whether or even how to use it. And any policies that come after the fact can be greatly influenced by the pattern of behavior already established, he said.
"We see how police practice actually molds the law," McQuade said. "It should be very threatening if you take the Constitution seriously. This is a big imbalance of power that gives the executive branch powers that are reserved on paper for the legislative bodies."
Clare Garvie, a researcher at Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, said that only two states would neither confirm nor deny use of facial recognition technology while she was conducting research for a 2016 report titled "The Perpetual Line-up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America." Those states were Maine and Massachusetts, she said.
That study, which sought records from 106 law enforcement agencies, found that 26 to 30 states allow law enforcement to run or request searches against their driver's license and state identification databases and roughly one in two American adults have their photos searched this way. Despite the state's refusal to provide information, Maine was listed as being capable of searching FBI mug shots - information gleaned from a U.S. Government Accountability Office report.
Wessler, of the ACLU, said privacy advocates got a similar response while researching the use of cell site simulators by law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Wessler said that only Maine and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would neither confirm nor deny the use of cell site simulators in response to public records requests from either the ACLU, privacy researchers or the press.
Both technologies have been the subject of inquiry by the GAO, which has generally called for more transparency and more privacy protections for innocent civilians.
"Police departments have a lot of power and we expect them to use that power responsibly to protect us," Wessler said. "But American history is replete with examples of abuses by police and that's why there needs to be strong oversight and transparency into their practices."
SIGNS POINTING TO USE
Despite the secrecy, there is evidence Maine may be using some of this technology.
Three years ago, Parr, the state police attorney, acknowledged in emails with Georgetown Law researchers that the agency was working with the FBI to conduct "considerable testing" of facial recognition technology.
The acknowledgement came five months after Maine had been listed in a 2016 report by the GAO as one of seven states to have an agreement with the FBI to conduct facial recognition searches on its federal database. The other states were Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas and Arkansas.
The report - "Facial Recognition Technology: FBI Should Better Ensure Privacy and Accuracy" - said Maine was one of 15 states plus the District of Columbia that had the technical ability to conduct facial recognition searches of the FBI's Next Generation Identification-Interstate Photo System. That database has over over 90 million civil and criminal photos and images of scars, marks and tattoos, according to a follow-up report in 2019. Of the 93 million photos, 38 million were criminal photos. And law enforcement has the ability to add photos of unknown individuals who are part of a federal investigation.
Maine State Police entered into an agreement to search that database back in 2012. The 2016 GAO report states that from the beginning of the pilot program in 2011 through 2015, search requests from each participating state ranged from under 20 by one state to 14,000 by another state. The report does not say how many search requests came from Maine.
In response to public records requests submitted by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, Parr told researchers that Maine was currently testing the technology, but had made no decision about how or whether to use it in the future. His response came after both the GAO and the Georgetown reports were published.
"For some time Maine has been working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Systems Division to implement the use of facial recognition technology," Parr wrote. "Although at this point we technically are capable of using the technology, we have been in no hurry to do so without considerable testing, which we still are conducting."
More than three years later, it is still not clear to what extent Maine is searching this database and what policies guide those searches.
At the time, Parr noted that the state had received the FBI's policy and implementation guide and that the state would likely draft its own. In 2018, Parr told researchers that the state's position had not changed.
But, in 2019, Parr told the Press Herald and Telegram even less.
"As a matter of law, we are unable to confirm the existence or nonexistence of records or information responsive to the request. See 16 M.R.S.A. § 807," Parr wrote.
Knowing whether state police are using facial recognition could become more important this year.
Maine is in the midst of rolling out new driver's licenses and state identification cards that are compliant with the federal Real ID program - a move that could greatly expand the number of photos that can be searched using facial recognition.
USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION FOR REAL ID
Beginning in October, Mainers will need to have a Real ID or a passport if they want to board an airplane or enter a secure federal facility. Getting that form of identification requires a photo that can be more effectively used in a facial recognition system. That could greatly expand the number of photos law enforcement can search.
Real ID photos are especially suited for facial recognition searches, because of their high resolution. In 2017, the state said "Real ID applicants must ... submit to a photograph using facial recognition technology."
And while Maine law currently prevents state officials from outside agencies, including the FBI, from searching its database, an effort is underway to change that.
A bill submitted by the Secretary of State's Office, which oversees the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, would allow the bureau's investigators to conduct searches of its Real ID database for outside agencies.
Secretary of State Matt Dunlap said his office is still developing rules for conducting those searches. But he said the state would continue to prohibit outside agencies, such as the FBI, from having open-ended access to the database.
"Nobody is going to have wholesale access to the database," Dunlap said. "We've never allowed that and we're not proposing it now."
Dunlap said the bill is intended to allow the BMV to help police identify specific individuals.
Dunlap cited a police standoff as an example. Police could provide the BMV with a person's name and other information, and the BMV would provide police with a license photo so they can locate the correct person. It's a practice that occurs with the old license system, he said.
Dunlap said the state "would never" allow an outside agency to search the database to identify individuals who were captured on camera attending a public rally or demonstration.
However, the Real ID system and the proposed legislation would open up a new avenue of searches by allowing police to submit a photo of an unknown person to the BMV so it can run a facial recognition search in hopes of digging up a positive ID. That would essentially put anyone who has a Real ID into a virtual lineup.
Dunlap said those types of searches could be allowed under certain circumstances if the bill passes. But he stressed facial recognition alone is not enough to establish a positive identification and that additional verification is needed.
"You don't ascertain identity with only one element," he said.
The bill, L.D. 1899, "An Act to Amend Certain Motor Vehicle Laws," received a public hearing on Jan. 23 before the Legislature's Committee on Transportation.
Michael Kebede, policy counsel for the ACLU of Maine, spoke in opposition to the bill as drafted. He asked the committee to consider an amendment that would restrict facial recognition searches only to emergency situations where there is an imminent threat to life.
Kebede said the technology poses "grave risks" for black people, especially black women, transgender people and immigrant communities, because it misidentifies these groups at higher rates than it does Caucasians.
"Persistent identification and tracking can have a chilling effect, as people will be less likely to exercise their rights if they know the government is tracking and identifying them everywhere they go," Kebede said. "Mainers must be able to visit substance use clinics, churches and synagogues, friends and family, political protests and doctors' offices without fear that a government agent is secretly keeping tabs on their every movement."
During a Feb. 6 work session, the Transportation Committee amended the bill to include the ACLU of Maine's amendment, as well as requiring the BMV to draft "major substantive rules for other authorized uses of facial recognition technology."
Dunlap said he shares the concerns of privacy advocates who worry about misuse. The state resisted complying with the Real ID program for years, he said, but lawmakers changed course when the federal government announced that people would no longer be able to fly on a commercial airliner or enter a federal building without a non-Real ID-compliant form of identification or passport.
He said that each time the database is searched, it logs a record of who searched it and when. It's unclear whether those records would be public because the rules are still being considered.
"Facial recognition really scares a lot of people and I think it really should," Dunlap said. "I think people have good reason to be freaked out about that."
Although Dunlap stressed that searches could only be conducted by BMV staff on behalf of other agencies, those employees already work closely with other federal, state and local law enforcement officials.
The BMV is one of 12 agencies that provide staffing and support for the Maine Information and Analysis Center, one of roughly 80 so-called fusion centers created in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks whose specific activities are also kept under wraps.
FUSION CENTER
Maine State Police oversee operations at the Maine Information and Analysis Center.
The center's 12-member staff includes federal, state and local officials, among them representatives of the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the BMV, which is building a database that could be searched with facial recognition technologies through the Real ID program.
Its activities are overseen by a 12-member advisory board. It includes one civilian and a private attorney, while the other 10 members include four members from the Maine State Police, Attorney General Aaron Frey, Douglas Farnham, adjutant general of the Maine National Guard, and a representative from Central Maine Power Co. Maine State Police Lt. Michael Johnston, the fusion center's director, said that a CMP representative is on the board because part of the center's mission is to protect critical infrastructure, including utilities.
Little is known about the activities of Maine's fusion center. Its investigations involve counterterrorism, felony drug crimes, violent crimes, including domestic violence, and property crimes, among others, Johnston said.
Johnston would not say what types of technologies are available to state and local police agencies, which submit daily inquiries to the center, and he would not provide a detailed budget, meeting minutes from an advisory committee tasked with oversight, or any audits of the center's operation without first conferring with Parr, the attorney. Parr has not yet indicated whether any documents would be released in response to the request.
Johnston said the center receives inquiries from local police and other agencies on a regular basis. But he would not point to any cases in which the information or the analysis from the center helped apprehend a suspect. "We have small victories every day," he said. "We're just a piece of the puzzle."
When asked about protecting citizens' privacy, Johnston said the fusion center operates within the constraints of the Constitution, as well as state and federal laws, policies and directives. The center is assessed annually by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and undergoes a regular audit, as well as being overseen by the advisory board, which is supposed to meet at least once a year.
Those audits and other records, however, were not immediately available.
The center's privacy policy is online. It does not reveal what types of technologies are used at the center, but it does lay out the ground rules for acquiring, storing and retaining information.
The policy states that the center may only seek, acquire and retain information that relates to a possible threat or criminal predicate, based on reasonable suspicion and that comes from a reliable source, among other requirements. However, it also states that the center "may retain information that is based on a level of suspicion that is less than 'reasonable suspicion,' such as tips and leads or a suspicious activity report."
The policy says that methods of acquiring information must be legal and the center shall not directly or indirectly seek, acquire or retain information from a nongovernmental partner if it suspects that partner is legally prohibited from having or disclosing that information, acquired that information through a method that the center itself could not legally use, or if the information itself could not be legally obtained by the center. Outside partners must certify in writing that they comply with laws and their methods are not based on misleading information-gathering practices.
"There are multi-layers of oversight for the fusion center," Johnston said. "While we're protecting them (citizens) from physical threats and harms, we have to make sure we're protecting their civil rights and liberties and that we're balancing the two."

Texto completo: A U.S. president with slipping approval ratings moves to shore up his conservative bona fides by pledging to reform a crucial government safety net program. He and his surrogates breathlessly insist that the current system is in crisis. Broadcast news outlets provide little context for " or economic analysis of " the claims.
Sounds a lot like President Trump's attacks on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, but as Paul Krugman reminds us in his new book, 'Arguing With Zombies: Economics, Politics, and the Fight for a Better Future,' conservatives' use of misleading or inaccurate information to justify cuts to assistance and entitlement programs dates back years, most notably to George W. Bush's failed 2004 effort to privatize Social Security.

Loyal readers of Krugman's twice-weekly column in the New York Times will not be surprised by the central themes of the book, which includes and expands on his Times writings. He forcefully and repeatedly contends that Republican lawmakers are carrying water for corporations and the wealthiest Americans by rolling back regulations and cutting taxes for the rich on the basis of the fake or 'zombie' theory that what's good for the 1 percent is good for everybody. (In Krugman's vivid language, zombie ideas are those 'that should have been killed by contrary evidence, but instead keep shambling along, eating people's brains.')
Still, the book is a revelation. It showcases the range of Krugman's intellect " he can toggle authoritatively from climate change and the Green New Deal to the Maastricht Treaty and currency crises " and his gift for clear, accessible writing. He neatly mixes pop cultural references and economic data; one column calling for 1950s-era tax policies (back then the marginal tax rate on top incomes was more than 90 percent) is whimsically titled 'The Twinkie Manifesto.'
But Krugman's real superpower may be his longevity. He began contributing to the Times in 2000, and he has chronicled numerous economic policies and proposals that have been promoted or propped up by zombie claims. He opens his book with a chapter on the push to privatize Social Security " by turning it over to financial services companies " with a series of columns showing that, contrary to Bush administration reports, the program is highly functional. He proceeds to dismantle other corporate and conservative talking points in vogue over the years: The Trump tax cut will pay for itself! (In fact, federal tax receipts on corporate income have plunged, and the budget deficit is now more than $1 trillion.) Government needs to be more fiscally responsible! (See aforementioned tax cut, which didn't come with concomitant spending cuts.) A disciple of John Maynard Keynes, Krugman eviscerates lawmakers in the United States for wringing their hands, post-financial crisis, over budget deficits caused by stimulus spending, which actually keep an economy from ruinous contraction. Without, say, unemployment benefits, families cut their spending, which in turn hurts vendors of goods and services.
Taken together, all these arguments with zombies reveal much about the electorate and the Republican Party of today. Krugman writes: 'I see Trump not as a departure from the past so much as the culmination of where movement conservatism' " an elitist dogma wrapped in populist rhetoric " 'has been taking us for decades.'
Krugman doesn't shy from calling out the mean-spiritedness that underlies much of the conservative agenda. One new essay is titled 'The Cruelty Caucus.' Indeed, there's little economic rationale for cutting food stamps for work-eligible adults, as the Trump administration has; Krugman notes that the United States actually spends very little helping low-income Americans. Nor is there a financial rationale for opting out of Medicaid expansion, as 14 states have. 'Refusing free money that would help the poor is something else " it's cruelty for its own sake,' Krugman writes.
The book is unexpectedly light on the topic of trade, for which he won what he calls the 'Swedish thingie.' (Krugman won his Nobel Prize for an analysis of trade patterns.) In the introduction to his 13-page chapter on trade wars, Krugman notes that 'international trade and international trade policy aren't as important as people think they are,' as if to justify the glossing over of what's (not) to come. But I would have loved more insight into his thinking on the flavor of free trade that has become commonplace among liberal elites in business, even as the rise of populists on the left and the right has exposed the shortcomings of globalization.
Krugman's critics on the right will surely take issue with his writings on Trump's economic policies by pointing to record-high stock prices and the 11-year expansion of the U.S. gross domestic product. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with Krugman's underlying message that the current system is hurting the poor to the benefit of the rich and corporations. According to the Census Bureau, a key index that measures the gap between the wealthiest and poorest Americans is the highest it has been in 50 years.
The problem is so acute that some businesses " the very beneficiaries of many of Trump's policies " have proactively embraced the notion of inclusive capitalism, essentially acknowledging that the system is broken if it doesn't work for everyone. Companies such as Bank of America are voluntarily raising their minimum wages; others, such as Mastercard, are enhancing their retirement plans. The Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of some of the country's biggest corporations, last year adopted a new statement of purpose, acknowledging that Americans are struggling, and modernizing its principles to invest in employees and support the communities where its members operate.
Krugman probably wouldn't object to these measures, but he might offer another suggestion. Corporations have entire teams dedicated to finding ways to reduce their payments to the federal government. Maybe in addition to being more benevolent to their workers, they could just pay their taxes.

AREN'T WE BETTER THAN THIS?

Texto completo: I have a bad habit that I mean to break.
I begin my day each morning reading the news.
This is logical for an old newspaperman. I have bet most of my adult life on the proposition that news matters. It is the first rough draft of history. It is the lifeblood of democracy. The news is a sort of blood draw on us - a way to assess the health of the American experiment.
But even news that informs seems to be a less and less positive way to start the day. It's not good for one's mental health to see case after case and day after day of the anger management problem in our politics.
Watching the president of the United States refuse to shake the hand of the speaker of the House at the State of the Union last week makes me grieve for the republic.
Watching the speaker tear up the president's speech at the end of that speech was disturbing, on several levels.
These spectacles are embarrassing as well as sad. Are we all back in seventh grade? Can anyone imagine President Dwight Eisenhower refusing to shake the hand of Speaker Sam Rayburn? Can anyone imagine Speaker Rayburn tearing up the president's speech for the cameras and the woke?
And you know why that is unimaginable?
First, civility, what they used to call comity in Washington, mattered once. That's how they got things done. Democrats and Republicans ate and drank together after hours. The wives of members of Congress (almost all men then) did civic projects together. Their children grew up together.
But, second, Gen. Eisenhower and Speaker Rayburn had respect for the office as well as the person holding the office. You just don't treat the speaker of the House like that. You don't disrespect a president like that.
Maybe this all started with the Republican who shouted "you lie" during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address some years ago. No one in my lifetime had shown that kind of disrespect toward the president in the House chamber. But the House member who acted out paid no price for shattering the decorum of the moment and the place. Now we have progressed to the president and the speaker as schoolyard bullies - in the chamber.
Call it the reverse evolution of American leadership.
The evolution began when Richard Nixon dispatched Spiro T. Agnew to travel the nation in the midterm elections of 1970 - to engage in protracted character assassination. Democrats and liberals were not just wrong on policy. They were stupid, weak and unpatriotic. This was a kind of generalization and personalization of what the great historian Richard Hofstadter called "the paranoid style in American politics."
From Adams to Agnew is not progress. And we have seen the progressive coarsening of our public conversation and our public men and women ever since.
It's OK for someone to ask a presidential candidate what kind of underwear he wears. And it's OK for him to answer.
It's OK for a CNN talking head to call Bernie Sanders a liar on national TV.
It's OK for Liz Warren to simply walk away from a challenging questioner in Iowa.
Or for Joe Biden to go off on a reporter for a perfectly reasonable question he should be able to answer. And to keep doing it.
It's OK for the president to say the speaker "hates America."
That 's really an outrageous thing to say.
We have defined decency down about as far as it will go, and the politics of public happiness, which Sen. Eugene McCarthy talked about so many years ago, is giving way to the politics of hate.
That's what name-calling and disdain without limits really is. The politics of demonizing and the cancel culture is the politics of hate.
And make no mistake, it's not just in Washington. I get hate mail every single day. Sometimes it is accusatory: You have buried a story because you are biased. Prove that you haven't! (The paranoid style again.) Sometimes, instead of email, people leave phone messages that are a string of shouted epithets.
When did it become OK for Americans to impugn and insult each other because they see the world differently? Being allowed to see the world differently is what the country is about.
How do we get out of the anger/reaction syndrome? That's the question.
It's a question that nags and haunts.
It is going to take a change of habits and of heart, as well as personnel.
I don't know if it is true, but the activist and filmmaker Michael Moore claimed the other day that he's never heard Bernie Sanders utter a mean word about Hillary Clinton. Wouldn't that be refreshing? If our leaders refused to respond to personal insult in kind? If they kept their tongues - out of a sense of privacy and limits and respect for both office and person?
I admired Bernie when a New York Times editorial board member asked him, as all the candidates were asked, to tell of a time someone broke his heart. He said that there are limits to political speech and inquiry, and even presidential candidates are entitled to privacy. "No," he said "I won't respond."
I have another idea: federalism.
If we could decentralize the government and the media and redistribute power back to cities, towns and states, two things might happen: lesser stakes in D.C. and more person-to-person interaction. It's hard to hate face to face.
Imagine CNN based in Kansas City. Or HHS in Wheeling. Or the DNC headquarters in St. Paul and the RNC HQ in Birmingham.
If we are to re-civilize our politics, we will need a new scene and stage as well as actors.
On the way to decentralization benign neglect might be the best medicine. Let's stop paying so much attention to the president's tweets and the speaker's pious lectures. She has lost all moral authority. And the president has willingly abdicated his.
I will be doing my part. Instead of reaching for my phone, I will be starting my day with a reading from the Gospel of John, or a poem by Yeats or Elizabeth Bishop, a yoga meditation, or maybe Dr. Seuss. Anything but the latest dispatch from the mud wars.

Texto completo: O
ne of the things photographer Dolly Faibyshev loves most about her job is the way it gives her a window onto strange and special events " and an excuse to capture the Orchid Show, a clown convention and the massive celebration of Dolly Parton that is DollyPalooza.
Faibyshev started photographing the Westminster Dog Show in New York on a whim nearly a decade ago after seeing coverage on television, and she's been going back " as well as to other dog shows " with some frequency in the years since, collecting eye-catching and often comical portraits along the way.
Her book of photos, 'Best in Show,' is out this month. To mark the occasion, she chatted about the challenges of getting the perfect shot, her favorite dog breed and some of the strange things she's witnessed backstage.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: It seems like you bring a very particular perspective. You're zooming in on paws or brooches or, in one case, a dog's back side. What are you trying to capture?
A: Honestly, everything. I love texture. I love color. I love thinking about what the dogs and the humans are going through. Like, while they're there, do the dogs know what's going on? I can't help but notice the faraway look in the dogs' eyes while they're being groomed. A lot of them are so calm throughout the process, they've done this a countless number of times. Some even look like they're enjoying the process of getting pampered like a human would.
I also love composition, so I'm sort of looking for everything and anything that catches my eye.

Q: It feels like there's almost a comedic element to some of it. Is that something that defines your work?
A: Yeah, definitely, though not in everything I do. I don't know that I look for humor, but I find it.
Q: I saw a can of hair spray in one of the photos on your website, which caught my eye. It seems like an obvious thing to have at a dog show, but still funny. Are there other surprising or strange things you've seen?
A: I've been doing it so long that it's like it's all normal to me now. The funny thing is I've also been shooting Fashion Week for many years for the New York Times and other publications, and it's kind of similar, in a way, backstage. There are a lot of strange hair products and powders. There's cornstarch for the white-haired dogs to get their hair more white. The groomers have all kinds of little tricks like wrapping the coat of the longer-haired dogs in sections, I think it's to keep it clean and from getting tangled. But they also use a lot of the same tools that humans use, like straightening irons, hair spray and hair dryers.
It doesn't come across in the book, but there are a lot of strange smells " from all of the different products and fur, and they obviously have to take them to the bathroom backstage, too. So it's a very unique scent.
Q: How does capturing dogs differ from, say, the challenges of Fashion Week or a clown convention?
A: The dogs are very fast. They move around a lot. So getting a good picture of them in motion or trying to get them to look at the camera is difficult. But other than that, these are dogs that are very well behaved, so it's not too difficult.

Q: Do you have a favorite dog or handler from the years that you've been going?
A: I've always loved poodles. I just think they're so funny to photograph. They're beautiful but humorous at the same time. There's so much work that goes into making them look so statuesque, and they actually seem very intelligent.
Q: Are you a dog owner?
A: I'm not. I grew up with dogs, and I was a cat owner. I just love animals in general, but they're a little bit too high maintenance for me to have one.

Texto completo: An investigation into the Confederation of African Football uncovered information suggesting that tens of millions of dollars had been misappropriated.
An audit of the governing body for soccer in Africa has uncovered millions of dollars of financial irregularities, a development that threatens to bring down its leadership after more than a year of turmoil at the troubled organization.
The board of the governing body, the Confederation of African Football, or C.A.F., agreed last year to an independent review of its operations amid accusations of financial wrongdoing made by a group of former senior executives at the Cairo-based organization. Its president, Ahmad Ahmad, is also the subject of an ethics inquiry by soccer's global governing body, FIFA, and by the authorities in France.
A 55-page report by the accountancy firm PWC, hired to audit the confederation, paints an ugly picture that is likely to lead to demands for swift action against the confederation's leadership. The auditors found problems across the board, including with the dispensation of millions of dollars of soccer development funds sent to the African soccer body by FIFA.
The report also cited payments for gifts and, in at least one instance, for organizing a funeral.
"I have been left shocked and dismayed, though my fears have now been vindicated," said Musa Bility, a former head of soccer in Liberia who had called for the audit in May before he was banned by FIFA for misappropriating soccer funds, allegations that he has denied.
The report provided yet another reminder of the challenges for good governance facing global soccer, which was rocked in 2015 when the United States filed a sweeping indictment that laid out in vivid detail accusations of decades of corruption and wrongdoing by some of the sport's most senior administrators.
The executive summary of the PWC report, which was obtained by The New York Times, outlines a slew of troubling information. The report's authors wrote that, "Potential elements of mismanagement and possible abuse of power were found in key areas of finance and operations of C.A.F."
The report said that FIFA had remitted a total of $ 51 million to the African governing body from 2015 to 2018 and that since then, about $ 24 million of that amount had been disbursed by African soccer officials. In reviewing 40 payments totaling $ 10 million, auditors found that just five of the payments, adding up to $ 1.6 million, had sufficient documentation to confirm what the money would be spent on. The rest lacked information that in some cases made it impossible to identify the beneficiaries of the funds.
The auditors wrote that they were stymied in doing their work in many cases because the records "are unreliable and not trustworthy due to several manual adjustments."
FIFA has so far declined to comment.
The revelations come a week after FIFA announced that a mission led by its secretary general, Fatma Samoura, intended to restore order at African soccer's governing body, had been completed and that the administrator would be returning to its headquarters in Zurich.
"FIFA is happy that the joint effort made with C.A.F. was done and delivered within the initial proposed time frame and reiterates its commitment to be at the disposal of African football to assist in the process of raising its level to the top of the world," FIFA said at the time.
Mr. Ahmad, the C.A.F. president, declined to comment. He is already facing an uncertain future amid an ethics investigation that started last year over claims of financial mismanagement and accusations of sexual harassment. He has denied any wrongdoing.
He was also questioned by French financial crimes prosecutors in Paris last summer over a payment to an equipment company based there that is linked to one of his close friends. That investigation was continuing.
The details of those payments also appear in the audit report. Flows of money connected to transactions between C.A.F. and bank accounts in the Gulf linked to the owner of the French company Tactical Steel were deemed by PWC to be "highly suspicious" and "may potentially indicate a kickback arrangement between parties involved or a case of tax evasion through offshore payments." Tactical Steel has denied any wrongdoing.
The new revelations come at a crucial time for FIFA and for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has devoted much of the past year to C.A.F., one of soccer's six regional governing bodies. This past week in Morocco, Mr. Infantino outlined an action plan for Africa at a gathering of the continent's soccer leaders.
"We have to develop African solutions to African problems," Mr. Infantino said, detailing initiatives that included a $ 1 billion fund to develop the sport on the continent.
But it now seems clear that the past will have to be dealt with before FIFA can move forward with any major changes at the African confederation.
The details revealed in the audit are likely to lead to a flurry of new cases for FIFA's ethics department, which has yet to deal with a number of longstanding investigations, including the one into Mr. Ahmad.
The ethics complaint at FIFA accuses him of misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars of federation money to make $ 20,000 payments into the private bank accounts of some African soccer leaders, to purchase a fleet of cars for his use in Madagascar and to enter into questionable contractual agreements, including the one with Tactical Steel.
Mr. Ahmad has blamed the case on disgruntled former employees.
This month, FIFA and C.A.F. announced a joint action plan to take significant power away from the African organization's board, which is composed of soccer leaders from across the continent. The audit revealed that many of those same officials had received thousands of dollars in cash payments without a justifiable business case.

Aging population finds needs aren't being met There's a rising demand for geriatricians, but few doctors are attracted to specialty

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
"I was not doing well emotionally," she recalled. "Physically, I didn't have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn't getting to work."
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn't seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, "Mommy needs an intervention."
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels "full of spirit" and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. "She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don't do anymore," Poskanzer said. "And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of."
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what's most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can't easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation's older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. "It's basically stagnation," said Aldis Petriceks, the study's lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
"These are smart people looking at economic reality," said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. "Having patience, having good communication skills, it's a different personality than being a surgeon," Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true "when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85," said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
"She's had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another," said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. "I thought, 'Let's see if there's a way to make her life easier.' "
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
"It's less of 'Let's order this med, let's order that procedure,' more of a holistic approach," Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, "we're not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians," Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they're also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as "a small, elite workforce" who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
"The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues" understand these patients' needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.

Texto completo: An acclaimed series airs its final season on Showtime. And a new series of New York vignettes is on HBO.
What's on TV
HOMELAND 9 p.m. on Showtime. Carried by Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, a bipolar C.I.A. officer, and Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, her mentor, this series begins its final run. When the show began in 2011, a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, Carrie was investigating a POW-turned-al-Qaeda-agent, who later became her lover. In battling the effects of the war in Afghanistan -- a conflict that has lasted a generation -- "Carrie was a kind of synecdoche for a rattled America," James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times. "She both fought the shadow war for us and felt it," he added. Now, in its eighth season, "Homeland" puts Carrie back in Afghanistan after months of Russian confinement. With the resurfacing of some Season 1 characters, the season places emphasis on Carrie and Saul's relationship over the years.
THE 92ND ACADEMY AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. The 2020 Oscars will forgo a host for the second year in a row, citing success from last year's awards after Kevin Hart became enmeshed in controversy. Several nominees for the best picture title, including "Little Women" and Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," are period pieces. Among the nominees for best director are Sam Mendes for "1917" and Bong Joon Ho for "Parasite," which is the only foreign film nominated in the best picture category.
What's Streaming
HIGH MAINTENANCE Stream on HBO and Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. This narrator-free third-person series, which began on Vimeo before moving to HBO in 2016, is back for its fourth season on the platform. "High Maintenance," at its most simple, is about a beloved, nameless pot dealer known as The Guy who, as he bikes around New York, is "a temporary friend-shrink-rabbi," James Poniewozik wrote in his review of Season 1. But in the bigger picture, it's a show about the lives and neuroses of New Yorkers, threaded together by The Guy with pot as a mere catalyst for their stories. "'High Maintenance' has a wide ambit," Willy Staley wrote for The Times, "and its vignette-­based structure provides it the freedom to depict New York more accurately and fully than anything that has come before it."
GHOST (1990) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Molly Jensen's (Demi Moore) life is shaken when her lover, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), is suddenly killed in a violent mugging. But instead of moving to the next world, Sam becomes a ghost, and he's incredibly confused by the situation at hand. As he learns the ways of partial existence (how to move objects and walk through doors, for example), he realizes he cannot communicate with his beloved -- so he finds himself a psychic who can. Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) makes it her mission to help Sam connect with Molly, warn her of impending danger and enact revenge on his killer.

Texto completo: Back in 1975, Thelma Schoonmaker helped create a National Geographic series for WQED public television about the upcoming American bicentennial. "Decades of Decision" was a five-part imagining of what life was like for ordinary citizens during the American Revolution.
Schoonmaker, 80, is still exploring the American experience, but in a vastly different arena. As longtime editor for director Martin Scorsese, she has helped shape how filmgoers see his vision. She's been really good at it. And on Sunday she might bring home her fourth Academy Award for doing so, this time for "The Irishman."
The 92nd Oscars ceremony will be at the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood&Vine Center, with red carpet strolls beginning around 6:30 p.m. and the big show at 8 p.m. ABC will carry live coverage on numerous platforms, including broadcast, cable and its ABC.GO app.
Pittsburgh native Billy Porter will be among the hosts with Tamron Hall, Elvis Mitchell, Ryan Seacrest and Lily Aldridge for ABC's red carpet look just before the awards broadcast.
Cord-cutters can stream through a number of sites, including Hulu With Live TV, YouTube TV, PlayStation Vue, Oscars.Go.Com and with The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Twitter account, @TheAcademy. Hulu will have the festivities for regular subscribers Monday. The official Oscars press site notes the awards will be viewed in 225 countries and territories.
On E!, the red carpet will be aggressively reported starting around 1 p.m. Sunday.
Nine films are vying for best picture: "Ford v Ferrari," "The Irishman," "Jojo Rabbit," "Joker," "Little Women," "Marriage Story," "1917," "Once Upon a Time . in Hollywood" and "Parasite."
"Joker" has the most nominations with 11, followed by "The Irishman," "1917" and "Once Upon a Time" with 10 each. Netflix, which produced "Marriage Story," has 24 nominations. Disney/Fox is next with 23. Sony Pictures - which produced the shot-in-Pittsburgh Fred Rogers' tale, "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" - has 20.
Schoonmaker won her previous Oscars for "Raging Bull" (1980), "The Aviator" (2004) and "The Departed" (2006).
A graduate of Cornell University who met Scorsese more than 50 years ago in a summer program at New York University, Schoonmaker was once asked how she could work on such violent films. She famously answered, "Marty's movies aren't violent until I cut them."
With eight each, she and Steven Spielberg collaborator Michael Kahn hold the record for most Oscar nominations in editing. They, along, with Ralph Dawson and Daniel Mandell, have all won three times.
Depending on how one takes stock in Oscars lore, consider Schoonmaker's nomination a big plus for "The Irishman." Only once in the past 40 years has a film won best picture without a nomination for editing.
Director Sam Mendes "1917," which employs a bit of neat trickery to appear it was filmed in one unbroken shot, is a strong best picture candidate but was not nominated for editing.
"Birdman," starring Pittsburgh native Michael Keaton, was the exception - it won the big prize at the 2015 Oscars without an editing nomination. Like "1917," the film was shot to make long scenes appear unbroken by cuts.
Although the Pittsburgh-shot "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" did not get a best picture nomination, star Tom Hanks is up for best supporting actor. Marielle Heller was among the women left out, for a second straight year, in the directing categories. With Lulu Wang ("The Farewell"), Greta Gerwig ("Little Women") and Lorene Scafaria ("Hustlers"), she's in good company.
Like last year, the Oscars will not have an official host but will employ a bevy of stars to introduce each category. The 2019 winners for acting - Olivia Colman, Rami Malek, Regina King and Mahershala Ali - will grace the stage to hand out those winners' statuettes.
For no apparent reason, Billie Eilish will sing at the ceremony. For the third consecutive year, an actress nominee will also perform a nominated song. Broadway superstar Cynthia Erivo ("Harriet") will sing "Stand Up." Mary J. Blige ("Mudbound") and Lady Gaga ("A Star Is Born") were previous performers.
This year's performers for nominated songs are Randy Newman ("I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away" from "Toy Story 4"), Elton John ("I'm Gonna Love Me Again" from "Rocketman"), Chrissy Metz ("I'm Standing With You" from "Breakthrough") and Idina Menzel ("Into the Unknown" from "Frozen II").
No word yet if John Travolta will introduce Menzel, but we can hope. Hollywood loves a second chance, after all.

Texto completo: Did reaction to Matthew Lopez's award-winning play about gay history vary by generation? We put that question to readers of our theater newsletter.
Ben Brantley's review of "The Inheritance" drew more than 100 comments, signaling the strong reactions engendered by the show. (One reader called the play "pompous, elitist, superficial" and "magnetically entertaining" all at once.) Did the show's impact vary by generation? We put that question to readers of our theater newsletter. An edited selection of their responses follows. (You can subscribe to the free newsletter here ).
I've never felt so personally connected to a play as I did watching this, particularly Part One. I saw myself and many friends in the characters, and as a 57-year-old who tested positive for H.I.V. at 27, I found the focus on the epidemic cathartic and evocative. It was also nice to feel so "seen," since gay men, particularly white gay men, are sometimes vilified within the L.G.B.T.Q. community these days, accused of not being woke enough fast enough. DENNIS EDWARDS, Miami
While beautifully staged and acted, there is not enough there for six hours of theater, at least for an American audience. So much of the material has been done before -- "Torch Song Trilogy," "The Normal Heart," "The Boys in the Band"-- that the first play almost appears to be a revival. Part Two brings us to the present day, but does not and cannot bring us to conclusion. MARY LOU WINNICK, Longboat Key, Fla.
As a gay millennial, I've never felt a piece of theater heal something in me and break me at the same time the way "The Inheritance" did. The storytelling reaffirms that less is more in an age when more is monotony. RYAN HAMMAN, Chicago
I'm a 31-year-old gay man, and I was interested in seeing the production based on word of mouth and the reviews from the West End. In the end, I had mixed feelings. I enjoyed the play when it was telling the story of Eric and Toby's crumbling relationship, and was less interested in didactic scenes where the play felt to be in conversation with itself about (to me) well-known history and complaints about "young gays these days." The end of Part One gave me hope, but Part Two felt to be more of the same: a mostly white, mostly handsome, 30-something perspective. While it was moving to be in a theater with many gay men a bit older than myself who seemed incredibly touched by the play, it didn't work on me in the same way. KARL HINZE, New York
I am a 47-year-old woman from Texas. I was captivated from start to finish, even given the length. As someone who was young and not part of the community impacted by AIDS, I didn't fully grasp the breadth of the suffering. As a mother, I was especially moved by Margaret's telling of how she came to work at Walter's home. Most parents can relate to saying things that they later regret and worry about the damage done by their words and actions. AMY HUFFORD, Austin, Tex.
Seeing "The Inheritance," I felt a renewed imperative to open myself to love and to give my love to others, as tricky and scary and messy as that can be. It was no abstract, hypothetical power that the play exercised, either. It has had a direct effect on actions that I've taken since I saw it. I can't say that for the vast majority of theater I have seen. JOSEPH MEDEIROS, New York
I'm part of the generation of gay men who survived the worst of the AIDS crisis, and frankly I was unprepared for the depth of feeling the play would generate in me. The end of Part One took my breath away, and, as the lights came up, a gentleman two rows ahead of mine turned back to the young men behind him and introduced himself, saying he just felt like he should "say hello, because of the play." I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that in a Broadway, or any, theater. I won't forget that moment. HARRY ALTHAUS, New York
I found it especially poignant to watch while living through our present-day predicament, a society that continues to carve us up based on identity, age, race, preference. Instead, "The Inheritance" shows us how connected we all truly are -- and urges us never to lose sight of that connectedness, because in the end we are all just humans looking for a purpose, something to fight for, someone to love.

Texto completo: Take it from Jasmine Brand, who started the celebrity news site The Jasmine Brand 10 years ago, and is still going strong.
Years ago, Jasmine Brand wanted to stand out at red carpet events, so she settled on a tactic used by Hollywood stars: She transformed her hair. She dyed it a blazing hot pink to catch the attention of the people she wanted to interview for her recently created entertainment news blog.
The Jasmine Brand started in 2010, during a boom in black celebrity blogs. Outlets like Crunk & Disorderly, The YBF, Necole Bitchie, Concrete Loop, Media Take Out, Straight From the A and Sandra Rose pioneered digital spaces that prioritized news and gossip about well-known black celebrities -- Beyoncé, Will Smith, Tiger Woods -- as well as "blackfamous" stars either unknown to or disregarded by their print predecessors and white peers.
"I always knew I wanted to shed more light on black celebrities because they didn't get the same kind of exposure," Ms. Brand, 35, said. "I also figured I could be objective and neutral and give a newsy point of view, but still talk about celebs that my audience cares about."
Now, a decade later, The Jasmine Brand has outlived most of those same websites that inspired her own, having grown from a one-woman passion project into an operation that, according to Ms. Brand, garners up to 195,000 page views daily and 2.1 million unique visitors monthly.
The Jasmine Brand has freelance writers and contributors who find scoops and write stories. Although some stories are sourced from social media posts or aggregated, it's the website's reporting on everything from "Love and Hip Hop" casting to messy divorces that has bolstered the brand's reputation, making it a source for outlets like "The Wendy Williams Show," Page Six and the nationally syndicated radio show "The Breakfast Club."
"I usually source them because they seem to be pretty accurate with a lot of the things that they post," said Charlamagne tha God, a host of "The Breakfast Club."
"Her stories are different," said Angela Yee, another host of "The Breakfast Club." Ms. Yee has developed a close friendship with Ms. Brand over the years and said she checks The Jasmine Brand every day. "I tend to find things that aren't as widely distributed on all the other websites." She also appreciates how the the Jasmine Brand's editorial voice tends to be either "unbiased" or have more of a "positive slant."
How a Brand Becomes a Brand
Dissatisfied with a well-paid corporate marketing director job in Washington, D.C., Ms. Brand, then 25, wanted a hobby that allowed her to write. She had a degree in mass communication and was an avid reader of celebrity news sites. Ms. Brand was also the go-to source for the latest celebrity stories among her friends.
Her daily schedule consisted of blogging before and after work, during lunch hours at a nearby Starbucks and on the weekends, writing up to six to eight stories a day. This lasted until someone at her company discovered a blog post that Ms. Brand had published about Kim Kardashian West. She was informed that the blog was a potential conflict of interest to clients -- so she quit and decided to pursue The Jasmine Brand full-time.
Over the next two years, she sourced, reported on and published most of the daily content herself, earning only a few hundred dollars a month through advertising revenue based on rates Ms. Brand determined by combining her upcoming bills.
Being a self-funded entrepreneur with no business background soon caught up to her, and Ms. Brand was forced to drain her 401(k) and savings to cover her living expenses. Her luxury car was repossessed, and she was evicted from her apartment; she decided to move in with her mother.
In 2013, Mahir Fadle, an investor with a background in finance and computer science, offered investment and continued future funding. The two had been in touch for years, with Mr. Fadle acting as an informal adviser to the website.
"She used to tell me about how she'd get up super early and work before going to work and at lunch and then after work," Mr. Fadle, 42, said. "And I'm an early riser, so I was like, 'Is she really doing this? Let me go ahead and randomly text her at four in the morning."' Ms. Brand would always text him back a few minutes later. "I was like, 'Oh, she's serious,"' he said.
The two ultimately agreed on a 50/50 financial partnership. Mr. Fadle, 42, would not specify how much he has invested, but said it was enough to cover expanding into the Los Angeles market (The Jasmine Brand also has offices in Atlanta and New York), as well as hiring freelance writers, editors, correspondents and videographers; increasing the advertising budget; and obtaining office space and equipment.
The business model is advertising -- display ads, video ads and social media ads coming through both agencies and direct brand buys. "The more traffic we have, the more ads we can display, the more profitable we become," Mr. Fadle said.
They have applied cost-efficient alternatives to traditional media practices -- sometimes sidestepping photo agencies by working directly with freelance photographers to license images. Mr. Fadle said the website saw a significant profit increase in less than a year.
"A lot of people think that if you have this huge office, a big staff and all these accessories, it looks sexy and you're successful," he said. "It just comes down to how you look at your books and how you budget."
Having a popular newsletter also helps. Ms. Brand started the daily "e-bulletin" shortly after creating the website, abandoned it once her workload grew as a solo entrepreneur, then restarted it in 2013 on Mr. Fadle's recommendation. It now has more than 263,000 subscribers.
The website's traffic eclipses the newsletter's, yet the emails, which simply list the day's top 25 stories, have proven to be a "game changer," Ms. Brand said. She said that these emails "land" in the inboxes of high-profile celebrities, agents, editors and other industry powerhouses and foster valuable brand recognition. (Some editors, including several at The New York Times, find The Jasmine Brand in their inbox without having ever signed up.)
"Everyone knows the newsletter before they know the site," Mr. Fadle said.
What's Next?
"It is different now," Ms. Brand said, about the current black celebrity news landscape. "I think we are one of the few sites that are still around from that era. But I understand when it's time to move on, try something else and go to your next chapter."
She said her daily look at Hollywood's behind-the-scenes "ugliness" has jaded her outlook on celebrities, but she preserves her passion for movies with weekly trips to local cinemas, preferring sweatpants and matinee showings over red carpet attire and premieres.
"We've seen a lot of sites come and go during this time. And we've seen sites get really hot and then fall off," Ms. Yee said, when asked about Ms. Brand's decade-long run. "Longevity is a big deal. That's definitely a testament to Jasmine's professionalism."
Today, mindful of their audience's maturation and evolving interests, The Jasmine Brand team plans on debuting at least two spinoff sites, one focusing on health and the other on lifestyle; there are also plans for a makeup line in the coming year.
Ultimately, Ms. Brand wants to land exclusive casting announcements, publishing trailers and on-set images. That's a path to becoming a trade publication along the lines of Deadline and Variety, albeit more cognizant of celebrities that her current audience cares about.
About that: She and her team reject labels like "urban" and "gossip site" that Ms. Brand said often relegates sites like The Jasmine Brand to "second-class" status. Instead she says the site's defining characteristics are two rather unglamorous assets that have carried the brand this far: perseverance and consistency.

Texto completo: Readers react to an article comparing textbooks in California and Texas.
To the Editor:
"Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories," by Dana Goldstein (front page, Jan. 13), a comparison of textbooks used in Texas and California, suggests that these materials "are not only shaded by politics, but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters."
The article's analysis of textbooks clearly supports the assertion that the content is "shaded by politics," but the claim that biased textbooks are helping "to shape a generation of future voters" is less evident and probably not true. The assumption is that textbooks teach; they don't. In the hands of incompetent teachers, textbooks are a crutch for covering content that is typically memorized, regurgitated and forgotten.
Teachers teach. Competent teachers use textbooks, even those with a clear bias, as springboards for student inquiry. They ask their students to examine the content, to identify assumptions, to look for biased language, to compare coverage in various textbooks (as the writer of this article did) and to analyze primary source material that may support or refute textbook assertions.
Only by thinking critically about textbook content are historical insights internalized and found meaningful. Treating any content, biased or not, as ultimate truth results in thinking of history as just stuff to be memorized, trivia. Certainly, there are insidious ways to spread propaganda, but textbooks alone are not likely to be one of them.

To the Editor:
I am a high school student and found Dana Goldstein's article informative and a bit alarming. The idea that the information I am currently absorbing could be different from what students my age learn around the country is concerning. America has only one past, and I believe that past should be presented in the same way to every student.
How can I be sure that the information I am taking in is the correct history and not the version that leaves out massive chunks? I recently opened my American history textbook, "Out of Many: A History of the American People," and I could hear this article ringing in my ears.

Editors' Note: Lizzy had asked for her letter to be sent to the author of the article. We wondered if Dana Goldstein had replied. Indeed, she had:
Dear Lizzy,
Thank you for reading my piece and for reaching out. You ask an important question. I'd suggest you choose a subject that interests you from your textbook -- say, Reconstruction, or the Vietnam War -- go to the library, and spend an hour doing your own research. Ask the librarian to help you. Look for news articles published during that time period featuring the same themes or people from your textbook. Find a recently published article in a scholarly journal on the topic. Pull a narrative biography of a historical figure off the shelf and page through it.
I guarantee you that you will emerge with new information and maybe even an entirely new framework for understanding the events in your textbook.
Best wishes,
Dana Goldstein
To the Editor:
It has been said time and time again that the South lost the war, but won the narrative. American history textbooks provide the best 21st-century evidence of the truism of that statement, especially when it comes to issues of race, gender and immigration.
I have been teaching American history for over two decades, and over the years my students and I have found countless examples of bias and misinformation. Thankfully, many schools have moved away from the traditional textbook. The only answer to tackling bias and partisan perspectives in textbooks is to go to the original source and do the important work of historiography. The accessibility of primary source documents and online news archives have proved to be an essential aid in helping students uncover the truth of America's past.
We must teach our students how to do the work of historians by being investigators of the past, and the first step in the process is to question everything. Clearly, we can no longer depend on textbooks to tell the story.

To the Editor:
What a high school teaching opportunity! Buy one of each textbook and use them not to teach history, but to teach critical thinking.

To the Editor:
Parents want their children to grow up to believe and value the things that are important to them, and textbooks are obvious instruments to convey parental hopes. But I can think of at least one natural experiment that exposes the vanity of the faith that people place in textbooks.
For a generation, Paul Samuelson's great textbook "Economics: An Introductory Analysis" was a best-selling textbook. It strongly advocated Keynesian economics -- including the importance of federal deficit spending during periods of high unemployment.
Although almost everyone in the United States who took an introductory economics course in college studied Samuelson's text, to this day a balanced federal budget -- that is to say an anti-Keynesian approach to economics -- remains a rhetorical article of faith for virtually every politician in both parties. I suspect that today's textbooks will be no more successful than Samuelson's in shaping tomorrow's public opinion.

To the Editor:
As a private-school teacher in Texas, I chose my own textbook. "The American Promise" presented history in a way that I strongly disagreed with. But I did not want a textbook that would parrot what I say. My students need multiple views.
My first day would consist of reading a section from Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" and Paul Johnson's rejoinder, "A History of the American People." You could not find two more diverse views on the meaning of our history. After you have absorbed the facts, the fun begins!

To the Editor:
A comparison of Texas and California science textbooks might produce more surprising results than Dana Goldstein's fascinating, but predictable, comparison of history textbooks.

To the Editor:
While the disparities between state versions of textbooks are concerning, I'm encouraged that educators now have more opportunities than ever to provide updated, culturally relevant content to their students.
Here in Washington State, several school districts are creating and adapting open educational resources to reflect the cultures and backgrounds of the students they serve. Just one example is Central Valley School District in Eastern Washington, which adapted material in consultation with tribal partners, weaving Native history and knowledge into the social studies curriculum to include a greater diversity of voices.
The bigger story unfolding in states and districts across the country is that in an effort to provide deeper understanding and multiple perspectives, we are seeing more educators generating their own materials. Open educational resources, which are free to use and can be updated, customized and shared with others, help facilitate this practice and are an important strategy to consider.

To the Editor:
"Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories" offers a clear, balanced explanation of the power both California and Texas wield over the content of textbooks. However, the article says the first step in the process is the writing of a national version of a book by "authors, often academics."
In my years as a writer and editor of textbooks for elementary and high school students for nearly a dozen publishers, I worked with only one set of credited authors who actually did any writing. In almost all cases, either in-house or freelance writers did the composing, and the credited "authors" would do little more than read and comment on the material. Almost all of them were under contract (and received royalties) not because of their ability to write, but because of their academic reputations.

Texto completo: An academic conference is rarely an occasion for world-historical predictions, but, addressing a meeting on African politics at Wellesley College 60 years ago, Ralph Bunche made one.
Bunche, the United Nations under secretary for political affairs and the first African-American to win the Nobel Peace Prize, declared that "1960 will be 'the year of Africa' because at least four, but maybe seven or eight, new member states will come from the continent," as The New York Times put it in February of that year.
By December, not seven but 17 new African states had joined the U.N.
The Year of Africa, as it came to be known, was a victory for the black world. It emerged from longstanding global movements for racial equality and gave rise to political and cultural revolutions that forever transformed Africa's place in the world. Along with the triumph of African independence, however, the political crises of decolonization revealed central quandaries -- from the place of ethnic identity in politics to the role and legitimacy of state power -- that still trouble the continent and the wider world.
For more than a decade before independence, nationalist organizations like Ghana's Convention People's Party and the Tanganyika African National Union had built mass political movements across the continent, using strikes, boycotts and other forms of civil disobedience to challenge imperial rule. This was a strategy that echoed the civil rights movement, whose leaders keenly watched developments in Africa. Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King and A. Philip Randolph attended Ghana's independence celebrations in 1957.
In her essay here, Luvvie Ajayi returns to a famous anecdote from that event when an African-American guest explained to Vice President Richard M. Nixon that he did not know what freedom felt like because he was from Alabama. The implication is clear: By 1960, Africa paved the way, showing that what Kwame Nkrumah, the president of Ghana, called "positive action" could realize the goals of racial equality and democracy.
Brutal violence during the Algerian War of Independence, which entered its seventh year in 1960, and at the Sharpeville massacre in South Africa made clear that a peaceful transition was not always on offer.
But the Year of Africa did close with a landmark diplomatic victory. On Dec. 14, 1960, the new African bloc in the U.N. led the effort to pass Resolution 1514, the Declaration of the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The resolution legitimized the hard-won victories on the ground and provided a new moral and legal framework for the struggles to come.
It described imperialism as "a denial of fundamental human rights" and insisted that underdevelopment can never "serve as a pretext for delaying independence." It called for "complete independence and freedom" in all colonial territories. Nine states -- including the United States, Britain and France -- abstained, but Resolution 1514 otherwise passed unanimously. As Amílcar Cabral put it in 1962, as he was leading a guerrilla war in Guinea-Bissau, the resolution made colonialism "an international crime."
The moment was about more, however, than the emergence of new states. African independence, in Mr. Nkrumah's words, "means much more than merely being free to fly our own flag and to play our own national anthem." According to the Martinican political theorist Frantz Fanon, it required the making of new men out of colonial subjugation.
For the new postcolonial leaders, this often meant industrializing rapidly and spending more on education and health care, without heeding Mr. Fanon's caution against imitating European history. And in fact, during the first decade of African independence, economies grew, while investment in social services paid off in declining mortality rates, increased life expectancies and higher literacy rates. However, these transformations happened as increasingly authoritarian states repurposed the repressive tools of the colonial regimes.
Among these political contradictions, bottom-up experiments in self-fashioning and collective reinvention sprang up. From the stalwart young boxer to the playful pose of the woman standing in front of the Afro Negro nightclub, the images here reveal the ways in which everyday people latched on to the promise of independence and the mantle of the Afro-modern. And as Yvonne Orji notes, these images counter persistently negative views of Africa by insisting that "we're all accumulations of our dreams, our experiences, our misfortunes, our gain, our losses."
The cultural revolution captured in these images happened all over the continent. It could be found in the photography of Sanlé Sory of Burkina Faso, the dance floors of Bamako captured by Malick Sidibé, the rumba of the Congo, the jazz of Ethiopia and Tanzania, the literary renaissance that included the novels of Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, the plays of Ama Ata Aidoo and many more. Africa's swinging '60s melded nationalism and pan-Africanism with global sounds and aesthetics. As Mr. Ngugi would famously put it, "decolonizing the minds" of Africans was just as important as reclaiming the land.
With the political and cultural triumphs of African independence, however, there were also deep challenges. This new world of independent states struggled to be born.
Weeks after the Democratic Republic of Congo gained independence, for instance, the southern province of Katanga seceded. The Congo crisis brought the first of many large-scale U.N. peacekeeping operations to the continent, and showed the shearing pressures of decolonization. If self-determination was now a universal right, what could it mean for Katanga and other subnational units to claim this mantle? Would the new postcolonial states accommodate ethnic and religious pluralism? How might state power be decentralized and delegated?
These questions -- and the political violence they generated -- came to the fore again with the 1967 Igbo bid for independence from Nigeria, which precipitated a civil war; the Rwanda genocide of 1994; and the current crisis of citizenship in Cameroon. The generation that celebrated the coming of African independence did not foresee the pitfalls of decolonization and the failures of the postcolonial state.
As the novelist Imbolo Mbue writes in this section: "Did any of them imagine a day would come when Cameroonians would risk their lives to flee their independent nation for Europe? Did any of them imagine that 60 years after independence, Cameroon would have had only two presidents, both of them dictators, one for 22 years, one now in his 38th year?"
During the Congo crisis in 1960, many experts and observers concluded that decolonization had indeed come too early to Africa, that "development" should have been a prerequisite for independence. But this judgment misses what was ultimately at the heart of the critique of imperial rule: a vision of equality that insisted self-government is not just for the educated, the elite and the white. For the photographer Omar Victor Diop, this vision means that unlike his parents' generation, "we did not have to yearn for independence: We were born entitled to a passport, our own."
The full promise of that passport remains unrealized, though, for the migrants crossing the Mediterranean in the hopes of making a living, and for those whose ethnic, religious and sexual identities are used to undermine their claims of political membership.
But out of this paradoxical experience of postcolonial citizenship, a new African diaspora has emerged. The reflections on the Year of Africa included here from members of this diaspora capture the many meanings of independence. Recovering family histories, offering personal narrative and reading the photographic record, they insist that revisiting this past is a way to reimagine the continent's future.

How Trump wins again

Texto completo: As several people have noticed, this was the most politically successful week of the Trump presidency.
First, President Donald Trump's job approval numbers are rising. When the impeachment inquiry got rolling in October his Gallup approval rating was 39. Now it's 49. If he can hold this level, he'll probably be reelected.
Second, impeachment never became a topic of conversation among rank-and-file Democrats, let alone independents and Republicans, so it was easily defeated in the Senate.
To the extent that it was noticed, impeachment worked for Republicans and against Democrats. Approval of the Republican Party is now at 51%, its highest since 2005. More Americans now identify as Republicans than as Democrats. As Gallup dryly observed in announcing these numbers, "Gallup observed similar public opinion shifts when Bill Clinton was impeached."
Third, there is no Democratic transcender. The Iowa results, though far from final, indicate that there is no obvious candidate who can be quickly embraced by all factions of the party. With Mike Bloomberg now doubling his campaign spending, it looks like the Democratic primary battle is going to go on for a while.
Democrats may wind up in a position in which they can't nominate Bernie Sanders because he's too far left, and they can't not nominate him because his followers would bolt from a Biden/Bloomberg/Buttigieg-led party.
Only 53% of Sanders voters say they will certainly support whomever is the Democratic nominee. This is no idle threat. In 2016, in Pennsylvania, 117,000 Sanders primary voters went for Trump in the general, and Trump won the state by 44,292 ballots. In Michigan, 48,000 Sanders voters went for Trump, and Trump won the state by 10,704. In Wisconsin, 51,300 Sanders voters went for Trump, and Trump won the state by 22,748. In short, Sanders voters helped elect Trump.
Fourth, Trump has cleverly reframed the election. I can see why Nancy Pelosi ripped up his State of the Union speech. It was the most effective speech of the Trump presidency.
In 2016, Trump ran a dark, fear-driven "American carnage" campaign. His 2016 convention speech was all about crime, violence and menace. The theme of this week's speech was mostly upbeat "Morning in America."
I don't know if he can keep this tone, because unlike Ronald Reagan, he's not an optimistic, generous person. But if he can, and he can keep his ideology anodyne, this message can resonate even with people who don't like him.
Trump's speech reframes the election around this core question: Is capitalism basically working or is it basically broken?
Trump can run on the proposition that it's basically working. He has a lot of evidence on his side: The unemployment rate is the lowest in decades. Wages are rising. The typical family income is higher than it has ever been.
Americans seem to accept this position. Confidence in the economy is higher now than at any moment since the Clinton administration. According to Gallup, 59% of Americans say they are better off than they were a year ago. Three-quarters of Americans expect to be even better off a year from now.
Democrats, by contrast, have congregated around the message that capitalism is fundamentally broken and that the economy is bad. As Matthew Yglesias noted recently in Vox, when Democrats were asked in the PBS NewsHour/Politico debate if the economy was good, they all gave the same answer.
Joe Biden: "I don't think [Americans] really do like the economy. Look at the middle-class neighborhoods. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed." Pete Buttigieg: "This economy is not working for most of us." Elizabeth Warren: "A rising GDP, rise in corporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across the country." And so on down the line.
An opposition party can retake the White House in a time of rising economic conditions, but it can't do it by denouncing capitalism and it can't do it by denying the felt reality of a majority of Americans.
It's hard to defeat a president in good times. UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, the author of "The Message Matters" and a co-author of "Identity Crisis," has found that the rare candidates who do succeed find issues that voters care about just as much. In 1960, John Kennedy ran on the missile gap. In 1968, Richard Nixon ran on law and order. In 2016, Trump ran on Middle America identity politics.
What would that issue be? Well, in his book "The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth," Benjamin Friedman argues that in prosperous times voters are more tolerant of diversity, more committed to fairness and expanding opportunity. As he puts it, "Economic growth bears moral benefits."
That suggests that Democrats should acknowledge that the economy has done well since the Obama recovery in 2009. They should argue that this is the time to take advantage of prosperity to begin a moral and social revival. This is the year to run a values campaign, one that champions policies to make America more socially mobile, caring and interdependent.
In 2020, running on economic gloom or class war probably won't work.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: MAMARONECK – Roger Kahn, the writer who wove memoir and baseball and touched millions of readers through his romantic account of the Brooklyn Dodgers in "The Boys of Summer," has died. He was 92.
Son Gordon Kahn said his father died Thursday at a nursing facility in Mamaroneck.
Kahn lived in Stone Ridge, spent one semester teaching at SUNY New Paltz, and was a one-time contributor to the Poughkeepsie Journal following the New York Yankees' 2009 World Series title.
The author of 20 books and hundreds of articles, Kahn was best known for the 1972 best-seller that looked at his relationship with his father through their shared love of the Dodgers, an object of nostalgia for the many fans who mourned the team's move to Los Angeles after the 1957 season.
"At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams," Kahn wrote.
"The Boys of Summer" was a story of lost youth, right down to its title, later borrowed for a hit Don Henley song about a man longing for his past. Kahn's book moved back and forth between the early 1950s, when he covered the Dodgers for the New York Herald Tribune, and 20 years later, when some were ailing (Jackie Robinson), embittered (Carl Furillo) or in a wheelchair (Roy Campanella).
The book was an instant hit, although Kahn was criticized for sentimentalizing his story.
"Here is a book that succeeded for me despite almost everything about it," wrote Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, a late book critic for The New York Times.
Stone Ridge man, baseball historian He later taught writing at several colleges and lectured at Yale, Princeton and Columbia universities and in 2004, he served a fellowship as the Ottaway Endowed Professor of Journalism at SUNY New Paltz. There, he taught a class called "Beyond the Boys of Summer," in which he aimed to show students the processes he had employed throughout his career.
"One of the finer journalistic traditions has been for one generation to guide those who follow," Kahn said.
The former Croton-On-Hudson resident often shared his insight with Journal readers, either through interviews or through his column written for the paper in 2009.
In 2002, he told the Journal the best part of baseball was the friendships he had made over his career. The worst part, he said, "is that friends die," listing off such players as Robinson, Joe Black and Enos Slaughter, and writers like Red Smith and Woodstock resident Haywood Hale Broun.
And, what was baseball's best moment?
"If 10 years can be a moment, the 10 years of Jackie Robinson, without question," he said in 2002 of the Hall of Famer's color-barrier-breaking career. "That focused a huge part of the nation on the racism that we had been hiding from ourselves.
"As Robinson played good ball, he made his statement. He was never the greatest player – never the player Willie Mays was – but a very fine player. That was the climate in which Martin Luther King began, and that was ending American apartheid. That's what the South was. I was there. 'Colored restroom. White restroom. Colored water fountain. White water fountain. No coloreds in the diner.' The Dodgers are on a bus in the South, and the team goes into a diner, Robinson would have to stay on the bus.," he said. "So that, I think, was the greatest moment in American sports. That's one case where sports led the country."
Kahn began his prolific career in 1948 as a copy boy for the Tribune, and soon became a baseball writer, working under famed sports editor Stanley Woodward. He recalled Woodward as "a wonder" who once cured a writer of using the cliche "spine-tingling" by telling him to "go out in the bleachers and ask every one of those fans if his spine actually tingled."
As for the New York Yankees, a team he covered in his 2004 book "October Men," Kahn compared generations following the team's 2009 championship to try to answer which roster in the team's vaunted history was the best.
His conclusion? "Never bet against Babe Ruth."
Writing for more than half a century Kahn was born in Brooklyn in on Oct. 31, 1927, and inherited his love of baseball from his father, who played third base for City College.
"There was nobody I enjoyed talking baseball with as much as this green-eyed, strong-armed, gentle, fierce, mustached, long-ball hitting, walking encyclopedia who was my father," he wrote in his 1997 "Memories of Summer."
He started writing about the Dodgers in 1952, and by age 26 was the newspaper's prominent sports reporter, earning a salary of $10,000, and also covering the city's other teams, the Giants and the Yankees.
In 1956, he was named sports editor at Newsweek magazine, and served at the Saturday Evening Post from 1963 to 1969 as editor at large. He also wrote for Esquire, Time and Sports Illustrated.
Kahn's sports writing often incorporated social issues, particularly race. He wrote at length about Robinson and his struggles in breaking baseball's color line, and the two formed a long friendship.
"By applauding Robinson, a man did not feel that he was taking a stand on school integration, or on open housing. But for an instant he had accepted Robinson simply as a hometown ball player," Kahn once wrote. "To disregard color, even for an instant, is to step away from the old prejudices, the old hatred. That is not a path on which many double back."
When Kahn was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig called him "an icon of our game."
Among Kahn's other sports books: 1986's "Joe and Marilyn: A Memory of Love," and 1999's "A Flame of Pure Fire: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring '20s."
One book caused lasting embarrassment: Kuhn collaborated with Pete Rose on the 1989 authorized autobiography "Pete Rose: My Story." Rose, the major league's all-time hits leader, had recently been barred from baseball for betting on games and the book featured his insistence that the allegations were untrue.
But Rose acknowledged years later, in a subsequent memoir, that he did gamble. Kahn said his "first reaction was to reach for the barf bag."
"I regret I ever got involved in the book," Kahn told the Los Angeles Times in 2007. "It turns out that Pete Rose was the Vietnam of ballplayers. He once told me he was the best ambassador baseball ever had. I've thought about that and wondered why we haven't sent him to Iran."
Kahn also wrote two novels and two nonfiction books not related to sports: 1968's "The Passionate People: What it Means to be a Jew in America," and 1970's "The Battle for Morningside Heights: Why Students Rebel." He maintained a friendship with the poet Robert Frost, whom he profiled in the Saturday Evening Post.
A funeral is set for Monday in Katonah.

The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The White House is throwing its support behind a plan to transfer the U.S. Secret Service back to the Treasury Department to better focus on the growing threat of online financial crimes.
Shifting the agency from within the Department of Homeland Security to the Treasury would require action from Congress, but President Donald Trump is confident enough that he plans to include the Secret Service under the Treasury's budget in his proposal expected Monday, according to five administration officials with knowledge of the move. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations.
The Department of Homeland Security's intense focus on immigration has only added to the growing divide between what the Secret Service sees as its dual missions - protecting the president and investigating financial crimes - and the mission of its parent department.
But there are strong concerns the Secret Service's departure could lead to the eventual dismantling of DHS, which was formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a counterterrorism agency bringing together security agencies across the government.
The Secret Service is best known as the agency responsible for protecting the president, but its original purpose when it was formed in 1865 was to investigate financial crimes such as counterfeit money proliferating during the Civil War. It was housed under the Treasury until 2003, when it was transferred to the new Department of Homeland Security.
Only about half of the Secret Service's budget is spent on protective services. It also has a robust cybercrime division, state-of-the-art forensic labs and a threat assessment center that studies how to mitigate and train against threats. The agency's annual budget of about $2.3 billion would shift from one department to another under Trump's proposal.
In the Trump era, DHS has been highly focused on immigration, one of the Republican president's top priorities, leaving other agencies unrelated to immigration out of the spotlight.
"The biggest challenge has been the president's immigration focus," Rep. Bennie Thompson, the head of the House Homeland Security Committee, told the AP. "The immigration focus takes up a lot of the resources for DHS. It's been very difficult for Secret Service to be fully funded. "
Department of Homeland Security officials initially pushed back against shifting the Secret Service back to the Treasury, concerned it could spark an exodus from other agencies contained within DHS, a 240,000-person department that also includes disaster relief, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration, according to the officials. DHS referred questions to the White House.
The Secret Service is "part of a unique cohort that gets lost in the massive bureaucracy," said Breanne Deppisch, who studies the topic for the Aspen Institute think tank.
Deppisch said she feared the news could be a blow to other non-immigration agencies at Homeland Security, specifically the newly formed Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, tasked with election security. She worried it could deepen recruitment problems at other agencies and lower morale, which is already low department-wide.
It's not the first time such a move has been considered in recent years. After a high-profile prostitution scandal in 2012 and other missteps, Democrats and Republicans in Congress debated whether the agency should be relocated, broken up or shrunk.
A feasibility study was completed last year from a working group of Homeland Security, the Treasury and the White House, and the results found that moving the Secret Service would help enhance collaboration in the Treasury and would put the Secret Service back on the map as a large law enforcement agency, though it could harm morale at Homeland Security.
"DHS employees, members of Congress and staff, the homeland security committee - may perceive a weakened DHS with the loss of Secret Service," the working group wrote in the report. "Such a loss could open DHS up to additional reforms or reorganizations, perhaps even some involving the transfer or dismantling of other operating components, further weakening the department at a critical time in its development."
The Secret Service would be the second largest agency at the Treasury after the Internal Revenue Service, which could result in more attention and a morale boost for staff, according to the report, initially published by The New York Times and obtained by the AP. It would give the Treasury back a law enforcement and investigative capability to protect financial infrastructure and payment systems.
Secret Service leadership recommended the move, according to the report.
"The Secret Service has been involved in discussions regarding the potential move and is appreciative of the active interest in advancing its integrated mission" according to an agency statement.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox Business this week that he expected legislation to be introduced soon.
"We think it will very much help us in combating money laundering and terrorist activities," he said of the move.
He approached the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee with the proposal, and they were open to it. But it may not be that simple to convince lawmakers - not all senators with a stake in the agency voiced support, and some House Democrats are strongly against it.
Rep. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said he recognized the challenges the agency faces in the current climate, but jumping ship isn't the right answer and he opposed the move.
"From the standpoint of what they do, intelligence, analysis, and threat mitigation, they're better situated within DHS," he said.
Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein's office said as part of the proposal she asked to include reports on the cost of presidential travel to include details of presidents' families, too, to provide "greater transparency, accountability and oversight."
Trump signaled a few weeks ago that he approved of the Secret Service transfer.
"The President and his administration support the bipartisan efforts of Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Dianne Feinstein to return the Secret Service to its historic home at the U.S. Department of the Treasury," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. "This transfer will improve the Secret Service's ability to carry out its integrated, dual mission of protection and investigations."
The head of a union representing Secret Service agents said he hadn't seen the proposal.
The first presidential protection job for the agency came in 1894, when it started protecting President Grover Cleveland. Agents eventually began protecting other government officials including Cabinet members and presidential candidates.

The Associated Press
PHOENIX - Tony Valdovinos didn't know he was in the U.S. illegally until he tried to join the Marine Corps at 18 and learned he was born in Mexico.
Valdovinos, now 29, channeled disappointment into activism, knocking on doors in Latino neighborhoods and registering people to vote, though he can't cast a ballot himself. He also enrolled in the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allows immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to work and protects them from deportation. He now runs a firm helping elect Arizona candidates.
"This is the greatest nation in the world," said Valdovinos. "I feel a responsibility to serve this country."
DACA recipients like Valdovinos are assuming prominent roles in the 2020 elections. They are becoming leaders in the Democratic presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer and get-out-the vote groups in immigrant communities, using their shared language and culture to build trust.
Jeanne Batalova, a senior analyst for the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said political involvement helps DACA recipients facing an uncertain future feel empowered.
"They are doing what they can to exercise their agency, to shape their lives and destinies," Batalova said.
The campaigns are heating up as the Supreme Court prepares to decide the future of DACA, which President Donald Trump wants to end for the estimated 652,880 recipients. Like many of them, Valdovinos calls himself an American and wants everyone engaged in an election that may shape their future more than any other in their lifetime.
" The current state of DACA is very precarious," said Arizona Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego. "We have to be worried with this administration and this Supreme Court, which are capable of creating a mass deportation of human beings who don't know any other country than the United States."
Gallego has long supported DACA recipients, inviting one, second grade teacher Vanessa Mendez, to be his guest this week at Trump's State of the Union address and recently attending a performance of "Americano!," a new Phoenix musical inspired by Valdovinos' life.
"We cannot give in to the fear," Valdovinos said about the upcoming court decision. "We have to fight for the right to have our lives."
Berkeley, California, journalist and immigrant rights activist Jose Antonio Vargas, who famously revealed he was brought to the U.S. illegally from the Philippines in The New York Times Magazine in 2011, said he identifies with DACA recipients even though he was too old to qualify. Now 39, Vargas discovered his status when applying for a driver's license at 16.
He said he is encouraged by immigrants like Valdovinos who feel American.
"It's part of the maturation of this generation, the sophistication of how we tell our stories," Vargas said. "Many of the DACA recipients are among the most civically engaged Americans you're likely to meet."
They include Argentine-born Belen Sisa, 25, Sanders' deputy press secretary in Washington.
DACA opponents say the program rewards children of families who broke the law. Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar called unsuccessfully for the deportation of DACA recipients who were invited by members of Congress to attend Trump's State of the Union address in 2018.
Precedents exist for activism by non-voters in the U.S., like the women who fought in the early 20th century for voting rights and African Americans who toppled barriers like literacy tests disenfranchising many black people into the 1960s.
The Supreme Court's conservative majority has indicated it will likely strip DACA protections by June. Liberal justices have suggested the Trump administration has not fully justified its decision to end DACA.
If the court lifts protections, Congress could vote to put the program on surer legal footing. But Congress' lack of comprehensive immigration reform prompted President Barack Obama in 2012 to create the program that gives immigrants who are in school, graduated from high school or served in the military two-year reprieves on deportation if they don't commit major crimes.
Trump said in a November tweet that if DACA is overturned, a deal would be made for them to stay, but he also alleged some recipients are "very tough, hardened criminals."
Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Matthew Albence confirmed at a press briefing last month the agency was reopening the closed cases of DACA enrollees "and putting them back on the docket so they can work their way through the immigration courts."
"Ultimately if the Supreme Court rules that these people do not have a lawful right to be here, it is incumbent on us either to execute the removal orders that were already issued by a judge or put the individual through the immigration court process so we can get a decision from a judge," Albence said.
Edder Diaz-Martinez, 29, a DACA recipient originally from Mexico City, is communications director for the Maricopa County Democratic Party in Phoenix. Diaz-Martinez called the program a Band-Aid and said recipients need a permanent solution.
Karen Martinez, Nevada state digital director for Steyer, is renewing her DACA status at a cost of $500, not knowing if the program will exist later this year. Now 30, she came to the U.S. from Hidalgo, Mexico, when she was 10.
But if the program crumbles, Martinez said, "I'll still absolutely feel like I'm an American."
Valdovinos said he tries not to think about what the court may do, noting that he lived without protections for many years in Arizona while Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio oversaw high-profile raids targeting migrants and a state law made police turn over people suspected of being in the country illegally to immigration authorities.
In those years, Valdovinos belonged to Team Awesome, comprised of mostly DACA recipients, who knocked on doors in the heavily Latino district of Maryvale to get Mexican American Daniel Hernandez elected to the Phoenix City Council in 2011.
"The toughest political work is walking in our communities, getting them registered, getting them to vote," he said. "The absentee ballots come in the mail with the water bill and sit in a pile of papers for years."
Valdovinos later formed La Machine Consulting F irm to help candidates such as Gallego, Phoenix City Councilman Carlos Garcia and Mayor Kate Gallego with their campaigns.
Fellow Team Awesome member Viridiana Hernandez, who ultimately obtained legal U.S. residency through marriage, said being a DACA recipient helped break down barriers while canvassing neighborhoods.
"I was able to speak to the woman of the house in Spanish, and I'd tell her, 'Look, I'm just like you, without papers,'" Hernandez said. She then could persuade any U.S. citizens in the family to register to vote.
While Valdovinos couldn't join the Marines, he said still hopes to gain citizenship.
"It would be so great to cast a vote after knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors," he said.

Texto completo: Las fuerzas estadounidenses y afganas fueron atacadas directamente el sábado en la provincia de Nangarhar, en Afganistán, un área donde tanto el ISIS como los talibanes tienen presencia, dijo un portavoz militar estadounidense.
Un funcionario del gobierno en el este de Afganistán dijo a CBS News que las tropas afganas y estadounidenses se enfrentaron en el distrito de Sherzad de la provincia oriental de Nangarhar.
El portavoz de la USFOR-A, coronel Sonny Leggett, dijo en un comunicado que “la fuerza combinada estadounidense y afgana que realizaba una operación en la provincia de Nangarhar fue atacada por disparos directos el 8 de febrero. Estamos evaluando la situación y proporcionaremos más actualizaciones a medida que estén disponibles”.
Un oficial militar de Estados Unidos dijo al New York Times que había bajas estadounidenses y afganas.
Hasta el momento no se conoce el número de causalidades.
Se estima que hay más de 10,000 soldados estadounidenses en Afganistán.
En el discurso del presidente Trump sobre el Estado de la Unión el martes, él dijo que Estados Unidos está “trabajando para finalmente poner fin a la guerra más larga de Estados Unidos y traer a nuestras tropas de regreso a casa”.
Trump dijo que “las conversaciones de paz están en marcha”, y dijo que no es la “función” del ejército estadounidense “servir a otras naciones como agencias de aplicación de la ley”.
Una fuente militar, que habló con Military Times bajo condición de anonimato porque no está autorizado para hablar con los medios de comunicación, dijo que al menos dos miembros del Séptimo Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales, que operan en el este de Afganistán, murieron y varios más resultaron heridos.
El periodista del New York Times destacado en Afganistán dijo en las redes sociales que el incidente pudo haber involucrado un ataque llamado “verde sobre azul”, lo que significa que los atacantes pudieron haber sido fuerzas amigas o extremistas haciéndose pasar por fuerzas amigas.
El corresponsal de NYT también dijo que se hablaba de 5 ó 6 muertos entre los soldados estadounidenses y que otro oficinal le dijo que también 6 afganos resultaron muertos en el incidente.
Multiple sources tell us it is as many as five or six US fatalities. One official says 6 on Afghan side too.
US military is confirming an incident — “a combined US & Afghan force conducting an operation in Nangarhar was engaged by direct fire” — but not providing any details. https://t.co/Tb9CiyyCgW

Still unclear whether the deadly incident is work of Taliban infiltrators, as has been a concern in the past, or an argument turning to shootout.
The fact that we are hearing of multiple fatalities on Afghan side points more to clash/shootout possibility… https://t.co/AH2hQRNuXQ

Horas después, aún la información sobre soldados muertos y heridos no se ha confirmado. Varios medios reportan que esto sucede habitualmente cuando ocurren estos enfrentamientos.
Our first update on the deadly shootout between U.S. and Afghan forces in Nangarhar.
Details are still scarce; casualty numbers in situations like this change. Still unclear whether it was Taliban infiltrators, or it was an argument that turned deadly.https://t.co/6qCMuQKqu6

Texto completo: TEL AVIV, Israel
To get a different perspective on the Trump-Kushner peace plan, I decided to call the best Middle East analyst I know. Her name is Mother Nature.
So, Mother Nature, what did you think of the Deal of the Century?
Well, Tom, not a lot. For starters, it mentioned me in only a few short sentences. Let me take you on a tour of the neighborhood, as I see it. Warning: My maps have no boundary lines, no walls — and no Areas A, B and C in the West Bank.
You can be sure that President Donald Trump, who has declared climate change a hoax, has no idea that the Eastern Mediterranean has experienced drought conditions for 15 of the last 20 years, which is unparalleled in the modern historical record. A recent study by Tel Aviv University predicts that the Eastern Mediterranean will get steadily hotter and drier and gradually lose two months of winter — i.e., rainfall months — within the next 25 years. Meanwhile, in 1948 Israel’s population was 800,000. It’s now 8.7 million. Jordan’s was 450,000. It’s now 10 million. Syria’s was 3 million, and it’s now 17.5 million. So, the future is steadily more people and less water.
What are the implications?
Israel used to pump up to 500 million cubic meters of water a year out of the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake, to meet domestic needs, including for agricultural fields in the south of Israel, to turn the desert green. In 2018, Israel could pump out only 30 million cubic meters!
In the summer of 2018, the Sea of Galilee was so low from droughts and water withdrawals for rising populations that it was threatening to become another saline lake, like the Dead Sea. You remember that Jesus walked on water in the Sea of Galilee? Well, you could have done that, too, because it was so low that two islands were visible in the middle of the lake.
How does that affect the Jordan River and all those dependent on it?
Sadly, in the last 50 years, the Jordan River’s annual flow has dropped to a trickle. With Israel, Jordan and Syria each grabbing as much clean water as they can, it’s actually mostly sewage that is keeping the river flowing today. But since a lot of the river is a closed military zone, most people don’t know it’s drying up.
The only guaranteed water for Israel’s big urban centers and farms on its coastal plain is desalinated water and treated wastewater, which have chemical issues. And now, in order to adapt to climate change, Israel is having to reverse the direction of its national water-transportation system — to take desalinated water from its coastal water plants up north to the Sea of Galilee, which, until sustained rainfall this winter began to replenish it, was so diminished it could not serve as Israel’s national water tower.
At the same time, Gaza does not have sufficient sewage treatment facilities, so roughly 100 million liters of raw sewage flows from Gaza every day into the Mediterranean. The prevailing current takes it right up the coast, where Gaza’s waste gets into the filters of Israel’s big Ashkelon desalination plant, which intermittently has had to be shut down to be unclogged.
What about Gaza, Jordan and the West Bank?
Well, Amman recently cut municipal water service from two days a week to eight hours a week for its residents. They have to buy the rest of their water from private vendors. Jordan has had to absorb 1.5 million refugees from Syria’s civil war, which itself was partly prompted by drought. The Jordanian people should get the Nobel Peace Prize for how they have peacefully absorbed so many refugees.
Jordan has 600,000 people living on its side of the Jordan Valley. With markets to Iraq and Syria both disrupted, and a decrease in water supply as a result of drought, youth unemployment on the Jordanian side of the valley is at 40%. The water-intensive crops they, and the Israelis, grow in the valley — tropical and subtropical fruits, like bananas and citrus, and fruits and vegetables for export — are not sustainable. The conditions have left most of these communities impoverished.
How has this affected the war on terrorism?
Jordan was the third-largest contributor of youth recruits to the Islamic State in the Arab world. You can be sure plenty of these recruits were from the Jordan Valley, which is full of frustrated young men who can’t get jobs and so can’t marry. It’s a trifecta of ecological demise, poverty and radicalization.
What about Gaza under Hamas?
Both Israel and Gaza traditionally drew most of their water from the coastal aquifer. The Gaza portion has totally collapsed under Hamas mismanagement, Israeli blockades and overuse. Some 97% of the Gaza aquifer is no longer potable. People there live by filling jerrycans with water from small desalination plants run by private vendors and international organizations. About a quarter of the disease in Gaza today is associated with unhealthy drinking water.
The mountain aquifer running down the spine of the West Bank and Israel is also being rapidly depleted and polluted. The Jewish settlers in the West Bank are connected to the Israeli water system through a sophisticated network that runs 24/7, but the Palestinian cities are not. So, in hot summer months in Bethlehem, for instance, residents get municipal water only episodically.
You also have many West Bank Palestinian villages and towns without sewage treatment facilities. Their raw sewage is tossed into cesspits — unlined holes in the ground — that let the liquid seep into the groundwater and the solids collect, to then be dumped into wadis. Sewage in the greater Hebron area, with over 300,000 people, flows via the Hebron Stream to the Israeli town of Beersheba, where it becomes the Beersheba Stream! As I said, I recognize no borders.
So what would be Mother Nature’s peace principles?
To begin, any plan that carves up the West Bank into siloed political spaces, walls and roads — driven by a Trump-Kushner desire to embrace the “reality” of where Jewish settlers have haphazardly settled around the West Bank — makes no sense to me. This is a single ecosystem, and there will be no physical security for one if there is not human security for all. More than once my flash floods have knocked down Israel’s security barrier around Tulkarm and Jerusalem.
You have to start with the right question: How do we bring peace to this region in an era of rapid population growth and climate change? Not: How do we bring peace to this region in a way that gives primacy to the demands of Israeli, Palestinian or evangelical Christian zealots?
What would your map look like?
Peace and prosperity came to Europe after World War II via the creation of the Common Market. The Common Market was built on trading last century’s main energy source and industrial product — coal and steel. Peace between Israelis and Jordanians and Palestinians will come through a confederation of their sovereign entities based on sea and sun. The only way Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians will all have water and energy security is through large-scale desalination, and the only way they can get that — and not worsen climate change — is through massive solar-power generation.
How might that work?
Israel and Gaza have vast capacity to tap the Mediterranean Sea for manufactured water, and Jordan has great capacity to tap its vast empty deserts for manufactured solar power. They all should be networked into a confederation, harnessing the sea and sun — with joint commissions to manage water, energy and food security — that would create healthy interdependencies. Then they could all rise economically together. Rather than the siloed, unhealthy interdependency or unilateralism that they are now creating — where they compete for water, energy and food and pollute one another, and fall together.
For more on all of this, look at the work of the organization EcoPeace Middle East and particularly its feasibility study. That group understands me like nobody else.
If you build on my formula, any peace will have to involve mutual respect and respect for my ecosystems — in contrast to the zero-sum thinking of the political extremists now driving this story and messing with Mother Nature. It’s not smart to mess with Mother Nature. Ask the Australians.

Rio Theater, landmark along lower Russian River, up for sale again

Texto completo: The landmark Rio Theater, an iconic community hub in western Sonoma County for 70 years, is back on the market after a 6-year experiment in collective ownership that succeeded in keeping the lower Russian River region’s only cinema operational — until last year’s flood drove home what key partners already knew.
With full-time jobs in the Bay Area and growing young families, there just wasn’t enough time, money and energy to fulfill their vision for the property, especially after on-site managers intended to oversee day-to-day operations didn’t work out, a representative for the consortium said.
But the group of 27 investors, which bought the 1.25-acre site for $599,000 in late 2013, hasn’t lost faith in its potential as an indoor-outdoor community event space, said co-owner Maura Dilley, a San Francisco-based green business consultant.
“I genuinely think this is a crown-jewel business that can serve the community and be viable and be dynamic in this day and age,” said Dilley, who with her husband, General Manager Dermot Hikisch, are principal investors.
Sale of the theater property, located in the heart of Monte Rio, could prove transformative, depending if future owners decide to keep the movie house, pursue the vision of its current owners, or raze the building and do something wholly different.
The site is zoned for recreation and tourist-commercial development, which allows a wide range of uses — from day care to telecommunication facilities, food service to hay cultivation.
“It gives you a lot of opportunities,” said Jeff Sacher, one of two listing agents with Santa Rosa Business & Commercial. The property is listed for $895,000.
A number of potential buyers have made inquiries, Sacher’s partner, Michelle Habib, said by phone on the way to a showing.
“There’s interest,” she said.
Located in a converted World War II surplus Quonset hut above a public river beach at a busy rural crossroads, the 167-seat, single-screen theater has long been woven into the fabric of Monte Rio and the lower river communities more broadly.
Generations of west county residents have bundled up in blankets to stay warm in the cool, cavernous space or heard the plinking sound of rain on the corrugated metal roof during movie screenings. Inexpensive family movies have long been part of community nights out, along with discounted meals at participating restaurants.
The building’s unusual semi-circular profile has lent itself to funky design features that include a faded landscape painted on the exterior. The curved ceiling is lined with fabric panels from Christo’s “Running Fence,” a famed 1976 art installation that stretched across nearly 25 miles of rural Marin and Sonoma counties.
But a string of owners has been challenged to keep the theater going throughout most of its history, through forays into live theater, the shifting seasonality of a micro economy and changes in consumer media consumption.
Twenty-year owners Don and Suzi Schaffert were nearly forced to draw the curtains in 2013 because they didn’t have the $55,000 they needed for a new digital projector. They had reached a point where it was nearly impossible to obtain first-run movies in the 35mm format they needed for their equipment.
Community members pooled funds through a Kickstarter campaign pushed over the threshold by actor Zach Braff. The fundraiser allowed the Schafferts to soldier on and make a few minor improvements, in addition to purchasing the new projector, while seeking a buyer who wanted to keep the theater viable.
Enter Colin Mutchler and Christy George, who have a weekend place in neighboring Villa Grande and took part in the Kickstarter campaign, Dilley said. They began talking to friends and friends of friends, and soon a group of people had come together to buy the place, taking on decades of deferred maintenance but also a kind of blank canvas on which they hoped to create something new and innovative, showing off the site’s open lawn and sweeping forest views, its proximity to river recreation and the unusual theater space.
“It’s too narrow to look at this opportunity as just for the cinephile,” Dilley said. “Selling movie tickets is not going to bring in enough money. But what is interesting is using the space all day long and for different applications, different purposes.”
The plan was an ambitious one: buy a “fixer upper,” do much of the physical labor themselves, and have staff to run the theater and manage the property for special events — from weddings to public occasions like the mostly annual Pongapalooza ping pong tournament.
For various reasons, two different managers hired by the owners didn’t work out. Hikisch found himself serving as general manager, managing the theater and special events largely on his own, in addition to performing his regular job in San Francisco.
In the meantime, the investor group did much of the work they had planned — retiling the lobby, updating bathrooms and installing new seats — and expanded the outdoor events through activities like corporate retreats.
But Hikisch and Dilley’s house-hunting efforts in the area failed. They and Mutchler and George, also key partners, started families. Others got new jobs or moved, and it “was just too much to keep up and to do right,” especially for Hikisch, Dilley said.
That was never clearer than in the past year, after a period of extreme rainfall in February raised the Russian River to its highest level in nearly a quarter century, bringing foul waters into low-lying areas of the theater, much of which had recently been upgraded.
One of the investors, artist Wendy MacNaughton, illustrated the partnership’s ordeal in the New York Times, describing the community inundation and the damage to their uninsured theater and the challenge they and other small business owners faced in an era of extreme weather.
But Dilley said their cleanup was comparatively simple compared with most of their neighbors, many of them resorts.
“We had warning and were able to move our more precious equipment to higher ground,” she said. “It wasn’t game over.”
Except for the floor in the rear of the theater, in what had been the Rio Cafe, now operating across the street, all the flood damage has been repaired.
Two other small Quonset huts on the property, including Kool City Surf Shop, also remain in operation.
With the decision to sell the property, Hikisch has not actively been booking the site, except for the annual Halloween screening of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” benefiting the Russian River Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and two other events.
“We all see the value and would love to have the Rio be that vibrating pulse of the community that it should be,” Dilley said, “and we can all see that that would be great.”
“Our hope is that we can find someone now that can take the ball and run with it, so we can share that vision, so it’s not just a single screen movie theater ­— that is just not the business that’s going to be viable there — but it’s a community event space.”

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Four days before their trip to Guatemala, Randy and Tina Carter read a story in The New York Times that enraged them.
That story changed their lives.
It also changed the life of a little boy and those who love him, especially his mother.
The article, published on June 17, 2018, was about Antony, 8, and his mother, Elsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez, who had made the perilous journey to the United States from their impoverished and dangerous home in Guatemala, only to be caught up in the treachery of the U.S. policy of separating families at the border.
The article, written by reporter Miriam Jordan, detailed how that May the 25-year-old mother and son had been taken by the Border Patrol to a detention center in South Texas and separated – he to a shelter for migrant children, she on a plane back to Guatemala, sobbing and frantic and ignored.
Argue the merits of such a policy if you will, but what the Carters saw was a little boy ripped away from his mother.
That, they said, was just wrong.
“We were both angry, furious that our government would do this,” said Randy Carter, who like his wife is a retired professor in Albuquerque. “Since we were going down to Guatemala, we thought maybe we could help.”
They started researching and reaching out to people they thought could help – including Michael Avenatti, the flashy Los Angeles attorney who formerly represented porn star Stormy Daniels in her legal battles against President Donald Trump.
Randy Carter said he read that Avenatti had vowed to help families affected by the administration’s immigration policies. Carter decided to hold Avenatti to that vow.
The Carters also enlisted the pro bono help of Ricardo de Anda, a Laredo, Texas, attorney with experience in family separation cases.
Other contacts they made helped them track down Ortiz to her father’s home in Guatemala City. In four days, they had managed to bring together a legal team and arrange a meeting with Ortiz in Guatemala City.
It took more than 2½ hours to get Ortiz to trust them enough to allow them to help her. It took 81 days to bring Antony home.
But the Carters weren’t done yet.
They came to know Ortiz as a brave, smart woman, despite having little education, little family support, little of anything to eke out a life for her and her son.
“They are so poor, you can’t imagine,” Tina Carter said. “Elsa has been abandoned by every man in her life, from her father to her son’s father.
Once again, they thought maybe they could help.
They decided to try their hand at business, forming a limited liability company selling handmade textiles and other crafts from Guatemala. They hired Ortiz as their buyer.
They named the business Elsa Ortiz Online and adopted the company motto, “We care.”
Because they do.
This month marks a year since the business went online, and the Carters say they’ve had modest success with selling vibrant textiles and traditional Guatemalan clothing like jaspé-style dyed drawstring pants and brightly embroidered dresses and blouses called huipils, wooden puzzles, animal figures and masks, beaded jewelry and ornaments.
The items are sold in small shops such as Great Harvest Bread in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, a website and Facebook page, craft fairs and an open house in their foothills neighborhood.
“We’ve never done anything like running a business and never imagined doing this,” Randy Carter said. “But it’s kind of fun.”
Ortiz receives $350 a month for her work, which in Guatemala affords her a middle-class lifestyle. She and Antony can now afford to live in a nice home close to Antony’s private school, his tuition paid for by the Carters.
In addition, the Carters are paying for Ortiz’s two younger sisters, ages 18 and 22, to attend school to obtain the equivalent of a GED.
As you might guess, the retired professors see education as a way out of poverty. That’s especially true in a country where school is free only up to sixth grade and rates of illiteracy range from 33 percent to as high as 60 percent in rural regions.
Recently, the sisters sent a photo of them proudly displaying certificates for completing a typing course. They looked happy.
And so are the Carters, who channeled their rage into a force for good, all because they thought they could help.
“We’re retired, we have a nice pension, so we thought, let’s just do this ourselves,” Tina Carter said. “You just have to have the nerve to say ‘I’m going to do it.’ ”

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — After a week of testing tougher rhetoric on the campaign trail, Joe Biden's team released an ad punching Pete Buttigieg three days before the New Hampshire primary.
"We're electing a president. What you've done matters," the narrator says.
The 90-second digital ad paints Buttigieg, 38, as a critic of former President Barack Obama, while tying Biden, 77, Obama's No. 2 to the administration's achievements, including Obamacare, the Iran nuclear deal, and reinvigorating the economy.
The spot also pegs the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, as the city executive of a small town, showcasing his work installing decorative lights, licensing pet chip scanners, and fixing sidewalks.
Tweet
Biden, on the heels of a weak fourth-place finish in Iowa, went on the offensive this week against the winners of the first-in-the-nation caucuses, Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 78. The former vice president called the untested Buttigieg a "risk" at a rally in Somersworth, following up the hit with a tweet.
"Mayor Pete likes to call me part of the old failed Washington. Was it a failure when I helped pass Obamacare, the Paris Agreement, the Violence Against Women Act, or the assault weapons ban?" he wrote.
Tweet
He reiterated the sentiment at the New Hampshire debate, describing Buttigieg as a “mayor of a small city.” South Bend’s population is just under 102,000.
In response, Buttigieg's national press secretary Chris Meagher said in a statement that "Pete’s on the ground experience as mayor, turning around a Midwestern industrial city, is exactly why he is running for president."
"The vice president’s decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete’s perspective as a mayor and veteran," Meagher wrote.
Biden's spot comes after rival Tom Steyer, 62, released the primary cycle's first attack ad, jabbing at Delaware's senator for 36 years, as well as Buttigieg and Sanders.
Buttigieg is surging in New Hampshire off of his performance in Iowa ahead of the primary election on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Biden is bracing for "a hit" before he hopes to regain momentum for his presidential campaign in the coming contests in Nevada on Feb. 22 and South Carolina on Feb. 29.

Texto completo: A group of Republican senators reportedly tried to stop President Trump from firing former Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, but the president ousted him anyway.
Before Trump relieved Sondland of his post on Friday, several GOP senators — including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Martha McSally of Arizona, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — warned the White House against the move, according to the New York Times. They raised their concerns with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, arguing that it would be a bad look for the president to fire the impeachment witness.
The senators also noted that Sondland was already set to leave his position following the conclusion of Trump's Senate impeachment trial and suggested letting him determine when to exit himself in effort to avoid backlash. The ambassador was asked to resign regardless and reportedly refused, saying the administration would have to fire him in order for him to leave.
The president then recalled Sondland just hours after the White House ousted fellow impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who worked on European affairs at the National Security Council, along with his identical twin brother Yevgeny. Both Sondland and Vindman played instrumental roles in the House's impeachment investigation last year by providing testimony.
The House impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December following the scandal related to his July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He was acquitted of both charges by the Senate this week.

St. John grocery store to be part of NBC documentary

Texto completo: ST. JOHN — A visit of the “NBC Today Show Weekend” with Willie Geist to St. John’s White’s Foodliner grocery complex in St. John didn’t go as planned last week. Footage filmed, however, will be part of a special television documentary in the near future.
Residents and travelers through St. John have taken advantage of the food products, prescription medications and fuel island options at the White’s Foodliner since the complex was built two years ago in St. John.
The successful establishment of a grocery store in a rural Kansas community caught the attention of “NBC Today Show Weekend,” and a crew from NBC planned to be in St. John on Thursday to film a segment that will be included in a larger NBC story on shrinking rural access to necessities like food, gas and medication. The entire segment will highlight the success of small grocery stores. It will likely last about 3 minutes.
Carolyn Dunn, Stafford County economic director, said she received an email from a producer at the “Today show” who had seen a story in the New York Times about rural grocery stores and had read the Kansas State University Rural Grocery Initiative. The producer thought it a story worth highlighting.
At the core of the issue is an investment gap at the private level, public level and philanthropic level. This is not just about a food business being successful but also about population levels being strong enough to make entertainment, clothing, medical and other businesses successful.
Citizens of St. John were ready to meet and greet NBC television personalities at their grocery store as scheduled on Thursday afternoon, but Weekend Today producer Alicia Hastey flew into Wichita minus her television equipment. She had to reschedule her filming at St. John’s White’s Foodliner for Friday.
“She got here at 9 a.m. and took some shots of bananas and bread, but there were very few people in the grocery store at that time,” said David Cutright, local news director for SSCTV3, a St. John station. “It was just unfortunate that two of the people she had planned to interview were both sick with the flu, but she didn’t have much to work with.”
Cutright said Hastey was able to film a few soundbites that will be part of the larger work on rural grocery stores. She said she would stop in Kingman at the White’s Foodliner store there to interview the manager on her way back to Wichita.
“We’re still glad to be a small part of this segment,” Dunn said. “We are proud of the fact that our grocery store has had a good, positive effect on St. John’s economy.”
Reporter Gale Rose contributed to this story.

Saudis Aren’t U.S. Allies

Texto completo: The New York Times recently asked Democratic candidates for president if they “still consider Saudi Arabia an ally” after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, human rights violations and the war in Yemen.
But the question is based upon a false premise: Technically, Saudi Arabia never has been an ally. The two countries have never signed a treaty or a mutual defense pact, and the relationship between them has never gone beyond a narrow partnership on select issues.
The myth that Saudi Arabia and the United States are allies was built and perpetuated by the Americans who owned and ran the oil company in the kingdom and the Saudi state itself, beginning with a brief meeting between the king of Saudi Arabia and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to advance their own interests. But this myth cloaks the reality of a reluctant partnership.
Saudi Arabia was formed in 1932, after King Abdulaziz spent 30 years fighting, negotiating and marrying into alliances that unified the Arabian Peninsula. The first permanent contact from the United States came a year later, when Standard Oil of California negotiated an oil concession. Washington did not have official diplomatic representation in the kingdom, which was less important to the United States than Egypt, Palestinian territories under the British Mandate, and Lebanon under the French Mandate.
In 1945, Roosevelt planned to meet with King Farouk of Egypt and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. A meeting with King Abdulaziz was added. The White House described the meeting as standard. Nine years later, Col. William A. Eddy, who had served as the interpreter for the meeting, wrote a booklet, “FDR Meets Ibn Saud.” Eddy saw great importance in the meeting. But even he conceded that for Roosevelt, the only meaning was hearing the king’s perspective on Jewish immigration to the Palestinian territories.
Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt’s adviser, thought the meeting was routine.
While Saudi Arabia did enter World War II on the side of the Allies two weeks later, the kingdom never contributed to the war effort. Saudi interests, not a request from Roosevelt, drove this declaration: It earned the kingdom a seat at the United Nations. In August 1945, King Abdulaziz sent his 41-year-old son and foreign minister to forge a relationship with President Harry Truman, but this visit was largely ignored by a preoccupied government.
In 1946, the United States finally sent an ambassador to Saudi Arabia. But he was forced to reside 500 miles away from Riyadh. Non-Muslims were only permitted to live in Jiddah and on the Aramco base of Dhahran.
Yet, the 1945 meeting became the foundation of a myth thanks to Aramco, the American-owned oil company. The oilmen relied on American diplomatic assistance. To persuade the U.S. diplomats to assist, the company needed the perception that there was a close relationship between the two countries.
But the reality is that the United States and Saudi Arabia have had a simply transactional relationship.
During the Cold War, U.S.-Saudi relations revolved around oil and were strained over America’s policy toward Israel. Relations soured when Saudi Arabia embargoed oil shipments to the United States and, with OPEC, raised global oil prices, sending the U.S. economy into a deep recession in the mid-1970s.
In 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, King Fahd reluctantly invited U.S. and international forces to repel Iraq. Saudi Arabia fueled the forces and was a minor participant in the war. After the war, U.S. forces remained in Saudi Arabia to enforce the no-fly zones over Iraq.
Bin Laden exploited the fact that U.S. troops had protected Saudi Arabia as a recruiting point for al-Qaida. But bin Laden’s propaganda overstated the importance of the U.S. base.
In 2003, when the United States asked Saudi Arabia for permission to launch its invasion of Iraq from the kingdom, Saudi Arabia reluctantly agreed, but on the condition that after the invasion the U.S. military leave Saudi Arabia entirely. The decision came back to haunt the kingdom, as the United States set up its Persian Gulf base in Qatar, a rival. Saudi Arabia remains the U.S. defense industry’s largest foreign customer.
Perhaps the greatest cooperative effort between the United States and Saudi Arabia was the counterterrorism information-sharing program spearheaded by the CIA and former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is now persona non grata in the government. In 2017, the CIA awarded the prince its George Tenet Medal. This symbolizes the transactional nature of the U.S.-Saudi relationship.
Now that oil imports from Saudi Arabia are low, the economic connection between the countries is tenuous. Perhaps this is why the meeting between Roosevelt and Abdulaziz is frequently invoked as the crux of the “special” U.S.-Saudi relationship. While powerful forces have mythologized it for their own reasons, the United States and Saudi Arabia are not and never have been allies.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney in the movie mogul's rape and sexual assault trial said in an interview that she has never been a victim of sexual assault "because I would never put myself in that position."
In an interview released by The Daily podcast on Friday, Donna Rotunno, was asked whether she had ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not because I would never put myself in that position," she said on the New York Times podcast. "I've always made choices from college age on where I never drank too much. I never went home with someone that I didn't know. I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstances ever."
New York Times reporter Megan Twohey, who is co-author of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," pressed her on this assertion, ""Do you believe every woman who's been sexually assaulted somehow put herself in that position -- whether it was having drinks or agreeing to go to a hotel room?"
"Absolutely not. But just as we make smart decisions when we walk out on the street at night, I think you have to make the same decision when your putting yourself in circumstances with other people," Rotunno added.
"When we walk out at night we look around, we make sure we have our phone, some people take Mace. We take precautions. All I'm saying is women should take precautions."
Twohey tweet
The interview aired the day after the prosecution rested in a trial where, according to the New York Daily News, six women provided graphic testimony about unwanted sexual attacks and advances by the powerful movie producer whom prosecutors said used his power to prey on young, inexperienced women who were hoping to establish their movie careers.
The Rotunno-led defense for Weinstein, argues that the sexual encounters were consensual. As evidence, they have pointed to friendly messages that the women sent to Weinstein after the alleged attacks, CNN reported.
Furthering the controversy, Buzzfeed reported that prosecutors argued in court Friday that Rotunno had violated an explicit order from the trial judge about publicly discussing the case. Rotunno said the interview was done "a long time ago," before the case began, and she "had no idea" it would air Friday.
A NYT spokeswoman says Rotunno's interview was recorded on Jan. 28 -- well after the trial began Jan. 7 -- and she was "made aware of the air date," according to Buzzfeed.

Texto completo: Whether you're firing up Netflix or a Spotify playlist, streaming has become the en vogue mode of disseminating and consuming entertainment. What you binge-watch or bop your head to is a matter of subjectivity and personal preference. The same holds true for sports opinions.
So, it's time for a sports stream of consciousness. I'm sharing thoughts occupying bandwidth in my brain, starting with the Celtics changing my mind about their three wings fitting together.
1. The Celtics are making me a believer that Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Gordon Hayward can function and flourish as players with overlapping skill sets and All-Star performance aspirations.
For much of this season, I've been skeptical of the fit as the trio has treated the season like a relay race, taking turns with the basketball baton. The idea of dealing Hayward, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer, for a less-talented player capable of filling a more pressing need, say a rim-protecting big man, held appeal. The failure of last season's Kyrie Irving-led collection of talent that never coalesced left scars. But since Boston's blowout of LeBron James and the Lakers at TD Garden on Jan. 20, we've gotten a tantalizing taste of what the triumvirate can deliver together, piquing interest in what heights the Celtics can reach with Tatum, Brown, Hayward, Marcus Smart, and Kemba Walker, whom Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge called Boston's best player.
The trio of Tatum, Brown, and Hayward has a 16-7 record and a 13.6 net rating in 387 minutes of court time. But since Jan. 20, the trio's net rating is 34.8 in 86 minutes with a 5-0 record. That net rating was No. 1 in the NBA among all three-man lineups that had played 80 or more minutes from Jan. 20 through Feb. 7, proof they can play together.
The question is, can the Green extract the full potential from their top five players when they're all healthy, a rarity this season? The five-man lineup of Walker, Tatum, Brown, Hayward, and Smart has shared the court for just 13 minutes.
While the Celtics' inactivity at Thursday's NBA trade deadline was disappointing (more on that later), the upside of this group is undeniably intriguing — and worth exploring. If the Celtics can maximize and synergize the talents and the contributions of their three wings, they can challenge for Eastern Conference supremacy.
2. The Celtics didn't need any seismic deals at the deadline. Keeping the core intact made sense. But . . . it would have been nice if Danny the Dealer had dipped into his passel of draft picks to upgrade Boston's bench. Instead, he was Danny the Dormant at the deadline again. Entering Friday, the Celtics were 27th in bench scoring, ahead of only Philadelphia, Portland, and Houston. The 76ers augmented their bench with Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III, and the Rockets changed their mix by adding Robert Covington.
There's debate as to whether two first-round picks would have gotten a deal done with the Washington Wizards for sharpshooter Davis Bertans, an impending free agent. While its value has tanked, it would've been difficult to mortgage the Memphis pick for a rental. But it's hard to believe that Ainge couldn't have wrangled another bench piece using one of the three first-rounders the Celtics own in the 2020 draft — theirs, Milwaukee's, and the Memphis pick.
Ainge told “Toucher & Rich" on 98.5 The Sports Hub that he didn't want to give up too much for a rental player who would have been Boston's ninth man in the rotation. That seems like a stretch. Rookie Grant Williams has played well lately, but a bench booster would have slotted ahead of him and, possibly, Enes Kanter. We're really talking about the seventh or eighth guy. Ainge and the Celtics have a history of overvaluing draft picks or wasting them on players such as J.R. Giddens, JaJuan Johnson, and Guerschon Yabusele. This year's draft is weak. The Celtics' picks are all slated to land outside the lottery, and they don't have room for three rookies. This was a lost opportunity for Ainge.
3. There was a premature rush to bestow franchise quarterback status on former Patriot Jimmy Garoppolo, perhaps, out of a desire to claim one Patriots victory this postseason. Jimmy G was a passenger for the San Francisco 49ers' playoff run, and when they needed him to take the wheel and drive a fourth-quarter comeback in the Super Bowl, he posted the worst fourth-quarter passer rating in Super Bowl history (2.8). When pressured last Sunday, he was a disastrous 1 of 9 for 20 yards with two interceptions, two batted passes, and a sack, according to Pro Football Focus.
Garoppolo has the talent, smarts, and elan to be an elite quarterback someday. But he still has the training wheels on, as evidenced by how 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan shielded him and managed him like a stage mom in the playoffs. Like Lamar Jackson, who is 0-2 in the postseason, Garoppolo has to prove he can conquer the postseason proving ground.
4. One of the best story lines of the Kansas City Chiefs' comeback victory in the Super Bowl was that Patrick Mahomes's ethnicity wasn't a major story line. Mahomes, the son of African-American former Red Sox reliever Pat Mahomes, became the third Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Doug Williams and Russell Wilson. But the talk wasn't about a Black QB lifting the Lombardi Trophy as Super Bowl MVP. It was simply about one of the game's transcendent QBs taking his place atop the throne. That Mahomes's status as one of the NFL's best pure passers superseded his race is progress. So, is this: According to the New York Times, this past season featured the most starts ever by Black quarterbacks, 138.
5. While the fallout from the Houston Astros' illicit electronic sign-stealing scandal continues, with the Wall Street Journal reporting the Astros employed an Excel-based program to steal signs from 2016–18, one of the game's all-time greats took a swing at Major League Baseball's handling of the cheating. Count baseball's true home run king, Hank Aaron, among those who think commissioner Rob Manfred whiffed by failing to punish the players involved.
Aaron said on NBC's “Today" show he felt the punishment, or lack thereof, didn't fit the crime.
“I think whoever did that should be out of baseball for the rest of their lives," said Aaron.
It remains baffling that Manfred agreed to give the players complete immunity, especially because he stated Thursday at an owners' meeting that he believed, “We have the right to discipline players right now. I'm absolutely convinced of that fact."
He said it wasn't done in the Astros investigation because to ascertain the facts, MLB had to grant somebody immunity.
The flaw here is that there is zero deterrent moving forward for players — who can win more games and get paid more money — to refrain from engaging in a sign-stealing scheme, especially if they know that if they're caught, it will all fall on their manager and their front office.
Bonus tracks: A 17-game NFL regular season is player health and safety hypocrisy . . . What's next for the Red Sox in this offseason of discontent, locusts? . . . Trying to equal Michael Jordan would have discouraged most athletes. It inspired Kobe Bryant. In the end, he was more than a spiritual heir to His Airness. He became something iconic all his own.

Texto completo: Roger Kahn, the writer who weaved memoir and baseball and touched millions of readers through his romantic account of the Brooklyn Dodgers in "The Boys of Summer," has died. He was 92.
Gordon Kahn said his father died Thursday at a nursing facility in Mamaroneck.
The author of 20 books and hundreds of articles, Kahn was best known for the 1972 bestseller that looked at his relationship with his father through their shared love of the Dodgers, an object of nostalgia for the many fans who mourned the team's move to Los Angeles after the 1957 season.
"At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams," Kahn wrote.
"The Boys of Summer" was a story of lost youth, right down to its title, later borrowed for a hit Don Henley song about a man longing for his past. Kahn's book moved back and forth between the early 1950s, when he covered the Dodgers for the New York Herald Tribune, and 20 years later, when some of the players were ailing (Jackie Robinson), embittered (Carl Furillo) or in a wheelchair (Roy Campanella).
The book was an instant hit, although Kahn was criticized for sentimentalizing his story.
"Here is a book that succeeded for me despite almost everything about it," wrote Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, a late book critic for the New York Times.
Kahn began his prolific career in 1948 as a copy boy for the Herald Tribune and soon became a baseball writer, working under famed sports editor Stanley Woodward. He recalled Woodward as "a wonder" who once cured a writer of using the cliche "spine-tingling" by telling him to "go out in the bleachers and ask every one of those fans if his spine actually tingled."
He started writing about the Dodgers in 1952 and by 26 was the newspaper's prominent sports reporter, earning a salary of $10,000 and also covering the city's other baseball teams, the Giants and Yankees.
In 1956 he was named sports editor at Newsweek magazine, and he served at the Saturday Evening Post from 1963 to 1969 as editor at large. He also wrote for Esquire, Time and Sports Illustrated.
Kahn's sports writing often incorporated social issues, particularly race. He wrote at length about Robinson and his struggles in breaking baseball's color line, and the two formed a long friendship.
"By applauding Robinson, a man did not feel that he was taking a stand on school integration, or on open housing. But for an instant he had accepted Robinson simply as a hometown ball player," Kahn once wrote. "To disregard color, even for an instant, is to step away from the old prejudices, the old hatred. That is not a path on which many double back."
When Kahn was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig called him "an icon of our game."
Among Kahn's other sports books were 2004's "October Men: Reggie Jackson, George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and the Yankees' Miraculous Finish in 1978," 1986's "Joe and Marilyn: A Memory of Love" and 1999's "A Flame of Pure Fire: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring '20s."
One book caused lasting embarrassment: Kahn collaborated with Pete Rose on the 1989 authorized autobiography "Pete Rose: My Story." Rose, the major leagues' all-time hits leader, had recently been barred from baseball for betting on games, and the book featured his insistence that the allegations were untrue.
But Rose acknowledged years later, in a subsequent memoir, that he did gamble. Kahn said his "first reaction was to reach for the barf bag."
"I regret I ever got involved in the book," Kahn told the Los Angeles Times in 2007. "It turns out that Pete Rose was the Vietnam of ballplayers. He once told me he was the best ambassador baseball ever had. I've thought about that and wondered why we haven't sent him to Iran."
Kahn also wrote two novels and two nonfiction books not related to sports: 1968's "The Passionate People: What It Means to Be a Jew in America," and 1970's "The Battle for Morningside Heights: Why Students Rebel." He maintained a friendship with the poet Robert Frost, whom he profiled in the Saturday Evening Post.
He later taught writing at several colleges and lectured at Yale, Princeton and Columbia universities, and in 2004 he served a one-semester fellowship as the Ottaway Endowed Professor of Journalism at the State University of New York in New Paltz.
Kahn was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 31, 1927, and inherited his love of baseball from his father, who played third base for City College.
"There was nobody I enjoyed talking baseball with as much as this green-eyed, strong-armed, gentle, fierce, mustached, long-ball hitting, walking encyclopedia who was my father," he wrote in his 1997 "Memories of Summer."
A funeral is set for Feb. 10 in Katonah, N.Y.

Letting individual states innovate on Medicaid

Texto completo: In the realm of health care, proposals for change always provoke instant resistance. That reaction greeted Barack Obama when he proposed the Affordable Care Act -- and reemerged when Republicans tried to repeal it. So it's no surprise that the Trump administration's modification of Medicaid has come under fire.
But a reflexive attachment to the status quo is the enemy of progress. Medicaid is one of the nation's biggest and most expensive social programs, covering 1 in 7 adults under age 65 and costing nearly $600 billion in 2018. In Illinois, about 1 in 4 are covered. Making sure taxpayers spend no more than necessary and get the maximum benefit from every dollar is a worthy goal.
The Department of Health and Human Services plan will let states gain waivers from some federal rules in exchange for accepting block grants -- a shift from open-ended individual entitlements. Currently, Washington covers from 50% to 75% of the cost of covering children, seniors, disabled people and pregnant women. In states such as Illinois that expanded coverage under the ACA to include low-income adults, the feds pay 90% of that cost.
Under the new HHS policy, states could apply new rules only to those adults covered under the ACA expansion. States that find ways to reduce costs would get to keep the savings. Supporters think better management can make the program more efficient, reducing costs without affecting the level of care. Critics fear that states will simply shrink coverage, to the detriment of needy recipients.
Either is possible. But there is no way to generate useful innovations without trying new things. Giving states more latitude, if they want it, offers policymakers the chance to adopt different reforms on a relatively small scale -- and get answers that other states can learn from. Those governors and legislators who fail, of course, will have to answer to their constituents.
It's worth remembering the dire warnings that were raised in 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed a welfare reform measure imposing work requirements and time limits on recipients' benefits. In practice, though, the worst didn't happen. Welfare rolls shrank and poverty rates declined.
Nor is the new Medicaid policy of value only to states that want to curtail coverage. "The new funding option could possibly have the effect of the increasing the number of Medicaid beneficiaries in some states -- namely the 14 that have not yet expanded Medicaid, who might see it as a more conservative way to move forward in covering poor adults," reports The New York Times.
States that agree to the new arrangement would be allowed to impose premiums and co-payments on recipients but could not require anyone to pay more than 5% of their income. That would discourage unnecessary visits and treatment.
States also could exclude some prescription drugs from coverage -- a lever that could be used to extract lower prices from pharmaceutical companies. In 2018, the notably progressive state of Massachusetts wanted federal permission to try this approach to "avoid exorbitant spending on high-cost drugs that are not medically necessary." But the Trump administration refused. Now Massachusetts will have the option. And should it seize the chance and realize successful results, other states could follow suit.
In all, the administration's new rules are a modest, reasonable change. As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in 1932, "It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."
Will this Medicaid experiment be a success, a failure or something in between? There is only one way to find out.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein's lead defense lawyer, in an lengthy interview made public Friday, appeared to lay some of the blame for sexual assaults against women on the victims.
Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi complained loudly in court about the comments made by Donna Rotunno in a New York Times podcast recorded last week. The Weinstein lawyer, who has represented a number of #MeToo defendants, replied quickly when asked during the interview if she was ever sexually assaulted.
"I have not, I have not, because I would never put myself in that position," said Rotunno. "I've always made choices from college age on where I never drank too much, never went home with someone I didn't know. I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance. Never."
Illuzzi was also irked by a Rotunno reference to America's "society of celebrity victimhood status ... a society where women don't have to take any responsibility for their actions." Illuzzi griped that Rotunno's sitdown with the Times flew in the face of instructions by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke for both sides to avoid the media during the trial.
"She's calling our witnesses liars and 'celebrity victimhood status,' and it is completely in contradiction to your order," Illuzzi told Burke. "So we are asking for you to order the defense to cease and desist any discussion about this case in public."
Rotunno insisted she had not spoken with any reporters since the trial began, and only learned about the podcast's airing in a Friday morning phone call from a friend.
"That was taped a long time ago," she claimed. "I have not spoken to anyone in the media. Have not spoken to anyone since we started this case. That was taped a while ago, and I did not speak about any witness individually."
The Times, in a statement released Friday, said Rotunno sat for the interview last week and was aware in advance of the air date. Burke imposed no sanctions after hearing from both sides.
Weinstein, 67, appeared to fall asleep at times during the morning testimony, his head drooping down as his lawyers put on their case. The defendant also removed his blazer at one point as a memory expert became the second defense witness called by Rotunno.
The high-profile trial was winding down, with the prosecution resting its case Thursday after calling 27 witnesses against Weinstein - including six accusers who graphically detailed about their unwanted sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer.

Texto completo: For nearly a decade, Lesley and D. Michael Risinger pored over transcripts, interviewed witnesses, consulted firearms experts and argued in courtrooms, with help of a team of Seton Hall law students.
Their goal: Free two men they believed were wrongly convicted for a double murder in Camden a quarter-century ago.
That chance at freedom came Dec. 26, when a New Jersey appeals court overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial for Kevin Baker and Shawn Washington, who were found guilty of the killings and locked away in state prison in 1996.
For the husband-and-wife legal team who run the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, it was a hard-fought first victory after years of work to make the justice system face up to its own flaws.
"There's nothing worse than being locked up for something you didn't do, especially if it's a long sentence," said Lesley Risinger, who co-founded the program in 2011 and serves as director. "When someone is locked up, possibly for life, for a crime they had nothing to do with, it's a thing you get inside you and that you feel is intolerable."
The Exoneration Project is driven by a key premise — that the criminal justice system makes mistakes and may send people to prison for crimes they did not commit. An estimated 1% to 5% of those in prison have been wrongfully convicted, according to a report last year ordered by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal.
Assuming a 1% rate of wrongful conviction in New Jersey, nearly 200 of those currently in a state prison population of about 19,500 people are innocent. Yet there have been only 37 overturned convictions in the state since 1989, the report said.
'Total failure of the defense' Lesley Risinger first got involved in cases of the wrongfully accused nearly 30 years ago, when she helped her mother, an attorney, appeal the conviction of Luis Kevin Rojas of Weehawken. Rojas, 18 at the time of the alleged crime, had been found guilty of a fatal shooting in 1990, but the case was marred by mistaken identity and missing eyewitness testimony, his attorneys successfully argued. He was freed after a retrial in 1998.
Risinger later represented Fernando Bermudez, who was convicted in a 1991 Manhattan murder, but the case was based on perjured testimony, Risinger argued. In 2009, a judge freed Bermudez after 18 years in prison.
In 2011, the Risingers launched the Last Resort Exoneration Project and got many letters from prisoners claiming innocence and looking for help. With help from law students, they vet cases for evidence that could prove a conviction was improper.
The application from Kevin Baker, one of the two convicts in the Camden case, was compelling.
"It cried out for attention simply based on the weakness of the evidence and the total failure of the defense to present a defense," said Lesley Risinger, 62, a former adjunct professor who graduated from the law school in 2003.
The case rested on testimony from a single witness who was high on crack at the time of the shooting and whose story was so shaky that defense lawyers thought it wouldn't be believed, Risinger said. The state called six witnesses during the two-day trial, while the defense called none, court records show.
The proceedings ended in a guilty verdict and life sentences with no chance of parole for 60 years. John Wynne, an assistant Camden County prosecutor on the case, told The New York Times in 1996 that even he was surprised by the verdict.
"We had to do the investigation that should have been done then," said D. Michael Risinger, 72, the associate director of the Exoneration Project.
Last month, a state appeals court finally agreed, ordering a new trial. The court ruled that additional evidence not presented at the time "probably would have changed the jury's verdict." Jurors never heard a recording of Baker's 911 call or a forensics analysis showing that the shooting could not have happened as the witness described, the court found.
Baker and Washington, who is represented by Lawrence Lustberg, an attorney with Gibbons P.C. in Newark, remain in state prison in Trenton waiting to find out whether the Camden County prosecutor will seek a new trial.
The Risingers hope a conviction review unit created by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office last year will end the case and the Prosecutor's Office will determine that pursuing it "would be fruitless and unjust."
In a statement, Grewal said his office and Camden prosecutors are "committed to pursuing the just result in each and every case.
"We are actively reviewing this case, including the trial evidence and the extensive appellate and post-conviction proceedings that have taken place over the past 25 years," Grewal said.
A passion for the work The Last Resort Exoneration Project is similar to "innocence projects" that rely on DNA to prove that individuals did not commit crimes of which they were accused.
But the Risingers have taken an even more difficult route, choosing cases that lack DNA evidence but where other facts show the defendants did not receive a fair trial. They said they closely review applications to see where there's a strong legal case to prove innocence.
The Baker case is the Exoneration Project's first overturned conviction and required extensive litigation, expert analysis and hundreds of legal exhibits. The Risingers said they have also given close consideration to at least a dozen more cases.
About half a dozen law school students volunteer with the program each year. Over nine years, about a dozen worked on the Camden case, studying case files, reviewing trial documents and giving feedback on oral arguments.
They include Renee Mariotti, a part-time law student from New York City who chose Seton Hall Law in part for the chance to work at the Exoneration Project. Her interest came after listening to podcasts about wrongful convictions, in particular the Baltimore murder case of Adnan Syed made famous in the podcast "Serial."
"These are men who have been imprisoned for, coming up on 25 years, crimes they did not commit," Mariotti said of Baker and Washington. "It's nice to see the law working in what feels like the right way in this case. That's not always the outcome."
Amy Cuzzolino, a Bloomfield native who graduated in 2016, helped review applications to find viable legal cases. Her work gave her more insight into how the justice system works — and fails, she said.
"I didn't come away with a sense that the system is bad because of bad actors in it. It's more a question of inefficiency and limited resources. There are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but don't know how," said Cuzzolino, who is studying for an advanced degree in international law.
The Risingers, who live in Kearny, don't take a salary for their work. Private donations to the program pay for expenses like buying transcripts and consulting experts.
Michael Risinger, who worked on civil rights cases involving wrongful police shootings in the '70s and '80s, said he has devoted his career to making sure the legal system is accurate, especially in criminal cases. The former Seton Hall law professor served on the New Jersey Supreme Court's Committee on Evidence for 25 years.
He and his wife, who married in 2004 and have six children from previous marriages, see their work with the Exoneration Project as a calling, he said.
"We have sufficient money. We live very frugally, and we don't have ambitions to take grand tours or anything," he said. "We'd rather do this."

1970 hit 'Love Story' is back in theaters. Go see it

Texto completo: Loving "Love Story" means never having to say you're sorry you love "Love Story."
No apologies. No denials. No remarks like, "I know it's corny, but..."
Go on, weep. Let it out.
Bawl into your popcorn as lovely Ali McGraw, the spirited Radcliffe music major, says her deathbed farewell to Ryan O'Neal, the handsome Harvard preppie. "Love means never having to say you're sorry," she tells him — in the movie, on the poster, and in that mystic land where pop culture clichés live forever.
What can you say about an iconic movie that is coming back to theaters for Valentine's Day week?
That it grossed $106 million? That it was a surprise mega-hit in 1970? That it divided the nation between those who wept and those who snickered?
That you can see it at 1 p.m. Sunday and 7 p.m. Wednesday at AMC Theaters across the country?
In a way, "Love Story" was an early broadside in the culture wars. It pit the critical elites, who mocked it in print and on TV, against Mr. and Mrs. Average American, who thought it was just swell. "You ain't human if you don't cry at that movie," said a character, defensively, in a TV sitcom of the era.
"I think both of those arguments — those who were moved to tears, and those who thought it was sappy and sentimental — have a point," said TCM host Ben Mankiewicz, who will be introducing the screenings, sponsored by Fathom Events, Turner Classic Movies and Paramount Pictures.
Among the things critics cackled over in 1970: the malady (never named) that doomed Jenny Cavalieri dies from. What kind of illness makes you even prettier on your deathbed? "Old Movie Disease" was the diagnosis of Mad Magazine.
"I suspect cancer makes people uncomfortable," Mankiewicz said. "That certainly would not be the case if they remade it today."
As for the heroine who becomes more beautiful as she dies — well, in operas, the heroine sings as she dies. "I think if the doctors accept it, and Ryan O'Neal accepts it, we accept it," Mankiewicz said. "We just buy what the characters in the movie accept. That's one of the beautiful things about movies."
As "Love Story" turned into the No. 1 grosser of 1970, and the book became the top-selling work of fiction the same year — the first time a novelization made it to the New York Times bestseller lists — it propelled writer Erich Segal, a Harvard classics professor and sometime movie writer ("Yellow Submarine") to fame as the culture warrior of the squares.
A key moment of the era was a January 1971 Dick Cavett Show, when Segal shared the stage with snide highbrow critic John Simon and rocker Little Richard.
"I have read and reread ["Love Story"] many times," Segal told Cavett modestly. "I am always moved."
Simon called Segal a "knave." Segal called Simon an "effete litterateur."
It was a momentous clash — so much so that later, commentators offered different versions, "Rashomon"-style.
To sci-fi writer Harlan Ellison (he had a TV column at the time), it was nothing less than a pivotal moment in Western civilization. Simon, the heroic critic, was the only thing standing between us and the Visigoths.
"Debasing emotions like love and recognition of one's own mortality," Ellison said, is "the cheap trick of panhandlers, flack merchants, con men."
"I am not bought that cheaply," said Ellison, grandly. "And neither are my tears."
Meanwhile, rock critic Greil Marcus saw both Simon and Segal as frauds. "Little Richard was the only artist on the stage that night," he wrote in his book "Mystery Train."
In the end, civilization survived. So did "Love Story." The famous theme music by Francis Lai became a favorite piece of elevator music, in versions by Ferrante & Teicher, Mantovani, and Andy Williams. There was a sequel, "Oliver's Story."
"This is a story of capitalism, as much as it is a love story," Mankiewicz said. "The people who made it were looking to make money."
Harvard freshmen, it is said, are still shown "Love Story" as part of orientation week. They cackle, hoot, and send it up, a la "Rocky Horror Picture Show."
They have every right. Harvard is not only the setting of the film but also the inspiration for the characters. Oliver is said to be a mashup of Harvard graduates Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones; Jones made his film debut in the movie.
"Segal went to Harvard and he knew those guys," Mankiewicz said. "It makes sense that he would craft the character of Oliver out of the Harvard students that he knew."
For the rest of us, "Love Story" is a movie that can still move, Mankiewicz said. In a battle between the head and heart, most moviegoers will go for the tear ducts.
"If what you really want is to immerse yourself in a cinematic experience, I think being moved is going to win," he said.

A modest proposal for Iowa

Texto completo: Lately, it has been exceedingly hard to miss that the Iowa Caucuses aren't, not to put too fine a point on it, universally popular.
Those who believe Iowa shouldn't go first point to the overwhelming whiteness of the state, the overwhelming rurality of the state, the overwhelmingly older population of the state. Those who dislike the caucus format argue that the system is anti-democratic, a form of voter suppression against those with children or jobs or disabilities; a deterrent to those who do not wish to publicly share their vote and a logistical nightmare of finding locations to hold thousands of arguing activists.
Iowa is first because state law requires that we caucus before any other nominating process. New Hampshire is second because its state law says it must primary first, and Iowa doesn't primary — the only place — if you believe the wailing from opinion pieces in national media. If Iowa switches from a caucus to a primary, New Hampshire's primary has to move earlier so that it remains first. We could get caught up in a race of leapfrog, each state bouncing backward a week until the next primary takes place before the previous election. Or until the Supreme Court decides who gets to be very most firstest.
So, here we are: Iowa the first nominating contest, New Hampshire the first primary, and no one happy. Well, some people happy. In what other state are endorsements from local officials and activists so dearly sought after — or do nationally recognized politicians regularly endorse in local races? In what other state can a tiny diner be a nationally recognized, must-see political destination? What other snow-bound state boasts hotels stuffed with journalists and prominent national figures for the entire month of January?
And with out-of-staters howling for the end of Iowa's primacy in the rudest possible terms, well, we aren't likely to see the end of the First-In-The-Nation Caucus any time soon. We Iowans tend to dig in when outsiders try to tell us what to do, and we know a good deal when we see one.
Dear reader, we believe that we Iowans could find ways to deliberate with our neighbors in crowded gyms without presidential caucuses, but we know that the boost to our state's economy, national profile, and pet issues would be terrible to give up. So we have an idea. We Iowans can give up the first-in-the-nation status in exchange for... wait for it... moving the nation's capital to Des Moines.
Consider the benefits: Iowa would no longer endure attention from scornful coast-dwellers every four years. Perhaps we could even become the Landlocked Elites, scornful of those suckers dwelling by the rising seas. We could move to a ranked-choice primary system, avoid disenfranchising anyone, and let other states bicker over who should be anointed Most Reflective Of The U.S. As A Whole and therefore go first.
Washington, D.C., could finally become a state, change its license plates, and stop putting up with people constantly marching all over. (No problem for Des Moines; it should be well-prepared for all sorts of marching after this cycle's parade of presidential candidates.) And no more jokes about Flyover Country when we are the physical heart and soul of the country.
It's really not healthy or sensible for the capital of our country — once so centrally located among 13 states — to be as remote as Washington, D.C., can be. So just like the Iowa capital moved westward as the state's population grew westward, we should finally move the capital of the United States to the heart of the country. Based on the scope of the media uproar over Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus over the past month, we're confident that everyone from the New York Times to the L.A. Times will be on board, and we look forward to having the President ensconced in the Golden-Domed House by 2024.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING — Michigan State University President Samuel Stanley said staff at the Wharton Center is being restructured after a gift shop display of dolls depicting black historical figures hanging from a rack resembling a tree led to widespread outrage.
In a letter he sent to the MSU community on Thursday and posted on the president's website, Stanley apologized for the display. He promised the university is taking the situation seriously and taking steps to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.
"This was a disturbing reminder of our country's history of terror and unrelenting brutality that targeted individuals based on their race," Stanley wrote. "Members of our community were hurt. Though this display was created to honor prominent African Americans during Black History Month, we cannot ignore the historical context that made it exceedingly painful and traumatic to our community members.
"This display was unacceptable and should never have been put up. I'm sorry that this happened. It has been taken down. We can, and must, do better as Spartans. We need to do the necessary work that better informs our thinking and deepens our understanding of how our actions affect others."
"The center is undergoing a full restructuring of staff, including management," Stanley wrote in the letter. More details were not in the letter, but Dan Olsen, an MSU spokesman, said the reorganization will be confined to gift shop staff.
Stanley wrote that diversity within the center's workforce would be a priority.
All staff and volunteers also will go through mandatory racial-bias education and development starting Wednesday in coordination with the MSU Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives.
Olsen said the Wharton Center will reevaluate the roles and responsibilities for gift shop workers and volunteers. A final determination will be made once those employees and volunteers complete the racial-bias education and development.
Additional plans are in the works to make a diversity, equity, and inclusion committee consisting of faculty, staff, students, volunteers and other community members to "bring a diverse range of identities and perspectives to the Wharton Center," according to Stanley.
"There is no denying this happened on our campus, at a location that was meant to recognize the contributions of MSU's past president, Clifton R. Wharton Jr., a great American and MSU leader and his wife, Dolores Wharton, who both came to campus with a deep appreciation for the arts," Stanley wrote in the letter. "We have work to do."
Wharton, 93, served as MSU's president from 1970 to 1978. His tenure at MSU marked the first time a black president was selected by a major university where the majority of students were white, the New York Times reported. Wharton left MSU to serve as chancellor of the State University of New York and later held business and diplomatic roles, including Under Secretary of State in the Clinton Administration.
While at MSU, Wharton and his wife, Dolores, promoted the plan to build a new performance venue to replace the aging MSU Auditorium. They also headed the successful fundraising campaign. When the new performing arts center opened in 1982, it was named in their honor.
The display in the gift shop was discovered last week. It featured a rack resembling a tree to hang felt ornaments resembling Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Prince and other African-American leaders.
Krystal Rose Davis-Dunn, a 31-year-old black graduate student at MSU, came across the displays after a jazz concert she had attended with a friend who wanted to check out the gift shop after the show. The dolls hanging from the tree was one of the first things she noticed when they walked in.
They kept walking around and she spotted four or five similar trees and a larger tree with "a lot more" black leaders.
"The Wharton Center recognizes the need for greater diversity among its staff and volunteers and for creating an environment that reflects our best efforts. However, they are not alone in that need," Stanley wrote. "Our entire campus must view this as an opportunity to learn and reflect on what we can and should do to create a safe and inclusive culture, and we must hold ourselves accountable for achieving these goals."

Texto completo: Were the Steven Cohen-Sterling Partners talks actually in danger?
Since Tuesday, everyone has pondered it. An answer arrived two days later.
The deal to purchase the New York Mets is dead, though the Wilpons are still looking to sell.
"The transaction between Sterling and Steve Cohen was a highly complicated one," Sterling Partners, which is owned by Fred Wilpon, said in a statement on Thursday night. "Despite the efforts of the parties over the past several months, it became apparent that the transaction as contemplated would have been too difficult to execute.
"Sterling intends now to pursue a new transaction and has engaged Allen & Company to manage that process."
Via a statement to the New York Times, Cohen said: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
In December, the Sterling Partners announced it was negotiating to sell a majority share of the Mets to Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire. Under the agreement, Fred and Jeff Wilpon would retain their titles for five years.
Earlier on Thursday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dealt a bit of a reality blow to those hoping the Wilpons would be able to sell the Mets to Cohen. Manfred, while speaking at the owners meetings in Florida, said it was this transaction would not occur.
"I want to thank the fans for their support and the respect they showed me," Cohen said, "and I want to thank Commissioner Manfred and MLB for their support through the process.
"I gave it my best shot."
On Tuesday, a Barstool Sports podcast reported that negotiations were not going well. Hours later, the Mets released this statement: "The parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, including a mutual non-disclosure agreement, and therefore cannot comment."
Sometimes, silence or a no comment is seen is a negative. We didn't know in this case, mostly because non-disclosure agreements are common in business. The speculation began.
Were the Wilpons at fault again? What happened to the deal? Was this news leak a negotiation ploy used to gain leverage?
Per the New York Post on Wednesday, "the Wilpons recently made it clear to Cohen that while he would be paying hundreds of millions of dollars every year, they would in fact retain control over all decision-making regarding the franchise until the end of five years."
This Cohen snag is the latest in a line of weird situations involving the Wilpons.
In 2011, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn accused the Wilpons of changing the terms to his deal to buy a minority stake in the Mets.
Nine years before, the Wilpons became owners when Fred bought out Nelson Doubleday. But Doubleday levied accusations of misconduct over what the team was valued.
Manfred on Thursday said that any accusation that the Wilpons acted in bad faith was "completely and utterly unfair."
As the statement at the top of this story outlines, the Wilpons still intend to search for a new transaction. The timeline is unknown.
The Mets for years have been branded as the big-market team that rarely spends like it. Fans hoped Cohen — who would've been the richest owner in baseball — could immediately alter that perception.
It will have to be someone else, unless the two sides reconvene in the future.
This saga caps a wild offseason for the Mets, who ...
Fired a manager, hired a manager, parted with the first manager, hired a new manager. Oh, and that doesn't count the personnel moves and restructuring Yoenis Céspedes' contract.
Pitchers and catchers report to Port St. Lucie, Florida, for spring training next week. Finally, baseball will be the center of conversation — or at least you'd hope. But the Mets remained active, for better or worse, over the last four months.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

Tips for married couples on Valentine's Day

Texto completo: Valentine's Day is coming! Prepare yourself for an onslaught of Instagram posts featuring bright flowers, sparkling jewelry, and oversized teddy bears. Your feed is about to get #blessed. If you get to know me for more than 10 seconds, you know that's not what I'm about. Heck, my husband isn't even on social media. And I'm okay with that.
One study wanted to find out if couples who post excessively about each other are actually happier in their relationships. Spoiler alert: They're not. The study found "over-the-top displays are being used to compensate for weaker relationships."
This doesn't mean you don't love your husband if you talk about how wonderful he is on social media. Hopefully, you and your spouse affirm each other daily and in person.
But when I think about the healthiest couples I know, they're not the ones posting about each other 24/7. They're also not worried about what other people think, so they're not buying more stuff to impress people (just so they can post about it). They're secure in their lives, but not because of an expensive lifestyle that they can flaunt. Instead, the couples I look up to have one thing in common — they're all intentional in their marriages.
A strong marriage doesn't happen by chance. If you want to be intentional and make your spouse feel really secure, work together on these three areas:
1. Set goals together A 2017 study by Ramsey Solutions revealed that 94 percent of couples who describe their marriages as "great" also say they discuss money goals together. Getting on the same page financially with your spouse is one of the best things you can do for your marriage. If you need some help reconnecting and realigning the goals of your relationship, check out this episode of The Rachel Cruze Show (rachelcruze.com/show/money-mistakes-that-can-ruin-your-relationships). You'll learn about money mistakes that can ruin your relationship, and practical ways to communicate and work better together.
2. Be willing to have tough conversations My friend, Dr. Les Parrott, says conflict is the price we pay for a deeper level of intimacy. You can disagree, and still make space to hear each other. Hashing it out, putting in the work, and coming from a place of understanding will only make you stronger. And by the way, I'm a huge fan of counseling for every marriage, not just the ones in crisis mode.
3. Don't compare your marriage to someone else's Comparison will steal your joy and frustrate your spouse. Too many people let Instagram-level expectations form their values and family priorities. I've been there, too, and I know it's an empty and endless battle trying to keep up. Spend that time and energy focusing on all the things you truly love about your spouse, and the life you've already built together.
Flowers will die, and jewelry will tarnish. But a relationship built on these three principles will make your marriage a blessing, not just #blessed.

Puerto Rico aid bill goes to Senate House approval comes amid White House veto threat

Texto completo: The House of Representatives approved $4.67 billion in additional aid relief to Puerto Rico on Friday, with just three GOP congressmen from Florida joining 14 other Republicans in voting for the bill.
But with a threat to veto the bill coming from the White House, it's unclear if the Senate will even hold a vote. And Florida's GOP senators were noncommittal.
Republican U.S. Reps. Michael Waltz, R-St. Augustine, Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, and Bill Posey, R-Rockledge, in joining the Democratic majority in voting in favor.
More than $3 billion would be allocated for disaster-relief grants, as well as more than $200 million for the food-stamp program and about $18 million to bolster the island's electrical grid, according to the New York Times.
The White House Office of Management and Budget issued a statement Wednesday opposing the bill, saying the island is already "projected to receive $90 billion in disaster funds."
That includes the $44 billion currently allocated to Puerto Rico, $22 billion the government has promised to spend.
While President Donald Trump has often touted a $90 billion or $91 billion number, PolitiFact reported he probably included additional estimated FEMA costs of $50 billion, which is a speculative "high-end estimate of what would need to be committed" over the course of many years. None of that money has yet been allocated.
The OMB said the House was "rushing this bill through its process - and seeking to push taxpayer dollars out the door - even before the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has completed its review of the damage caused by earthquakes that have recently affected the island."
It recommended a Trump veto of the bill, adding, "neither Puerto Ricans nor the American taxpayers benefit when emergency aid is misallocated, lost, or stolen through waste, fraud, and abuse," and citing Puerto Rico's "long history of inadequate financial controls over regular government operations."
"Multiple high-profile cases of corruption have marred distribution of aid already appropriated and have led to ongoing political instability on the island," the OMB stated.
Terrie Rizzo, the Florida Democratic chair, said in a statement Thursday, "Here we go again."
"Trump has consistently failed Puerto Ricans since he took office - he has neglected to distribute the billions of dollars in aid that Congress approved following Hurricane Maria's devastation; he ignored the island during his recent State of the Union Address; and now, he is threatening to veto necessary aid after major earthquakes further damaged the island," Rizzo said.
U.S. Rep. Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee, also wrote in a tweet, "When our brothers & sisters in Puerto Rico are in need, WE ACT. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly in delivering on our promise to help our fellow Americans recover & rebuild."
U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Winter Park, said in a statement, "Every dollar is critical-and every dollar must be accounted for and reach the Puerto Rico residents who need it most."
In the Republican Senate, there were mixed messages as to whether a companion bill would pass or even come up for a vote following the White House veto threat.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told Bloomberg News he believes the island needs more help, saying, "We'll do whatever it takes. This is serious, serious, serious business."
A spokesperson for Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott said he was "reviewing" the bill but wouldn't commit to it.
"The Senator is in constant communication with the Island's leadership, FEMA, and has spoken to the President about the importance of quickly getting aid to Puerto Rico," his office stated. "Senator Scott also met with Governor Vazquez and Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón this week to discuss the resources Puerto Rico needs to recover from the earthquakes, and he will always work to support our brothers and sisters on the Island."
Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio's office was also noncommittal on whether Rubio would support the bill.

Texto completo: Some signs read "Trump 2020." Another said "We don't need your dirty $$." And another said "Killing tiny humans is not health care."
A crowd of protesters joined dozens of supporters at presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg's campaign event Friday in Norfolk. It's his fifth visit to Virginia since launching his campaign in November, his team said.
One man, Rick Bryson, went to protest with his 13-year-old son.
"I served 25 years in the Air Force," Bryson said. "I thought I had solidified my rights in this country. Now, you have somebody like (Mike Bloomberg) trying to come in and take my Second Amendment rights."
He said legislators want to take away guns so that they can rule over citizens, like a dictatorship. He didn't go register for the event or head inside.
"I will not give them money to talk to somebody that doesn't want to hear what you have to say," he said.
Lisa Ross didn't register, either, but stood outside the gate in front of the Half Moone Cruise & Celebration Center to see what was going on. The Virginia Beach resident wanted to learn more about Bloomberg, she said.
"I've followed his commercials," she said. "I've followed a little bit about him."
She said she has some concerns about his track record as mayor of New York City, including his stance on stop-and-frisk policies, which targeted blacks and Latinos, The New York Times reported. Bloomberg apologized in November for supporting the strategy.
Ross, who is undecided on for whom she will vote, hoped to learn more about what Bloomberg hopes to bring to the table, and see how authentic he is. She also said he is interesting because of his approach to his candidacy.
"It's so tactical and money is no object," she later said in an email. "I'll be doing some additional research on his ideas."
Cheri Britt traveled from Williamsburg to protest in support of gun rights and against abortion rights.
Holding a sign that read "Killing tiny humans is not health care," she said Bloomberg supports a woman's right to choose without fully understanding it.
"I'm all for choice myself," she said. "Where you send your kids to school, who you marry, where you go to school. All those things. But ending the life of another human being is not another choice that we should have."
While waiting in line to get into the event, Keith Ehrhard and his wife, Merri, said they were there to make a more informed decision about the 2020 election.
"I think everybody in the country should be doing the same thing," he said.
"We've just got to beat Trump," his wife chimed in with a laugh.

A CHANCE AT FREEDOM

Texto completo: For nearly a decade, Lesley and D. Michael Risinger pored over transcripts, interviewed witnesses, consulted firearms experts and argued in courtrooms, with help of a team of Seton Hall law students.
Their goal: Free two men they believed were wrongly convicted for a double murder in Camden a quarter-century ago.
That chance at freedom came Dec. 26, when a New Jersey appeals court overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial for Kevin Baker and Shawn Washington, who were found guilty of the killings and locked away in state prison in 1996.
For the husband-and-wife legal team who run the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, it was a hard-fought first victory after years of work to make the justice system face up to its own flaws.
"There's nothing worse than being locked up for something you didn't do, especially if it's a long sentence," said Lesley Risinger, who co-founded the program in 2011 and serves as director. "When someone is locked up, possibly for life, for a crime they had nothing to do with, it's a thing you get inside you and that you feel is intolerable."
The Exoneration Project is driven by a key premise — that the criminal justice system makes mistakes and may send people to prison for crimes they did not commit. An estimated 1% to 5% of those in prison have been wrongfully convicted, according to a report last year ordered by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal.
Assuming a 1% rate of wrongful conviction in New Jersey, nearly 200 of those currently in a state prison population of about 19,500 people are innocent. Yet there have been only 37 overturned convictions in the state since 1989, the report said.
'Total failure of the defense' Lesley Risinger first got involved in cases of the wrongfully accused nearly 30 years ago, when she helped her mother, an attorney, appeal the conviction of Luis Kevin Rojas of Weehawken. Rojas, 18 at the time of the alleged crime, had been found guilty of a fatal shooting in 1990, but the case was marred by mistaken identity and missing eyewitness testimony, his attorneys successfully argued. He was freed after a retrial in 1998. Risinger later represented Fernando Bermudez, who was convicted in a 1991 Manhattan murder, but the case was based on perjured testimony, Risinger argued. In 2009, a judge freed Bermudez after 18 years in prison.
In 2011, the Risingers launched the Last Resort Exoneration Project and got many letters from prisoners claiming innocence and looking for help. With help from law students, they vet cases for evidence that could prove a conviction was improper.
The application from Kevin Baker, one of the two convicts in the Camden case, was compelling.
"It cried out for attention simply based on the weakness of the evidence and the total failure of the defense to present a defense," said Lesley Risinger, 62, a former adjunct professor who graduated from the law school in 2003.
The case rested on testimony from a single witness who was high on crack at the time of the shooting and whose story was so shaky that defense lawyers thought it wouldn't be believed, Risinger said. The state called six witnesses during the two-day trial, while the defense called none, court records show.
The proceedings ended in a guilty verdict and life sentences with no chance of parole for 60 years. John Wynne, an assistant Camden County prosecutor on the case, told The New York Times in 1996 that even he was surprised by the verdict.
"We had to do the investigation that should have been done then," said D. Michael Risinger, 72, the associate director of the Exoneration Project.
Last month, a state appeals court finally agreed, ordering a new trial. The court ruled that additional evidence not presented at the time "probably would have changed the jury's verdict." Jurors never heard a recording of Baker's 911 call or a forensics analysis showing that the shooting could not have happened as the witness described, the court found.
Baker and Washington, who is represented by Lawrence Lustberg, an attorney with Gibbons P.C. in Newark, remain in state prison in Trenton waiting to find out whether the Camden County prosecutor will seek a new trial.
The Risingers hope a conviction review unit created by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office last year will end the case and the Prosecutor's Office will determine that pursuing it "would be fruitless and unjust."
In a statement, Grewal said his office and Camden prosecutors are "committed to pursuing the just result in each and every case.
"We are actively reviewing this case, including the trial evidence and the extensive appellate and post-conviction proceedings that have taken place over the past 25 years," Grewal said.
A passion for the work The Last Resort Exoneration Project is similar to "innocence projects" that rely on DNA to prove that individuals did not commit crimes of which they were accused.
But the Risingers have taken an even more difficult route, choosing cases that lack DNA evidence but where other facts show the defendants did not receive a fair trial. They said they closely review applications to see where there's a strong legal case to prove innocence.
The Baker case is the Exoneration Project's first overturned conviction and required extensive litigation, expert analysis and hundreds of legal exhibits. The Risingers said they have also given close consideration to at least a dozen more cases.
About half a dozen law school students volunteer with the program each year. Over nine years, about a dozen worked on the Camden case, studying case files, reviewing trial documents and giving feedback on oral arguments.
They include Renee Mariotti, a part-time law student from New York City who chose Seton Hall Law in part for the chance to work at the Exoneration Project. Her interest came after listening to podcasts about wrongful convictions, in particular the Baltimore murder case of Adnan Syed made famous in the podcast "Serial."
"These are men who have been imprisoned for, coming up on 25 years, crimes they did not commit," Mariotti said of Baker and Washington. "It's nice to see the law working in what feels like the right way in this case. That's not always the outcome."
Amy Cuzzolino, a Bloomfield native who graduated in 2016, helped review applications to find viable legal cases. Her work gave her more insight into how the justice system works — and fails, she said.
"I didn't come away with a sense that the system is bad because of bad actors in it. It's more a question of inefficiency and limited resources. There are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but don't know how," said Cuzzolino, who is studying for an advanced degree in international law.
The Risingers, who live in Kearny, don't take a salary for their work. Private donations to the program pay for expenses like buying transcripts and consulting experts.
Michael Risinger, who worked on civil rights cases involving wrongful police shootings in the '70s and '80s, said he has devoted his career to making sure the legal system is accurate, especially in criminal cases. The former Seton Hall law professor served on the New Jersey Supreme Court's Committee on Evidence for 25 years.
He and his wife, who married in 2004 and have six children from previous marriages, see their work with the Exoneration Project as a calling, he said.
"We have sufficient money. We live very frugally, and we don't have ambitions to take grand tours or anything," he said. "We'd rather do this."

Texto completo: Kyle Johnson can't enter his high-rise apartment tower outside Shanghai without being greeted by men in white biosafety suits who take his temperature each time to check for signs of the coronavirus.
Although he's hundreds of miles from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak of the deadly flu-like illness began, the international school where the Kentucky native teaches history is closed, along with many local shops and restaurants. Taxi drivers who ferry him for groceries wear face masks. The area has a 9 p.m. curfew.
"It feels a little like a ghost town," said Johnson, who grew up in Woodford County and lived for a time in Louisville before taking a teaching job in China about six months ago.
Johnson, 30, is among a wide range of Kentucky-connected teachers, students, business people and others affected by the travel restrictions and global response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak, which had infected more than 31,400 people.
The death toll was at nearly 640 Friday, with almost all of those in China.
Just 12 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. and other nations have moved to temporarily block the entry of noncitizens from China, and hundreds of Americans who were evacuated from China are being quarantined for two weeks.
In China, officials have restricted people's movement and closed some public transit in hopes of containing the virus.
All that has left Johnson holed up in his apartment in China, where authorities have extended the Lunar New Year holiday break, which was due to end this week, well into February to reduce the virus's spread. That decision has left Johnson's school closed for the rest of the month.
He has decided to stay put and is unlikely to return home anytime soon. Multiple airlines have halted or curtailed China flights.
"I saw that U.S. citizens coming to America from China had to spend two weeks in quarantine anyway, so I'd be doing the same thing, hanging out and watching movies," he said.
One woman and her 8-year-old daughter with Kentucky ties living in Wuhan were among those evacuated by a U.S. chartered flight last week, WLEX-TV reported. The woman filmed her trip to the airport, which showed eerily empty streets.
In Kentucky, the virus has upended travel plans for employees of businesses such as Papa John's International and led universities to cancel travel to China study programs. They have urged students to adhere to U.S. State Department warnings against traveling to China.
The University of Kentucky, which had one staffer stuck in the quarantine zone in China while visiting for a funeral, hosts more than 500 Chinese students on campus. Many are worried about family, rescheduling trips and unsure when they can return, officials said.
"They're all in contact with families" on social media, said Huajing Maske, executive director of UK's Confucius Institute and director of the Office of China Initiatives.
Zhizhi Wang, 25, a graduate finance student, said his family is hunkered down in Yueyang, about a 30-minute train ride from Wuhan. From Lexington, he's been in touch daily on WeChat.
"When the Wuhan government issued a city lockdown, 10,000 people fled the city and camped in my hometown. That's when we freaked out," he said. "I told my family, just don't go out. You never know who you're going to bump into."
Cases have grown in the last week. "It's pretty scary," he said.
Some residents are afraid to visit those in hospitals and New Year's celebrations are taking place on social media video, not in person.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Wuhan officials had been ordered to round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.
In Kentucky, Wang has seen reported instances on Chinese American community social media chats of schoolkids being subject to phrases such as "Chinese virus, stay away!" he said, with many feeling that referring to it a "Chinese virus" was discriminatory.
Chang Zheng Wang, of Lexington, past president of the Kentucky Chinese American Association, said his relatives "are still safe, they're just stuck in the house every day. All the trains, buses, public transport is stopped, people can't go anywhere. One of my nieces works in a hospital, and they're seeing a lot of (coronavirus) patients."
Central China's Hubei province has added thousands of beds by building two new hospitals and creating quarantine centers.
The province has been in virtual lockdown, and international news has shown quiet, empty streets and residents staying distracted with television and food delivery.
CNN reported that social media videos show people coming up with all kinds of activities to kill time, including playing pingpong on dinner tables.
Far to the east, Johnson, who teaches at Kang Chiao International School, where students prepare to study at colleges in the U.S., has been largely stuck inside the apartment building he shares with other foreign teachers. Many had left for the break and have delayed their return.
Government workers came to his door to ask about his travel history, he said. And while public transportation has been shut down in some areas, buses still run where he lives.
Across China and beyond, fears of infection have spread with the virus. In Hong Kong, hit hard in 2002 by SARS, a highly contagious respiratory illness, thousands of hospital workers went on strike earlier to demand complete closure of the border. Other countries are continuing evacuations and restricting the entry of Chinese or people who have recently traveled in the country.
The new virus's mortality rate is about 2%, lower than SARS, which has a mortality rate of about 10%.
Sylvie Birand, director of global infections hazard preparedness at the World Health Organization, has told USA TODAY it was "very early" in the outbreak. She declined to describe the situation as a pandemic, saying the outbreak remained mostly contained in China.
Johnson said one friend refers to it as a "panic-demic."
He said people should remember that news reports often focus on the hardest-hit areas and response efforts, which have fueled concern from some friends and family in Kentucky. He said he doesn't believe he'll come in contact with the virus.
"People are calling. ... 'Oh my God, three hundred people died," he said. While reading about it from afar may make it seem like "something out of a zombie movie," he said, at least in his area, "it's not as scary being here as it looks."

Texto completo: Were the Steven Cohen-Sterling Partners talks actually in danger?
Since Tuesday, everyone has pondered it. An answer arrived two days later.
The deal to purchase the New York Mets is dead, though the Wilpons are still looking to sell.
"The transaction between Sterling and Steve Cohen was a highly complicated one," Sterling Partners, which is owned by Fred Wilpon, said in a statement on Thursday night. "Despite the efforts of the parties over the past several months, it became apparent that the transaction as contemplated would have been too difficult to execute.
"Sterling intends now to pursue a new transaction and has engaged Allen & Company to manage that process."
Via a statement to the New York Times, Cohen said: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
In December, the Sterling Partners announced it was negotiating to sell a majority share of the Mets to Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire. Under the agreement, Fred and Jeff Wilpon would retain their titles for five years.
Earlier on Thursday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dealt a bit of a reality blow to those hoping the Wilpons would be able to sell the Mets to Cohen. Manfred, while speaking at the owners meetings in Florida, said it was this transaction would not occur.
"I want to thank the fans for their support and the respect they showed me," Cohen said, "and I want to thank Commissioner Manfred and MLB for their support through the process.
"I gave it my best shot."
On Tuesday, a Barstool Sports podcast reported that negotiations were not going well. Hours later, the Mets released this statement: "The parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, including a mutual non-disclosure agreement, and therefore cannot comment."
Sometimes, silence or a no comment is seen is a negative. We didn't know in this case, mostly because non-disclosure agreements are common in business. The speculation began.
Were the Wilpons at fault again? What happened to the deal? Was this news leak a negotiation ploy used to gain leverage?
Per the New York Post on Wednesday, "the Wilpons recently made it clear to Cohen that while he would be paying hundreds of millions of dollars every year, they would in fact retain control over all decision-making regarding the franchise until the end of five years."
This Cohen snag is the latest in a line of weird situations involving the Wilpons.
In 2011, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn accused the Wilpons of changing the terms to his deal to buy a minority stake in the Mets.
Nine years before, the Wilpons became owners when Fred bought out Nelson Doubleday. But Doubleday levied accusations of misconduct over what the team was valued.
Manfred on Thursday said that any accusation that the Wilpons acted in bad faith was "completely and utterly unfair."
As the statement at the top of this story outlines, the Wilpons still intend to search for a new transaction. The timeline is unknown.
The Mets for years have been branded as the big-market team that rarely spends like it. Fans hoped Cohen — who would've been the richest owner in baseball — could immediately alter that perception.
It will have to be someone else, unless the two sides reconvene in the future.
This saga caps a wild offseason for the Mets, who ...
Fired a manager, hired a manager, parted with the first manager, hired a new manager. Oh, and that doesn't count the personnel moves and restructuring Yoenis Céspedes' contract.
Pitchers and catchers report to Port St. Lucie, Florida, for spring training next week. Finally, baseball will be the center of conversation — or at least you'd hope. But the Mets remained active, for better or worse, over the last four months.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

1970 hit 'Love Story' is back in theaters. Go see it

Texto completo: Loving "Love Story" means never having to say you're sorry you love "Love Story."
No apologies. No denials. No remarks like, "I know it's corny, but..."
Go on, weep. Let it out.
Bawl into your popcorn as lovely Ali McGraw, the spirited Radcliffe music major, says her deathbed farewell to Ryan O'Neal, the handsome Harvard preppie. "Love means never having to say you're sorry," she tells him — in the movie, on the poster, and in that mystic land where pop culture clichés live forever.
What can you say about an iconic movie that is coming back to theaters for Valentine's Day week?
That it grossed $106 million? That it was a surprise mega-hit in 1970? That it divided the nation between those who wept and those who snickered?
That you can see it at 1 p.m. Feb. 9 and 7 p.m. Feb. 12 at AMC Theaters across the country?
In a way, "Love Story" was an early broadside in the culture wars. It pit the critical elites, who mocked it in print and on TV, against Mr. and Mrs. Average American, who thought it was just swell. "You ain't human if you don't cry at that movie," said a character, defensively, in a TV sitcom of the era.
"I think both of those arguments — those who were moved to tears, and those who thought it was sappy and sentimental — have a point," said TCM host Ben Mankiewicz, who will be introducing the screenings, sponsored by Fathom Events, Turner Classic Movies and Paramount Pictures.
Among the things critics cackled over in 1970: the malady (never named) that doomed Jenny Cavalieri dies from. What kind of illness makes you even prettier on your deathbed? "Old Movie Disease" was the diagnosis of Mad Magazine.
"I suspect cancer makes people uncomfortable," Mankiewicz said. "That certainly would not be the case if they remade it today."
As for the heroine who becomes more beautiful as she dies — well, in operas, the heroine sings as she dies. "I think if the doctors accept it, and Ryan O'Neal accepts it, we accept it," Mankiewicz said. "We just buy what the characters in the movie accept. That's one of the beautiful things about movies."
As "Love Story" turned into the No. 1 grosser of 1970, and the book became the top-selling work of fiction the same year — the first time a novelization made it to the New York Times bestseller lists — it propelled writer Erich Segal, a Harvard classics professor and sometime movie writer ("Yellow Submarine") to fame as the culture warrior of the squares.
A key moment of the era was a January 1971 Dick Cavett Show, when Segal shared the stage with snide highbrow critic John Simon and rocker Little Richard.
"I have read and reread ["Love Story"] many times," Segal told Cavett modestly. "I am always moved."
Simon called Segal a "knave." Segal called Simon an "effete litterateur."
It was a momentous clash — so much so that later, commentators offered different versions, "Rashomon"-style.
To sci-fi writer Harlan Ellison (he had a TV column at the time), it was nothing less than a pivotal moment in Western civilization. Simon, the heroic critic, was the only thing standing between us and the Visigoths.
"Debasing emotions like love and recognition of one's own mortality," Ellison said, is "the cheap trick of panhandlers, flack merchants, con men."
"I am not bought that cheaply," said Ellison, grandly. "And neither are my tears."
Meanwhile, rock critic Greil Marcus saw both Simon and Segal as frauds. "Little Richard was the only artist on the stage that night," he wrote in his book "Mystery Train."
In the end, civilization survived. So did "Love Story." The famous theme music by Francis Lai became a favorite piece of elevator music, in versions by Ferrante & Teicher, Mantovani, and Andy Williams. There was a sequel, "Oliver's Story."
"This is a story of capitalism, as much as it is a love story," Mankiewicz said. "The people who made it were looking to make money."
Harvard freshmen, it is said, are still shown "Love Story" as part of orientation week. They cackle, hoot, and send it up, a la "Rocky Horror Picture Show."
They have every right. Harvard is not only the setting of the film but also the inspiration for the characters. Oliver is said to be a mashup of Harvard graduates Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones; Jones made his film debut in the movie.
"Segal went to Harvard and he knew those guys," Mankiewicz said. "It makes sense that he would craft the character of Oliver out of the Harvard students that he knew."
For the rest of us, "Love Story" is a movie that can still move, Mankiewicz said. In a battle between the head and heart, most moviegoers will go for the tear ducts.
"If what you really want is to immerse yourself in a cinematic experience, I think being moved is going to win," he said.

Texto completo: Were the Steven Cohen-Sterling Partners talks actually in danger?
Since Tuesday, everyone has pondered it. An answer arrived two days later.
The deal to purchase the New York Mets is dead, though the Wilpons are still looking to sell.
"The transaction between Sterling and Steve Cohen was a highly complicated one," Sterling Partners, which is owned by Fred Wilpon, said in a statement on Thursday night. "Despite the efforts of the parties over the past several months, it became apparent that the transaction as contemplated would have been too difficult to execute.
"Sterling intends now to pursue a new transaction and has engaged Allen & Company to manage that process."
Via a statement to the New York Times, Cohen said: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
In December, the Sterling Partners announced it was negotiating to sell a majority share of the Mets to Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire. Under the agreement, Fred and Jeff Wilpon would retain their titles for five years.
Earlier on Thursday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dealt a bit of a reality blow to those hoping the Wilpons would be able to sell the Mets to Cohen. Manfred, while speaking at the owners meetings in Florida, said it was this transaction would not occur.
"I want to thank the fans for their support and the respect they showed me," Cohen said, "and I want to thank Commissioner Manfred and MLB for their support through the process.
"I gave it my best shot."
On Tuesday, a Barstool Sports podcast reported that negotiations were not going well. Hours later, the Mets released this statement: "The parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, including a mutual non-disclosure agreement, and therefore cannot comment."
Sometimes, silence or a no comment is seen is a negative. We didn't know in this case, mostly because non-disclosure agreements are common in business. The speculation began.
Were the Wilpons at fault again? What happened to the deal? Was this news leak a negotiation ploy used to gain leverage?
Per the New York Post on Wednesday, "the Wilpons recently made it clear to Cohen that while he would be paying hundreds of millions of dollars every year, they would in fact retain control over all decision-making regarding the franchise until the end of five years."
This Cohen snag is the latest in a line of weird situations involving the Wilpons.
In 2011, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn accused the Wilpons of changing the terms to his deal to buy a minority stake in the Mets.
Nine years before, the Wilpons became owners when Fred bought out Nelson Doubleday. But Doubleday levied accusations of misconduct over what the team was valued.
Manfred on Thursday said that any accusation that the Wilpons acted in bad faith was "completely and utterly unfair."
As the statement at the top of this story outlines, the Wilpons still intend to search for a new transaction. The timeline is unknown.
The Mets for years have been branded as the big-market team that rarely spends like it. Fans hoped Cohen — who would've been the richest owner in baseball — could immediately alter that perception.
It will have to be someone else, unless the two sides reconvene in the future.
This saga caps a wild offseason for the Mets, who ...
Fired a manager, hired a manager, parted with the first manager, hired a new manager. Oh, and that doesn't count the personnel moves and restructuring Yoenis Céspedes' contract.
Pitchers and catchers report to Port St. Lucie, Florida, for spring training next week. Finally, baseball will be the center of conversation — or at least you'd hope. But the Mets remained active, for better or worse, over the last four months.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

New York Mets Chief Operating Officer Jeff Wilpon and Chief Executive Officer Fred Wilpon listen in as Luis Rojas is introduced as the team's new manager at Citi Field. Rojas had been the Mets quality control coach and was tapped as a replacement after Carlos Beltran was implicated for his role in the Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal.

State needs to enact a medical marijuana law

Texto completo: The Wisconsin Legislature needs to come together and show compassion for suffering patients by enacting a medical cannabis law this year.
Patients and their doctors should be trusted to decide if medical cannabis is an appropriate treatment, just as they do for far more dangerous drugs, such as opiates.
Never has there been more of a true public understanding that marijuana reform is clearly needed in our state.

Reader thanks League of Women Voters for hosting mayoral form Thanks League of Women Voters for hosting the mayoral forum. It's good to see several qualified and motivated candidates and several others who, in my view, are not.
Chad Doran and Jake Woodward know the importance of transparency (openess), particularly regarding the total cost of the bluff site for the U.S. Venture project and additional cost coming with a school referendum.

Sen. Johnson is not representing his constituents Included in the U.S. Senate daily prayer Friday were the words you will "Reap what you sow." Our Wisconsin Senator, Ron Johnson (R-Oshkosh) let a large percentage of us down.
A Quinnipiac poll showed that 75% of people wanted a Yes vote for witnesses in the impeachment trial. Johnson voted No. He is not representing 75% of us, his constituents.
We have been cheated out of a fair trial and knowing the full truth in the Senate. Out of 15 impeachment trials there has never been a trial without witnesses. Johnson chose to follow his party and not represent his entire state.
He was also involved in the Ukraine controversy. Johnson was "troubled" by Trump's actions, but believed Trump's denial. Johnson was a fact witness and should not have served on the jury and had a vote at all. Stating "I represent the people that elected me," he refused to recuse himself. He clearly meant he represents only his party.
If we listen to the wise words of the Senate chaplain, Johnson will reap what he has sown and 75% of Wisconsin voters will vote him out of office.

LBGT still face hurdles in workplace Workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity had some discussion in the political realm last year. In the cases the Supreme Court discussed last October, the New York Times said one case was about two gay men who were fired because of their sexual orientation and the other about a transgender womanwho was fired for presenting as female at her workplace.
During the Supreme Court discussion of these two cases the justices discussed religious freedom in relation to LGBT customers and bathrooms. Although it makes sense for justices to compare the religious freedom cases because they were similar cases effecting the LGBT community, it did not make as much sense to spend so much of their discussion time talking about bathroom bills. Bathroom bills are an important issue for transgender folk but the issue did not have much to do with workplace discrimination.
The Supreme Court has yet to make an official decision about workplace protections. Not all LGBT workplace protections issues are being discussed at the federal level.
Last year, Wisconisin Gov. Tony Evers first executive order was banning workplace discrimination against LGBT people. According to Urban Milwaukee Wisconsin was one of 28 states without explicit workplace protections for transgender individuals until the executive order was made. The moral of these cases might be that it's easier to bring change at a state level compared to a federal level, but that change for LGBT individuals still takes time.

Country needs to come together and support president I think it is time that we as a country come together and support our president.
You may say I don't approve of his tweeting, how he combs his hair, how he may be critical of some people or whatever. Those are so insignificant it shouldn't matter when you look at the big picture.
Let's look at his job performance.
He has stimulated our economy with his tax cuts to corporations and individuals to a level we haven't seen in years.
He is taking on the Chinese leveling out the playing field with redoing our trade deals.
He has redone the Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
He is trying to rid Washington of all the corruption that has gone on for years.
He has brought God back into our government.
He is attempting to deal with the serious immigration problems that are costing our country billions of dollars.
He has rebuilt our military that has been neglected for years.
He has appointed great people to our Supreme Court.
He truly is making America Great Again.

Headline should not have singled out Gallagher I thought it inappropriate that the Post-Crescent singled-out Mike Gallagher in the front-page headline (Feb. 4) about accepting a political donation from a company producing PFAS contamination.
Buried on page 3 was the news that others, including Democrats, had received donations from the company also. Wouldn't it have been less-biased if the headline would have said politicians instead of just Gallagher?

In 2011, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn accused the Wilpons of changing the terms to his deal to buy a minority stake in the Mets.
Nine years before, the Wilpons became owners when Fred bought out Nelson Doubleday. But Doubleday levied accusations of misconduct over what the team was valued.
Manfred on Thursday said that any accusation that the Wilpons acted in bad faith was "completely and utterly unfair."
As the statement at the top of this story outlines, the Wilpons still intend to search for a new transaction. The timeline is unknown.
The Mets for years have been branded as the big-market team that rarely spends like it. Fans hoped Cohen — who would've been the richest owner in baseball — could immediately alter that perception.
It will have to be someone else, unless the two sides reconvene in the future.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

Texto completo: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
Steven Cohen
Via a statement to the New York Times
Were the Steven Cohen-Sterling Partners talks actually in danger?
Since Tuesday, everyone has pondered it. An answer arrived two days later.
The deal to purchase the New York Mets is dead, though the Wilpons are still looking to sell.
"The transaction between Sterling and Steve Cohen was a highly complicated one," Sterling Partners, which is owned by Fred Wilpon, said in a statement on Thursday night. "Despite the efforts of the parties over the past several months, it became apparent that the transaction as contemplated would have been too difficult to execute.
"Sterling intends now to pursue a new transaction and has engaged Allen & Company to manage that process."
Via a statement to the New York Times, Cohen said: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
In December, the Sterling Partners announced it was negotiating to sell a majority share of the Mets to Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire. Under the agreement, Fred and Jeff Wilpon would retain their titles for five years.
Earlier on Thursday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dealt a bit of a reality blow to those hoping the Wilpons would be able to sell the Mets to Cohen. Manfred, while speaking at the owners meetings in Florida, said it was this transaction would not occur.
"I want to thank the fans for their support and the respect they showed me," Cohen said, "and I want to thank Commissioner Manfred and MLB for their support through the process.
"I gave it my best shot."
On Tuesday, a Barstool Sports podcast reported that negotiations were not going well. Hours later, the Mets released this statement: "The parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, including a mutual non-disclosure agreement, and therefore cannot comment."
Sometimes, silence or a no comment is seen is a negative. We didn't know in this case, mostly because non-disclosure agreements are common in business. The speculation began.
Were the Wilpons at fault again? What happened to the deal? Was this news leak a negotiation ploy used to gain leverage?
Per the New York Post on Wednesday, "the Wilpons recently made it clear to Cohen that while he would be paying hundreds of millions of dollars every year, they would in fact retain control over all decision-making regarding the franchise until the end of five years."
This Cohen snag is the latest in a line of weird situations involving the Wilpons.
In 2011, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn accused the Wilpons of changing the terms to his deal to buy a minority stake in the Mets.
Nine years before, the Wilpons became owners when Fred bought out Nelson Doubleday. But Doubleday levied accusations of misconduct over what the team was valued.
Manfred on Thursday said that any accusation that the Wilpons acted in bad faith was "completely and utterly unfair."
As the statement at the top of this story outlines, the Wilpons still intend to search for a new transaction. The timeline is unknown.
The Mets for years have been branded as the big-market team that rarely spends like it. Fans hoped Cohen — who would've been the richest owner in baseball — could immediately alter that perception.
It will have to be someone else, unless the two sides reconvene in the future.
This saga caps a wild offseason for the Mets, who ...
Fired a manager, hired a manager, parted with the first manager, hired a new manager. Oh, and that doesn't count the personnel moves and restructuring Yoenis Céspedes' contract.
Pitchers and catchers report to Port St. Lucie, Florida, for spring training next week. Finally, baseball will be the center of conversation — or at least you'd hope. But the Mets remained active, for better or worse, over the last four months.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

Texto completo: I have been teaching economics since 1967 - 40 years of it at George Mason University in Fairfax. During that interval, economic reality has not changed. Just as Galileo's law about the independent influence of gravity on falling objects has not changed, neither have the fundamental principles of economics.
Economics is fun and simple. It's made complicated by some economics professors - fortunately, not by my colleagues at George Mason. Let's apply some simple tools of economics to reveal outright myths, lies and tricks.
Who is punished by tariffs on imported goods? Let's go through the steps. The Canadian government imposes high tariffs on American dairy imports. That forces Canadians to pay higher prices for dairy products and protects Canada's dairy producers from American competition.
What should be the U.S. government's response to Canada's screwing its citizens? If you were in the Trump administration, you might retaliate by imposing stiff tariffs on softwood products built from pine, spruce and fir trees used by U.S. homebuilders. In other words, the United States should retaliate against Canada's harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes.
Many politicians, pundits and some economists would have us believe that corporations pay taxes, but do they? Economists distinguish between entities who ultimately bear the tax burden and those upon whom tax is initially levied. Just because a tax is levied on a corporation doesn't mean that the corporation bears its burden.
Faced with a tax, a corporation can shift the tax burden by raising its product prices, lowering dividends or laying off workers. The lesson here is that only people pay taxes, not legal fictions like corporations. Corporations are simply tax collectors for the government. Similarly, no one would fall for a politician telling a homeowner, "I'm not going to tax you; I'm going to tax your property." I guarantee that it will be a person, not the property, writing out the check to the taxing authority. Again, only people pay taxes.
Here's a question: Are natural or manmade disasters good for the economy? Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. In the wake of the earlier Kobe earthquake Japan actually gained some economic strength."
After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it's not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It's a perverse thing ... there's real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus."
Then there's Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman who wrote in his New York Times column "After the Horror," after the 9/11 attack, "Ghastly as it may seem to say this, the terror attack - like the original day of infamy, which brought an end to the Great Depression - could do some economic good." He went on to explain that rebuilding the destruction would stimulate the economy through business investment and job creation.
One would never hear my colleagues in George Mason University's economics department spouting such insanities. Just ask yourself whether the Japanese economy would have faced even greater opportunities for economic growth had the earthquake also struck Tokyo, Hiroshima, Yokohama and other major cities? Would the 9/11 terrorists have made a greater contribution to our economy had they also destroyed lives and buildings in Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Atlanta? The

The world of mezcal evolves and grows

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: After skipping Iowa, New Hampshire and other early contests, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign is betting big on Connecticut and states with later primaries to propel him to the Democratic nomination.
But Bloomberg's supporters have to contend with the moderate-left candidate's "stop-and-frisk" legacy of policing, which disproportionately affected African American and Latino men during his time as mayor.
"Stop-and-frisk" refers to the controversial police tactic of temporarily detaining, questioning and possibly searching civilians, which peaked in 2011 under Bloomberg's leadership with 685,724 recorded New York Police Department stops, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union.
At a Thursday event at Thomas Hooker Brewery at Colt in Hartford, Connecticut campaign co-chair Kerry Wood, a Democratic state representative from Newington, said Bloomberg's apology last November showed character.
"I think as politicians, sometimes when you're called out on things, you want to be defensive and hammer home that that's the right way," Wood said. "But I think it's really admirable for him to say, 'You know what? Thank you for educating me. I'm going to do things differently going forward.' "
State Rep. Chris Rosario, D-Bridgeport, said Bloomberg's work with Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a nonprofit advocacy group, shows his commitment to public safety.
"We have a lot of Democrats supporting a candidate right now who's not even a Democrat in Bernie Sanders," said Rosario, who is also a campaign co-chair.
"On stop-and-frisk, [Bloomberg] has come out and apologized about it and he's put his money where his mouth is. He's done a lot of work with the reentry community. He's put in a lot of work again with Mayors Against Illegal Guns every time for gun safety. I have a feeling that he's going to do right by those communities that were impacted by stop-and-frisk."
The Hartford event arrived just a week after Bloomberg announced his Connecticut campaign staff, which is led by state director Brett Broesder, a former political consultant for Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, and state Treasurer Shawn Wooden.
Nationally, Bloomberg is surging; current polls show him below former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to RealClear Politics' average of leading polls, but he leads former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
Another recent national poll had Bloomberg edging ahead of Warren.
State Sen. Doug McCrory said he attended the event to "listen and learn." McCrory is concerned about Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk past but won't necessarily vote against him because of it.
"I'm not letting him off the hook, because that's his responsibility, but that's an issue," McCrory said. "That's going to be an issue for voters like myself who care about that concern. But it shouldn't be because of that he's out. I don't care about apologies. What are you going to do as we move forward? That's my interest here."
Bloomberg supporters cited his anti-gun policies, positions on gun violence, infrastructure and the environment, financial independence and ability to counter-punch as unique strengths.
"I just really have no hope anymore for anything, because it doesn't seem like anything matters," said Andrew Miano of Rocky Hill. "Trump does something, and everyone says, 'This is the end, this is appalling.' And then something else happens and everyone forgets about it. I don't think any of the other presidential candidates really have what it takes to counter that. This is kind of my last hope for a candidate where I think we actually have a chance countering Trump's chaotic energy."
In a state with tremendous income inequality, Miano admits Bloomberg's billionaire status "isn't a good look," but he's not completely turned off either.
"It's either the money comes from you or it comes from other people, and I'd rather have someone spend their own money than take money from corporations or wealthy people who they feel beholden to. So while it doesn't look good to have a billionaire at the top of our ticket, maybe that's better than having a corporation at the top of the ticket."
Many supporters said they'd back the eventual Democratic nominee if Bloomberg doesn't succeed. Wood cited Bloomberg's pledge to use his campaign infrastructure to help the party retake the White House no matter what as another reason to vote for him.
"I think that he believes in the Democrats that are out there now enough to say if he's not the nominee, he's going to help whoever that is," Wood said.
Andy Lopez of West Hartford brought Charlize, his French Bulldog. Like Miano, Lopez likes Bloomberg's toughness.
"I do have some reservations about some of his policies as they relate to minorities, being a minority myself, like stop-and-frisk and policing," Lopez said. "I used to spend a lot of time in [New York]. Thankfully, I never found myself in a situation like that. But, you know, crime comes from all ethnicities. I know that in the past week or two, he's kind of taken a step back from that and didn't necessarily apologize, but kind of walked back some of his policies. It would be interesting to see his platform now. Really, I wanted to learn more about what his platform is and that's why I came out."

Texto completo: The Steven Cohen-Sterling Partners deal to purchase the New York Mets is dead, though the Wilpons are still looking to sell.
"The transaction between Sterling and Steve Cohen was a highly complicated one," Sterling Partners, which is owned by Fred Wilpon, said in a statement on Thursday night. "Despite the efforts of the parties over the past several months, it became apparent that the transaction as contemplated would have been too difficult to execute.
"Sterling intends now to pursue a new transaction and has engaged Allen & Company to manage that process."
Via a statement to the New York Times, Cohen said: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
In December, the Sterling Partners announced it was negotiating to sell a majority share of the Mets to Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire. Under the agreement, Fred and Jeff Wilpon would retain their titles for five years.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

Tips for married couples on Valentine's Day

Texto completo: Valentine's Day is coming! Prepare yourself for an onslaught of Instagram posts featuring bright flowers, sparkling jewelry, and oversized teddy bears. Your feed is about to get #blessed. If you get to know me for more than 10 seconds, you know that's not what I'm about. Heck, my husband isn't even on social media. And I'm okay with that.
One study wanted to find out if couples who post excessively about each other are actually happier in their relationships. Spoiler alert: They're not. The study found "over-the-top displays are being used to compensate for weaker relationships."
This doesn't mean you don't love your husband if you talk about how wonderful he is on social media. Hopefully, you and your spouse affirm each other daily and in person.
But when I think about the healthiest couples I know, they're not the ones posting about each other 24/7. They're also not worried about what other people think, so they're not buying more stuff to impress people (just so they can post about it). They're secure in their lives, but not because of an expensive lifestyle that they can flaunt. Instead, the couples I look up to have one thing in common — they're all intentional in their marriages.
A strong marriage doesn't happen by chance. If you want to be intentional and make your spouse feel really secure, work together on these three areas:
1. Set goals together A 2017 study by Ramsey Solutions revealed that 94 percent of couples who describe their marriages as "great" also say they discuss money goals together. Getting on the same page financially with your spouse is one of the best things you can do for your marriage. If you need some help reconnecting and realigning the goals of your relationship, check out this episode of The Rachel Cruze Show (rachelcruze.com/show/money-mistakes-that-can-ruin-your-relationships). You'll learn about money mistakes that can ruin your relationship, and practical ways to communicate and work better together.
2. Be willing to have tough conversations My friend, Dr. Les Parrott, says conflict is the price we pay for a deeper level of intimacy. You can disagree, and still make space to hear each other. Hashing it out, putting in the work, and coming from a place of understanding will only make you stronger. And by the way, I'm a huge fan of counseling for every marriage, not just the ones in crisis mode.
3. Don't compare your marriage to someone else's Comparison will steal your joy and frustrate your spouse. Too many people let Instagram-level expectations form their values and family priorities. I've been there, too, and I know it's an empty and endless battle trying to keep up. Spend that time and energy focusing on all the things you truly love about your spouse, and the life you've already built together.
Flowers will die, and jewelry will tarnish. But a relationship built on these three principles will make your marriage a blessing, not just #blessed.

Most Valentine's Day gifts don't last, but couples who are intentional about their marriages can have healthy relationships that last a lifetime.

Texto completo: Were the Steven Cohen-Sterling Partners talks actually in danger?
Since Tuesday, everyone has pondered it. An answer arrived two days later.
The deal to purchase the New York Mets is dead, though the Wilpons are still looking to sell.
"The transaction between Sterling and Steve Cohen was a highly complicated one," Sterling Partners, which is owned by Fred Wilpon, said in a statement on Thursday night. "Despite the efforts of the parties over the past several months, it became apparent that the transaction as contemplated would have been too difficult to execute.
"Sterling intends now to pursue a new transaction and has engaged Allen & Company to manage that process."
Via a statement to the New York Times, Cohen said: "I'm very disappointed we couldn't work out a deal, but as an 8 percent holder (in the Mets), I'm looking forward to a higher bid for the team."
In December, the Sterling Partners announced it was negotiating to sell a majority share of the Mets to Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire. Under the agreement, Fred and Jeff Wilpon would retain their titles for five years.
Earlier on Thursday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dealt a bit of a reality blow to those hoping the Wilpons would be able to sell the Mets to Cohen. Manfred, while speaking at the owners meetings in Florida, said it was this transaction would not occur.
"I want to thank the fans for their support and the respect they showed me," Cohen said, "and I want to thank Commissioner Manfred and MLB for their support through the process.
"I gave it my best shot."
On Tuesday, a Barstool Sports podcast reported that negotiations were not going well. Hours later, the Mets released this statement: "The parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, including a mutual non-disclosure agreement, and therefore cannot comment."
Sometimes, silence or a no comment is seen is a negative. We didn't know in this case, mostly because non-disclosure agreements are common in business. The speculation began.
Were the Wilpons at fault again? What happened to the deal? Was this news leak a negotiation ploy used to gain leverage?
Per the New York Post on Wednesday, "the Wilpons recently made it clear to Cohen that while he would be paying hundreds of millions of dollars every year, they would in fact retain control over all decision-making regarding the franchise until the end of five years."
This Cohen snag is the latest in a line of weird situations involving the Wilpons.
In 2011, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn accused the Wilpons of changing the terms to his deal to buy a minority stake in the Mets.
Nine years before, the Wilpons became owners when Fred bought out Nelson Doubleday. But Doubleday levied accusations of misconduct over what the team was valued.
Manfred on Thursday said that any accusation that the Wilpons acted in bad faith was "completely and utterly unfair."
As the statement at the top of this story outlines, the Wilpons still intend to search for a new transaction. The timeline is unknown.
The Mets for years have been branded as the big-market team that rarely spends like it. Fans hoped Cohen — who would've been the richest owner in baseball — could immediately alter that perception.
It will have to be someone else, unless the two sides reconvene in the future.
This saga caps a wild offseason for the Mets, who ...
Fired a manager, hired a manager, parted with the first manager, hired a new manager. Oh, and that doesn't count the personnel moves and restructuring Yoenis Céspedes' contract.
Pitchers and catchers report to Port St. Lucie, Florida, for spring training next week. Finally, baseball will be the center of conversation — or at least you'd hope. But the Mets remained active, for better or worse, over the last four months.
On Tuesday, news broke that talks were not going well. But the fact that was leaked, some speculated, was a negotiation ploy.
It was not. There will be no deal between the Mets and Cohen.

Texto completo: The most enjoyable part of the Treasures of the Sea of Cortez cruise – the inaugural sailing from Puerto Peñasco, Mexico, departed in January – is the itinerary.
The 11-night, seven-port cruise was on Cruise and Maritime Voyages' storied MV Astoria ship. It showed passengers a variety of seaside communities, from small towns like Santa Rosalia, which welcomed its first cruise ship in 10 years, to the bustling tourist town of Cabo San Lucas, known for its celebrity spottings as well as being a staple of cruise-to-Mexico itineraries.
Here are highlights of each port I visited. I was on the ship for six nights, joining in Cabo San Lucas just in time for the ship to set sail and disembarking in Puerto Peñasco, also known as Rocky Point, at the end of the itinerary.
La Paz We docked in La Paz, about 98 miles north of Cabo San Lucas. It's gaining popularity as a low-key alternative to Cabo. An appealing alternative to nature lovers, La Paz was recently named to New York Times Travel's 52 Places to travel in 2020 thanks to its "reimagined waterfront and sustainable sensibility."
You'll see what they mean with a simple stroll along the renovated Malecón, the walkway that winds along the water's edge. It has sculptures and plenty of seaside playgrounds for kids. Would you rather bike than walk? The city offers free eBikes to borrow. You'll just need to download the app to your phone to unlock one.
Astoria passengers had the choice of taking a shuttle from the dock to either the heart of La Paz or to the beach. You won't find chain hotels or mega shopping. Nature lovers come here to enjoy the famous Balandra Beach as well as spot sea lions and other wildlife.
Loreto We rode a tender from the Astoria to Loreto, where Jesuit missionaries settled in 1697. If you want to lounge on the beach, there's one right as you walk off the boat. From the dock you can easily walk into the heart of the city.
Jesuit missionaries built Nuestra Señora de Loreto, which has transferred among the Jesuit, Franciscan and Dominican orders. A museum next to the mission provides a look at the history of missionaries in Baja California. From there, you can stroll down the cobblestone streets, enjoying the restaurants and shops.
You also can take an excursion up a mountain to nearby San Javier, where Franciscan missionaries built Mision San Francisco Javier de Vigge-Biaundo. Outside are Valencia orange trees and olive trees brought from Spain by the missionaries.
Fair warning: To get to this mission, you'll drive a winding road through the mountains. It's a beautiful drive, but probably not for those who easily get car sick.
Santa Rosalia We also tendered from the ship to Santa Rosalia. I think this was my favorite port. The town of 15,000 people held a meeting to plan for the arrival of the first cruise ship in 10 years. Their preparation showed. They had information booths placed around town and held a farmers market to share the work of local artisans with passengers.
The French-influenced town is easy to walk around and the center city is a short walk from the dock where the tenders arrive. Iglesia de Santa Bárbara reportedly was designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel, the designer and namesake of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It's created from stamped steel squares. (In the 1990s, a scholar challenged whether the church was indeed a product of Eiffel. Neither side could produce definitive proof.)
Panaderia el Boleo has been baking bread and pastries in its wood-fired stove since 1901. Enjoy a sweet treat from here as you walk around town.
Walk up the hill for a view of the city and the Sea of Cortez. There you will find the historic Hotel Frances as well as the Museo el Boleo, which once served as the bookkeeping offices for the El Boleo mining operation.
The Astoria offered a whale-watching tour from this port. You'll take a bus for a couple hours to the point where you'll board a boat to head out and see these spectacular mammals in the wild.
Guaymas In Guaymas, we docked and then boarded a shuttle that dropped us off about a block from the town square. Dancers and musicians performed for people strolling through the market in Plaza de Armas 13 de Julio in front of San Fernando Church.
Casa de los 3 Frentes is a coffee shop and museum about a block from the plaza. Along with good coffee and cakes, it has exhibits that pay tribute to the three Mexican presidents who have come from Guaymas.
You can also take a wildlife cruise along the shore. A bus will take you to nearby San Carlos, where you can spot some of the beautiful homes overlooking the Sea of Cortez before learning more about the geology of the region, which sits along a fault line. Your tour guide will point out the birds and fauna as well as take you to spot dolphins.

Texto completo: Why Snowboarders Are Inferior
"Get [snowboarders] on the flats and they look like little old ladies with incontinence issues."
-- Jack Clayton, mpora.com, 2015
"Snowboarders still have a stigma . . . [that they] need to get real jobs and stop partaking in illegal substances."
-- Jessica Kopitz, skis.com, 2015
"Snowboarding simply doesn't have the rebel cachet that it once did . . . Simply put, it's cool to be on two planks again."
-- Christopher Solomon, The New York Times, 2013
"I bought a T-shirt in Breckenridge that says 'If skiing was easier, they'd call it snowboarding.' I get a lot of compliments on [it]."
-- Michael Ryan, outdoortechnology.com, 2015
Why Skiers Are the Worst
"A skier who spent $4,500 on the gear he strapped to the top of his Audi . . . sees a snowboarder who spent less than $1,000 rolling up in a '83 Civic hatchback having more fun."
-- Gregory Laudadio, "This Hill Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us," 2016
"It's hard not to feel smug when you're passing those poor skiers . . . as they stumble along in Darth Vader boots."

U.S. News: U.S. Ends Probe of Auto Makers, California

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department closed its antitrust investigation of four auto makers that had reached a tailpipe-emissions deal last summer with the state of California, finding no evidence of collusion among the companies.
After examining the matter for several months, the department concluded that the auto makers -- Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG -- didn't engage in conduct that violated U.S. antitrust law, according to people familiar with the matter.
Spokespeople for Ford and BMW confirmed that the Justice Department had dropped the probe, which was reported earlier by the New York Times. The other auto makers didn't respond to requests to comment.
At issue was a July agreement between the auto makers and the California Air Resources Board on fuel efficiency standards, a state-based framework that is at odds with the Trump administration's regulatory approach.
Justice Department officials questioned whether the companies had agreed among themselves on the outlines of the deal with California regulators, and the auto makers received civil subpoenas in the fall.
The department launched the investigation amid a heated conflict between the Republican Trump administration and California's Democratic leaders -- one that has played out over several fronts, including health care, immigration and transportation.
In a statement, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the investigation was "always a sham -- a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to prevent more auto makers from joining California and agreeing to stronger emissions standards."
The Justice Department's top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, appeared before the Senate in September and testified that politics played no role in the auto maker investigation, calling the investigation a fact-finding mission.
Environmental rules, especially climate policy, have been at the center of the conflict between California and the White House. Sacramento wants to sharply limit the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change, especially from cars and trucks.
The Trump administration has moved to rescind Obama-era rules that attempted to lower emissions, and to curb California's influence in the auto industry.
The four companies announced a deal in July to support standards set by the California Air Resources Board, betting it was the best way to ensure the dispute didn't lead to two sets of emissions standards in the U.S.
Justice officials believed at the time the deal could restrict competition by limiting the types of cars and trucks the auto companies offer to consumers, people familiar with the department's thinking say.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the investigation last year.

SANDERS: BUTTIGIEG, BLOOMBERG PART OF 'CORRUPT' PROBLEM

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, N.H. - Railing against a "corrupt political system" that he said has battered the American middle class for nearly half a century, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd here Friday that Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, two of his primary opponents, are part of the problem.
Mr. Sanders, blaming money in politics for contributing to the suffering of working families and the health of the planet, said that Mr. Bloomberg - the former mayor of New York City - is trying to "buy an election" by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign, while Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., is accepting billionaire donations at a time when "billionaires control not only our economy but our political [system]."
The question that voters in New Hampshire should ask the candidates before next week's first-in-the-nation primary, he said, is: "Which side are you on?"
"Are you willing to take on the greed and corruption of the billionaire class and the 1%?" Mr. Sanders asked, "or will you continue to stand with the big money interests?"
Speaking at the "Politics&Eggs" breakfast series at Saint Anselm College's New Hampshire Institute of Politics, Mr. Sanders said his campaign is best suited to stand up for working families because it has been funded by small donations.
It will take a government and president that "unapologetically represents working people, not billionaires," Mr. Sanders said, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, pass "Medicare for All," and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
His speech, in the hours before this evening's Democratic debate here, painted a picture of America as a country where many families live paycheck to paycheck and teachers make as little as $29,000 a year while pharmaceutical companies get subsidies and Amazon pays no federal income tax.
"How does it happen that - year after year after year - people on top do phenomenally well, and year after year after year, the working class and middle class of this country struggle and 40 million people live in poverty?" Mr. Sanders asked.
Mr. Buttigieg, whom Mr. Sanders called a "nice guy," narrowly beat the Vermont senator in delegates in Tuesday's Iowa caucuses. But Mr. Sanders said he was the winner because he got more votes.
Asked by an attendee how he'd defeat Donald Trump in a general election, Mr. Sanders said it will take the largest voter turnout in U.S. history, noting that although the turnout in Iowa was "not as high" as he would have liked, there was a 30% increase in voter participation among people under age 29.

Texto completo: According to author Patricia Schultz, there are 1,000 places you should see before you die.
A deluxe edition of her New York Times best-seller "1,000 Places to See Before You Die" is out now, and three of the locations are in Georgia.
Savannah, Schultz told CBS46, "is one big, walkable, open-air museum full of fantastic architecture, history, great food and lovely people."
Savannah was founded in 1733 along with Georgia's birth as the last of the original 13 Colonies.
Last year, Condé Nast ranked Savannah No. 3 among the best small cities in the U.S.
Not too far from Savannah is another Georgia place you need to see before you die -- the Golden Isles.
The region includes the city of Brunswick and the barrier islands of St. Simons Island, Sea Island, Little St. Simons Island and Jekyll Island.
St. Simons and Jekyll were also named two of the best islands in the South by Southern Living magazine.
The third Georgia destination Schultz says you must see before you die is the Appalachian Trail.
The Appalachian Trail is about 2,200 miles long, with 78 of those miles in Georgia. The trail can be a beautiful hike, but don't forget to check out the cities along the way including Blairsville, Dahlonega, Ellijay, Helen and Hiawassee.

Texto completo: The death toll from the coronavirus in mainland China spiked 23 percent Wednesday amid new counting methods adopted by Chinese health officials, who eased their criteria for confirmed cases.
Deaths rose by 252, to a total of 1,367 worldwide. All but two of those deaths have been recorded in China. Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases spiked to 60,286 - an increase of over 15,000 from the previous day.
The spikes are at least partly due to new counting standards implemented by China, which reported Wednesday that it is tallying infections differently. The nation previously only counted a coronavirus case as confirmed when a person tested positively for the virus.
As of Tuesday, the government is no longer requiring a positive test, a decision made partly because testing kits are in short supply. New cases are now being confirmed if a person is simply diagnosed by a doctor or other health professional; China says the new standard will help treat people more quickly once they exhibit symptoms of the virus.
The new numbers of deaths push the coronavirus past that of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, officials said. They also reported that a 60-year-old U. S. citizen became what appears to be the first American fatality from the global virus outbreak.
But the mortality rate - a statistic that measures the deadliness of the virus on infected persons - of SARS is still significantly higher than coronavirus. The latest figures show that coronavirus has a mortality rate of 2. 3 percent, compared to nearly 9. 6 percent for SARS.
SARS is widely considered to have killed 774 people and sickened 8,098, mainly in mainland China and Hong Kong. The response this time has been much quicker and countries around the world are enforcing stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus, which broke out in Wuhan, China, in December.
The American victim, who was not identified, died Wednesday after being diagnosed with the coronavirus in Wuhan, according to the U. S. Embassy.
Japan’s Foreign Ministry said a Japanese man in his 60s being treated in Wuhan also died. It said that the patient had been suspected of having the coronavirus but that it had not been confirmed.
Coronavirus, explained: Everything you need to know about the deadly virus
In the U. S. , another group of 201 American evacuees from Wuhan arrived at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California, to drop off 53 people for a two-week quarantine.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the U. S. had brought more than 800 Americans from Wuhan in recent days.
The plane that landed in California flew on to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, where about 90 people will be quarantined, and then to Omaha, Nebraska, where the remaining 57 passengers will be housed at a nearby Nebraska National Guard training base.
There were no signs of illness among those who flew into Lackland Air Force Base, said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of high consequence pathogens and pathology. There were no immediate reports on the conditions of the other passenger.
In other developments:
Two more passengers on a cruise ship quarantined in Japan were diagnosed with the virus in Japan for a total of 63 on board the ship.
Five people from Britain, including one child, are hospitalized in France with the virus after contracting it during a holiday in the Alps.
China's ruling Communist Party has faced a sharp public backlash after the death of a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded by police in January for warning fellow doctors about the initial outbreak.
Li Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, contracted the virus while treating patients, and his death was confirmed early Friday. Li was one of eight medical professionals in Wuhan who were arrested for trying to warn colleagues about the outbreak. They were forced to sign statements confessing to the spreading of "falsehoods.

Texto completo: Correction: Latinx visibility: In the Feb. 8 Calendar section, an article about Latinx visibility in the publishing industry misstated of the age of the title character in Kate Elizabeth Russell's forthcoming novel "My Dark Vanessa." Vanessa was 32 when she confronted a sexual relationship she had with a teacher 17 years earlier, when she was 15.
Long before Jeanine Cummins' highly contentious "American Dirt" was published by Flatiron Books, the novel was raising red flags internally, according to Myriam Gurba.
"I've spoken to people who work in Flatiron who have told me that the book was identified as problematic from the get-go," Gurba alleged, speaking before a packed room on Thursday at a panel organized by her new group, #DignidadLiteraria. "And people's critiques were either dismissed or they felt coerced into being silent. ... They knew that this could happen and they went through with it anyway."
Flatiron Books, which is a division of Macmillan Publishing, did not immediately respond to a Times request for comment.

Gurba, an author and high school teacher in Long Beach, wrote a negative review of the novel that was first published on the online site Tropics of Meta. Her critique became the catalyst for one of the biggest controversies in U.S. publishing in recent years.
The panel, held at Antioch University in Culver City, hosted a crowd of around 100 people. In a nod to the #OwnVoices movement, dozens of books by people of color were on display near the back. A diverse audience of activists, booksellers, professors, writers and other community members filled seats or stood along the perimeter, occasionally nodding, clapping and murmuring in agreement at remarks made by the panelists on the dais.
They were there to hear Gurba, Roxane Gay, Romeo Guzman, Wendy C. Ortiz and Christopher Soto talk about the publishing industry.
The event was part of #DignidadLiteraria's national week of action, a series of town halls to discuss Latinx visibility in the U.S. It was the first panel to be held since authors and #DignidadLiteraria founders Gurba, David Bowles and Roberto Lovato met with Macmillan publishers and others on Monday to discuss steps the imprint can take to amplify Latinx voices in the industry.
The hashtag and movement emerged in the wake of the "American Dirt" controversy and is composed of writers advocating for Latinx people in the publishing world.
During Monday's meeting in New York, Macmillan committed to increasing its number of Latinx staff, authors and titles and to changing the "overall ecosystem." It vowed to develop an action plan to address those goals within 90 days and to meet with the cohort in 30 days to evaluate progress.
Responding to Gurba's claim that Flatiron ignored red flags, Gay said she believes the publisher will continue to dismiss them because "American Dirt" is selling so well, having debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times Bestsellers list. "This woman is going to be set for life, this book is going to earn royalties in perpetuity, and so it just reinforces what publishing already knows, which is as long as white people are translating the experiences of people of color, it will sell very well," said Gay, the bestselling author of "Hunger" and "Bad Feminist."
Gay took time out of a busy speaking and writing schedule to appear in her capacity as the editor of Ortiz's article on the topic, " Adventures in Publishing Outside the Gates," in her online journal, Gay Mag.
The wide-ranging discussion coalesced around a couple of flashpoints. One of them was panelists' differences with white feminists.
Ortiz recounted the negative reactions she's received after publishing her essay, which called out the similarities between her 2014 memoir, "Excavation," and Kate Elizabeth Russell's forthcoming, highly anticipated and heavily promoted novel "My Dark Vanessa."
"Excavation" is about the five-year sexual relationship between the teenage Ortiz and her eighth-grade English teacher. "My Dark Vanessa," for which Russell received a seven-figure advance, tells a similar story: A 17-year-old girl confronts the sexual relationship she had with her English teacher when she was 15 after another student accuses him of sexual abuse.
Ortiz said some critical responses have taken the form of "racism ... cloaked in white feminism."
Gay said that it has been white women who've rallied to defend Russell against Ortiz, who has called the book "a fictional take on a reality I lived." (On the panel, Ortiz denied that she had ever alleged plagiarism.)
Gay said that accusations of professional envy and demands for apologies of the kind that dogged Ortiz are common. "We see this a lot in online discourse where people see something that triggers or upsets them, and they worry that it could happen to them someday. So they get behind whoever they perceive is the biggest victim, and it's always going to be the white woman."
Another topic addressed by the panel was the question of whether it was better to use small presses when the corporate gatekeepers failed to embrace them.
Gurba said #Dignidad Literaria had suggested at the Macmillan meeting that the publisher start a Latinx imprint. "We gave them basically a business model for it ... [but] they didn't even want to touch the paper. ... Mexican Americans are scary people!" she said, laughing.
Before the conversation was opened up to the audience, moderator Xochitl-Julisa Bermejo asked the panelists how people of color can hold big publishers accountable while also supporting small presses.
Gay advised people to keep raising their voices. "The only reason Macmillan responded is because the backlash was so significant and so concentrated and it has not gone away," she said. "That just shows that when we speak up as people of color, it actually does something when we do it in numbers."
She emphasized that supporting small publishing isn't always the sole answer because it "lets big publishing off the hook," and it doesn't change the fact that the so-called Big Five control the vast majority of the books we get to read. Gay encouraged consumers to educate themselves on what's happening in small presses and "make one of every three book purchases a small-press book, if not more."
In any event, she was skeptical of the common complaint that the publishing industry is declining and in need of support. "Big publishing is going to be OK."

Texto completo: I've never actually been to the Oscars but I've spent a good part of my television career awards-show-adjacent -- on red carpets, interviewing celebrities about their fashion choices. The first time I came to L.A. to cover the ramp-up to the Oscars, I was living in New York and working as a TV producer. My assignment was to deliver fashion preview pieces during the week leading up to the awards and to be on the red carpet the day of. It sounds glamorous, and there were perks, like the stunning black satin heels designer Stuart Weitzman once gave me to wear. But in reality, covering red carpet arrivals consisted of me screaming celebrities' names at the top of my lungs to get their attention. "George Clooney!!! Over here!!"
I had no plans to fall in love (not even with Clooney). But the editor I was working alongside that week, Hugh, was distractingly handsome. Tan and rugged, the word "cowboy" came to mind. He told me he lived in Silver Lake. I didn't know what that meant or where it was. But like so many people in Los Angeles, it turns out, he'd just moved from New York. He was great to work with, grounded amid the insanity of a night of television where everyone is losing their minds.
I was single at the time, focused on work. When one of my friends encouraged me to "get back out there" after my last relationship ended, I'd rolled my eyes and gently told him to back off. But the night of the Oscars, sitting behind Hugh in the edit room, it briefly crossed my mind: What if after the ceremony was over we walked to our cars at the same time? If he asked me to grab a drink, would I say yes? But he didn't.

I returned to New York, keeping the red-carpet shoes. A few weeks later, I received a friend request on Facebook from Hugh.
Facebook turned to emails turned to texts turned to long phone calls. And as I got to know him, I discovered he was the most soulful, kind and curious man I'd ever met. He told me he'd never move back to New York. He loved Los Angeles too much.
Too bad. I decided long ago I'd never relocate for a man.
I didn't want to repeat the pattern of my own parents.
Growing up, we moved a lot, and it was always because my dad got a new job. My mom never seemed to have any say. When I finally got out on my own, I moved to New York City, a place no one could ever make me leave.
Hugh asked me to dinner and then flew to New York for it. It was a bold move. What if our long-distance connection wasn't there in real life? What if this was all in my head? I wore my red-carpet shoes. He was standing outside the restaurant when I arrived. We said hi and then I kissed him. Because I needed to know. Could I kiss this man for the rest of my life?
Yes.
Three weeks later, I visited him in Los Angeles and he showed me his Los Angeles. A motorcycle ride to Mt. Baldy, jazz at a dark, hidden club in Glendale. Bowls of hearty pasta at a restaurant so charming and romantic with the misfortune of being directly across the street from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a glowing "Tower Urology" sign.
We dated long distance like that for eight months, alternating cities.
I came out to Los Angeles to work the awards season and the Oscars again, only now, we were a couple. The morning after the Academy Awards that year, we went for omelets at Home in Los Feliz, then spent the day at Disneyland.
I started to see Los Angeles through Hugh's eyes -- this vast expanse of possibility and freedom. When I was a little girl, I was obsessed with the pioneers, people who risked their lives to go West for a new life. Could I do the same?
I was still determined not to be the girl who moved across the country for a guy, but what would happen if I loosened my grip on that idea? After we dated almost a year, I applied for a job in Los Angeles and got it. Just try it, I told myself. If it all falls apart, New York will always be there.
Every time Hugh told me how happy he was that I was in Los Angeles, I'd say something like, "It's a great opportunity for my career," like this was all a coincidence.
Then one morning over breakfast, he looked at me with his intense, brown eyes and said, "I want to acknowledge for one second that by moving to Los Angeles, you did something beautiful for us."
It was true. Why was it so hard to admit?
For me, the person who hadn't ever taken risks in relationships, this was a new frontier. I didn't move for work. I moved for love.
Six months later, sitting outside at a loud Italian restaurant in Venice, Hugh took my hands in his and asked me to marry him. "Wait, are you sure?" I interrupted, then stopped and let him finish the proposal. When he was done, I said yes.
That was more than 10 years ago. I don't work on the red carpet anymore, but we live in Hollywood, so on Oscars Sunday we stay in, because who wants to drive with all those New Yorkers in town clogging the streets. We get on the couch with our cats and watch the show. Oscars-adjacent.

Texto completo: A new psychological thriller is available on Netflix. And an Octavia Spencer horror film is on HBO.
What's Streaming
HORSE GIRL Stream on Netflix. Alison Brie -- who co-wrote this film with its director, Jeff Baena -- plays Sarah, an unassuming and socially awkward arts-and-crafts store employee who doesn't quite fit in with her Zumba classmates or her roommate. Despite this, she finds comfort in her favorite TV show, "Purgatory," and in visiting a horse she used to own -- both of which seem to protect her from the world's harsh realities, including her mother's death and her grandmother's psychosis. Then, Sarah begins to spiral. In what is a clear mental health decline, Sarah finds herself entangled in a web of amnesia, hallucinations and supernatural experiences. "It would be tactful, at this point, for 'Horse Girl' to show how Sarah's hallucinations are causing her suffering; instead, it indulges them," Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review for The New York Times. She added, "The more time we spend inside her visions, the more we are invited to enable her, to shrug off our worry in favor of an absorbing paranormal mystery."
THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (1947) Stream on Criterion. "'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is a big, colorful show and a good one," a 1947 review in The New York Times said. Walter Mitty, in his most realistic version, is a dull, suburban proofreader. But in his elaborate fantasies, he is a military commander, a surgeon and a Southern gambler, among other roles -- all of which pale in comparison with the real-life adventure he finds himself on. Danny Kaye, who plays Mitty, creates a consistently charming adaptation of James Thurber's 1939 short story of the same title.
What's on TV
MA (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. Octavia Spencer experiments in the horror genre for her role as the title character of "Ma." The movie, which was directed by Tate Taylor ("The Help") and written by Scotty Landes ("Get Out"), has similarly complicated undertones, with a plot centered around a lonely woman who provides a party basement for some rowdy teenagers. Things start to get weird when Ma, who to this point has been a comforting presence and a very lax "parental" supervisor, starts showing up in unexpected places and interacting with the children constantly. Eventually, the viewer learns that Ma -- whose real name is Sue Ann -- went to high school with many of her guests' parents, and she is now seeking revenge for an unspeakably awful act performed in her past. Spencer delivers in this role, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, adding, "She's warm, needy, scary, conspiratorial and witty, overriding any concerns for coherence with the sheer force of her personality."
THE WITNESSES 7 p.m. on Oxygen. Excommunicated members of the Jehovah's Witnesses -- who have been vocal about what they say is the church's history of child sexual abuse -- are interviewed in this two-part documentary. In their conversations with the reporter Trey Bundy, who has covered the topic for several news publications, victims and witnesses describe the lack of support they say they received from the community's leaders, as well as attempts to hide these allegations from both congregation members and the outside world.

Weinstein's Lawyers Try to Discredit Actress's Allegation of Rape

Texto completo: The defense called two witnesses who cast doubt on the "Sopranos" actress's allegation that Harvey Weinstein raped her in the 1990s.
Harvey Weinstein's lawyers began their defense at his rape trial in Manhattan with testimony intended to discredit one of the prosecution's strongest witnesses: the actress Annabella Sciorra, who claims Mr. Weinstein attacked her in the early 1990s.
The defense team also called a cognitive psychologist who is an expert on false, repressed and unreliable memories, to cast doubt on his six accusers, all of whom have testified to sexual assaults that happened years ago. "It doesn't take a Ph.D. to know that memory fades over time," the psychologist, Elizabeth Loftus, said in her testimony.
On Thursday, Manhattan prosecutors rested their case against Mr. Weinstein, the once-powerful Hollywood producer, after three weeks of testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including the six women who said he raped or sexually assaulted them.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers began calling witnesses on Thursday afternoon to support their claim that his encounters with the women had been consensual and, in some instances, transactional to advance their careers.
The second prong of the defense is to suggest that the women's memories and recollections are skewed given the passage of time.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony charges, including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault. If convicted on the last charge, he could be sentenced to up to life in prison.
The trial is largely seen as a pivotal moment for the #MeToo movement, the widespread rebuke of decades of sexual harassment and abuse by men against women in the workplace. The jury of seven men and five women have been asked to consider complex issues around consent and power.
The main charges in the indictment rest on the testimony of just two women: Miriam Haley, a former production assistant who said the producer forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006, and Jessica Mann, a former actress who accused him of raping her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013.
The defense has focused on evidence that suggests Ms. Mann and Ms. Haley maintained relationships, including consensual sexual encounters, with the producer long after he allegedly assaulted them. Mr. Weinstein's lawyers used the women's own words, documented in dozens of emails, to support their theory.
Ms. Sciorra was added to the criminal case late last summer to further support the charge of predatory sexual assault, which requires that prosecutors prove Mr. Weinstein committed a serious sex crime against at least two women. Though the state statute of limitations bars a rape charge based on her allegation, her testimony can be used as part of the predatory sexual assault charge.
Ms. Sciorra, 59, is the most challenging witness for the defense to discredit. Unlike Ms. Mann and Ms. Haley, she did not maintain a relationship with Mr. Weinstein after the alleged rape.
She testified that Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her apartment after giving her a ride home from a dinner party, then raped her even as she punched and kicked him. She said that when she tried to confront him about what happened a couple of weeks later, he menaced her, saying, "This remains between you and I."
But the defense's first witness was Paul Feldsher, a writer and former talent agent who has known both Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Sciorra for decades.
Mr. Feldsher testified that shortly after the alleged attack, during a long walk through Manhattan, Ms. Sciorra characterized her encounter with Mr. Weinstein as something far less serious than rape, calling it a "crazy thing" she had done with the producer.
"My understanding was that she fooled around with him," he said.
In her own testimony, Ms. Sciorra, best known for her roles in "Jungle Fever," and "The Sopranos," had denied saying anything like that to Mr. Feldsher.
Mr. Feldsher described himself as a defender of Mr. Weinstein, saying that he had kept in touch with the producer even after scores of women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.
He gave an unvarnished portrait of Mr. Weinstein on the stand. He said he believed his friend was a "sex addict" and had "dated a lot of women," but also noted that he had never seen Mr. Weinstein act "improperly" toward a woman.
He acknowledged that Mr. Weinstein could be "extremely aggressive" in his work life. And once, he admitted, he sent Mr. Weinstein a text saying, "Your appetite and ambition for the things you want -- a script a movie and yes a girl -- are to put it mildly voracious." But he also said that he did not believe Mr. Weinstein was capable of the crimes he had been charged with.
Ms. Loftus, the cognitive psychologist, testified on Friday that a person's memory can change over time.
"Five years is quite a long time for -- where there would be significant memory decay," said Ms. Loftus, who has testified in the trials of O.J. Simpson and of the officers accused in the beating of Rodney King, as well as in litigation involving Michael Jackson and Martha Stewart.
"So then at 27 years?" asked Diana Fabi Samson, one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, referring to the amount of time that has passed since Mr. Weinstein allegedly attacked Ms. Sciorra. "That's an extraordinarily long period of time where there can be substantial fading of memory," Ms. Loftus said.
Ms. Loftus added that factors like stress and alcohol or drugs can affect a person's memory. She said leading questions by investigators and extensive media coverage on a subject "can cause a contamination and alteration in memory."
Ms. Fabi Samson asked if it was possible that someone could create false memories as they try to recall an event to support a criminal prosecution. Ms. Loftus said some people would "want to try to remember more," and that could lead to "filling in the gaps of an ambiguous or weakened memory with details that then start to feel like memories."
On cross-examination, the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, pointed out that Ms. Loftus's testimony was general and that she was not giving an opinion on the facts of the case.
Jeffrey H. Luber, a forensic document examiner, was called to testify about Ms. Haley's planner. Mr. Luber said he used technology to reveal what Ms. Haley had crossed out in her calendar, including a note to call Mr. Weinstein in late May, only a month after she said he attacked her.
After the jury had left for the day, Ms. Illuzzi accused Donna Rotunno, the lead defense lawyer, of violating the judge's order to not talk to the media about witnesses in the case. Last week, Ms. Rotunno had given an interview to The Daily, The New York Times's news podcast.
In an episode that aired on Friday, Ms. Rotunno told The Times, among other things, that she had never been sexually assaulted "because I would never put myself in that position."
"I have always made choices from college-age on where I never drank too much," she said "I never went home with someone that I didn't know. I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance, ever."
Ms. Illuzzi said Ms. Rotunno, in the interview, had called the accusers liars who were seeking fame.
Ms. Rotunno told the judge in the case, Justice James M. Burke, on Friday that she had not spoken to any reporters since the case began in early January, even though a Times spokeswoman said she had done the interview on Jan. 28 and had been told it would air on Feb. 7.
"I have not spoke to anyone in the media," Ms. Rotunno told the court. "That was taped a while ago, and I did not speak about any witness individually. I talked about a multitude of issues with regard to questions that were asked of me."

Texto completo: The Carol Shields Prize is an effort to raise the visibility of women writers, in part with a sum that far exceeds many other book awards.
About eight years ago, the Canadian novelist Susan Swan looked into the research about how female writers compared with male ones when it came to literary prizes and coverage. She was shocked by what she found.
"I thought it was going to be a happy progress report," she said in an interview. "Instead it was a bad news day."
Books written by women were less likely to be reviewed or win the most prominent book awards, Swan said. Some of those numbers have shifted in recent years. VIDA: Women in Literary Arts, a group that tracks the gender imbalance in major publications, reported gains for female writers at several of them in 2018, and writers such as Bernardine Evaristo, Margaret Atwood, Susan Choi and Sarah M. Broom took home several of the highest-profile book awards last year.
But Swan teamed up with a friend who works in book publishing, Janice Zawerbny, in an effort to continue to level the playing field. The result is a new annual prize, the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction, which starting in 2022 will award 150,000 Canadian dollars, about $ 113,000, for a work of fiction published in the previous year by a woman or nonbinary person.
It is a sum that dwarfs the prize money for literary awards such as the Booker Prize (50,000 pounds, roughly $ 65,000), the Pulitzer Prize for fiction ( $ 15,000) and the National Book Award ( $ 10,000). The Nobel Prize for literature is one exception, with laureates receiving nearly $ 1 million.
"We wanted to go big on it so that people paid attention," Swan said. In addition to the grand prize, four finalists will each receive 12,500 Canadian dollars, about $ 9,400.
Award winners often see their book sales increase, which Swan said is part of the goal of their prize. "I think it's going to make a big difference to the lives of women writers, because it will boost their incomes and their profile," she said.
Books published in English in the United States and Canada will be eligible, including those translated from Spanish or French. Writers must be citizens and current residents, for at least five years, of the United States or Canada. The winner and finalists will be selected by a judging panel that will include one writer each from the United States, Canada and another country.
Carol Shields was a prolific, genre-spanning author who wrote more than 20 books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Stone Diaries." She died in 2003 from complications from breast cancer. Zawerbny and Swan named the prize after her because of her dual Canadian and United States citizenship and the way her work centered domestic life, something Swan said has often been wrongly dismissed as lightweight or unimportant by male critics.
The prize has been funded for the first three years by an anonymous corporate donor. Swan and Zawerbny have started a foundation that will operate the prize and raise additional money to cover administrative costs. They have already enlisted prominent novelists as honorary patrons, including Atwood, Louise Erdrich, Jane Smiley and Alice Munro.
Mentorship is also a key part of the prize. The winner will be asked to select another writer to mentor and work with on writing fellowships. "It's still your job as a younger writer to figure out what you're trying to say to the world," Swan said, but a more experienced one can, "by taking you seriously, just affirm that what you're working on matters."
Correction: Feb. 7, 2020
An earlier version of this article misstated the currency in which the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction will be awarded. The grand prize is 150,000 Canadian dollars, about $ 113,000, not $ 150,000, and the finalists will receive 12,500 Canadian dollars, not $ 12,500.

40 (or So) Delegates Down, And Nearly 2,000 More to Go

Texto completo: Mr. Buttigieg has picked up the most pledged delegates so far, but it's early in the race: 1,990 pledged delegates are needed to secure the Democratic presidential nomination.
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., has taken 13 pledged delegates from Iowa's maligned caucuses and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has won 12, The Associated Press said Friday.
The A.P. had announced Thursday afternoon that it would not declare a winner in Iowa's first-in-the-nation contest, but the allocation provides new clarity about the accumulation of delegates that are necessary to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts took eight delegates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. received six and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has one, according to The A.P.
The A.P. calculated the distribution of 40 of Iowa's 41 national convention delegates. It was not immediately clear why the 41st delegate was not allocated, but it may have been withheld because the news service did not declare a winner in the race. That leaves open the possibility that Mr. Sanders could tie Mr. Buttigieg in pledged delegates.
So who actually won Iowa?
The count of national convention delegates tabulated by The A.P. on Friday added yet another way to measure who won -- or at least who is winning -- the Iowa caucuses several days after they took place.
But there are several other data sets that have been released, and candidates are spinning the numbers to favor their campaigns. So, here is a quick review of what we know.
A(nother) word on the national convention delegates
If you have been paying attention to the Iowa caucuses and the fallout, you surely have seen lots and lots of numbers.
But at the end of the day, to win the Democratic nomination, a candidate must secure 1,990 national (sometimes known as "pledged") delegates. Mr. Buttigieg now has the most, 13, but he and his rivals have a long way to go.
State delegate equivalents
In the run-up to the caucuses, we surveyed media organizations on how they would determine a winner in Iowa, and they basically agreed: state delegate equivalents. Why those? In short, because they determine the number of pledged delegates that each candidate will receive at the national convention.
As of Friday afternoon, Mr. Buttigieg -- who did well in rural areas of Iowa -- is leading Mr. Sanders -- who had success in urban parts of the state -- by two S.D.E.s, 564 to 562.
Why are there different results on different websites?
The Iowa Democratic Party is reporting that 100 percent of the results are in from 1,765 of 1,765 precincts.
But The A.P. said Thursday that it was unable to declare a winner, in part because of "evidence the party has not accurately tabulated some of its results." The New York Times documented extensive errors and inconsistencies in the results in a report published on Thursday.
The A.P. has said that its compilation of results has reached 99 percent of precincts reporting, with data missing from one precinct.
On Thursday, Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, called for the Iowa Democratic Party to "recanvass," or basically double-check, the results of specific precincts where irregularities had been reported.
It is not clear that the correction of any erroneous data would have much of an effect on the count of S.D.E.s. But in a race this close, even one or two delegates could matter.
Another, potentially more consequential decision surrounds how voters at satellite caucuses are being measured, which you can read more about here.
The 'first alignment' and the 'final alignment'
Without getting too much into the weeds (which you can do here, here or here), for years, the only results the Iowa Democratic Party released were S.D.E.s. But this cycle they also released raw data from the so-called first and final alignments.
The first alignment numbers essentially amount to a tally of the popular vote. The final alignment is a count of how many caucusgoers supported each viable candidate after what is called "realignment"; in realignment, people supporting a candidate who did not earn at least 15 percent support in the room were allowed to shift their support to another candidate -- or go home.
Based on the results we have at this point, Mr. Sanders is winning the first alignment by more than 6,000 votes and seems highly unlikely to relinquish a lead. Speaking at his New Hampshire campaign headquarters on Thursday, Mr. Sanders cited that lead as effectively an expression of the popular vote in Iowa.
Mr. Sanders ended the final alignment in front of Mr. Buttigieg by a margin of 2,600 voters.
Mr. Buttigieg, for his part, declared himself the Iowa caucus winner multiple times this week including shortly after caucusgoers went home Monday night and on Wednesday during a conference call with supporters.
So, seriously, who won?
That seems likely to depend on who (or which campaign) you ask.

Texto completo: The mood was tense two weeks ago as I headed to Wuhan, China1, where the coronavirus outbreak began. But not panicked. As one train passenger2 told me, if you're the panicky type, you're not on this train.
I came to see how people were coping with one of the world's worst epidemics in decades. They are cordoned off by a government lockdown and discouraged from going outside.
The scale of Wuhan is breathtaking. This modern-day epidemic has a suitably modern-day setting. But it feels like a ghost town. Nearly all shops are shut. Restaurants are closed. Driving is mostly banned.
Walking around, I can hear birdsong. Dogs bark in chorus. Little ones on the street, hurrying somewhere.3
The market where the outbreak is believed to have started is boarded up.4 It's big, and exotic animals were apparently just a small part.
A government poster5 tells people how to cope: Don't go outside or gather in crowds. Wash your hands. Don't believe rumors or spread them. Have faith, this hardship is temporary.
Wuhan is a city in fear. But it's far from a city in famine.6
This little restaurant stayed open, selling noodles in a wonderful, peppery fish broth. Nearly everyone buys takeout and rushes home with the food.
But masks and thermometers are scarce. "No masks." "Currently no masks for sale." In the signs, you can almost hear the voices of exasperated pharmacy workers who don't have the basic defenses against the virus.
The hospitals are packed.
People crowded at Wuhan Union Hospital for diagnoses, and for prescriptions for fevers, sniffles and coughs. Many are surely wondering: What if it's the coronavirus?
Medical workers rush in and out to receive people from ambulances.7
As the number of cases in Wuhan grew into the thousands, hospitals ran out of beds. Some people have gone from hospital to hospital, only to be turned away.
Medical workers told me they are still seriously short of the gowns and masks that may keep them safer.8 One told me that they have been buying their own masks, and using them longer than they should.
Chinese people often believe IV drips are the best cure for fevers. This man was setting up his drip on the street outside the Red Cross Hospital. It was too crowded inside the hospital, he explained.
One resident set up an isolation unit in a car.
Wuhan is surviving and staying relatively orderly thanks in large part to its working class: people sent out to collect trash, clean streets,9 work in supermarkets -- when every instinct tells residents that they should hole up at home.
It is unclear if the city can get the outbreak under control. A new hospital in Wuhan for coronavirus patients was built in less than two weeks. But there are still not enough beds.
People find ways to cope. This man10 believes exercise will keep him healthy and ward off the virus.
Bowing to public demand, some cigarette and liquor stores stay open.
I met Qiu Dongjun,11 a building worker in Wuhan from rural Hubei. He's living on instant noodles and tinned porridge.
After we spoke, he walked off, then ran back shouting. Did I want one of his tins of porridge?
Xu Shaoqiu,12 a cafe owner, told me he thought questions of who was responsible could be settled later. Get through this first, he said.

Texto completo: The commonwealth has been battered by national disasters and human error, but Republicans have resisted sending the island more money.
WASHINGTON -- The House on Friday approved sending $ 4.89 billion in emergency recovery aid and additional tax relief to Puerto Rico after a series of devastating earthquakes, most likely reigniting a feud with President Trump over his objections to sending federal money to an island battered by national disasters and mismanagement.
The $ 4.89 billion funding package includes $ 3.3 billion in grant funding for disaster relief, $ 210 million to bolster the island's food stamp program and $ 18 million for technical assistance that would in part support the faltering electric grid in Puerto Rico and other territories.
It includes a tax relief package that, among other provisions, expands child tax credit benefits for residents of Puerto Rico and increases the amount of money collected from rum excise taxes diverted back to the governments of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.
"Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico need our help -- unless we step up to the plate right now, we further jeopardize their safety and security," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.
The bill passed on a 237 to 161 margin, carried predominately by Democratic support.
But Mr. Trump has been hostile to the idea of sending federal money to the island, and the White House has warned that it will veto the package. And Senate Republicans, emerging from the impeachment trial, may have similar reservations about the legislation, particularly given the administration's objections.
"We haven't focused on that," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "But historically, we've never turned our backs on our own folks."
The administration raised concerns about Puerto Rico's "history of inadequate financial controls over regular government operations" and the "multiple high-profile cases of corruption" that have "marred distribution of aid." In a statement, the administration also accused the House of "rushing this bill through its process -- and seeking to push taxpayer dollars out the door" before the damage had been fully assessed.
"While I, too, have been frustrated with the amount of time it takes the federal government to distribute funds after disaster, appropriating funds before we know what is truly needed is not the answer," said Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the Appropriations panel. Republicans also objected to the decision to tie a tax relief package to a spending bill, arguing that the two should be separate.
In impassioned speeches on the House floor, several Democrats argued that the legislation was a vital step to ensure the territories are treated in the same way that states would be. While Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands each elect delegates to Congress, their representatives do not have voting rights in the House.
"When we have a disaster, yes, we need more money," declared Representative Stacey E. Plaskett, the Democratic delegate who represents the Virgin Islands. "Because we have underfunding and our infrastructure is a lot more fragile than the rest of the country -- because this body has not done its job."
Allocating and spending emergency aid for Puerto Rico has been politically fraught during the Trump administration, even as the island has struggled to recover from historically catastrophic hurricanes in 2017 and 2018 and a series of earthquakes last month.
Mr. Trump has personally clashed with the island's leadership and objected to sending aid to the island. And even when aid for the recovery secured congressional approval, the administration has been slow to distribute the funds and attached stringent caveats that have restricted how some of that money could be spent.
Mr. Trump and his administration have also pointed to mismanagement on the island as evidence of corruption and a factor in the slow recovery. The governor fired multiple cabinet officials and ordered an investigation after unused emergency supplies were discovered in a warehouse last month.
But disaster-prone states have had more documented public corruption cases -- and often less federal oversight. And despite Mr. Trump's repeated castigation of Puerto Rican officials, it was a former top FEMA administrator working on the island who was arrested in September for taking bribes during the island's recovery from Hurricane Maria.
Mr. Trump announced on Friday that he had named Rear Adm. Peter J. Brown of the Coast Guard to oversee federal efforts to rebuild Puerto Rico as his special representative for Puerto Rico's Disaster Recovery.
With thousands of the island's critical infrastructure projects still in limbo, a nonpartisan watchdog organization on Thursday called for FEMA to improve guidance for the territory's recovery and cost estimates. With about 10,000 damaged sites still in need of repair, island officials estimated it needs $ 132 billion over the next eight years to completely repair its infrastructure.
Puerto Rican officials told the group, the Government Accountability Office, that they were concerned about using outdated guidance, and remain unsure about what guidance is in effect. Through a public assistance program, FEMA had developed guidance and policy specifically to aid Puerto Rico through the recovery process. More than 85 percent of federal aid from FEMA distributed since 2017 has gone toward debris removal and power restoration, according to the report.
The G.A.O. recommended that the two entities -- FEMA and the Puerto Rican government -- work together to understand what is needed for project approval in order to more quickly begin work, and tasked FEMA with providing access to the most current policy and guidance.
"Ultimately we hope these recommendations can clear up all the confusion and complexities around trying to get to these cost estimates for these projects so they can get started rebuilding Puerto Rico," said Chris Currie, the director of the Government Accountability Office team that wrote the report.

Texto completo: Years of warnings that children were being abused may have gone unheeded until the death of Kaseem Watkins.
The young father was arrested after his 6-week-old son was found lifeless in his crib in the Bronx one morning last week. Investigators had found undated video on a baby monitor of him pressing down on a pillow over the tiny boy's head and charged him with murder.
But it was not the first time the authorities had heard about the father, Teshawn Watkins.
Not only had the police arrested him twice on charges he had assaulted the baby's mother, but the authorities investigated him four times over allegations of child abuse in the family, including once when another son had a broken leg, law enforcement officials told The New York Times.
Now, nearly a week after Mr. Watkins, 27, was charged in his son Kaseem's death, questions have begun to arise over how so many warning signs went unheeded and whether the city could have done more to protect Mr. Watkins's three sons.
The city's Administration for Children's Services, which handles child abuse allegations, and the New York Police Department, which investigated at least one suspected case of abuse in the family, have not explained how the agencies responded to a troubling sequence of violence. Now, city officials are trying to determine if the system broke down.
"We need to know how this happened, why this happened, how it was possible this happened," Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday.
Prosecutors said one video from the baby monitor's memory card showed Mr. Watkins holding the newborn by the head and spinning him in the air. A cellphone video recorded by Mr. Watkins showed him punching Kaseem's mother in the face while she was pregnant, leaving her with a bloody nose.
"It's clear based on the investigation that there's a pattern of violence in this home," Amir Fadl, the prosecutor handling his arraignment, said. The couple has two older sons, 3 and 4.
The baby's mother, Celicia Reyes, found Kaseem unresponsive the morning of Jan. 29 in their Williamsbridge apartment. He was later pronounced dead at Montefiore Medical Center, according to the police. The city medical examiner determined he died from asphyxiation.
Mr. Watkins told the police he had put a pillow over his son's face in attempt to stop his crying and went to sleep. His lawyer, Cesar Gonzalez, said his client was "remorseful."
But the police came to believe the act was intentional after discovering video on the baby monitor that showed Mr. Watkins apparently trying to smother the boy, prosecutors said at court hearings. The video was undated, but prosecutors said it was consistent with Mr. Watkins's past behavior.
Details that have emerged in court hearings and interviews with people familiar with the case showed that the path that led to Kaseem's death may have been years in the making.
Signs that the children were being abused arose as early as December 2016, when Ms. Reyes's mother became concerned about bruises on another of the boys, who was then a newborn, said three law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive investigation.
Doctors at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center determined the infant had a fractured leg that was already healing and a suspicious pattern of bruises. Ms. Reyes said she believed the baby's brother, who was a year old, may have bitten him, but doctors did not think the marks could have been caused by a child's bite, the officials said.
The Administration for Children's Services placed the boys in foster care while the police investigated if they were abused, the officials said. The children were returned to their parents in 2017 after the police determined that no crime had occurred, officials said.
The law enforcement officials interviewed for this article said the determination was troubling, given that Ms. Reyes's explanation was inconsistent with doctors' findings, and because the detective did not interview the children's parents. Ms. Reyes had declined to answer questions without a lawyer, and at the time Mr. Watkins had been ordered to stay away from her and their children after an arrest on domestic violence charges.
The abuse investigation occurred while the city's child-welfare agency was under immense scrutiny following the deaths of Zymere Perkins, 6, and Jaden Jordan, 3, whose families both had repeated contact with the agency. The state ordered the city to install an independent monitor over the agency as the number of reports of children being abused or neglected in the city rose to nearly 69,000 in 2017 from about 65,000 in 2016.
The monitor found that the child-welfare agency had not been performing thorough investigations in all cases, including in some where there were "critical safety issues" that put children at risk.
At the same time, the then-commander of the Police Department's Special Victims Division, which investigates sex crimes and child abuse, was warning higher-ups that the unit was dangerously understaffed, according to a 2018 city audit. The commander, Deputy Chief Michael Osgood, had written that the department could not be "the cause of a future Zymere Perkins."
After Zymere's death in September 2016, child-welfare teams increasingly flagged incoming reports of child abuse as serious cases, triggering a surge in police investigations. Investigators in the Bronx handled 416 new cases between Sept. 26, 2016, and Dec. 21, 2016, a 41 percent increase from the same period in 2015, according to a law enforcement official.
By the time Ms. Reyes's mother called 911 on Dec. 28, the police were already swamped.
A spokeswoman for the Police Department did not answer questions about the department's handling of the 2016 abuse investigation. At his news conference on Tuesday, the mayor said confidentiality rules prevented him from talking about the case more openly.
The Administration for Children's Services said it had implemented nearly all of the monitor's recommendations, including increased collaboration with the Police Department. Chanel Caraway, a spokeswoman, however, declined to comment on the Kaseem's case beyond saying the agency was investigating with the Police Department.
"Our top priority is protecting the safety and well-being of all children in New York City," Ms. Caraway said.
The authorities investigated three additional allegations of child abuse involving Mr. Watkins, the law enforcement officials said. But further details, including which agencies were involved and the timing of the allegations, were not available.
Abe George, a former prosecutor and a lawyer who has represented the families of several children who died from abuse, said one question was whether the child-welfare agency had been closely monitoring the family after four abuse allegations.
"If they didn't do that, the intense monitoring, then I think there's definitely some negligence on the part of A.C.S.," said Mr. George, who added it was too early to tell if the city had faltered in the case.
Mr. Watkins also had a history of violence against Ms. Reyes, according to the police and court records.
He had been arrested in February 2016 after he lifted Ms. Reyes off the ground by her neck, law enforcement officers said. He pleaded guilty to harassment and was given a conditional discharge, according to court records.
In another incident, Ms. Reyes, a home attendant, told the police last May that she was headed to work when Mr. Watkins approached her at a Bronx train station, two law enforcement officials said. When she refused to speak to him, he took her cellphone and pushed her. He was arrested in June, but prosecutors dropped the case when Ms. Reyes decided not to testify, officials said.
In February 2019, he was arrested on charges that he had threatened an upstairs neighbor with a kitchen knife, the police said. A judge agreed early this year to dismiss the case if he stayed out of trouble for six months, according to court records.
Three weeks later, Mr. Watkins was back in court, accused of killing his own child. He is being held without bail on Rikers Island.
At a recent hearing, a handful of Mr. Watkins's relatives sat in the courtroom watching the proceeding. They declined to be interviewed. Reached by phone, Ms. Reyes and Felicia Watson, Kaseem's aunt, also declined to comment.
At the Holland Avenue apartment building where the family lived, a stuffed Mickey Mouse and six candles formed a memorial next to the entrance steps.
Neighbors said they had seen the police come and go from the apartment several times since the family moved in about two years ago, but they believed the parents had been fighting -- not harming their children.
"They always looked clean, happy, well-fed," Keisha Cartel, a downstairs neighbor, said. "I never suspected anything."

Meaningful Discussion of Abortion by Rivals Shows This Election Cycle Is Different

Texto completo: The candidates had their most significant discussion about abortion in any debate yet, tackling an issue whose absence from previous debates has angered advocates.
In their most substantive debate statements to date on abortion, several of the leading Democratic presidential candidates reaffirmed on Friday night that if elected, they would put forward only Supreme Court nominees who supported Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a woman's right to abortion.
Historically, many presidential candidates have shied away from an outright litmus test on abortion or any other issue, arguing that Supreme Court justices should not be selected based on their political positions but on their experience and jurisprudence. But that has changed this campaign cycle.
The Democratic candidates have also gone a step further and urged that the right to abortion be legislated, a call that several repeated on Friday during the discussion of an issue whose absence from previous debates has angered advocates.
"I've lived in an America in which abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, and that's what we have to remember about this," Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said, arguing that Roe v. Wade should be codified.
"Three out of every four people in America believe right now that the rule of Roe v. Wade should be the law," Ms. Warren said. "That means we should be pushing for a congressional solution as well. It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a woman's choice."
Ms. Warren added: "States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright, and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies, then it's going to mean we can't simply rely on the courts."
The exchange began with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also pledging that if the Supreme Court were to rule abortion unconstitutional, he would ask Congress to pass a bill codifying Roe v. Wade.
"It's a woman's right to do that. Period," Mr. Biden said. "And if you call that a litmus test, it's a litmus test."
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she would appoint only justices who respected precedent.
"And one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade," she said. "In addition, you have got to put it into law."
Ms. Klobuchar warned that President Trump and some states had suggested criminalization of abortion. "When he was running for election -- and this is a case I will make on the debate stage against him -- he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail. He then dialed it back and said, 'No, I want to put doctors in jail,"' she said. "Is it a big surprise, then, we are seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions? It's not."
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also demanded codification of Roe v. Wade. "Look, you asked a simple question," Mr. Sanders said. "Is there a litmus test for those of us up here? For me, there is. I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who is not 100 percent pro-Roe v. Wade. Number two, we have to codify Roe v. Wade into legislation."
"We all have the litmus test. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman's right to choose," the businessman Tom Steyer said.
"There's something else going on. The Republicans are in control," he added. "They're stacking the court for a generation with young right-wing radicals. And we've watched it happen and the question is, what are we going to do about it?"

Texto completo: Readers criticize the president's "uncouth" and "un-Christian" behavior at a prayer breakfast and worry about America's future.
To the Editor:
Re "Instead of Reconciliation, a Promise of Payback" (front page, Feb. 7):
Your article about President Trump's comments at the National Prayer Breakfast amply illustrates how uncouth, vindictive and unrepentant he is. He is the last person to pay heed to the call of the Harvard professor Arthur Brooks, whose speech preceded his, to "love your enemies."
All those who have worked with Mr. Trump, in business as well as in government, know how vindictive he is. All those who voted for his acquittal did so out of fear of being punished by him. The fact that he used a prayer breakfast whose theme is Christian forgiveness to settle scores with his political opponents shows how un-Christian-like he is.
It is laughable when the president, after trashing his political opponents, should talk about "wanting to heal our country and fix our country." He destroyed the spirit of the National Prayer Breakfast, which you note is "traditionally a bipartisan affair."

To the Editor:
The problem is not that Republican senators are spineless, though they certainly are.
Nor that President Trump will do anything to get re-elected, though he certainly will.
Nor is the problem that Mr. Trump will slime whomever he runs against, though he will, nor that the Electoral College gives him a big advantage, though it does, nor even that the Democrats' impeachment of Mr. Trump was an amateur circus, though it was.
The problem is that 63 million Americans voted for him in the first place, and despite everything -- his blatant lying, the extraordinary incompetence of his administration, the unprecedented damage he's done to American power and prestige around the world, his use of the power of the presidency to enrich himself and his friends and family -- they seem prepared to do so again.
This country has never lived up to the brilliance of its founding documents. We wrote that "all men are created equal" and then spent much of the next century creating our nation's fortune on slavery and genocide. But until recently, no matter how badly we behaved, we continued to hold up those documents as the standard to which we aspired. And when those ideals were challenged, the institutions founded by those documents did their jobs and righted the ship.
Many voters are focused on "Who can beat Trump?," which is to say, "Who can save this country?" We need someone who can stand up and remind us why this country is worth saving.

To the Editor:
Re "How Trump Wins Again" (column, Feb. 7):
David Brooks asserts that the election is being framed around this core question: "Is capitalism basically working or is it basically broken?" Rather, the central question that we must address is more fundamental, one that goes to the heart of the kind of country we aspire to be. It is whether we choose to continue traveling on the path of meanspiritedness, incivility, transactional amorality and tribalism that our current president is leading us down, or follow a different path that puts mutual respect, embrace of differences, compassion for our fellow citizens and the pursuit of common ground at the center of our national life.
This election will be nothing less than a referendum on who we want to be as a people and a nation.

Texto completo: The Interior Department grounded its fleet over national security concerns. But other agencies are more worried about the impact of an all-out ban.
WASHINGTON -- Federal agencies are split on how best to handle national security concerns surrounding popular and ubiquitous Chinese-made drones, with some policymakers chafing at more protectionist approaches.
The Department of the Interior, which uses drones for tasks like wildlife conservation and the monitoring of the state of infrastructure, grounded all those made in China or built with Chinese parts in October. It reaffirmed that decision in January, saying its entire fleet of 810 drones would essentially remain out of commission until it can confirm they pose no security threat.
Yet the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget raised warnings last year about congressional legislation that would make it impossible for the United States government to buy Chinese drones at all. The Agriculture Department, which uses drones to survey farmland, for example, said it could limit the ability "to carry out our mission-crucial work" and "halt" the Forest Service's use of drones altogether.
The Trump administration has engaged in a steady campaign to wall off America from Chinese technology, saying the Chinese government could use it to spy on the United States. The administration has been trying to keep Huawei, the telecom equipment giant, out of the next generation of wireless networks both in the United States and abroad and has increased scrutiny of Chinese investment in sectors deemed "critical," like telecom and tech. Federal officials have also investigated whether mobile apps owned by Chinese companies could leak sensitive data.
Their efforts have been cheered on by members of Congress from both parties, many of whom have written legislation that would restrict China's ability to operate in the United States.
But the debate over drones, which are primarily made either in China or with Chinese parts, shows how attempts to "decouple" America from Chinese industry can crash into the realities of the global tech supply chain.
DJI, a drone manufacturer based in Shenzhen, China, is by far the industry leader, with analysts estimating it has a market share of 70 percent or higher. Its drones are used not only by government agencies but by legions of hobbyists. Even some competing products that are made in America include Chinese parts.
"Decoupling isn't like a magic wand where you just say, 'We're not going to use these people anymore,"' said James Lewis, the director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The prevalence of DJI's products has drawn concern from government officials for years. In 2017, a memo from the Los Angeles office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had "moderate confidence" that DJI was providing critical United States "infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government."
While DJI denied the claims, the concerns have persisted. Last year, Congress approved a measure blocking defense agencies from buying Chinese drones.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers has also introduced legislation that would effectively bar federal agencies from buying drones made in China, accusing the companies of intellectual property theft and endangering American security.
The proposed law triggered concerns from various corners of the executive branch.
In letters obtained by The New York Times, Stephen L. Censky, the deputy secretary of the Department of Agriculture, told the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget that the agency had major concerns with the law. A letter, dated late September, said the law would "severely impact the establishment, development and implementation" of the Agriculture Department's drone program "to carry out our mission-crucial work."
Mr. Censky also said in the letter that drones could be useful to the agency's efforts in nature conservation, combating wildfires and monitoring the health of forests.
By December, the agency had seen a new version of the draft law, according to a second letter, but Mr. Censky said it was still "concerned that none of our previous comments were considered or integrated into this rewrite."
The budget office also said it opposed a version of the ban in a memo circulated in September, which was first reported by Politico. It expressed concerns that prohibiting government use of Chinese drones would prompt Chinese officials to do the same to American companies, hindering their growth. And it said that "banning the use of these systems without any viable alternatives would put undue burden on federal agencies."
The next month, the Interior Department grounded any drones made in China, or with Chinese parts. Last week, it formalized the move -- with officials saying that it was "without question" aimed at China -- while allowing drones to be used in emergencies.
The aircraft will not be used again until they can be vetted for security flaws, the agency has said. Nonemergency missions will use other aircraft or helicopters.
The Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to requests for comment.
Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican and a sponsor of the legislation that would bar federal agencies from buying Chinese drones, said he was unaware of the letters from the Agriculture Department but noted that defense agencies had raised concerns about the flying devices.
"While I would defer to the Department of Agriculture on the Dairy Margin Coverage Program, when it comes to threats to our national security, I am inclined to agree with the security-minded experts," he said.
Critics of DJI say that it's important for the United States to develop its own drone companies that can compete with Chinese firms.
One California company, Skydio, makes its drones stateside but still uses some Chinese parts. Its chief executive, Adam Bry, said that all the core components were American -- and that the company was moving away from using the Chinese parts altogether.
DJI has tried to soothe the Trump administration's fears, moving some of its production to California and introducing a version of its product explicitly for government users.
In a statement, DJI said it supported the development of standards to defuse security concerns about drones, instead of an all-out ban on Chinese products.
"They are protectionist ploys to exclude successful competitors in favor of domestic suppliers that don't exist," a spokesman said.
"Federal officials and lawmakers supporting this country of origin restriction have little understanding of how professionals use drones to do their work, and cannot explain how using drones to manage wildfires, support wildlife conservation and monitor the health of forests is somehow sensitive or puts U.S. national security at risk," he said.

Texto completo: Ms. Dunn, who worked in the Obama White House, is taking on a new role as Mr. Biden seeks a reset after a disappointing fourth-place finish in Iowa.
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is shaking up his campaign leadership just days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, an acknowledgment that his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination is in major trouble after a disastrous fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Biden is giving effective control of the campaign to Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic operative and top adviser to him.
"She will be working closely with us on campaign strategy and overall coordination on budget and personnel as we build a bigger campaign for the next phase," according to a campaign email obtained by The New York Times.
But two senior Biden officials said Ms. Dunn is doing more than that -- and that she will have final decision-making authority, a decision that came at the behest of the former vice-president. The Biden advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.
The email was sent on Thursday by Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's current campaign manager, and a longtime Biden adviser, Steve Ricchetti, who have had differences with each other, reflecting internal generational tensions that have divided the Biden campaign, according to some Democrats close to it.
Mr. Biden's decision to make such a major change amounts to a recognition that if he does not revive his fortunes in New Hampshire and in the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, his so-called firewall in South Carolina -- where he is presumed to have strong support from black voters -- could crumble and donors will bolt. He acknowledged this week that the result in Iowa was a "gut punch," a remark his team referenced in the email.
In another indication that Mr. Biden knows he must quickly turn his campaign around, his senior aides reached out this week to Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, a former Obama campaign official who ran Beto O'Rourke's campaign. The aides asked Ms. O'Malley Dillon to help on their Nevada caucus effort and she agreed to do so in a volunteer capacity, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation, but she will not join the campaign.
Such shake-ups are common in troubled presidential campaigns -- and even before the primary here. In 2008, after being soundly defeated by Barack Obama in Iowa, Hillary Clinton overhauled her staff before winning the New Hampshire primary.
Ms. Dunn's new role was greeted enthusiastically by some on Mr. Biden's staff who have been frustrated by the bickering and view her as a unifying and respected figure across generational lines.
But in a sign of the tensions on the campaign, and the growth of rival factions who are and are not loyal to Mr. Schultz, other Biden officials sought to downplay the elevation of an already-senior official, suggesting it was mostly done to reassure the vice-president himself.
The move follows days of speculation inside Mr. Biden's Philadelphia headquarters about potential staff shake-ups following a disappointing Iowa result that has complicated Mr. Biden's path forward. Before her elevation, Ms. Dunn had been focused chiefly on communications strategy.
Her new leadership role, which came with Mr. Biden's blessing, signals that the campaign recognizes a need to make changes. But it's not clear that promoting Ms. Dunn will alter Mr. Biden's trajectory in the race -- or be the last change Mr. Biden makes.
A spokesman for the Biden campaign, T.J. Ducklo, declined to comment.
Ms. Dunn, a managing director at the public affairs firm SKDKnickerbocker, is a longtime Democratic strategist who has worked on a number of presidential campaigns and grew close to Mr. Biden when she worked in the Obama White House. She has been dividing her time between Washington, the Philadelphia headquarters and on the campaign trail with Mr. Biden.

A Statistical Tie Heading Into the Next Contest

Texto completo: Five days before the New Hampshire primary, the race is looking more like a two front-runner competition between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.
Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .
The New Hampshire Democratic primary is increasingly looking like a dual front-runner race as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg leaps ahead to join Senator Bernie Sanders at the front of the pack, according to newly released polls.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg are statistically tied in both a Monmouth University survey released Thursday and a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll out Friday. Each survey was taken during the aftermath of Monday's bungled Iowa caucuses.
These results set up a possible outcome that few had given much thought to before this week: Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg may emerge from the two earliest-voting states with roughly equal momentum, leaving even their strongest rivals scrambling to regain footing -- even as the race expands to more diverse contests in the South and West.
The Monmouth poll showed Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, with the support of 24 percent of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire, and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., with 20 percent. Those numbers are technically within the poll's margin of error of each other. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was at 17 percent and Senator Elizabeth Warren had 13 percent. Senator Amy Klobuchar was at 9 percent.
The Suffolk numbers were even tighter: Mr. Sanders was at 24 percent, and Mr. Buttigieg was at 23 percent. No other candidate was within 10 points of them in that poll.
Suffolk has been polling New Hampshire voters constantly this week, releasing new results from its "tracking poll" every day. According to the poll, Mr. Buttigieg's support has doubled since the beginning of the week, when he captured just 11 percent of likely voters.
Campaigning around New Hampshire this week, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have each claimed victory in the Iowa caucuses. And as of right now, both have a legitimate argument: With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are locked in a virtual tie in the delegate count.
While the Monmouth poll had a four-day collection period, which began on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the latest Globe/Suffolk poll was only collected on Wednesday and Thursday. That meant the news of Mr. Buttigieg's unexpectedly strong showing in Iowa had sunk in a bit more by the time that poll's field period began.
A little over half of primary voters in both polls said they had yet to firmly settle on a Democratic candidate.
"I don't think Iowa has sunk in yet -- things are still shifting there," Patrick Murray, who runs the Monmouth poll, said in an interview. But even without an outright win, Mr. Buttigieg's strong showing has the potential to bring him more attention, Mr. Murray said -- particularly if he performs strongly in the Democratic debate in Manchester, N.H., on Friday.
That's because Mr. Murray sees the most uncertainty existing among electability-minded voters -- those who say they are most interested in finding a candidate who will defeat President Trump. And Mr. Buttigieg tends to be more popular among these voters than among those who prioritize particular issues.
"Some of these other supporters of Biden and Klobuchar are the ones taking a look, because they're the ones most concerned about electability," Mr. Murray said, referring to voter curiosity about Mr. Buttigieg.
There is sometimes a temptation to lump Iowa and New Hampshire together as a kind of opening chapter to the nominating process. After all, both are heavily white states and nonrepresentative of the country's population at large. And indeed, the results this year could end up being quite similar in both states.
But the two contests differ significantly. Iowa's consists of caucuses -- which favor candidates with younger and more activist supporters -- and includes only Democrats. New Hampshire's election is a simple primary, and is also open to political independents.
In 2016, when Mr. Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the primary there, he relied largely on the support of independent voters. He is himself a political independent, and he still does well among this group. But the 26 percent support he is now earning from non-Democrats in the Monmouth poll is still far less than the nearly three-quarters of independent voters he got in 2016.
This reflects the complications of a more crowded field this year, and the fact that the independent voters who participate on Tuesday may skew slightly more conservative than they did in 2016. That is because there was a competitive Republican primary that year. With Mr. Trump's nomination all but guaranteed among Republicans this year, a broader cross-section of independents may consider weighing in on the Democratic race.
Mr. Buttigieg, who is the only other candidate to break 20 percent among non-Democrats in the Monmouth poll, could stand to gain.
Ms. Warren -- whose poll numbers in New Hampshire crested in the fall, but who still stands a chance at a strong showing -- is far less popular among independents. She pulls the vast majority of her backing from Democrats, and from liberals.
The divide between her liberal supporters and Mr. Sanders's falls strikingly along gender lines. He is nearly twice as popular among New Hampshire men than he is among women there, according to the Monmouth poll. For Ms. Warren, the inverse is true.
A possible asset for Ms. Warren is that college graduates make up an outsize share of the New Hampshire primary electorate. Mr. Sanders tends to underperform with this group; according to Iowa entrance polls, on Monday he did only half as well among those with a college degree as he did among less-educated voters.
But so far, no other candidate has consolidated the support of college-educated New Hampshire Democrats either. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg each command about one-fifth of these voters, according to Monmouth. Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar are not far behind.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
During the president's impeachment trial, no photos or videos were permitted in the Senate chamber except for C-SPAN cameras. But sketches were allowed, so The New York Times sent Art Lien, a courtroom sketch artist, to give readers a rare view of the Senate floor, capturing moments that TV viewers might not have seen otherwise. Alicia Parlapiano, a graphics and multimedia editor, spoke with him to get insights into his process and perspective.
1. HIS TOOLS
Mr. Lien used a very thin (. 03 mm) mechanical pencil with soft lead, which results in a darker mark. He'd prefer to use pen, but pencils allowed him to make adjustments. "People move around and things change, so it's nice to be able to erase," he said. When it came to colors, Mr. Lien would simply jot down notes about what shades he wanted to use, because he was required to exit the chamber if he wanted to use his portable watercolor kit -- a three-by-five-inch box of paints, and brushes with water in the handles.
2. HIS APPROACH
Mr. Lien sketched from the press gallery overlooking the Senate floor. That vantage point made drawing difficult. "It's a large room, into which all of these individual little desks are squeezed," he said. "It's an unusual perspective, looking down on the tops of heads." At the beginning, Mr. Lien looked for objects or moments that stood out in the proceedings. "The fidget spinners, all that stuff," he said. "Then toward the end, we were really looking for who would defect from the vote and the witnesses."
3. HIS STYLE
One thing he did during the trial that he didn't do earlier in his career was write labels and captions on his sketches. They added more information, he said. But the annotations also injected a lightness or humor to the images. In some cases, Mr. Lien intentionally left sketches more unfinished. "The eye doesn't really have time to look at every little corner," he said.

Parisian-based artist Ballaké Sissoko accused the TSA of dismantling his prized kora during an inspection at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Tuesday. A TSA spokesperson denies that the agency caused any damage.
The kora is a 21-string harp of African origin, according to Sissoko's official biography.
"This is an unprovoked and sad act of aggression, a reflection of the kind of cultural ignorance and racism that is taking over in so many parts of the world and that endangers the best of musicians from Africa and elsewhere," read the post on the Facebook fan page.
Pictures showing the extent of the damages and an image of a notice of inspection bearing the TSA logo were posted to Sissoko's official Facebook fan page. Sissoko says the damage happened just before he disembarked on a trip home to Paris.
A statement translated into English accompanied the images, saying, "The neck of the kora has been removed. The strings, bridge and entire, delicate and complex sound system of amplification have been taken apart . . . These kinds of custom-made koras are simply impossible to replace. "
Sissoko was returning from a two-week tour across the United States and didn't realize what happened to the instrument until he got home.
The musician blamed the TSA on his fan page, sparking outrage among his fans and attracting international attention.
Bestselling fantasy author, N. K. Jemison, called the incident "horrific" in a tweet posted Wednesday.
Fellow bestselling writer Steve Silberman described the matter as "grotesque" on Twitter.
TSA denied handling the instrument in a statement released Thursday to The Guardian.
"It is most unfortunate that Mr Sissoko’s instrument was damaged in transport. However, after a thorough review of the claim, it was determined that TSA did not open the instrument case because it did not trigger an alarm when it was screened for possible explosives,” a TSA representative told The Guardian in an email.
Sissoko's manager, Corinne Serres, said she was "very shocked" that the TSA denied responsibility, The New York Times reported.
“It is totally ridiculous to say that the kora can have been disassembled by transport,” Serres said. “This kora travels worldwide and recently went to India, China, Japan, Finland. ”
Serres also said the kora couldn't have been taken apart "without the help of some bad people touching it," according to The Times.
The TSA is adamant that the instrument case was not opened and that the notice pictured on Sissoko's fan page could have been placed there by anyone. Records show the case was screened, cleared, and loaded by conveyor belt onto the aircraft, The Washington Post reported.
TSA security regulations state that, "musical instruments must undergo screening when transported as carry-on or in checked bags. "
Both Sissoko and Serres, have attributed ulterior motives to the incident.
In a statement to The Times, Sissoko said he often experiences racism while traveling.
“Many people don’t treat you normally and can be very arrogant,” he said in the statement. “I always try to keep calm to avoid problems. "
"Would they have dared do such a thing to a white musician playing a classical instrument?” Serres said. She called the matter, "an unprovoked and sad act of aggression" and a reflection of cultural ignorance.
Serres also told The Times that Sissoko would proceed with a formal complaint to the TSA.
Digital media platform Okay Africa calls Sissoko "a contemporary master of the kora. " He is recognized as an accomplished musician throughout the world and performs in many countries. Among the venues where he has performed is the Taj Mahal.
On his web site, Sissoko describes the kora as essential to his art. Sissoko began learning the kora at a very young age under his father's guidance.
"Ten fingers for twenty-one strings, and magic takes place, surely, calmly," Sissoko's web page bio reads. "Ballaké Sissoko enlaces us in his suave and crystalline sonority and his kora, magnified by his talent as a melodist and an improviser. "
The biography says Sissoko is the son of Djelimady Sissoko, "a great master of the Manding Kora, a twenty-one-stringed harp whose crystalline sound has conquered the international public. "

Texto completo: EIGHT CHINESE doctors expressed concern about a new sickness in Wuhan in December and were reprimanded for spreading rumors. One of them, Li Wenliang, died on Friday of what has now been identified as a novel coronavirus, and he quickly became a powerful online symbol of speaking truth to power. Mr. Li's heroism is undeniable. The larger story is how this fast-moving epidemic is severely testing China's authoritarian system, which is showing signs of strain.
Dr. Li, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was reprimanded by the police after he shared concerns about seven new cases of pneumonia in an online chat group on Dec.-30. At the time, the Wuhan health commission was telling hospitals not to say anything publicly and just report the cases internally. The police accused the eight doctors of rumor-mongering. They compelled Dr. Li to sign a statement answering the questions 'Can you stop your illegal behavior?' and 'Do you understand you'll be punished if you don't stop such behavior?' He wrote, 'I can' and 'I understand,' and put his red-inked thumbprint on them.
In a strictly totalitarian system, that might have been the last word. But it was not. China is an authoritarian, one-party state that can easily silence dissidents one by one, but there are limits to its control, especially when millions of people on social media grow angry " as they have over Dr. Li's death and the government's failure to inform the public in the early stage of the epidemic. Aside from the biomedical issues and lockdown sacrifices, the public has zeroed in on the unexplained information gaps and coverups. This is extremely sensitive for a leadership that rigidly polices information.
According to Li Yuan of the New York Times, the hashtag #WeWantFreedomOfSpeech# was created on China's social media platform Weibo at 2 a.m. on Friday, and had more than 2 million views and over 5,500 posts by 7 a.m. before it was deleted by censors. Another hashtag, 'The Wuhan government owes Li Wenliang an apology,' was viewed 180 million times by late Thursday before it was blocked by government censors, the Financial Times reported.
This is not the first crisis of the digital age to expose popular fury in China: The Sichuan earthquake and contaminated dairy products scandal of 2008 and the Zhejiang train disaster of 2011 all did the same. China's leaders have grown more proficient at managing it, giving people limited room to let off steam while marshaling censors, as well as injecting their own messages into the social media stream. The decision in Beijing to send a prosecutorial unit to investigate Dr. Li's death is also a damage-control move.
The coronavirus outbreak presents a vast public-health challenge to China and will for months to come. But at the same time, it is shaking the foundations of a political system built on President Xi Jinping's assurance that the party knows best for all. China's people have some doubts.

Justice Department Drops Antitrust Probe of Auto Makers Involved in California Emissions Deal; Agency had been investigating Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen's pact with Democratic-led state

WASHINGTON—The Justice Department closed its antitrust investigation of four auto makers that had reached a tailpipe-emissions deal last summer with the state of California, finding no evidence of collusion among the companies.
After examining the matter for several months, the department concluded that the auto makers—Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG—didn't engage in conduct that violated U.S. antitrust law, according to people familiar with the matter.
Spokespeople for Ford and BMW confirmed that the Justice Department had dropped the probe, which was reported earlier by the New York Times. The other auto makers didn't respond to requests to comment.
At issue was a July agreement between the auto makers and the California Air Resources Board on fuel efficiency standards, a state-based framework that is at odds with the Trump administration's regulatory approach.
Justice Department officials questioned whether the companies had agreed among themselves on the outlines of the deal with California regulators, and the auto makers received formal civil subpoenas in the fall .
The department launched the investigation amid a heated conflict between the Republican Trump administration and California's Democratic leaders—one that has played out over several fronts, including health care, immigration and transportation.
In a statement, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the investigation was "always a sham—a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to prevent more auto makers from joining California and agreeing to stronger emissions standards."
"This is a big loss for the president and his weaponization of federal agencies—and a victory for anyone who cares about the rule of law and clean air," Mr. Newsom said.
The Justice Department's top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, appeared before the Senate in September and testified that politics played no role in the auto maker investigation, calling the investigation a fact-finding mission.
Environmental rules, especially climate policy, have been at the center of the conflict between California and the White House. Sacramento wants to sharply limit the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change, especially from cars and trucks.
The Trump administration has moved to rescind Obama-era rules that attempted to lower emissions, and to curb California's influence in the auto industry .
The four companies announced a deal in July to support standards set by the California Air Resources Board, betting it was the best way to ensure the dispute didn't lead to two sets of emissions standards in the U.S.
Justice officials believed at the time the deal could effectively restrict competition by potentially limiting the types of cars and trucks the auto companies offer to consumers, people familiar with the department's thinking say.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the investigation last year.
For a time, that investigation had effectively frozen any progress on negotiations to further detail or expand the pact. No other companies have announced interest in joining since the start of the investigation, and several of those that hadn't joined chose to intervene on behalf of the Trump administration in October in a lawsuit over its move to strip California's authority.
The auto makers eventually met with department antitrust officials in person and formally responded to the subpoenas.

Trump travel ban snubs Africa's biggest economy

Texto completo: Headnote NIGERIAN IMMIGRATION HALTED
The newlyweds had already been apart for half their yearlong marriage. Miriam Nwegbe was in Nigeria. Her husband was in Baltimore, and until she could join him, everything was on hold: finding a home together, trying for their first baby, becoming an American family.
Then last week, their lives were thrown into disarray by the expansion of President Donald Trump's ban on immigration to include six new countries, including four in Africa. Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, was one of them.
"America has killed me," Nwegbe's husband, Ikenna, an optometrist, texted her when he heard. "We are finished."
A year after the Trump administration announced that a major pillar of its new strategy for Africa was to counter the growing influence of China and Russia by expanding economic ties to the continent, it slammed the door shut on Nigeria, the continent's biggest economy.
The travel restrictions also apply to three other African countries - Sudan, Tanzania, and Eritrea - as well as to Myanmar, which is accused of genocide against its Muslim population, and Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet state.
The ban will prevent thousands of people from being able to move to the U.S.
The initial ban, which was put into effect in 2017, restricted travel from some Muslim-majority countries as part of Trump's plan to keep out "radical Islamic terrorists." It has already affected more than 135 million people - many of them Christians - from seven countries.
With the new expansion, the ban will affect nearly a quarter of the 1.2 billion people on the African continent, according to W. Gyude Moore, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development, a research group, potentially taking a heavy toll on African economies - and on America's image in the region.
"Chinese, Turkish, Russian and British firms, backed by their governments, are staking positions on a continent that will define the global economy's future," he said, adding, "One hopes that the United States would follow suit and fully engage with the continent - but that hope fades."
The rationale for the new restrictions varies depending on country, but the White House announcement said that most of the six countries added to the list did not comply with identity-verification and information-sharing rules.
And Nigeria, it said, posed a risk of harboring terrorists who may seek to enter the U.S. The country has been hit brutally by the Islamist group Boko Haram, though the extremists have shown little sign that they have the capability to export their fight overseas.
Critics, many of whom also denounced the initial ban, saw something far more venal at play.
"Trump's travel bans have never been rooted in national security - they're about discriminating against people of color," Kamala Harris, a former Democratic presidential candidate, declared Sunday. "They are, without a doubt, rooted in anti-immigrant, white supremacist ideologies."
Two Democrats still in the race also weighed in. Elizabeth Warren described the measure as a "racist, xenophobic Muslim ban." Former Vice President Joe Biden called it "a disgrace."
And Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said Democratic lawmakers would push ahead with a measure to forbid religious discrimination in immigration policy.
Beyond those people who may now never make it across U.S. borders, the new ban could also affect millions who have no plans to travel to the U.S. themselves but may have benefited from the billions of dollars in remittances visa holders send home each year.
The U.S. may also emerge a loser, studies suggest. Nigerians are among the most successful and highly educated immigrants to America. (Trump, demanding to know why immigration policies did not favor people from countries like Norway, once disparaged those from Africa and Haiti, and said Nigerians would never go back to their "huts" if they were allowed in.)
Hadiza Aliyu lives in Borno, the Nigerian state at the epicenter of the Boko Haram crisis that has left tens of thousands dead. But she thought she had found a way out.
Aliyu was preparing to apply to move to the U.S., where she once studied and where her two brothers live.
She was furious when she heard about the extended ban.
"Trump has been looking for a way to get at us Africans for a very long time, and finally got us," Aliyu said. "To hell with Republicans and their supremacist ideas."
Some Nigerians praised Trump for his decision, arguing it might make it more difficult for those responsible for stealing government money back home to find cover in the U.S., and force the country's leaders to be more honest and work harder to develop Nigeria.
In 2018,7,922 immigrant visas were issued to Nigerians. Of these, 4,525 went to the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, and another 2,820 to other family members. An estimated 345,000 people born in Nigeria were living in the U.S. in 2017, according to the Census Bureau.
If the visas are coveted in Nigeria, they are just as prized in African countries like Eritrea, where government repression is rampant and those who try to leave face obstacles and danger. With more than 500,000 refugees living outside the country, Eritrea was the ninth-largest source of refugees in the world in 2018, according to the United Nations, but fewer than 900 Eritreans received immigrant visas to the U.S. that year.
Hie economic consequences of the ban could be far-reaching, experts said.
"Being cut off from the largest economy in the world systematically is problematic," said Nonso Obikili, a Nigerian economist.
The biggest effect, he said, could be on remittances.
Nigerians abroad send home billions of dollars each year, $24 billion in 2018 alone, according to accounting firm PwC. With Nigeria's economy highly dependent on oil and its unemployment rate at 23%, this money provides a lifeline for millions of its citizens.
The new restrictions come at a time when the U.S. says it wants to jockey for power in Africa, particularly through its "Prosper Africa" initiative announced last summer, which aims to double two-way trade and investment.
"If on the one hand you're trying to make a push into Africa, and on the other hand you're barring the largest African country by population from moving to your country, then it does send mixed signals," Obikili said.
In January 2017, Trump's travel ban targeted several other African nations, including Chad, Libya, and Somalia. Chad was later removed from that list, but the executive order halted the plans of thousands of Somali refugees living in camps in Kenya who were about to travel to the U.S. and start new lives.
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, nearly 30,000 Nigerians overstayed their non-immigrant visas in 2018. The number of Nigerians visiting the U.S. dropped sharply after the Trump administration made it harder for visitors to obtain visas last summer.
The new restrictions affect those who want to move to the U.S., not visit it.
Many people from the countries newly targeted by the ban said the uncertainty was the hardest thing to bear. Nwegbe, the newlywed, who works as the chief operating officer of a tourism company that tries to encourage people to visit Africa, said the ban came as she and her husband were building their future.
"We're in limbo and our relationship is suffering," she said. "This is unnecessary hardship."

Texto completo: Google's Black History Month ad, "The Most Searched: A Celebration of Black History Makers," which aired during the Grammy's and was widely celebrated, is an exciting array of images portraying Black excellence.
As an educator and parent, I am thrilled that Google chose to celebrate the accomplishments of prominent Black Americans, and I imagine that by watching their ad, millions will have an opportunity to take in the breathtaking artistry, poetry and intellect that represent the Black American experience.
As I watched, however, I could not help but notice that the pride I felt was tinged with another, less positive emotion. For virtually all of the icons in the 90-second clip, I also could recount examples of how many of these same heroes were pressured into silence - to not use their wisdom, prominence and sense of justice - and not apply systemic critiques of American society and advocate for equality.
Like the dubious advice once offered to Google's "most searched athlete" LeBron James - after he criticized President Donald Trump - prominent African Americans should "shut up and dribble."
I suspect many Black Americans will know the feeling-our talents are often appreciated until we apply those same skills toward advocating for social change.
I often remind people around the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday that the Dr. King - a central focus of Google's "most searched movement" - we remember is a revision of how he was viewed at the time of his assassination.
While we reflect on the image of thousands of peaceful protesters on the National Mall gathered in 1963, we overlook the fact that King was under constant threat of violence and FBI surveillance. His disapproval rating, according to a 1966 Gallup Poll, was in the 60s - primarily because his message toward the end of his life included stronger demands for racial and economic justice; he openly opposed poverty and the Vietnam War.
Maya Angelou, Google's "most searched poet," received savage criticism for her political beliefs, and Serena Williams has regularly been condemned and policed for her appearance and her viewpoints - for example, on how the gender pay gap affects women of color, while white tennis players are rarely called out in such a manner.
Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the iconic Olympians who raised their fists in 1968 to protest racial injustice and who are also the focuses of Google's "most searched movement," were ostracized from the U.S. sporting establishment.
In the ad, these images are triumphant, courageous, but in real life, they came at considerable cost. In the cases of King and Malcolm X - the focus of Google's "most searched autobiography" - it cost them their lives.
In July 2015, Ebony magazine ran an issue with a provocative cover. It read, "America Loves Black People," with the word "Culture" superimposed over "People."
Then Еэопу editor-inchief Kierna Mayo wrote that "America truly loves what it perceives as Black - from baby oil to butts, collard greens to c runk - but actual Black people? Perhaps not so much."
If the rr.ost preeminent and tarrier-breaking Black Americans are scrutinized, savaged and silenced when they speak truth to power - how does this manifest in the lives of ordinary, everyday Black people?
I'm reminded of the recent policing ofyoung Black children, for the length and style of their natural hair - even as journalist and creator of The New York Times' 1619 Project, Nikole Hannah-Jones, tells us that the "avant-garde nature of Elack hairstyles and fashion displays a vibrant reflection of enslaved people's determination to feel fully human through self-expression;" and we learn that these ycung people are excellent, engaged students - their ancestors' wildest creams.
I'm also reminded of how many Black people in professional settings walk on eggs heh s in their workplaces, fearful that if they call out microaggressive climates, they'll be ascribed as the "ang ry Black person." I reflect cn the daily interactions that Black people have with law enforcement and the judicial system, where unwarranted traffic stops can escalate to imprisonment and death.
Seme reading this are protáhly already marshaling counter-arguments. They will likely accuse me of "playing the race card" with these observations. I ask those readers lo consider the words cf legal scholar Michelle Alexander: "Our understanding of racism is therefore shaped by the most extreme expressions cf indiv.dual bigotry, not by the way in which it functions naturally, almost invisibly (and sometimes with genuinely benign intent), when it is embedded in the structure cf a social system."
The widespread policing of Black people's behavior, when white people are often excused or not even noticed for similar actions, is an example of the embedded discrimination of which Alexander speaks.
Those who demonstrate Black excellence often see their accomplishments diminished when they should be celebrated, such as when an Italian gymnast suggested (and later apologized) in 2013 that Simone Biles' world championship was awarded because of her skin color.
Black History Month is a moment for celebration, and Google's impressive campaign should spur national discussion and global admiration. But it should also stir personal reflection.
As Hannah-Jones remarked in the 1619 Project, "'mainstream' society has coveted our style, our slang and our song, seeking to appropriate the one truly American culture as its own." I would add that another feature of this coveting is erasure.

Texto completo: For weeks, Mississippi's prisons have been gripped by crisis. At least a dozen inmates have been slain or have killed themselves, and feuding gangs have forced lockdowns. Images and videos taken on smuggled cellphones have highlighted deteriorating and possibly dangerous conditions, and legislators and activists have asked for federal intervention.
The Justice Department responded to the turmoil Wednesday by announcing a civil rights investigation to explore whether prison officials have done enough to protect inmates from one another; the quality of mental health care and suicide prevention efforts; and the appropriate use of isolation.
In a statement, officials said the inquiry would focus on four prisons controlled by the state's Department of Corrections, including its facility in Parchman, a Mississippi Delta prison notorious for its history of harsh conditions.
The federal investigation follows a burst of violence that began in late December and prompted the lockdown of prisons across the state. Officials attributed the disorder to warring gangs, but the turmoil has underscored the broader troubles plaguing an understaffed prison system as it has descended into chaos.
The situation has become one of the most pressing issues facing Gov. Tate Reeves, the newly elected Republican who took office last month. In the first days of his term, he announced a state investigation into the prisons and plans to find a new corrections commissioner.
His administration said Wednesday that it welcomed the federal inquiry.
"We are grateful that President Trump's administration has taken a focused interest in criminal justice reform and that they care enough about Mississippi to engage on this critical issue," said Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for Reeves.
"As we continue our own investigations," she continued, "we look forward to cooperating with them and working together to right this ship."
The inquiry into Mississippi's Department of Corrections comes after a Justice Department investigation into Alabama's prisons. Federal investigators last year found evidence that Alabama's prisons had violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment, as officials had failed to provide safe conditions for inmates and protect them from violence and sexual abuse.
Critics in Mississippi pressed federal officials to initiate an investigation there after the recent spate of violence, decrying conditions that they described as inhumane and unconstitutional. In a 23-page request, a roster of civil rights groups and elected officials, including Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.,- described "extreme" staff vacancies, as well as a long record of violence, escapes, uprisings, inadequate health care and institutions where criminal gangs are tolerated.
"The Mississippi prison system is in a state of acute and undeniable crisis," the letter said, adding that at one prison, gang members who dominate the kitchen withhold food to punish other prisoners and control who gets a mattress or blanket.
Inmates using illegal cellphones have also sought to bring attention to the conditions in which they are held, sending out photographs of inmates fighting, broken toilets, holes in prison walls, dangling wires and dead rodents caught in sticky traps.
Last month, 29 inmates filed a lawsuit against state officials, describing the recent killings as the "culmination of years of severe understaffing and neglect."
"Plaintiffs' lives are in peril," the lawsuit said, adding that inmates have died as a "direct result of Mississippi's utter disregard for the people it has incarcerated and their constitutional rights."

Gandhi's killer evokes admiration from Indians

Texto completo: MEERUT, India - Under the shade of a banyan tree, a group of worshipers recite Sanskrit mantras. A couple of men step forward and light a fire. Then they start walking, hands folded, as if in a trance, toward a statue.
Some drape flowers over it. Others sing songs of valor to the statue. It is of Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the revered father of Indian independence and a symbol of nonviolent resistance the world over.
Indians consider Gandhi one of the fathers of their nation. But the rise of a Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has uncorked many extremist beliefs, and admiration for Gandhi's killer, among some, has become more open. It is a sign of how much India has changed in the 5½ years since Modi took power.
"Gandhi was a traitor," said Pooja Shakun Pandey, who blames Gandhi for partition and who participated in a recent ceremony worshiping Godse on the anniversary of Gandhi's assassination. "He deserved to be shot in the head."
Prominent Hindu nationalists still invoke Gandhi, but in many cases they are trying to co-opt his legacy - presenting their policies, however divisive, as congruent with his beliefs. One example: a recent citizenship law pushed by Modi's government that, critics say, discriminates against Muslims and threatens the secular state that Gandhi had envisioned.
Other Hindu nationalists, though, continue to overtly vilify the man admired worldwide as an apostle of peace.
The ceremony at the statue venerating his killer, in Meerut, in the north of the country, is not the only sign of respect for Godse in India these days.
Across the country, more than a dozen statues of Gandhi's killer have been erected. Several Hindu temples are being converted into Godse temples.
Last year the government of Uttar Pradesh state, which is led by a firebrand Hindu monk, Yogi Adityanath, proposed changing the name of Meerut to Godse City. One of the first Godse statues was unveiled there about three years ago. Officials now say they have been overwhelmed by demands for more Godse memorials.
Ramachandra Guha, a preeminent biographer of Gandhi, said that fans of Gandhi's killer were no longer a fringe group. Instead, he said, Godse admiration has found a place among what he considers a worryingly large segment of the population.
"It is foul, despicable, but it is real and widespread," Guha said.
In recent months, vandals with links to right-wing groups have defaced pictures of Gandhi, attacked his memorials and scrawled the word traitor on his picture. In June last year, a statue of Gandhi was decapitated in eastern India.
The growing cult around Godse seems rooted in the same militant brand of Hindu nationalism that inspired Gandhi's killer to shoot him on a mildly cold January evening in 1948.
That day, Gandhi walked slowly across a stately lawn in New Delhi, India's capital, leaning on the shoulders of two young women. Godse stepped out from a crowd, greeted him and touched his feet. He then pulled out a Beretta and shot the frail 78-year-old three times in the upper body.
Godse was born in a small village in central India to an upper-caste family. Three of their older sons died from an unknown illness. Thinking it would protect their new child to treat him as a girl, they pierced the young Godse's nose and made him wear a nose ring until they had another son.
For wearing the nose ring, Godse was called Nathuram, meaning a man with pierced nose.
When he was a young man, Godse joined the RSS, a Hindu nationalist group that many members of India's governing party, including Modi, have been part of.
Godse believed Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims and by allowing Pakistan to break off during the partition of India in 1947. That line is still echoed by many Hindu nationalists who see Godse as a national hero and Gandhi as a traitor.
Technology has helped spread the revisionist attitude toward Godse.
The availability of cheap data in much of the countryside has helped create an ecosystem of disinformation in which it is difficult to sift facts from fiction. WhatsApp messages shared widely in rural areas say that if Godse had not killed Gandhi, India would have fallen apart as the Soviet Union did. Other messages call Gandhi a womanizer.
Public meetings eulogizing Gandhi's killer are also used to spread lies and justify the murder.
Amit Jaiswal Jain, an advertising professional in the town of Agra, believes Godse is a hero because he tried to stop Gandhi's push for India to help the newly formed Pakistan.
"Gandhi should be respected," Jain, 38, said. "But the new India should not tolerate the castigation of Godse."

Texto completo: Headnote Golf course architect Joseph Bartholomew is remembered
As an African-American youngster - as young as 7-years-old, some say - Joseph Bartholomew caddied in the afternoons at the private, whites-only Audubon Park Club golf course in New Orleans, earning $3 a day. There he learned the game by watching the men whose bags he bore on his shoulders.
Bartholomew prided himself on his caddying skills, particularly in finding errant shots.
"It distracts a golf player to lose his ball," he was quoted as saying in the reference book "African-American Business Leaders: A Biographical Dictionary" (1994). "I never lost one golf ball a year."
Audubon's club professional, Freddie McLeod, who would go on to win the 1908 U.S. Open, taught Joseph how to repair clubs and eventually offered him a job.
The catch?
"He told me," Bartholomew later recalled, "T can't give you $3, just 50 cents."'
Most people wouldn't dare take such a pay cut, or such a risk. But, Bartholomew said: "I figured I can learn more from Mr. McLeod than I can as a caddie. So, I took it."
Learn, the young man did.
Bartholomew would one day become the greens superintendent and give lessons - as many as 12 per day at $2 per lesson. And beyond that he would become an admired golf course designer.
But it would take decades for him to get to that point. And through it all - as he rose from caddie to club repairman to superintendent to course designer - Bartholomew, a Black man in the Jim Crow South, was barred from playing at Audubon or any other segregated private club, even those whose courses he designed.
Joseph Manuel Bartholomew was born on Aug. 1, 1888, in New Orleans to Manuel and Alice Bartholomew. He was ambitious from a young age. He once asked a teacher if there would be any objection to his completing two grades in one year. "She said no," he told Sports Illustrated in 1966, "so I went ahead and skipped."
Bartholomew was in his 30s, in the early 1920s, when local golfers, impressed with his interest in the game and his work as a groundskeeper, collaborated to send him to a golf architecture school in New York, where he studied with the golf course architect Seth Raynor.
"Whooo, but I was surprised," Bartholomew told Fortune magazine in 1949. "They gave me a whole bunch of money and told me to go and find the best course in the world and bring it back."
He did even better, returning with the design for a course composed of holes modeled on famous ones at courses throughout the United States and Scotland.
The golfers liked it, and hired him to build it. Opening in the '20s, it was called Metairie County Club, and he was named its first club professional. But while he was permitted to give lessons, he was not allowed to play a round of golf there. Indeed, he was hired to design and build several more golf courses in the area for white golfers but barred from playing them.
Undeterred, he eventually built a seven-hole course on property he owned in Harahan, Louisiana, a Mississippi River town west of New Orleans. And in Pontchartrain Park in New Orleans he built Louisiana's first municipal golf course for African Americans.
By the time he died on Oct. 12,1971, at 83, Bartholomew had been celebrated as a golf course architect by Sports Illustrated. In 1972, he was posthumously elected into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. And in 1979, the City of New Orleans renamed its Pontchartrain Park golf course the Joseph M. Bartholomew Sr. Municipal Golf Course.
After building his courses, Bartholomew rented his construction equipment to white contractors. And just as he had learned golf by watching the players he caddied for, he learned the construction business by observing, on the job, the men who had rented his equipment.
Working with, and not just for, white men was unusual for Black men in the South, but Bartholomew had become accustomed to it. "Don't try to outsmart the white folks - they're smart," he told Fortune. "Be honest, listen and learn."
And make money. Bartholomew started his own construction enterprise, focusing on drainage, foundations and landscaping. He landed contracts with large public and private housing projects in New Orleans, as well as for office buildings and factories.
He didn't stop there. He invested contracting profits in a fledgling life insurance company named for Frederick Douglass. It was losing money when he bought it in 1940 and took over as president. Nine years later it was thriving, headquartered in a building that Bartholomew had bought.
Bartholomew turned his attention to real estate full time when a man for whom he once caddied came to him to be a partner on a land-improvement venture. They bought hundreds of acres of rough land and, using Bartholomew's equipment, drained and upgraded the property. They then sold it, with some parcels going for more than 10 times what they had paid.
In what may have been Bartholomew's ultimate venture, he built an ice cream plant for $75,000. By 1949, it was raking in profits.
Bartholomew rarely saw a risk that wasn't worth taking, and he told Fortune he believed that had been the key to his success.
"That's the difference between me and most of the rest of the colored people," he said. "They won't take a chance because they've been skinned before. I take 'em all the time."

What Kobe Bryant's Passing

Texto completo: Headnote Reminds Us....
LOS ANGELES, Calif. - As the world reacted to the news of 41-year-old retired Laker Kobe Bean Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna Maria-On-ore's demise, we want to take time to reflect on the impact Mr. Bryant made on not only the game of basketball but people, including youth world-wide.
Before I go on, it would be remiss to not send our heartfelt condolences to Kobe's wife, Ms. Vanessa Laine Bryant, her three surviving children, and the entire Bryant family, including Kobe's parents and siblings, along with his mother-in-law.
We also extend our deepest condolences to the Altobelli, Chester, Mauser and Zobayan families who also tragically lost their loved ones as passengers aboard the helicopter flight that fatally crashed in Calabasas, California on Jan. 26, 2020.
Kobe Bryant was, for many years, Mr. Los Angeles Lakers. And while I personally was not a fan before his retirement (I'm more of an 8o's Lakers, Shaq, and LeBron fan), I truly came to respect the man who was, in the eyes of many men in my family including my husband and nephew, a true champion.
It's for that reason alone that I fondly remember sucking up my own pride after returning from Hajj and taking my nephew, Malik downtown to the Lakers' victory parade in front of the Staples Center.
Although that NBA back-to-back championship sweep in 2009 and 2010 seemed so long ago, it will forever be a treasured memory and opportunity for Malik to Insha'Allah share with his kids and grandkids.
That he celebrated these victories with his favorite player of all-time, Kobe Bryant, and all the other Lakers on those sunny days in LA. Kobe won a total of five NBA Championship rings, two World Olympic gold medals and an Oscar for his Best Animated Short film entitled Dear Basketball.
Regardless of Kobe's somewhat controversial past, he was without a shadow of a doubt, a man whom many in his family, including his wife and longtime friends, including Shaquille O'Neal, publicly forgave. Most importantly, he openly apologized and forgave himself.
When we look at Kobe the athlete, we know that he infamously modeled discipline and work ethic in the game of basketball. Drafted at the age of 17-years-old, Kobe a trailblazer in his own right, knew that many young men and women would try to follow in his footsteps by foregoing college to head straight into the NBA.
Few people can take such a risk. To do so, one must be committed to putting in intense practice for near-perfect results; ultimately, placing the sport to a level of sacrifice that most of us are unwilling to make.
Mr. Bryant mastered this and, perhaps, it's this high-level dedication that made him exceptionally special. Actually, it made Kobe legendary.
Mr. Kobe Bryant marketed his successful brand and used it as an example for youth all over the globe.
The notion of mentally focusing and physically working hard with the determination to do your ultimate best in achieving anything was truly Kobe's signature motto.
It's no wonder he and Nike had the perfect partnership to 'Just Do It'.
From arriving at the court for practice at 5 a.m. in high school to infamously advising others on how he wakes up daily at 4 a.m. to begin his day pre and post
Lakers' career days, Mr. Bryant was known for his impeccable work ethics.
Kobe even instilled this admirable work ethic into his own children, including his oldest daughter Natalia and second to the eldest, Gianna who aspired to be like her father and one-day play for the WNBA.
In Kobe's own words as told to author Lewis Howes on an episode of The School of Greatness, "Your kids can't see how hard you work. You go to the office. I come to the studio [Granity]. They don't really see the effort.
"So how can we teach our children what it means to work hard? You do it through training.... When I get up in the morning [to exercise], my daughter [Natalia] goes with me. She goes with me efore school and it becomes a daddy-daughter thing. Through that process, she understands the value of hard work."
We will never get the opportunity to watch 13-year-old Gianna play at UCONN, the college she aspired to attend or know if she would become the next Lisa Leslie, Candace Parker, Sheryl Swoopes or for that matter, break barriers and be Gianna Bryant playing in the NBA.
Sorrowfully, what we do know is that Gianna will be missed by her family, friends, schoolmates, and teammates from Mamba Sports Academy, the training center that her beloved father founded.
We also remember her father, Mr. Kobe Bryant. Kobe will not see his remaining daughters, including his toddler and infant girls, grow into young women nor will he experience the thrill of being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
He'll be unable to witness his second YA novel, The Wizenard Series: Season One soar to the top of the New York Times #1 Bestselling Book List in perhaps a matter of hours. However, Kobe will know that belief and good deeds are priceless.
Both Kobe and Gianna, who were Catholic, attended early morning mass just before boarding the helicopter on Sunday morning.
Kobe left lasting examples of kindness, including tweeting Lebron James on surpassing his scoring record the night before this tragedy.
Remarkably, Kobe checked in on Shaq's son just hours before his passing as well. Acts of kindness that will forever symbolize the impact Kobe had on so many of us on and off the court.
The passing of a high-level icon like Kobe reminds us that: None of us knows the time in which we will leave this earth but what we must do, like Kobe Bryant and most importantly our beloved Prophet Muhammad (saw), is to be mindful of our words and actions, be kind to our family members and others.
"For every soul shall taste death." (Surah Ali-Imran, Ayat 185).
As I began, one may ask why I wasn't a fan of Kobe's - after all, I am from LA. where he was and will always be viewed as the modern-day Lakers King.
Well, like many women, my lists of reasons were long.
Whether it was his perceived defiance in marrying a young teenager from Fullerton (whom he appeared to have truly loved for over 20 years) versus marrying a young lady his parents preferred, his open "dissing" of Shaq back in the day or his marital infidelity along with allegations and charges of assault against a young woman that would be later dropped.
One thing my husband who is a Muslim Chaplain reminded me of is that in our religion, we must refrain from harsh judgments unless it is proven.
Furthermore, to talk about or in my case, continue to talk about Kobe's faults is backbiting.
He reminded me of when Abu Huraira narrated that Allah's messenger, Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H) asked:
'"Do you know what is meant by backbiting?' The Companions said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He (SAW) said, 'To say something about your brother [sister] which he [she] dislikes.'
"One asked, 'Even if what I say is true about my brother?' He (SAW) replied, If such defects you say are true about him, then you have backbitten him. And if he doesn't have what you say, then you have committed slander against him.'" (Muslim, Abu Dawood, and Tirmidhi).

Bagel and lox at Cedar Street Bagel Co. in Camas.

Bagel flavors range from traditional
plain, salt, egg, onion and poppy seed to more unusual options.

Cedar Street Bagel Co. uses age-old technique without magical water
It's commonly believed that New York water is required to make a good bagel. Jewish folklore is filled with stories of magic water and talking fishes. They sound ridiculous to a modern audience. Yet some still believe. The New York Times covered a story about a 20-pound carp that spoke Hebrew in a fish market. You won't find that type of hocus-pocus in this column — at least not this week.
Making a true New York-style bagel with its crisp, shiny exterior and chewy interior does require water, because bagels are traditionally boiled and then baked. As long as it's boiled, that water can come from the Hudson River or the Columbia River. Cedar Street Bagel Co. in downtown Camas makes New York-style bagels using age-old techniques without any kind of magical New York water.
The bagels start with frozen dough pucks from Seattle Bagel Bakery at Pike Place Market in Seattle. Like most bagel shops in the area, the kitchen at Cedar Street doesn't have space for dough making. Amber Owens, manager of Cedar Street Bagel Co., searched for places to get bagel dough. When she met with Seattle Bagel Bakery owner A.J. Ghambari and toured his bakery, she knew she'd found her dough as well as a bagel mentor.
The bagels sitting in bins in the glass case are the type found at shops in New York or any Jewish community in the United States, but with some updates.
At very old-school bagel places, you'll find plain, everything, salt, egg, pumpernickel, onion, poppy seed and maybe cinnamon raisin bagels. Cedar Street includes these flavors along with less traditional options: pizza, jalapeno, French toast and wild everything (everything bagel with cheddar cheese). All bagels are $2 each.
Cream cheese flavors vary from plain to savory options (such as jalapeno or pesto) and sweet spreads (such as maple nut or cranberry orange). Prices range from $1.50 for 2 ounces to $8.95 for 16 ounces. Wild sockeye salmon spread is $5 for 2 ounces.
Gluten-free and vegan meals appear on the menu, which is divided into breakfast and lunch meals (both are available from 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.). The breakfast bagels are variations on a bagel with egg, cheese and meat, but also include the classic bagel and lox with cream cheese, lox, capers, pickled red onions and cucumbers. The lunch sandwiches, served on your choice of bagel, are roast beef, turkey cranberry, veggie (pesto cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, cucumber and microgreens), vegan (vegan chicken salad, vegan mayo, lettuce, tomato, red onion, celery and cucumber), and a Reuben on a pumpernickel bagel.
Bagel-free items such as egg and avocado, egg bake, yogurt parfait, chicken tortilla soup and a winter spinach salad also grace the menu.
Teas with names such as Bluebird Morning and Dream Catcher from Flying Bird Botanicals of Bellingham come in triangular silk bags to bob in a mug of hot water.
Coffee comes from local roaster Nine Bar Coffee Roasters. If you're interested in some morning libations, order a brunch-friendly adult beverage such as Prosecco, mimosas or beer.
Opening a New York-style bagel and sandwich place in downtown Camas is a dream realized for Marcie and Jeramy Wilcox. When this space opened up, near their coffee shop, Squeeze and Grind, they renovated it to create the perfect spot to grab a bag of bagels and a container of cream cheese or sit and chat with friends over a cup of hot tea and a french toast bagel with cinnamon vanilla cream cheese.

Rep. Golden endorses Michael Bennet for president

Texto completo: The 2nd District congressman is supporting Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who is seen as unlikely to win the Democratic nomination and is not on the primary ballot in Maine.

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is endorsing Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet for president, an underdog candidate who is not on the ballot for the Democratic primary in Maine.
“While many candidates blame the current president for our broken politics, Michael Bennet honestly identifies the challenges facing our democracy as decades old and going nowhere unless we commit to revitalize the good in our democracy and reform the worst,” Golden said in a statement Thursday.
The endorsement was first reported by Politico.
Golden, a first-term congressman who is also up for election this fall, said in the statement he is supporting Bennet because he is “committed to fighting corruption and putting an end to an era dominated by big money in politics.”
“Most importantly, after years of divisive leadership from Washington, Michael Bennet is committed to leading this country by example toward a more unified and thoughtful future,” he said.
The National Republican Congressional Committee criticized Golden for the endorsement, with spokesman Michael McAdams saying in a statement, “Jared Golden’s endorsement of Michael Bennet makes it clear he supports giving illegal immigrants free health care at the expense of Maine voters, and in a district Trump won by 10 that’s a big problem.”
Bennet joined with nine other Democratic presidential candidates at a July 2019 debate and expressed support for allowing undocumented immigrants to have access to government-funded health care programs. In his response to a June 2019 health care policy survey by the New York Times, Bennet said undocumented immigrants should be able to purchase insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange.
Presidential candidates in Maine were required to submit at least 2,000 signatures of registered voters who are enrolled in their party to the Secretary of State by Dec. 23 in order to appear on the March primary ballot. Bennet is not among the 12 candidates who qualified.
In a tweet Thursday, he thanked Golden for the support saying, “Grateful to have the endorsement of (Golden) — a frontline House member who knows what it takes to win in an Obama-Trump district.”

Democrats threw all they had at Trump - he's still standing Far from making their case for removing the president, they've convinced more people to re-elect him.

Texto completo: Democrats' drive to impeach and remove President Trump was destined to fail. But more than fail, it has backfired on them - strengthening Trump for the 2020 campaign and increasing his odds of winning a second term.
First, impeachment appears to have raised Trump's approval rating to the highest point of his presidency. In mid-October, just before the House impeachment hearings began, Trump's Gallup approval rating was just 39 percent - a few points above his all-time low. This week, as his Senate trial wound up, Gallup reported that Trump's approval has risen a 10 full points to 49 percent - his all-time personal best. The share of Americans who want Trump removed has plummeted. In October, a 52 percent majority of Americans supported his removal; today, a 52 percent majority opposes it. For Democrats, this is the very definition of failure.
Far from advancing their case for removing Trump, Democrats have convinced more Americans that he deserves a second term. Before the 2018 midterms that put Democrats in control of the House, just 41 percent of the country said Trump should be re-elected; today, after the Democratic House's failed impeachment effort, 50 percent want to give him four more years. Since impeachment began, Trump's standing with the voters has improved by almost every measure.
Second, impeachment has energized Trump's base. According to Gallup, the president's approval among Republicans is now a record 94 percent - up 6 percentage points since January. The more Democrats tried to take him down, the more Republicans have united behind the president.
Third, the failure of their impeachment drive has dispirited the Democratic base. An Associated Press poll finds that just 33 percent of Democrats are excited about the 2020 election. At the Iowa caucuses, where Democratic voters had their first chance to show their enthusiasm for replacing Trump, turnout was a dismal 170,000 - a 30 percent decline from 2008, when 240,000 Iowans turned out to give Barack Obama his first presidential primary victory.
Fourth, impeachment has put moderate House Democrats in grave peril. A New York Times/Sienna College poll recently found that almost two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, but then voted for House Democrats in 2018, plan to back Trump again in 2020. That's bad news for the 31 House Democrats elected in Trump districts in the midterms. How many people are going to vote to give Trump a second term and vote for the Democrats who tried to take away their right to do so? Not many.
Fifth, impeachment forced Democrats to unlock the legislative floodgates and give Trump major victories. Democrats knew that voters saw them focusing on impeachment at the expense of getting things done, so as they voted to approve articles of impeachment, they also voted to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump's tax bill that repealed three Obamacare taxes, and Trump's $738 billion defense spending bill that created his Space Force and enacted his parental leave policy for federal workers, without restricting his use of defense dollars to build a border wall. The effect was the opposite of what Democrats intended, creating the impression that while Democrats were busy impeaching, Trump was busy governing.
Finally, impeachment has helped Trump raise an enormous war chest. In the last three months of 2019 - the period during which the House conducted its impeachment inquiry - Trump raised $46 million, giving him $102.7 million in the bank. The Senate trial will likely have a similar impact on his fundraising in the first quarter of 2020. Impeachment energized not only Republican voters, but also Republican donors.
And the Democrats' self-inflicted wounds keep coming. During Trump's State of the Union address, the House impeachment managers sat together in the chamber, sullen and stone-faced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., broke protocol and refused to utter the traditional words of introduction - "it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce the president of the United States" - and then dramatically tore up Trump's address on national television when he concluded. The image Democrats projected to the country was that of a bunch of sore losers.
Trump now goes into the 2020 election strengthened and emboldened - the first president in U.S. history to carry an impeachment acquittal into a general election. For three years, Democrats threw everything they had at Trump. They accused him of bribery, extortion, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress, abuse of power, conspiracy and even treason. Three years later, he's still standing - and thanks to impeachment, he may still be standing after the dust settles in November.

"While many candidates blame the current president for our broken politics, Michael Bennet honestly identifies the challenges facing our democracy as decades old and going nowhere unless we commit to revitalize the good in our democracy and reform the worst," Golden said in a statement Thursday.
The endorsement was first reported by Politico.
Golden, a first-term congressman who is up for reelection this fall, said in the statement that he is supporting Bennet because he is "committed to fighting corruption and putting an end to an era dominated by big money in politics."
"Most importantly, after years of divisive leadership from Washington, Michael Bennet is committed to leading this country by example toward a more unified and thoughtful future," he said.
The National Republican Congressional Committee criticized Golden for the endorsement, with spokesman Michael McAdams saying in a statement, "Jared Golden's endorsement of Michael Bennet makes it clear he supports giving illegal immigrants free health care at the expense of Maine voters, and in a district Trump won by 10 that's a big problem."
Bennet appeared with nine other Democratic presidential candidates at a July 2019 debate and expressed support for allowing undocumented immigrants to have access to government-funded health care programs. In his response to a June 2019 health care policy survey by the New York Times, Bennet said undocumented immigrants should be able to purchase insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange.
Presidential candidates in Maine were required to submit at least 2,000 signatures of registered voters enrolled in their party to the secretary of state by Dec. 23 in order to appear on the March primary ballot. Bennet is not among the 12 candidates who qualified.
In a tweet Thursday, he thanked Golden for the support saying, "Grateful to have the endorsement of (Golden) - a frontline House member who knows what it takes to win in an Obama-Trump district."

Texto completo: BOSTON — The New England First Amendment Coalition Friday honored Hearst Connecticut Media with its 2020 Michael Donoghue Freedom of Information Award for stories on sexual abuse cases tied to Boys & Girls Clubs across the country.
The FOI Award is presented annually to New England journalists who protect or advance the public’s right to know under federal or state law.
A team of seven journalists at Hearst Connecticut spent more than six months digging through 1,600 pages of public documents and filing more than 100 public record requests. They found more than 100 cases of abuse involving 280 victims in 31 states over the course of 70 years tied to Boys & Girls Clubs of America affiliates.
“Our commitment to holding a national organization to a standard that ensure safety for children remains strong, and it’s an honor to be recognized for the important journalism work of making public information accessible,” said Lisa Yanick Litwiller, the lead editor on the investigation.
The Hearst staff used the documents it obtained to create a public database that allows parents sending a child to a local Boys & Girls Club to look up information about incidents and how they were handled by the organization.
“This work was a testament to the expertise and unwavering determination with which this team of adept journalists carried out this vitally important investigation,” said Wendy Metcalfe, VP of content and editor-in-chief for Hearst Connecticut. “We are deeply honored by this award.”
As a result of the reporting, Boys & Girls Clubs of America — which oversees 4,600 local affiliates — announced it will hire a third-party firm to review how it responds to complaints related to abuse and will provide additional safety training to its staff. Another youth organization also announced it would end all overnight visits between children and mentors as a result of Hearst Connecticut’s investigation into Boys & Girls Clubs.
Hearst Connecticut staff members who worked on the project — Litwiller and reporters Hannah Dellinger, Viktoria Sundqvist, Meghan Friedmann, Peter Yankowski, Humberto J. Rocha and Tatiana Flowers — were honored at NEFAC’s 10th annual awards luncheon at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel. During the luncheon, A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, was honored with the Stephen Hamblett First Amendment Award.
Previous recipients of the FOI Award are the Hartford Courant (2019); Todd Wallack of The Boston Globe (2018); The Sun Journal in Lewiston, Maine (2017); Jenifer McKim of the New England Center for Investigative Reporting (2016); James W. Foley (posthumously), the war correspondent and New Hampshire native killed by the Islamic State (2015); Brent Curtis of the Rutland Herald in Vermont (2014); and Don Stacom of the Hartford Courant (2013).

Texto completo: Throughout its 108-year existence, L.L. Bean has never appeared on a runway. Until now.
The Maine company will be featured as part of designer Todd Snyder's fall men's wear show during New York Fashion Week, according to the New York Times.
L.L. Bean has previously worked with capital F fashion, according to the Times, and in 2018 collaborated with Maine breweries for special edition boots.
More than a decade ago, Alex Carlton -- who has been considered one of the country's best new men's wear designers -- was hired to revitalize L.L. Bean's image, the Times reported.
"I thought putting a shawl collar on the Norwegian sweater was about as far as things could go," Lisa Birnbach, who wrote "The Official Preppy Handbook," told the New York Times.
"I mean, are they fashion or are they gear," Birnbach also said.
In 2018, the company dropped its unlimited return policy, citing fraud. Later that year, L.L. Bean didn't provide bonuses for its employees for the first time in a decade and announced job cuts. In 2019, net revenue was up 1 percent, so the outdoors company reinstated its bonuses.

Texto completo: Colby College has put up some students who returned from a recent trip to China at a Waterville hotel, isolating the students as a precautionary measure against coronavirus even though none has shown symptoms, according to the college and Waterville police.
State public health officials said the students pose no added public health risk, and they never required that Colby isolate the students, said Robert Long, a spokesman for the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
There are no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection in Maine, and the risk of contracting the infection is low, Long said. No one in Maine has been tested for the novel coronavirus because no one in the state has met the criteria to be tested, he said.
"None of the individuals in isolation have any symptoms of the virus, and they are being monitored per CDC guidelines," a statement from the college said. "They were isolated based on public health guidance for those returning from mainland China and out of an abundance of caution for the safety and wellbeing of the Colby and local communities."
Maine CDC is aware of the students being housed in the hotel, Long said.
"We have assessed the situation and determined that the students pose no added public health risk," he said. "Maine CDC did not mandate this decision and was not consulted before the alternative housing was provided."
However, the public health agency has been in touch with the college to provide guidance and answer questions since learning of the situation.
The Waterville police and fire departments are working with Colby to keep an eye on the situation, according to a statement from police Chief Joseph Massey.
The death toll from the respiratory illness that originated in Wuhan, China, is at least 636, and the total number of confirmed cases is 31,161, The New York Times reported Friday. The World Health Organization has declared the illness a global health emergency.

VA Secretary Looked for Dirt on a House Staffer Who Reported Sexual Assault in a VA Hospital, Complaint Says

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie personally sought damaging information about a congressional aide who said she was sexually assaulted in a VA hospital, according to an anonymous complaint to the House committee the woman works for.
The written complaint was obtained by ProPublica. In addition, a former senior official with direct knowledge of the matter said Wilkie discussed damaging information he collected about the aide and suggested using it to discredit her. Another person said he spoke with other officials who were in those discussions, and they corroborated the former senior official’s and the written complaint’s account. The people interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation.
Wilkie denied inquiring into the aide’s past. “I never would do that to a fellow officer,” he said in a statement. “It is a breach of honor.”
The aide, Andrea Goldstein, is a Navy reserve intelligence officer and a senior policy adviser for the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee’s Women Veterans Task Force. In September, she said she was sexually assaulted at the VA medical center in Washington. According to Goldstein’s account reported in The New York Times, she was buying a snack in the cafeteria when a man slammed his body into hers, pressed against her and told her, “You look like you could use a good time.” Goldstein said she did not know who the man was, but he was not an employee.
As required by VA regulations, Goldstein’s allegation was turned over to the department’s inspector general to conduct an independent criminal investigation, working with federal prosecutors.
But the complaint alleges that while the inspector general and prosecutors investigated Goldstein’s allegation, Wilkie initiated what the complaint described as “his own investigation into Ms. Goldstein’s credibility and military record.”
The House committee said it is considering how to respond to the complaint, spokeswoman Jenni Geurink said. While the committee has oversight jurisdiction over the VA and often fields complaints from employees and patients, it is in an unusual position since this complaint relates to one of its staff members.
“We have been contacted about possible actions taken within VA which may have utilized government time and resources to attempt to tarnish a member of our staff’s character, discredit her and spread false information about her past in retaliation for her reporting of a sexual assault at VA,” Geurink said. “This ordeal has been draining and unfair to Ms. Goldstein.”
According to the complaint and the former senior official, Wilkie repeatedly shared the information he had gathered about Goldstein with his senior staff, including officials responsible for public relations, between October 2019 and January 2020. One of the officials present, Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs James E. Hutton, did not respond to requests for comment.
“Wilkie’s energies are directed toward attacking her character,” the complaint said.
Wilkie did not specify the source of his information but said he wished his findings could be used to undermine Goldstein’s account of the assault in the Washington VA, the complaint and the former senior official said. While Wilkie did not direct anyone to do anything with the information, he wondered aloud about how it might become public, according to the complaint and the former senior official.
Wilkie, through a spokeswoman, denied saying that.
Wilkie also met in his office with Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, who is a former Navy commando. After the meeting, Wilkie told his staff that Crenshaw agreed with the allegations that Wilkie made about Goldstein’s credibility, according to the complaint, the former senior official and the other person with knowledge of the meeting.
Wilkie denied discussing Goldstein with Crenshaw. Crenshaw, in a brief interview in the Capitol, confirmed that he met with Wilkie. “I had breakfast with him once,” Crenshaw said. “I know where this rumor’s coming from. So you have a bunch of Democrat staffers who are leading you guys down a really stupid path. I’ve never been asked about the case, never been told about the case.”
Wilkie and his staff have not publicized the information he collected about Goldstein’s past. But after the inspector general concluded its investigation and federal prosecutors declined to bring charges, Wilkie sent a Jan. 15 letter to Congress calling Goldstein’s complaint “unsubstantiated” and saying it “could deter our veterans from seeking the care they need and deserve.”
Wilkie’s letter prompted an objection from the VA’s inspector general, Michael Missal, who said calling Goldstein’s allegations “unsubstantiated” was “not an accurate description of the results of our investigation.” The Times reported that the criminal probe was hindered because video cameras that might have captured the incident at the hospital weren’t working.
“Neither I nor my staff told you or anyone else that the allegations were unsubstantiated,” Missal wrote to Wilkie. “Reaching a decision to close the investigation with no criminal charges does not mean the underlying allegation is unsubstantiated.”
Goldstein, in an op-ed published Monday on the website Jezebel, criticized Wilkie, saying that his letter to Congress was retaliation for her reporting the assault and that she had also faced retaliation from a military commander when she reported sexual harassment while on active duty. She said she receives treatment at the VA for conditions related to sexual trauma during her military service.
“He used coded language, but the words still stung,” Goldstein wrote. “The Secretary of the second largest federal agency knew how his words would resonate. He was implying that a fellow Navy veteran was a liar. He was implying that I was a liar.”
Asked about the subject at a post-State of the Union press conference on Wednesday, Wilkie said he was “not satisfied with the resolution of the Goldstein case” and wants to reexamine it.
“I met with the [inspector general] yesterday,” he said. “We’re going to make a renewed push to get answers.”
But the inspector general’s office later said the investigation remains closed. “We are not working with anyone to seek additional information at this time,” a spokesman said.
A spokeswoman for Wilkie later clarified that he wasn’t asking to reopen the investigation but wants to receive more details of the inspector general’s findings. “At a minimum, the IG should let VA and committee leaders know if its investigation found any wrongdoing so the department can take action to protect and safeguard our patients,” VA press secretary Christina Mandreucci said. “We need this help to make sure our facilities are safe.”

Dems threw all they had at Trump. He’s still standing.

Texto completo: Democrats’ drive to impeach and remove President Trump was destined to fail. But more than fail, it has backfired on them — strengthening Trump for the 2020 campaign and increasing his odds of winning a second term.
First, impeachment appears to have raised Trump’s approval rating to the highest point of his presidency. In mid-October, just before the House impeachment hearings began, Trump’s Gallup approval rating was just 39 percent — a few points above his all-time low. This week, as his Senate trial wound up, Gallup reported that Trump’s approval has risen a 10 full points to 49 percent — his all-time personal best.
Far from advancing their case for removing Trump, Democrats have convinced more Americans that he deserves a second term. Before the 2018 midterms that put Democrats in control of the House, just 41 percent of the country said Trump should be reelected; today, after the Democratic House’s failed impeachment effort, 50 percent want to give him four more years.
Second, impeachment has energized Trump’s base. According to Gallup, the president’s approval among Republicans is now a record 94 percent — up 6 percentage points since January.
Third, the failure of their impeachment drive has dispirited the Democratic base.
An Associated Press poll finds that just 33 percent of Democrats are excited about the 2020 election. At the Iowa caucuses, where Democratic voters had their first chance to show their enthusiasm for replacing Trump, turnout was a dismal 170,000 — a 30 percent decline from 2008.
Fourth, impeachment has put moderate House Democrats in grave peril. A New York Times/Sienna College poll recently found that almost two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, but then voted for House Democrats in 2018, plan to back Trump again in 2020.
Fifth, impeachment forced Democrats to unlock the legislative floodgates and give Trump major victories. Democrats knew that voters saw them focusing on impeachment at the expense of getting things done, so as they voted to approve articles of impeachment, they also voted to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump’s tax bill that repealed three Obamacare taxes, and Trump’s $738 billion defense spending bill that created his Space Force and enacted his parental leave policy for federal workers, without restricting his use of defense dollars to build a border wall. The impression was that while Democrats were busy impeaching, Trump was busy governing.
Finally, impeachment has helped Trump raise an enormous war chest. In the last three months of 2019 — the period during which the House conducted its impeachment inquiry — Trump raised $46 million, giving him $102.7 million in the bank.
And the Democrats’ self-inflicted wounds keep coming. During Trump’s State of the Union address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., dramatically tore up Trump’s address on national television when he concluded. The image Democrats projected to the country was that of a bunch of sore losers.
Trump now goes into the 2020 election strengthened and emboldened. Thanks to impeachment, he may still be standing after the dust settles in November.

Texto completo: The Palm Beach County School Board wants to pursue a policy to prohibit discrimination — hair discrimination.
Board member Debra Robinson initiated the conversation at a meeting Wednesday, saying she was particularly troubled by the story roughly a year ago of a New Jersey teen who tearfully stood at a wrestling match as his dreadlocks were cut rather than forfeit his opportunity to compete.
Similar stories abound, including that of a Louisiana sixth-grader who was kicked out of her school after she was told her hairstyle “did not align with school policy,”
according to The New York Times.
Robinson said she is “definitely not aware that it’s happened in Palm Beach County,” but she wanted the board to make sure it never does.
A Central Florida lawmaker is making the same case to his colleagues. State Sen. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, has filed a bill that would outlaw discrimination based on race-associated hairstyles and textures. Senate Bill 566 is known as the CROWN Act, an acronym for “Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural” hair act.
For years, black people of all ages have been turned away from jobs and schools on the basis of the texture and style of their hair. But in the past year, several states and cities have moved to ban policies that penalize people of color for wearing braids, dreadlocks, natural curls and other looks that reflect their heritage and cultural identity.
New York and California have enacted laws banning race- based hair discrimination. Five other states and a handful of local governments are seeking to do the same, reports USA Today.
Board members agreed they want to act regardless of what happens at the state level and asked staff to come back with a plan to amend the board’s anti-discrimination policies to address hair discrimination directly.
“I was fired up about this too,” said board member Erica Whitfield. “This has happened across the country. As a person who spent a long time growing her hair out, I can’t imagine how upsetting that would be. We should do it.”
“It needs to be etched in stone,” said board member Marcia Andrews.

Immigrants faced with discriminatory system

Texto completo: The government has been sending a clear message: Immigrants and refugees are not welcome!
Immigration has reached its breaking point, and changes need to be made. Statistics have shown an increase in immigration since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965, which, according to a Pew Research Center article, “created a new system favoring family reunification and skilled immigrants, rather than country quotas.”
According to Jynnah Radford of the Pew Research Center, immigrants now make up 13.6% of the U.S. population.
Recently, however, President Donald Trump has been making changes to the system — changes that affect the lives of many and leave no escape for the millions of refugees trapped in a seemingly never-ending legal cycle.
President Trump has been pushing back against immigration since his campaign, proposing the expansion of a wall between the United States and Mexico. Even with stricter rules, in 2018 a caravan of over 1,000 people attempted to enter the United States. In response to this, the Trump administration enacted a zero-tolerance policy, prosecuting any immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. Since then, the government has imposed stricter asylum rules, taken children away from their families and reduced the number of people allowed to apply for refugee status.
The conditions in which migrants are being detained are not sanitary. Two migrant children died in December 2018 in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody. People sleep in Mylar blankets to try and stay warm in detention centers. The United States needs to figure out a safer and more welcoming way to aid desperate migrants.
According to Michael Shear of The New York Times, the president now is aiming to change immigration into a merit-based system. Backed by White House adviser Stephen Miller, the plan would favor skilled people and try to reduce the number of people who need federal aid. This would mean immigrants could no longer enter the U.S. just because they have relatives and it would shut down the American dream. More deportations could also cause an economic issue as some immigrants perform the physical and unwanted jobs that boost the economy.
However, it would never be possible for the United States to open their doors to every immigrant. There must be a legal system in place that can control the influx of migrants. Without legal control, the already overflowing system would collapse into chaos. People would begin entering the United States without the correct paperwork, sanitary conditions in detention centers would decrease, and unemployment could increase.
The immigration system needs to be changed. Instead of spending money on concrete borders, the American government should go to the source. They should give financial and development aid to the countries from which the immigrants are fleeing — without enacting imperialistic policies. They could also give immigrants more of a chance to present their cases fairly in court. Since most immigration papers must be completed in English, there should be more translators provided by the government to help migrants understand what papers they will need to enter the country.
There is no possible way to open America’s doors to the world’s entire population. However, the government should not cut down on the number of immigrants allowed in without trying to improve the system first. Illegal immigration will only continue to rise with a merit-based immigration system. Desperate people who are fleeing violence and turmoil will not let paper limitations hinder their flight.

Mitt Romney's 'profile in courage'

Texto completo: For years Mitt Romney had a reputation as a flip-flopper, an opportunist, a politician who would tailor his beliefs to fit whichever group he was trying to please.
Running for office in deep-blue Massachusetts in 1994 and 2002, he pronounced himself strongly pro-choice. Running for the Republican presidential nomination in pro-life Iowa and South Carolina, he became just as strongly pro-life.
As governor of Massachusetts, he produced a universal health care program that prefigured Obamacare. Appealing to GOP voters deeply opposed to Obama, Romney renounced his signature accomplishment.
Running for office in Massachusetts, Romney backed away from the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Running in the Republican primaries, he embraced the GOP's favorite president.
Running for office in Massachusetts, Romney eschewed the label of conservative Republican. "My views are progressive," he said in 2002, pronouncing himself a "moderate." Ten years later, running in the GOP primaries, he famously declared himself "severely conservative."
And so on. Romney could never escape the opportunist label, mostly because it fit.
Until now. As the junior senator from Utah, on Wednesday Romney voted to convict and remove President Trump from office, becoming the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president of his own party. To hear some mainstream journalists tell the story, Romney's years of opportunism just melted away, replaced by a profile in courage.
"A profile in courage," declared the Washington Post.
"A profile in courage," declared the Atlantic.
"A profile in courage," declared CNN.
Romney meticulously prepared the media rollout of his new profile in courage. Before he announced his intention to vote against Trump, he arranged for interviews with the New York Times, Washington Post, Atlantic, and Fox News -- all embargoed until he made his decision public on the Senate floor.
"Romney's media plan around this is really a wonder to behold," noted Buzzfeed's Ben Smith.
One of those pre-interviews was with the Times' podcast The Daily. Romney conceded the charge of political opportunism in the past. "My guess is that I was influenced in some cases by political benefit," he said, "and I regret that."
But what about now? The Times' Mark Leibovich suggested that with the anti-Trump vote, Romney might be trying to make up for times past. "He has always been very aware of his own political narrative," Leibovich said. "He has been aware of how he was viewed, maybe as a political opportunist, him maybe doing things out of expediency rather than principle. And I think ultimately one of the things that this Senate chapter has done for him in his career is that it has enabled him to maybe rewrite the ending, maybe recast himself as someone who did feel as if he was doing the right thing at the expense of whatever the expedient decision at the moment would have been."
And so the Old Romney became the New Romney. "His career...is littered with examples of moments where it seems like he wanted to be on both sides of an issue, or he 'evolved' in ways that felt opportunistic," the Times' Michael Barbaro said. "Yet at this moment, he becomes a senator of conscience."
But Barbaro, who covered Romney's 2012 presidential run, wondered whether it might not be that simple, whether all might not be exactly as it seems, whether there might still be a bit of Old Romney at work. "But it's a moment where his vote to convict the president on one of two counts has no impact whatsoever on the process," Barbaro said. "Romney is the lone dissenting voice in a case that he can have no influence over."
Barbaro compared Romney's anti-Trump vote to the deciding vote the late Sen. John McCain cast to kill the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare. That was a consequential vote, one where the fate of a major political issue rested entirely on McCain's shoulders. Romney's vote, even though it earned him the scorn of Trump supporters, was nevertheless not terribly consequential. Trump would remain in office whether he cast it or not.
On the plus side, the vote would win Romney widespread praise across much of the media. How often can one become a profile in courage? That would certainly feel good, especially for a man who was excoriated by some of those same media voices when he ran against Barack Obama eight years ago.
Now, Romney will take plenty of hits from the Trump side, and from the president himself. But there are clearly benefits as well. So, just as it was in the old days, the question is: Who is Romney trying to please?
It is often remarked that Donald Trump, at 73 years of age, is not going to change. That certainly appears to be true. And what about the 72 year-old Mitt Romney? A career in politics led to his vote Wednesday. Although he is a man with some undeniably good qualities, those who have watched him over the years will wonder whether the vote was truly something new or the Romney they have known for a long time.

Paul Krugman, who predicted 'global recession' under Trump, admits economy is 'strong'

Texto completo: When President Trump was elected president, Paul Krugman warned readers of the New York Times to brace themselves for a "global recession." Now, he admits the economy is "strong."
Krugman's latest comments came just before another jobs report that smashed expectations, with 225,000 workers added to payrolls in an already strong labor market. Unemployment, which ticked up slightly — was still at 3.6%.
It was not supposed to work out this way as far as the Nobel Prize winning economist predicted back in 2016.
Right after Trump was elected, the New York Times asked its opinion writers to weigh in on what it meant.
"If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never," Krugman predicted.
Since the day Trump was inaugurated, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gone up about 9,500 points, or nearly 50%.
In November 2016, Krugman also wrote that "we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight."
In reality, the United States has the strongest job market in half a century.
While criticizing corporate tax cuts for creating lopsided gains and reduced health insurance rates, Krugman acknowledges, "Still, it is indeed a strong economy."
Krugman then uses this as a jumping-off point to argue that the reason the economy is doing so well is that under Trump, Republicans decided to abandon fiscal restraint and allow $1 trillion deficits. Had Republicans not sabotaged efforts to deficit spend more during the Obama administration (when the federal debt nearly doubled), then the economy would have had a much more robust recovery sooner.
Now, I've been a critic of Republican deficit hypocrisy in the Trump era (including in Krugman's own newspaper), but that still doesn't explain why his economic predictions were so off.
Trump ran as a populist, not as a deficit hawk. He promised big tax cuts, increased military spending, a massive boost to infrastructure, and opposed entitlement reform. It was obvious that deficits would be rising under the policies he was proposing. So if Krugman was so confident in his thesis on the importance of deficit spending, he should have predicted that the economy would boom under Trump. Instead, he predicted a never-ending global recession and irreparable damage to financial markets.

Texto completo: Two hours into the latest Democratic debate, Elizabeth Warren hadn't spoken very much.
Her speaking time ran just shy of 14.5 minutes; ahead of her were Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Bernie Sanders, with four more minutes of politicking.
If you ask Warren’s campaign, you’d think sexism is to blame.
“Current status,” Joe Rospars, chief strategist for the Warren campaign, tweeted during the debate, “guy who came 4th in Iowa has gotten to speak for more than 50% more time in the debate than the woman who finished above above [sic] him.”
Tweet
The “guy” Rospars refers to, of course, is Biden, who has struggled to gain traction in previous debates and, clearly, in the first caucuses. But don’t shed tears for Warren just yet.
During the seventh and previous debate, CNN threw the questioning in Warren’s favor by mischaracterizing her dispute with Sanders. Rather than repeating her claims against him as allegations, moderator Abby Phillip accepted Warren's claim as fact. During that debate, Warren spoke the most of any candidate, clocking in at more than 19 minutes (nearly three more minutes than Biden).
Similarly, at the CNN/New York Times debate in October, Warren spent nearly 23 minutes speaking on the stage. Don’t forget that the rest of the media is in love with Warren, too.
She may not have been able to get as much face time as desired on Friday night, but Warren has greatly benefited from her media coverage in the past. It’s too bad she couldn’t use that advantage to push past third place in the Iowa caucuses.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is dramatically changing his campaign staff after a disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses.
Anita Dunn, a longtime Democratic operative who worked for years in the Obama administration, has been elevated to a senior position in the campaign. Previously, she was only an adviser in the former vice president's campaign.
“She will be working closely with us on campaign strategy and overall coordination on budget and personnel as we build a bigger campaign for the next phase,” a leaked campaign email to the New York Times said.
Dunn, 62, is currently the managing director of SKDKnickerbocker, a liberal communications firm in Washington. She worked for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2006 before being his director of communications in his 2008 White House run.
She served as the White House communications director from April to November 2009 before leaving for the private sector. Dunn helped advise Obama's campaign during his 2012 reelection bid as president.
The news of Dunn's role comes after the results of Monday's Iowa caucuses left Biden in a weakened political position. Though his campaign wavered on whether it believed a strong performance was necessary in Iowa, its distant fourth-place finish behind Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren has come with dramatic reevaluations on the campaign's future strategy.
On Wednesday, reports came out that the Biden campaign fired its Iowa field director, Adrienne Bogen. Other senior members of the state's operation moved on to positions in Super Tuesday states ahead of the March 3 contests.

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has always been an honorable and decent guy, even back in 2012 when he was blamed for a woman dying of cancer.

All it took for the news media to see this was for him to vote with Democrats on impeachment.

On Wednesday, Romney became the only Republican member of the Senate to vote "guilty" on either of the two charges brought against President Trump. The upper chamber of Congress voted anyway to acquit the president, but not before the press declared Romney a true hero of the republic.

It is difficult to get into the nitty-gritty of whether the praise is deserved because it is basically impossible to overlook the fact that the applause comes mostly from the people who did everything they could seven years ago to destroy Romney’s character and reputation.
The 2012 presidential election was not just a tough race, featuring hard-nosed politics. The attacks leveled against Romney when he sought to oust President Barack Obama from the White House were not about mere policy criticisms and disagreements. Romney was portrayed as an irredeemable bigot, whose election would lead to the enslavement of women and minorities. When the news media were not participating directly in the destruction of Romney, who was just as honorable and decent then as he is now, they watched silently as it happened.

In 2012, for example, the Washington Post editorial board accused the Republican nominee not once, but twice of holding the electorate in “contempt,” arguing that Romney’s strategy clearly relied on his alleged hope that voters would be stupid enough to support him.

This week, however, the Washington Post declared its undying respect for Romney in an editorial titled, “History will remember Mitt Romney.”

“Mr. Romney deserves respect for thoughtfully weighing the evidence and the implications of removing a sitting president,” reads the Feb. 5 editorial. “At least one Republican acted with integrity and honor. History will remember the rest very differently.”

In 2012, many news organizations, including the New Yorker, HuffPo, and the Atlantic, worked hard to further the “war on women” narrative that alleged Romney was a retrograde sexist. The New Yorker’s Amy Davidson Sorkin, for example, argued that the GOP campaign’s decision to bring on Ann Romney to help with voter outreach proved the Republican nominee definitely had a “problem with women” and that he is also somewhat sexist.

HuffPo went big pushing the nonsensical lie that “binders full of women” was a deeply sexist thing for Romney to have said. The Atlantic went so far as to publish articles with titles such as, “'Binders Full of Women' Won the Debate” and “Binders Full of Women: A Meme That Means Something” (it did not mean anything).

Following Romney’s “guilty” vote this week, HuffPo published an article titled, “Will Mitt Romney Face Punishment For Having A Conscience?”

“A Profile in Courage,” read a very simple headline published this week by the Atlantic.

The New Yorker, meanwhile, put out an article titled, “Mitt Romney's Act of Political Courage.”

To be fair, no one ever said supposed sexists could not have a conscience.

In 2012, then-New York Times reporter Ashley Parker was part of the press pool that heckled Romney during an overseas trip to Poland, shouting repeatedly about the GOP candidate's “gaffes" during a visit to a memorial dedicated to the country’s fallen heroes. This week, Parker marveled as Romney explained in a speech that his Mormon faith led him to vote “guilty.”

“I was the NYT’s Romney embed in 2012,” she said in an almost reverential tone. “I listened to hundreds of speeches, scoured dozens of statements, dissected myriad tweets. I cannot think of a time he has spoken as openly and directly about the role his faith plays than he did before today’s vote.”

It is true that Romney was mostly mum about his Mormon faith during the 2012 election, but even if he had opened up about it, Parker likely would not have heard it over her screaming about his gaffffeeees.

In the world of news commentary and entertainment, the treatment of Romney in 2012 was the same.

MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell claimed in 2012 that Romney was “uniquely immoral.” O’Donnell also challenged one of Romney’s sons to a fistfight on-air after that son criticized Obama. The MSNBC host even alleged that Romney “deliberately” incited boos during an address before the NAACP, claiming the GOP nominee likely hoped the visual of unhappy black attendees would inspire white racists to vote Republican.

This week, O’Donnell solemnly declared, “Each day for the rest of his life, [Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina] will live in enraged jealousy of [Romney’s] courage.”

MSNBC’s Chris Matthews likewise accused Romney in 2012 of being a racist, arguing that the GOP nominee had played the “ethnic card” when he alleged Obama had gutted the work requirement for welfare.

"This stuff about getting rid of the work requirement for welfare is dishonest … you are playing that little ethnic card there," Matthews shouted. "You can play your games and giggle about it, but the fact is your side is playing that card. When you start talking about work requirements, we know what game you’re playing, and everybody knows what game you’re playing, it’s a race card.”

He added in a separate segment wherein he portrayed Romney as a heartless autocrat, “You’re part of the problem. You’re one of the bad guys.”

On Feb. 5, Matthews poured out heavy praise for the senator.

"What takes bravery, what merits regard, is the voice that speaks out and tells the brave truth through the sad chorus of silence and submission," the cable anchor said. "We saw it when Mitt Romney stood up for the constitution against Donald Trump.”

Late-night host Stephen Colbert, who spent the entire 2012 presidential election giving life to the absolute worst things said about Romney, dedicated a “heartfelt monologue” this week to the Utah senator, thanking him for his vote.

Even New York Times columnist Gail Collins, who attacked Romney repeatedly in 2012 for his alleged cruelty, writing obsessively about the time he placed the family dog, Seamus, on the roof of the family car, has praise for the senator.

Romney is a “profile in courage,” she writes this week. “When history looks back on Mitt Romney, this should be the moment that gets remembered.”

The same media that shrugged in 2015 after it was revealed Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada was lying when he used the floor of the Senate to claim that Romney was a tax cheat are now running headlines declaring the Utah senator is a "profile in courage." The media that shrugged in 2012 while members of the press intentionally mischaracterized Romney’s opinion article, “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,” are in awe now of his moral courage and bravery.

It is amazing how quickly a single vote with the Democrats can earn a supposed monster the adoration of the press.

The Oscars’ gender quandary

Texto completo: After actress Issa Rae announced the nominees for best director at the Oscars this year, she quipped, “Congratulations to those men.”
Some feminists and film buffs were miffed that the Academy Awards snubbed female directors, particularly Little Women filmmaker Greta Gerwig.
While critics perennially complain that the Oscars shut out women from many of its main categories, they have one surefire shot at success: best actress. But another group of liberal lobbyists has recently begun to air another grievance whose solution would make the gender imbalance worse: creating space for entertainers who identify as nonbinary, neither female nor male, by scrapping gendered categories.
Activist and nonbinary actor Asia Kate Dillon has been calling on awards shows to do away with their gender distinctions for years. Star of the TV show Billions, Dillon has petitioned the Emmys to eliminate its gender distinctions, though the awards show has not been receptive to the suggestion. When Dillon submitted an application for best supporting role, the actor wasn’t sure whether to choose “actor” or “actress.” The Television Academy said whichever group Dillon identified with was fine.
Contra Dillon's disappointment with the Emmys, the music industry has already evolved somewhat to fit the prevailing taste: The Grammys and MTV’s Video Music Awards scrapped gendered awards in 2012 and 2017, respectively. In 2017, Dillon presented the MTV Movie & TV Awards’ first nongendered award to Emma Watson.
“If we separated categories by the colors of eyes, hair, or skin, people would go, ‘This is unacceptable,’” Dillon told the New York Times. “That’s how I feel about gender categories. At this point, it feels unacceptable and unnecessary and archaic.”
It may be commonplace among some circles to view gender as a personal identifier no more significant than hair color, but that’s not how most of America sees it. Most awards shows, including the Oscars (whose leaders said they have no plans to scrap gendered categories but will “continue to be sensitive to the evolving conversation”), are a far cry from making any drastic changes.
But as the calls for nonbinary options pick up traction — and they will — awards shows will find themselves in a tough position: run afoul of the growing number of entertainers who refuse to identify with a single gender or scrap gendered categories and suffer the wrath of other liberals when they realize many film and TV academies still aren’t good at nominating women.
Soon, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going to have to answer a question: Are there two genders or not? Either way, many fans will not be happy. So the Academy will listen to the loudest voices.

Navy secretary fired by Trump endorses Bloomberg

Texto completo: Former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer endorsed Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign months after being ousted by President Trump.
Spencer announced his support for the former New York mayor Thursday morning, saying, "I have the utmost confidence that Mike will faithfully execute his duty as commander in chief."
Spencer, 66, was secretary of the Navy from August 2017 to November 2019, including when Trump pardoned Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who had been accused of several war crimes and found guilty of taking a photograph with a corpse of an Islamic State fighter.
It was unclear if the Navy would allow Gallagher to retire with his coveted Trident pin, but Trump ordered Gallagher to retire with full honors. Spencer side-stepped Defense Secretary Mark Esper to raise his concerns about Gallagher to the White House and was asked to resign by Esper in November.
In a parting op-ed, Spencer ripped Trump for his “shocking and unprecedented intervention” into the Navy’s affairs.
Prior to his endorsement of Bloomberg, Spencer had donated to Republican causes, including donations to George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and the Republican National Committee. While Bloomberg is a Democrat today, he was a Republican when he was mayor of New York City.
“We need a leader who can bring the country together,” Spencer told the New York Times. “This is not about a party. This is not about left and right. It’s about where can we find a solution to get the country working together and be unified, with an operable political system.”
Bloomberg accepted Spencer’s endorsement and lauded him for breaking with Trump, saying, “I salute Secretary Spencer for not flinching from his duties. But the fact remains, we have a president, a commander in chief, who has no respect for the rule of law and no concern whatsoever for ethics or honor, or for the values that truly make America great.”
Spencer is slated to join Bloomberg on the campaign trail on Friday in Norfolk, Virginia. Bloomberg, a 78-year-old billionaire, has made a relatively strong showing in nationwide polls, despite not participating in early state elections such as the Iowa caucuses. The RealClearPolitics polling averages show Bloomberg in fourth place with 10.6% nationwide.

Life is good in Trump's America, and Democrats want to break it

Texto completo: The Democrats are on a roll. The past couple of weeks have been a political parade of one disaster after another, all to the benefit of President Trump’s reelection campaign.
The results of the Iowa caucuses have been delayed after a high-profile failure of technology and the Democratic Party. As of now, Pete Buttigieg seems to be leading by a hair over Bernie Sanders, but the New York Times reports the data released by the Iowa Democratic Party remain “riddled with inconsistencies and other flaws.”
At this point, even if the issues are resolved and a definitive winner is soon declared, the messy process has already shaken the public’s confidence in the results. It’s an embarrassing blemish on the Democratic Party’s ability to use technology to plan … anything, really.
The Democratic primary candidates want to run your healthcare, education, and finances, but they have proven incapable of reporting votes in a simple caucus. Although to be fair, former President Barack Obama’s Healthcare.gov website crashed on its launch day too, so the Iowa fiasco is nothing new for the Democratic Party.
Meanwhile, the beat goes on in Washington. Trump delivered a triumphant State of the Union address to Congress despite Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s distracting facial expressions and her melodramatic, almost ceremonial, ripping up of a copy of the speech. If I didn’t know any better, I’d suspect she didn’t like Trump all that much.
Pelosi’s attitude problem is a symptom of a much larger problem among Democrats, who are on the verge of falling into the same trap they fell into in 2016. They underestimated Trump as a candidate, and they have underestimated him as a president ever since. They assumed their personal opinions were the only correct way to view the world, took many of their own voters for granted, and, ultimately, lost big as a result.
The Trump administration has achieved significant policy victories that have improved life for everyday people. Democrats talk a big game about raising living standards for the “little man,” but the Trump administration is getting it done: from school choice, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, record-low minority unemployment, and more. Democrats have promised reform on these issues for generations — but Trump is actually getting it done for disenfranchised urban communities.
Even CNN contributor and ardent liberal Van Jones admitted, to the shock of his colleagues, that Trump is helping black Americans in real life. Tweet
He warned the CNN panel that Trump’s achievements could appeal to groups outside the GOP’s typical coalition, including minority communities. “Wake up, folks,” Jones said. “What you’re going see him do is say, ‘you may not like my rhetoric, but look at my results.’ And if he narrowcasts that, it’s going to be effective.”
For once, Van Jones is absolutely right: This election is going to be about results, not rhetoric.
Which political party will earn the trust of struggling communities: the party that is creating jobs and getting criminal justice reform done or the party that is laser-focused on banning plastic straws and retrofitting every building in America?
Democrats so desperately want to paint a doomsday scenario where America is falling apart at the hands of Trump, and within the confines of their echo chambers on Facebook and MSNBC, they might be able to paint that picture. But it’s just not in line with reality. Consumer confidence is at a 20-year high. According to a recent Gallup poll, 90% of the public is satisfied with their personal lives, the highest number reported since 2003.
It’s a pretty great time to be alive, and Democrats are going to need a compelling argument for why voters should get off this train and opt for “big, structural change” — as it says on the back of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign RV.
Democrats will have to take a break from blaming the world’s problems on Trump and blaming their own problems on Trump supporters. They will have to reexamine their own beliefs and come up with practical policy proposals. Like the Iowans waiting for final results from the caucuses, I’m not holding my breath.
Adam Brandon is the President of FreedomWorks.

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s reelection campaign will be centered around claims that he has done great things for the economy. And let’s be honest: The U.S. economy is running pretty hot these days. Growth in GDP and employment has been good, though not spectacular; the unemployment rate is near a historic low.
There are some shadows in the picture. Economic gains have been lopsided, with a large increase in corporate profits that mainly reflects giant tax breaks, while workers haven’t seen comparable gains (and gains for lower-wage workers have been driven in part by minimum-wage increases in blue states). The huge gains in health insurance coverage under President Barack Obama have stalled or gone into reverse, and there has been a sharp increase in the number of Americans who report delaying medical treatment because of costs.
Still, it is indeed a strong economy. But if we ask what lies behind that strength, the main answer is an explosion in the federal budget deficit, which exceeded $1 trillion last year. And the story of how that happened has deeply disturbing implications for the future of U.S. politics.
Let’s go back for a minute to early 2009, when the economy was imploding and desperately needed help in the form of deficit spending. The Obama administration did indeed propose a significant stimulus plan — but it was much too small relative to the size of the problem, largely because the administration wanted to win bipartisan support and wasn’t willing to use reconciliation to bypass the filibuster.
This isn’t hindsight. In January 2009 I was practically tearing my hair out over the inadequacy of the stimulus, and warned of a scenario in which “the plan limits the rise in unemployment, but things are still pretty bad, with the rate peaking at something like 9% and coming down only slowly. And then Mitch McConnell says, ‘See, government spending doesn’t work.’” That is, of course, exactly what happened.
Then, in 2010, Republicans took control of the House and were in a position to force Obama into years of spending cuts that exerted a significant drag on economic growth. This drag wasn’t enough to prevent a sustained economic recovery, but the recovery could and should have been much faster. There was no economic reason we shouldn’t have returned to full employment by, say, 2013; instead, largely thanks to fiscal austerity, the average unemployment rate that year was still above 7%.
Now, Republicans claimed that they were demanding spending cuts because they were deeply concerned about budget deficits. And the news media, I’m sorry to say, both bought into the narrative that deficits were our most important problem — abandoning the usual conventions of reportorial neutrality — and took GOP claims of fiscal probity at face value.
By the way, whatever happened to the deficit scolds who were so prominent during the Obama years? They’re oddly quiet now.
Anyway, it was always obvious to anyone who really paid attention that people like Paul Ryan were fiscal hypocrites, who would suddenly lose all interest in deficits as soon as a Republican occupied the White House. And that’s what they did.
As I said, the budget deficit has exploded past $1 trillion under Trump, up from less than $600 billion in Obama’s last year. Most of that rise can be attributed to Trump’s policies, mainly a tax cut rammed through Congress using exactly the hyperpartisan tactics Obama balked at in 2009.
In a way, the surprising thing about Trump’s deficitpalooza is that it hasn’t boosted the economy even more, a shortfall that can be attributed to bad design. After all, the corporate tax cuts that were the biggest driver of rising deficits did nothing to increase business investment, which has actually declined over the past year.
And while the Obama stimulus included significant investments in the future, helping in particular to jump-start revolutionary progress in green energy, Trump has never delivered a penny on his promise to rebuild America’s infrastructure.
Still, Trump’s deficits have given the economy — and Trump’s political fortunes — a lift in the short term. And that fact should bother you, a lot.
Put it this way: Republicans used the pretense that they cared about fiscal responsibility to engage in de facto economic sabotage as long as a Democrat was in the White House. Then they abandoned the pretense and opened up the spending taps as soon as one of their own was in power. And far from paying a price for their duplicity, they are being politically rewarded.
The implications for party strategy are stark: Maximum cynicism is the best policy. Obstruct, disrupt, and hurt the economy as much as you can, deploying whatever hypocritical excuses you think the media will buy, when the other party holds the presidency. Then abandon all concerns for the future and buy votes once you’re back in control.
For whatever reason, Democrats haven’t been willing or able to behave that cynically. Republicans, however, have. And if Trump is reelected, that asymmetric cynicism will be the main reason.

Texto completo: As several people have noticed, this was the most politically successful week of the Trump presidency.
First, President Donald Trump’s job approval numbers are rising. When the impeachment inquiry got rolling in October his Gallup approval rating was 39. Now it’s 49. If he can hold this level, he’ll probably be reelected.
Second, impeachment never became a topic of conversation among rank-and-file Democrats, let alone independents and Republicans, so it was easily defeated in the Senate.
To the extent that it was noticed, impeachment worked for Republicans and against Democrats. Approval of the Republican Party is now at 51%, its highest since 2005. More Americans now identify as Republicans than as Democrats. As Gallup dryly observed in announcing these numbers, “Gallup observed similar public opinion shifts when Bill Clinton was impeached.”
Third, there is no Democratic transcender. The Iowa results, though far from final, indicate that there is no obvious candidate who can be quickly embraced by all factions of the party. With Mike Bloomberg now doubling his campaign spending, it looks like the Democratic primary battle is going to go on for a while.
Democrats may wind up in a position in which they can’t nominate Bernie Sanders because he’s too far left, and they can’t not nominate him because his followers would bolt from a Biden/Bloomberg/Buttigieg-led party.
Only 53% of Sanders voters say they will certainly support whomever is the Democratic nominee. This is no idle threat. In 2016, in Pennsylvania, 117,000 Sanders primary voters went for Trump in the general, and Trump won the state by 44,292 ballots. In Michigan, 48,000 Sanders voters went for Trump, and Trump won the state by 10,704. In Wisconsin, 51,300 Sanders voters went for Trump, and Trump won the state by 22,748. In short, Sanders voters helped elect Trump.
Fourth, Trump has cleverly reframed the election. I can see why Nancy Pelosi ripped up his State of the Union speech. It was the most effective speech of the Trump presidency.
In 2016, Trump ran a dark, fear-driven “American carnage” campaign. His 2016 convention speech was all about crime, violence and menace. The theme of this week’s speech was mostly upbeat “Morning in America.”
I don’t know if he can keep this tone, because unlike Ronald Reagan, he’s not an optimistic, generous person. But if he can, and he can keep his ideology anodyne, this message can resonate even with people who don’t like him.
Trump’s speech reframes the election around this core question: Is capitalism basically working or is it basically broken?
Trump can run on the proposition that it’s basically working. He has a lot of evidence on his side: The unemployment rate is the lowest in decades. Wages are rising. The typical family income is higher than it has ever been.
Americans seem to accept this position. Confidence in the economy is higher now than at any moment since the Clinton administration. According to Gallup, 59% of Americans say they are better off than they were a year ago. Three-quarters of Americans expect to be even better off a year from now.
Democrats, by contrast, have congregated around the message that capitalism is fundamentally broken and that the economy is bad. As Matthew Yglesias noted recently in Vox, when Democrats were asked in the PBS NewsHour/Politico debate if the economy was good, they all gave the same answer.
Joe Biden: “I don’t think [Americans] really do like the economy. Look at the middle-class neighborhoods. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed.” Pete Buttigieg: “This economy is not working for most of us.” Elizabeth Warren: “A rising GDP, rise in corporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across the country.” And so on down the line.
An opposition party can retake the White House in a time of rising economic conditions, but it can’t do it by denouncing capitalism and it can’t do it by denying the felt reality of a majority of Americans.
It’s hard to defeat a president in good times. UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, the author of “The Message Matters” and a co-author of “Identity Crisis,” has found that the rare candidates who do succeed find issues that voters care about just as much. In 1960, John Kennedy ran on the missile gap. In 1968, Richard Nixon ran on law and order. In 2016, Trump ran on Middle America identity politics.
What would that issue be? Well, in his book “The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth,” Benjamin Friedman argues that in prosperous times voters are more tolerant of diversity, more committed to fairness and expanding opportunity. As he puts it, “Economic growth bears moral benefits.”
That suggests that Democrats should acknowledge that the economy has done well since the Obama recovery in 2009. They should argue that this is the time to take advantage of prosperity to begin a moral and social revival. This is the year to run a values campaign, one that champions policies to make America more socially mobile, caring and interdependent.
In 2020, running on economic gloom or class war probably won’t work.

Texto completo: Cuatro ciudadanos chinos de más de dos docenas de esa nacionalidad que viajaban a bordo de un crucero que regresó a la costa de Nueva Jersey este viernes fueron trasladados a un hospital para ser examinados por posible contagio con el coronavirus, informaron las autoridades. Mientras aumentan a 61 los pasajeros infectados en otro crucero anclado en Japón.
El alcalde de ciudad de Bayona, Jimmy Davis, dijo a NBC New York que uno de los cuatro viajeros procedentes de China sufrió fiebre en la embarcación “Anthem of the Seas” de Royal Caribbean pero remitió, aún así, junto con los otros tres están bajo estricta observación en el Hospital Universitario de Newark, que cuenta con salas de aislamiento.
Además, como medida de precaución, otros 23 pasajeros de nacionalidad china fueron examinados en el interior del crucero después de atracar en la localidad este viernes por la mañana serán enviados al aeropuerto de Newark desde donde regresarán a China, mientras que el resto viajeros permanecen en la embarcación sin que se conozca hasta el momento cuando podrán desembarcar.
Davis aseguró que ninguno de los 27 ciudadanos chinos son de Wuhan o han viajado a la ciudad, el epicentro del brote de la enfermedad mortal que ha causado al menos 636 muertos en China, según los últimos datos proporcionados por las autoridades del país, que cifraron en 31.161 el número de personas contagiadas.
“Estamos monitoreando de cerca los posibles contagios con el coronavirus y contamos con protocolos médicos rigurosos a bordo de nuestros barcos. Continuamos trabajando en estrecha consulta con los Centros de Control para Enfermedad (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés), la Organización Mundial de la Salud y las autoridades sanitarias locales para su orientación y garantizar la salud y el bienestar de nuestros pasajeros y la tripulación “, dijo en un comunicado la portavoz de Royal Caribbean, Melissa Charbonneau.
Por su parte, Japón ha confirmado este viernes que se detectaron 41 nuevos casos de coronavirus entre las personas a bordo de un crucero varado en un puerto del país desde el pasado lunes, y puesto en cuarentena ante el riesgo de que el microbio, detectado en algunos de los viajeros, se propague ulteriormente. Los responsables sanitarios nipones ya habían hallado otros 20 casos en los dos días anteriores.
Las 3,700 personas embarcadas en el navío varado en Japón, llamado Diamond Princess, tienen que transcurrir 14 días de aislamiento a bordo (el tiempo estimado como el periodo máximo de incubación del virus, que está provocando una emergencia sanitaria internacional), según determinaron las autoridades. De acuerdo a lo que describen algunos de estos pasajeros, ya no están disfrutando un viaje en un “crucero de lujo”, y tienen que enfrentar restricciones, aislamiento e intranquilidad por la situación, de las que varios se sienten poco informados.
“Vamos a estar aquí durante mucho tiempo. Creo que esto nos va a poner un poco a prueba, obviamente. Pero no sé. ¿Qué hacemos? No podríamos saltar del bote; hace un poco frío”, dijo a The Associated Press Jacqui Fidrmuc, una pasajera australiana.
“No va a ser un crucero de lujo; va a ser como una prisión flotante “, afirmó David Abel, otro viajero a bordo del barco, anclado en el puerto de Yokohama, que cuelga varios videos en Facebook para describir la situación a bordo.
Pasajeros “sin luz natural”
El hombre describió que los pasajeros tienen que quedarse aislado dentro de sus propias cabinas. “Los pasajeros que están en las cabinas interiores no tienen ventanas para mirar, no hay luz del sol, luz natural, y no pueden caminar por un pasillo”, afirmó en conexión con CNBC.
A esos viajeros, agregó, se les permite una salida de hora y media a la cubierta para tomar el aire. “Tienen que quedarse a un metro el uno del otro y no pueden entrar en contacto o juntarse en grupos”, dijo en uno de sus posts en Facebook.
También la comida no es la misma que antes. En una de ellas, solo le dieron un vaso de jugo de naranja, un yogur y un poco de melón, según contó. Otra vez, se trató de un “sándwich de lechuga con algo de pollo adentro” y un postre.
En conclusión, opinó Abel, “todo el lujo de tener a alguien —un miembro de la tripulación que viene a la cabina, hace la cama, pone chocolate en la almohada, cambia las toallas, los paños para la cara, limpia el baño— esos días ya se han ido”.
La alarma a bordo del Diamond Princess saltó después de que uno de las personas que se encontraban a bordo, un hombre de Hong Kong, fuera detectado con el coronavirus después de bajarse del crucero durante una parada en su ciudad de origen.
Masako Ishida, otra pasajera del crucero, dijo a The New York Times que varias personas tardaron un tiempo en darse cuenta de que podrían haber estado expuestos al virus porque “no había mucha información” sobre lo que estaba ocurriendo.
La televisión pública japonesa informa que entre los 61 viajeros contagiados por el coronavirus hay ocho estadounidenses. Los pacientes serán tratados en instalaciones sanitarias.
El primer ministro japonés, Shinzo Abe, anunció el jueves que el país negará la entrada de pasajeros extranjeros en otro crucero, el Westerdam de Holland America, en camino a Okinawa desde Hong Kong, por la sospecha de pacientes con virus encontrados a bordo. El operador del navío, con sede en Estados Unidos, negó que alguien tuviera virus.
También las autoridades de Hong Kong mantienen un crucero con 3,600 personas a bordo en cuarentena después de que se detectaran algunos casos de pasajeros de viajes anteriores infectados.
Indignación en China tras la muerte del médico que alertó del peligro y fue reprimido
En China, el país epicentro del brote del coronavirus , donde murieron por las consecuencias de la infección al menos 636 personas y más de 31,000 resultan contagiadas, se produjo una oleada de indignación después de que un médico que alertó del peligro provocado por la difusión del microbio y fue reprimido por ello por parte de las autoridades, murió justamente por este virus.
Cuando el virus, desconocido hasta finales de diciembre, se empezó a extender, Li Wenliang compartió en un chat privado con otros doctores información sobre la enfermedad; entonces había una persona en cuarentena en su hospital, con síntomas similares a otra enfermedad anterior, el SARS, que se extendió a principio de la década de los años 2000.
El hospital donde trabajaba este médico de Wuhan, la ciudad china con más casos de enfermos y muertes por el virus, informó de su fallecimiento en las primeras horas de este viernes. Cientos de miles de personas y hasta un medio normalmente afín al Gobierno chino homenajearon al doctor, y expresaron críticas a las autoridades por la gestión de la crisis sanitaria.
