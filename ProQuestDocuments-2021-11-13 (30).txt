Texto completo: Facebook is an easy target. The company is criticized by the right for perceived liberal bias and the left for its role in disseminating political falsehoods.
And in this election year, the heat is on.
But it wasn't until recently that we learned former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the presidency, wants to put limits on Facebook and revoke a federal law that the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as "the most important law protecting free speech online." That would be a very big deal.
Understanding what's at stake may take a little reminiscing. If you were online in the early 1990s, it meant you had a subscription to a private service called CompuServe, Prodigy or America Online. AOL would excitedly advise you, "You've got mail." It was a time when that sounded like good news rather than a threat. Our interaction online was pretty limited. Essentially, you could post your views on electronic bulletin boards. And if you insulted someone, it would take some time for that to register, thanks to our 2400-baud modems.
Soon came ever-more accessible operating systems and browsers, and an unprecedented blossoming of online communication. We could all share our views in real time on sites hosted by media and technology companies, or on platforms created by a new generation of entrepreneurs.
Rare wisdom from Congress The marketplace of ideas would grow exponentially online. It was the fulfillment of the ideals of the First Amendment and its promise of free speech for all. But there was a hitch to this exciting development.
If websites provided open access to those who wanted to share their views, what would happen if those posts were lies or libels? Aggrieved parties would sue the companies that allowed the post. The companies couldn't possibly check every post for accuracy, so they'd be sued out of existence.
In its wisdom (occasionally it happens), Congress passed a law in 1996 to help ensure that this free flow of views would continue: the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, specifying that sites on the internet would not be held liable for the defamatory posts of others.
Picture a country store in a small town where people drop by and talk on the front porch. There will be local gossip, buffoons and braggarts, but the store owner faces no consequences. He's just providing his porch.
Those who defame others online can still be sued, but the conduits for those views are largely free of liability. Yes, some of that free speech online is ugly and manipulative, but thanks to Section 230, a wealth of speech remains fluid and free. For now.
Facebook has earned criticism In a December interview published Jan. 17, Biden told The New York Times that Section 230 "should be revoked because (Facebook) is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false."
Facebook has earned a lot of the criticism coming its way. For all of its talk of lofty ideals, it has demonstrated time and again that it's all about revenue. The company has even refused to review political advertising for falsehoods or bar microtargeting of Facebook users, based on the principle that "people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public."
Translation: "We'll cash their checks and let them lie. You figure it out."
There's certainly merit in revisiting Section 230. We're a long way from dial-up modems. Even so, the notion that we should revoke a law that keeps the free exchange of ideas flowing all over the world is dangerous.
Yes, we need to fight the onslaught of foreign and domestic hackers and bots intended to mislead Americans, sow divisions and undermine our elections. But we can't effectively fight those who would undermine American principles by losing sight of them ourselves.

LOYAL CAMPAIGNERS Presidential hopefuls feature dogs on social media - and at some events - to cozy up to voters

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Last May, Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted a photograph of a dog surrounded by the chewed-up detritus of what appeared to be some unfortunate household item. It was Bailey, her family's adolescent golden retriever.
"Bailey was a bad boy this morning," she wrote. "But at least he's sorry."
Bailey often appears in his owner's social media accounts.
So do Truman and Buddy, the mixed-breed dogs who belong to Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten - although as befitting media-savvy members of a millennial-run household, they also have their own, dog-centric Twitter feed.
Non-punctuated and mostly nonsensical, Truman and Buddy's posts feature approximations of the sort of things Midwestern dogs might say, if they actually said anything. Topics include Christmas ("ther is a tree in the living room again"; irony ("GLAM," next to a goofy selfie); and stoner-type observations about food and identity ("I AM A LOAF OF OFN BREAD").
W.C. Fields famously advised actors never to work with animals, lest they be upstaged or unpleasantly surprised by unscripted moments.
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, seemed to illustrate the wisdom of this advice last week on the campaign trail in Vermont.
Introduced to a dog, he grabbed its nose and shook hello - not a traditional greeting, but a maneuver that seemed quintessentially Bloomberg-esque, as if he had studied the manual for how to be a normal person but hadn't gotten the details right.
But for most politicians, dogs are no-downside campaign enhancers: friendly foils, emollient front-animals, reliable comic relief providers, and slobbery good will ambassadors. They can make even the chilliest candidate seem warmer.
According to the most recent survey of pet owners by the American Pet Products Association, a trade group, some 63.4 million American households have dogs, a state of affairs that creates a natural constituency of citizens who might be disposed toward dog-owning candidates. And dogs make great surrogates, in part because they never say anything, let alone the wrong thing.
Dogs also make excellent presidential props, of course.
President Richard Nixon weathered a financial-improprieties scandal during his vice presidential run in 1952 before becoming president by, in part, speaking eloquently (for him) about Checkers, the dog his family had accepted as a gift. President Herbert Hoover, burdened with a stuffy, stilted image, successfully humanized himself by releasing a photograph in which he communed in a manly yet affectionate manner with his German shepherd, King Tut.
And fans of President Barack Obama loved it when his family brought Bo and then Sunny, Portuguese water dogs, into the White House, even after Sunny knocked down a 2-year-old visitor.
(The exception to all this, as is so often the case, is President Donald Trump, who regularly compares his enemies to dogs in terms unflattering to the dogs, and is the only president in 100 years not to have installed a First Dog in the White House. But the normal rules of politics generally don't apply to him. He doesn't even have a cat.)
Many of the Democratic candidates for president have dogs, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who has two: Champ and Major, both German shepherds. The two make occasional social media appearances, most notably this past Christmas, when Biden tweeted out holiday greetings that showed the dogs in a "Home Alone"-style video rooting under the tree, munching on Christmas cookies and cavorting with what looked like a squeaky stuffed Santa toy.
Meanwhile, Warren's and Buttigieg's dogs are highly visible features of their campaigns, in notably different ways.
Bailey has been a rambunctious part of Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination since he came into her family's life, a gift of her husband, Bruce, in 2018. He travels in the car with the couple when they drive to New Hampshire for campaign events and had been a stand in for the senator in Iowa - when she was stuck in Washington at the president's impeachment trial.
"He's still a puppy, but he has that incredible love-the-people mentality," the candidate's son and sometime dogsitter, Alex Warren, said last month at the campaign's field office in Cambridge.
Alex Warren, 43, had brought Bailey to a meet-the-dog event for volunteers.
Introduced as "our future first dog," Bailey proved a charismatic if unpredictable surrogate, whacking things with his tail, rolling around with his paws in the air, munching on hoodies and slobbering on the volunteers.
"The selfie line with Bailey is a really acrobatic experience," Alex Warren said.
Alex Warren, an IT consultant, took a disciplined approach to the interview, confining his answers to the subject of Bailey.
But he did reveal that he and his wife have their own dog, Oberon, aka Obi Warren Kenobi, and that Obi and Bailey spent last Halloween together. Obi dressed as Batdog, and Bailey was festooned with two large pennies to depict Warren's belief that wealth over $50 million should be subject to a 2% annual surcharge.
"That's the scariest costume the wealthy will ever see," a user named Zach tweeted in response.
Bailey is a popular figure in the wider canine community in Fresh Pond park in Cambridge. "A lot of us recognize Bailey before we see the senator," said Jennifer Kay Goodman, 53, who showed up at the campaign event with Pelé, her Boston terrier, and some homemade dog biscuits.
Dog ownership is a good quality in a candidate, she said. "If you can take care of a dog, and dogs like you, it says a lot about your character."
But while Bailey is a flesh-and-blood participant in campaign events, the Buttigieg pets, Truman and Buddy, are mainly virtual ones, at least so far. They regularly appear in the social media feeds of the candidate and his husband. But their Twitter account (@firstdogsSB), is popular, with 90,500 followers.
Fans follow the ups and downs of the dogs' lives, learning of their hopes and passions, including those that have to do with peanut butter. In October, the subject was Buddy's Halloween costume, a shiny green-and-yellow outfit, the meaning of which was unclear at first.
"OMG GOT MY HALOSWEEN COSTUM," the dog (or someone in the voice of the dog) wrote. "DO YOU WANT TO SEEZ IT OMG I AM so EXCITE."
But what was it, exactly? The caption on the photo said it: "ACVOCADO."
The Buttigieg dogs have taken a bold approach to the classic Twitter conundrum: Do you say some normal thing while abiding by conventional rules of spelling, grammar and punctuation, or are we pioneering a whole new freestyling vernacular in which there seems to be no filter between our random fleeting thoughts and our thrilled belief that other people want to hear them?
Don't ask the Buttigieg campaign. "Buddy and Truman have full creative control over their Twitter account," Tess Whittlesey, deputy national press secretary, said via email.
As for the dogs' part in the campaign: "The dogs primarily serve in the important role of South Bend representatives for the campaign while Pete and Chasten are on the road," she said. "They have quite the following in South Bend as well, and always enjoy running into friends and neighbors when they are walking around the city. They haven't hit the campaign trail quite yet, but hope to soon."
Interestingly enough, Bailey does not have his own social media account. An independent fan account (@FirstDogBailey) is operated by Robert Abare, 28, who works for a think tank in Washington.
In contrast to the Buttigieg dogs' Twitter account, which is managed by humans "as if they're actually dogs who can't speak English and don't understand what Twitter is," Abare said, "I took an approach that Warren is an intellectual who is running this aggressive campaign focused on issues like corruption."
In Abare's rendering, Bailey reflects his owner's politics.
"Buddy and Truman never make political statements, but I try to make Bailey into this progressive-warrior-like golden retriever," he said. "I make little jokes that blend dog humor with economic progressive activism."
"Hi! I'm Bailey Warren," the account's pinned tweet says. "I like long walks, belly rubs, and financial regulations that hold billionaires and corporations accountable."
Recent posts have touched on such topics as Warren's attitude toward the rich ("Mom put billionaire tears in my water bowl") and, after Bloomberg's weird nose-shake with the dog in New Hampshire, "Hmmm shake my paw, not my teeth thx Mike."
The account currently has 26,700 followers.
"People respond to the tweets as if I'm actually a dog," Abare said. "Sometimes I wonder if people are crazy."

Leader, actress hit with big lawsuit over NXIVM cult

Texto completo: Dozens of people who say they were bilked out of thousands of dollars and left emotionally and physically abused filed a federal lawsuit this week against NXIVM, the cult-like group that drew international headlines when some of its members were branded with their leader's initials.
The lawsuit accuses Keith Raniere, actress Allison Mack and 13 other NXIVM leaders of playing various roles in a pyramid scheme that doubled as a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, one that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and illegal human experimentation.
The complaint was filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court by actress Sarah Edmondson; Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman who dated Raniere in the 1990s; filmmaker Mark Vicente; and more than 70 former NXIVM members kept anonymous.
They are seeking monetary damages, asking a federal judge to determine how much they are owed for their pain and suffering.
NXIVM, now defunct, was based in the Albany suburbs.
"Defendants exerted power over the Plaintiffs; took their money; made it financially, physically and psychologically difficult, and in some cases impossible, to leave the coercive community; and systematically abused Plaintiffs physically and emotionally," the plaintiffs attorneys, led by Neil Glazer, wrote in the 189-page complaint.
NXIVM leaders found guilty in 2019 The expansive lawsuit explores the various ways Raniere, a Rockland County native who billed himself as one of the smartest men in the world, and NXIVM are alleged to have systematically abused its members, coercing them into spending their money on purported self-help classes and making them psychologically dependent on his teachings.
Raniere, Mack and four other NXIVM leaders — including Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune — were convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes related to the group last year. They are awaiting sentencing.
Mack, one of Raniere's most-devoted followers, is best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville."
Attorneys for Mack and Raniere did not immediately respond to comment Thursday. But Raniere's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told The New York Times he thinks the civil suit will benefit his client's chances on appeal.
"As several of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit testified at trial that they were not planning on bringing a lawsuit, Keith's chances on appeal just increased," Mr. Agnifilo said in a statement, according to the newspaper.
Civil suit details alleged abuse The civil suit recounts much of what was revealed during Raniere's trial and more.
At the trial, Mack was accused of helping run a NXIVM subgroup known as DOS, a master-slave group that was ultimately led by Raniere himself, though some members other than Mack didn't know it.
The women were branded near their pubic area with a logo containing Raniere's initials, while some were groomed to become Raniere's sexual partners. They were forced to give up naked photographs and other damaging information that was held as collateral in case they ever revealed the existence of the group.
Edmondson, who was among those branded, ultimately blew the whistle on the group, setting in motion a criminal investigation that led to Raniere's conviction.
Along with the branding, the lawsuit also details Natalie's years of court battles with Raniere, which came after she ended an eight-year relationship with him.
Raniere and NXIVM officials, backed with Bronfman's fortune, bombarded Natalie with lawsuits and court filings that cost her thousands of dollars and kept her tied up in court for years, even intervening in her and her mother's personal bankruptcy proceedings.
The civil suit lays out 10 different claims, ranging from racketeering to battery to malicious abuse of the legal process.
Along with Raniere and Mack, the lawsuit also names Clare Bronfman, her sister Sara, Nicki Clyne, Nancy Salzman and Lauren Salzman as defendants, along with NXIVM and 11 other individuals or companies with ties to the group.
Clyne, like Mack, was an actress and Raniere follower. She played the role of Cally Henderson Tyrol in the Sci-Fi Channel reboot of "Battlestar Galactica."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States was "hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
The number of attacks, detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008, highlights the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.
"Both overall enemy-initiated attacks and effective enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded same-period levels in every year since recording began in 2010," said the report, which was released Friday.
The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.
The tally is one of the few remaining public barometers for the United States' war effort in Afghanistan after the U.S. military command there stopped releasing or classified others, such as the number of Afghan casualties and the percentage of districts controlled by the Afghan government versus Taliban forces.
"There's so little you can publicly talk about that garners importance," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said Thursday.
This type of information has been used in the past to extrapolate a trend toward victory or defeat over the course of the war, but ultimately it has foretold little in the United States' longest conflict.
The expansion of the U.S. air campaign seemed to mirror the increase in Taliban attacks.
In 2019, U.S. military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs and missiles - a record number since the Air Force began recording the data in 2006, according to recently released Air Force documents.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Special Operations missions had increased by 124% from 2018, according to military documents, a rate that most likely continued throughout 2019.
In 2019, the U.S. military command in the country, led by Gen. Austin Miller, focused on inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban in an effort to keep its leadership involved in peace negotiations taking place in Doha, Qatar.
The offensives also aimed to push back the insurgent group to both lower Afghan casualties and hold what territory remained under government control.
But the increase in military operations from the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban are not without cost. There were more than 8,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2019, according to U.N. data.
Twenty U.S. troops died during combat operations in 2019, the most in any year since 2014.

Texto completo: Facebook is an easy target. The company is criticized by the right for perceived liberal bias and the left for its role in disseminating political falsehoods.
And in this election year, the heat is on.
But it wasn't until recently that we learned former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the presidency, wants to put limits on Facebook and revoke a federal law that the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as "the most important law protecting free speech online." That would be a very big deal.
Understanding what's at stake may take a little reminiscing. If you were online in the early 1990s, it meant you had a subscription to a private service called CompuServe, Prodigy or America Online. AOL would excitedly advise you, "You've got mail." It was a time when that sounded like good news rather than a threat. Our interaction online was pretty limited. Essentially, you could post your views on electronic bulletin boards. And if you insulted someone, it would take some time for that to register, thanks to our 2400-baud modems.
Soon came ever-more accessible operating systems and browsers, and an unprecedented blossoming of online communication. We could all share our views in real time on sites hosted by media and technology companies, or on platforms created by a new generation of entrepreneurs.
Rare wisdom from Congress The marketplace of ideas would grow exponentially online. It was the fulfillment of the ideals of the First Amendment and its promise of free speech for all. But there was a hitch to this exciting development.
If websites provided open access to those who wanted to share their views, what would happen if those posts were lies or libels? Aggrieved parties would sue the companies that allowed the post. The companies couldn't possibly check every post for accuracy, so they'd be sued out of existence.
In its wisdom (occasionally it happens), Congress passed a law in 1996 to help ensure that this free flow of views would continue: the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, specifying that sites on the internet would not be held liable for the defamatory posts of others.
Picture a country store in a small town where people drop by and talk on the front porch. There will be local gossip, buffoons and braggarts, but the store owner faces no consequences. He's just providing his porch.
Those who defame others online can still be sued, but the conduits for those views are largely free of liability. Yes, some of that free speech online is ugly and manipulative, but thanks to Section 230, a wealth of speech remains fluid and free. For now.
Facebook has earned criticism In a December interview published Jan. 17, Biden told The New York Times that Section 230 "should be revoked because (Facebook) is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false."
Facebook has earned a lot of the criticism coming its way. For all of its talk of lofty ideals, it has demonstrated time and again that it's all about revenue. The company has even refused to review political advertising for falsehoods or bar microtargeting of Facebook users, based on the principle that "people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public."
Translation: "We'll cash their checks and let them lie. You figure it out."
There's certainly merit in revisiting Section 230. We're a long way from dial-up modems. Even so, the notion that we should revoke a law that keeps the free exchange of ideas flowing all over the world is dangerous.
Yes, we need to fight the onslaught of foreign and domestic hackers and bots intended to mislead Americans, sow divisions and undermine our elections. But we can't effectively fight those who would undermine American principles by losing sight of them ourselves.

Texto completo: The Iowa caucuses on Monday and the New Hampshire primary the following week may settle a family argument that has deeply divided the left wing of the Democratic party: Is their candidate Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren?
As Sanders has emerged as a favorite in recent polls from Iowa and New Hampshire, The Courant asked backers of the two candidates across Connecticut to describe their choice, using up to three words. We gathered 26 detailed written and verbal responses.
Sanders supporters most often referred to the Vermont senator with words such as "honest" or "integrity," "consistent," "bold" and "authentic." The Warren camp used words such as "empathetic" or "compassionate," "intelligent" or "brilliant," "receptive" and "qualified." Several of those words and others ("fighter" and "tough" among them) came back for both candidates.
Not surprisingly, health care, the environment, financial regulation, taxing the rich and eliminating student debt are key issues for both groups.
A recent Hartford Courant/Sacred Heart poll found that while former Vice President Joe Biden remains the favorite among Connecticut Democrats, Sanders and Warren are battling for second place. The poll found that 33% of Democrats in Connecticut would vote for Biden to be the party's presidential nominee, followed by Sanders (19.3%), Warren (17.8%) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (11.2%).
In recent weeks, Sanders has emerged as a clear favorite over Warren, as the Massachusetts senator has faded. An Iowa State poll last week found that Sanders was pulling support from about 10% of people who had previously supported Warren. Another recent national poll had former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg edging ahead of Warren for the first time.
For some left-leaning Connecticut Democrats, choosing between Sanders, who has essentially been running for president for the last five years, and Warren, who bills herself as the candidate who can unite the party, hasn't been easy.
"[It] was something that I spent a lot of time reflecting on, because I did support Sanders in 2016," Janée Woods Weber, a West Hartford resident, said. "For this election, I'm with Elizabeth Warren because I have seen her explicitly and consistently center the needs of people of color, in particular black women, in her policies and in her approaches."
Others have no problem picking one over the other.
"It was not a tough decision to make whatsoever," Oren Schweitzer of New Haven wrote to The Courant. "Bernie is far better than Warren when it comes to healthcare, the environment, labor, trade, housing and pretty much every other issue, especially foreign policy."
With the Iowa Caucus approaching, Sanders is surging in Iowa, where he leads by an average of 3.5% and New Hampshire, where his lead over Warren is a more solid 9.5%, according to RealClear Politics' average of leading polls. Biden leads by five points nationally, but Sanders appears to be gaining ground.
Warren's poll numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire, meanwhile, dropped recently - despite endorsements by the Des Moines Register and the New York Times (a co-endorsement with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar). Connecticut Secretary of the State Denise Merrill endorsed Warren in December.
Warren supporters who gathered at state Sen. Matt Lesser's house in Middletown on Jan. 25 talked up their candidate's strengths - her numerous, detailed policy positions; her readiness to jump in and make immediate changes; her intelligence and empathy - while taking care not to denigrate Sanders.
"The thing that's so impressive about [Warren] is that she's got a plan to get things done on day one," said Lesser. "She can be that unifying voice, a progressive who doesn't run away from the values of the Democratic Party, who understands the problems that families are facing in a real way, not a theoretical way."
Laura Merriman, a North Haven resident, backed Sanders in 2016, but quietly hoped Warren would run. She is drawn to Warren's personal appeal - and the fact that she's a woman.
"It's actually funny because I took that Washington Post quiz, and it showed me with Bernie," said Merriman. "It showed me that I actually I had more in common with his views than with Warren, even though for me guns is a huge thing, and I really don't like that stance of his."
Lesser, Merriman and other Warren voters said they'd vote for Sanders if he ends up being the Democratic nominee. Some, like Trumbull resident Kristin Whitehead, had strong reservations.
"I do worry about Bernie's socialism stance and whether he could win a general election," Whitehead said. "It would just be difficult for me to support him. But you know, I very much admire Bernie for all he has done for social justice throughout his life. I'm not averse to voting for Bernie, but I just feel like Elizabeth is the better candidate at this moment in time in our democracy."
UConn political science professor Ronald Schurin characterized Sanders as "angry," "principled" and "divisive." Warren, he added, is "personable," "smart" and "narrow ... meaning everything leads to a focus on wiping out corruption."
"Bernie is thought of as being more pie-in-the-sky, while Warren tends to have more detailed plans," Schurin said. "Another difference is that Warren says she believes in capitalism, while Sanders explicitly supports socialism."
Feuding between Sanders and Warren culminated in a tense exchange at the Jan. 15 Democratic primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, during which Sanders denied telling Warren that a woman couldn't win the presidency. (After the debate, Warren allegedly accused Sanders of calling her a liar on national television.)
As a result, Merriman worried about Sanders voters who are saying "Bernie or nothing."
"I think that's very dangerous. I never liked the term Bernie Bro. I never thought that that was a thing. But I do think that [Sanders] needs to do a better job of addressing that we're all in this together."
Although the Connecticut primary isn't until April 28, many supporters of Sanders and Warren aren't waiting. Caravans have been heading north to campaign for the two candidates for weeks.
"Unfortunately, Connecticut is late in the game, so without New Hampshire, and even Massachusetts, there's no Connecticut," said Sanders organizer Mark Gardner. "We're really focusing all our efforts up in New Hampshire."
Early on Jan. 25, Gardner and other Sanders supporters gathered in an East Hartford park-and-ride lot for a rally, before driving up to knock on doors in New Hampshire. Some said their candidate has been more consistent than Warren and simply has been doing it longer, while taking no campaign money from corporations.
"I respect all of the candidates, and I will support whoever the party selects at the end of the day," said state Sen. Saud Anwar. "[Sanders] has been right on the issues from day one, and [Warren] is progressive as well. I just feel that he has far more experience and also far more long-term appropriate responses on issues than she does, between the two. But I respect her."
Angie Parkinson, who serves on the East Hartford Town Council, said the pivotal issue that distinguishes Sanders from other democratic candidates is that "he does not take money from corporations and PACs and billionaires. ... Honestly, we know that if you take someone's money, that's who you're representing."
"Warren's my number two for sure," Parkinson added. "I think it's time for a woman president. I absolutely do."

Cyber flashing: Sending unsolicited explicit pics is the tip of our toxic sexual culture

Resumen: We need to do more for the women who receive unsolicited, inappropriate pictures. Changing laws is a start, but we also have to change the culture.

Texto completo: If you’ve waded into the jungle of online dating, chances are you’ve been exposed to a graphic image that you never wanted to see — especially if you’re a young woman.
Over half of women ages 18 to 29 have received an explicit image they never asked for, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study. Among all women, 32% have, while 30% of men have.
It’s so widespread a problem that one internet user, Kelsey Bressler, working with a friend, developed a filter that would allow women to not see explicit images sent to their messages. Bressler’s actions, she wrote in Huffington Post, came after she received a photo on her phone of a man's penis and the message, “Why don’t you talk to me?”
Lawmakers making changes
Now lawmakers are starting to consider making “cyber” flashing, as it’s dubbed, illegal.
In January, California state Sen. Ling Ling Chang, a Republican, introduced legislation that would make it illegal to send unsolicited nude images, punishable by a fine. Just last year, Texas became one of the first states to ban such behavior, instituting fines up to $500.
In 2018, as New York female subway passengers dealt with unwanted sexual images sent via AirDrop to their phones, several city council members introduced legislation to discourage the practice, recommending up to a year in jail, a $1,000 fine or both. As Joseph Borelli, a Republican council member and a co-sponsor of the legislation, told The New York Times, “Technology has made it significantly easier to be a creep. ”
But the fact that this is a real enough problem to warrant lawmaker attention shows how little #MeToo has made inroads in our culture.
Similarly, the new focus on consent in recent years seems to be a band-aid, not a comprehensive solution. There are contracts for college students to sign to indicate consent to sexual activity, and there are now even apps for people to use to sign a consent contract before sex.
While a renewed attention to consent is welcome, it’s also just the most basic human decency when it comes to sexual encounters and sharing explicit images.
Consider resigned Rep. Katie Hill’s comments in The Times regarding the sexual images of her that circulated online: “I was overwhelmed by everything — by how many people had seen my naked body, by the comments, the articles, the millions of opinions, the texts, the calls. I would start shaking, crying, throwing up. ”
Sexual assault: The Harvey Weinstein story is about more than Harvey Weinstein
While the California Democrat’s case raises interesting questions about transparency, and voters’ rights to know about the character of their lawmaker, shouldn’t we be able to agree that such measures should be accomplished without exposing private images to the whole internet?
Why send out unsolicited pictures?
Ultimately, the problem in our culture right now seems to be rooted in a me-first mindset of so many — an attitude that prioritizes personal sexual gratification over honoring and respecting the human dignity of others, including would-be sexual partners.
“Men who reported having sent unsolicited (penis pictures) demonstrated higher levels of narcissism and endorsed greater ambivalent and hostile sexism than their nonsending counterparts,” reported researchers in a July article for the Journal of Sex Research.
In other words: Pair focus on self with little respect for women, and you’ve got the formula for the kind of jerk who think it’s a swell idea to send explicit images without consent.
The modern sexual revolution is generally depicted as a welcome liberation, the beginning of a new era of pleasure. But is that interpretation correct? Watching “Little Women” — the hit Oscar-nominated movie from brilliant director Greta Gerwig — it is easy to be wistful for an era where men sought to improve themselves to win women’s hearts, and where a tender gesture of love was secretly holding onto a lady’s glove, not sending her a graphic sexual image. Sure, I wouldn’t like the dauntingly limited career prospects of the “Little Women” heroines, but are we so confident their romantic lives were more stifling than ours?
Men are victims, and advocates, too: For male survivors of sexual assault — like me — #MeToo can help change culture of silence
Undergirding our modern sexual mores is the notion that sexual intimacy can be achieved, and achieved without pain to either partner, without actual personal intimacy — the kind that can only be acquired by communication and companionship over a period of time, not a few hours at a bar.
In fact, that same Journal of Sex Research article found that “the most frequently reported motivational category for sending genital images was a transactional mindset (i. e. , motivated by hopes of receiving images in return), while the most commonly desired reaction from recipients was that of sexual excitement. ” Sending these pictures may just be a way to cut short the conversation and go straight to the sexual activity.
Curbing the sending of inappropriate sexual images to strangers is a good first step. But when it comes to healing the toxic, often selfish norms of our sexual culture, much more is needed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States was "hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
The number of attacks, detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008, highlights the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.
"Both overall enemy-initiated attacks and effective enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded same-period levels in every year since recording began in 2010," said the report, which was released Friday.
The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.
The tally is one of the few remaining public barometers for the United States' war effort in Afghanistan after the U.S. military command there stopped releasing or classified others, such as the number of Afghan casualties and the percentage of districts controlled by the Afghan government versus Taliban forces.
"There's so little you can publicly talk about that garners importance," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said Thursday.
This type of information has been used in the past to extrapolate a trend toward victory or defeat over the course of the war, but ultimately it has foretold little in the United States' longest conflict.
The expansion of the U.S. air campaign seemed to mirror the increase in Taliban attacks.
In 2019, U.S. military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs and missiles - a record number since the Air Force began recording the data in 2006, according to recently released Air Force documents.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Special Operations missions had increased by 124% from 2018, according to military documents, a rate that most likely continued throughout 2019.
In 2019, the U.S. military command in the country, led by Gen. Austin Miller, focused on inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban in an effort to keep its leadership involved in peace negotiations taking place in Doha, Qatar.
The offensives also aimed to push back the insurgent group to both lower Afghan casualties and hold what territory remained under government control.
But the increase in military operations from the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban are not without cost. There were more than 8,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2019, according to U.N. data.
Twenty U.S. troops died during combat operations in 2019, the most in any year since 2014.

Texto completo: Our series "How I became a ..." digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From her beginnings working in the restaurant scene to becoming a cook with viral recipes such as #TheCookies and #TheStew, Alison Roman is quite the culinary jill-of-all-trades. As the bestselling author of cookbooks "Dining In" and "Nothing Fancy" as well as a columnist for New York Times Cooking and Bon Appétit, Roman always has her hands on a keyboard or working on a stovetop.
USA TODAY caught up with the food writer and chef extraordinaire to talk about everything from Joan Didion and oat milk to learning to say no and consistently cultivating staying power in everything she does.
Question: How did you get your start?
Alison Roman: I started by working in kitchens, working in restaurants as a pastry cook. That looks very different than my life does now, but I was working in restaurants and doing service and coming up with dishes that went on menus, things like that.
It basically all relates to each other. I don't think that I would have been as strong of a writer about food had I not cooked professionally and had that background experience. It also teaches you a ridiculous work ethic that is challenging to find elsewhere.
Q: What does a typical day look like for you?
Roman: A typical day is super atypical. It really depends – if I'm shooting photos or videos or shopping for those things, or I'm doing neither and I'm writing or traveling or running errands and trying to stay on top of my general life administration. I feel like I do so many different things all the time that there truly is no typical day, which makes things very challenging.
Q: What's your favorite part about your job?
Roman: It's different all the time; it pushes me creatively and intellectually, and I get to have contact with people and teach them things and have an impact on their lives. It's a completely unique experience to be in people's homes and be a part of their lives, even if it feels one-sided because I don't actually know them. But, just to have a lasting impact that feels a bit different than, say, cooking for them in a restaurant (which can obviously have a really deep impact, but it's just a different style).
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Roman: Really hard work, and not letting things that I find challenging deter me. I think that I have come up against a lot of things that I struggled with, but I've never thought that meant I shouldn't be doing what I wanted to be doing.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule?
Roman: That's something I'm working on. I think that as I get more secure in my career and more successful, it's much easier for me to kind of say no to things and to make time for myself, my friends, and protect my space and personal life. I find that to be easier and easier, and I think I'm getting there. But, just understanding that I'm not going to be very good at my job or to anyone else if I am feeling run ragged because I haven't set aside any time for myself.
Q: What have been some career highlights?
Roman: I'll never forget the first time I was published in Bon Appetit, I'll never forget the first time I got a job as a pastry chef, I'll never forget being recognized for the things that I was putting on menus in restaurants, I'll never forget my first column in The New York Times or making The New York Times bestseller's list, or these milestones that I feel like only happen once that truly do feel so, so special.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Roman: Try different things. Always say yes. Push yourself. Just know that it's not going to be easy. Nothing just falls into your lap, and if it does it's not going to last for very long. You have to constantly be thinking about how to make something secure and stable. Things will come your way, and you may achieve a small amount of success by accident, but in order to really keep it and have staying power, you have to actually work at it, and work really hard. It's like a plant that you have to water and feed and take care of.
Quick hits
What's your coffee order? Oat milk cortado, iced black, or a regular black.
What's your favorite book? I'm really bad at favorites, but I'm rereading "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" right now, which is so good.
What's your favorite song at the moment? I've been listening to a lot of King Princess.
Who have been your biggest mentors? I've been really lucky to have many mentors in the various stages of my career, but I have two chefs I worked for – Ron Mendoza and William Werner – who really helped shape a lot of my work ethic and basic understanding of pastry, cooking, and baking. As I moved more into editorial, I had a lot of really great champions. Christine Muhlke and Adam Rapoport were both so wonderful at championing me and pursuing my own thing.
What's the coolest thing you've ever done? My whole life is really cool. I feel very fortunate and happy to have done several cool things. I was actually just thinking that today while we were shooting videos for The New York Times. I find as much joy in that as if I'm recording [a podcast] with NPR or going on a vacation to Mexico. The coolest thing I've done is shape my life to be able to do a bunch of cool things.
Alison Roman started her career by working in kitchens and in restaurants as a pastry chef.

Biden is wrong about internet free speech

Texto completo: Facebook is an easy target. The company is criticized by the right for perceived liberal bias and the left for its role in disseminating political falsehoods. And in this election year, the heat is on.
But it wasn't until this month that we learned former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the presidency, wants to put limits on Facebook and revoke a federal law that the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as "the most important law protecting free speech online." That would be a very big deal.
Understanding what's at stake may take a little reminiscing. If you were online in the early 1990s, it meant you had a subscription to a private service called CompuServe, Prodigy or America Online. AOL would excitedly advise you, "You've got mail." It was a time when that sounded like good news rather than a threat.
Our interaction online was pretty limited. Essentially, you could post your views on electronic bulletin boards. And if you insulted someone, it would take some time for that to register, thanks to our 2400-baud modems.
Soon came ever more accessible operating systems and browsers, and an unprecedented blossoming of online communication. We could all share our views in real time on sites hosted by media and technology companies, or on platforms created by a new generation of entrepreneurs.
Rare wisdom from Congress The marketplace of ideas would grow exponentially online. It was the fulfillment of the ideals of the First Amendment and its promise of free speech for all. But there was a hitch to this exciting development.
If websites provided open access to those who wanted to share their views, what would happen if those posts were lies or libels? Aggrieved parties would sue the companies that allowed the post. The companies couldn't possibly check every post for accuracy, so they'd be sued out of existence.
In its wisdom (occasionally it happens), Congress passed a law in 1996 to help ensure that this free flow of views would continue: the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, specifying that sites on the internet would not be held liable for the defamatory posts of others.
Picture a country store in a small town where people drop by and talk on the front porch. There will be local gossip, buffoons and braggarts, but the store owner faces no consequences. He's just providing his porch.
Those who defame others online can still be sued, but the conduits for those views are largely free of liability. Yes, some of that free speech online is ugly and manipulative, but thanks to Section 230, a wealth of speech remains fluid and free. For now.
Facebook has earned criticism In a December interview published Jan. 17, Biden told The New York Times that Section 230 "should be revoked because (Facebook) is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false."
Facebook has earned a lot of the criticism coming its way. For all of its talk of lofty ideals, it has demonstrated time and again that it's all about revenue. The company has even refused to review political advertising for falsehoods or bar microtargeting of Facebook users, based on the principle that "people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public."
Translation: "We'll cash their checks and let them lie. You figure it out."
There's certainly merit in revisiting Section 230. We're a long way from dial-up modems. Even so, the notion that we should revoke a law that keeps the free exchange of ideas flowing all over the world is dangerous.
Yes, we need to fight the onslaught of foreign and domestic hackers and bots intended to mislead Americans, sow divisions and undermine our elections. But we can't effectively fight those who would undermine American principles by losing sight of them ourselves.

Skating Quebec Icy forest mazes and long, winding paths through winter landscapes beckon all skaters

Texto completo: The wait for my rental car at Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport last February was slow, but the talk was breakaway fast. I joined the line with a National Hockey League scout for the New Jersey Devils on his way to a tournament to look at promising teenage skaters.
"Skating is a way of life up here," the native Quebecois said, as my sturdy Nissan SUV pulled up, poised to plow through the snowy roads of southern Quebec where I'd come simply to skate.
As a winter lover who once traveled to Winnipeg to skate that city's sculpture-dotted frozen river in below-zero temperatures, I was intrigued by the icy fount of adventurous possibilities in Quebec, Canada's largest province, where it's possible to escape the oval confines of what we normally think of as ice rinks and skate for long, sinuous stretches on frozen trails through forests and snowy landscapes.
Skating trails can be found across Canada. They embrace the landscape when little is growing but frost and hark back to the origins of skating as a means of travel.
In Quebec, many parks and villages host skating areas that take a variety of forms, from ribbons plowed on rivers to forests that are flooded to create skating mazes.
Several of these ice innovations lie in Mauricie and Lanaudière, two of the 17 administrative regions that make up Quebec province, roughly midway between Montreal and Quebec City.
In terms of tourism, winter is among the busiest seasons here. Snowmobilers come to sled inn-to-inn; "glissades," or sledding runs, abound, from public parks to private resorts; and ice-fishing shanties create pop-up villages of down-padded anglers.
With ice skates in my carry-on, I laced up to explore Quebec's long, winding skating trails in a three-day ice quest.
Island
skating trail
At Trois-Rivières, a two-hour drive from Montreal, the broad and swift St. Lawrence doesn't freeze except in some sheltered bays. A pair of islands in the intersecting St.-Maurice River creates three channels where they meet the larger waterway, giving Trois-Rivières or Three Rivers, the second oldest Francophone city in North America, its name.
On one of those islands, Île St.-Quentin, park managers seasonally flood an ice-skating path that's about 1¼ miles. The frozen maze skirts the seaway, flowing with jagged cells of ice, and weaves into the hardwood forest behind it. Following the contours of the land, it had enough gradual downhills to persuade several skaters to wear helmets.
I laced my skates inside the park's generous field house, which offered fat-tire bike rentals for rides on another trail, shared by snowshoers, that runs for about 2 miles around the periphery of the island.
With just a few skaters sharing the ice on a sunny and windy weekday, I had the "sentier de patin," or ice path, largely to myself, allowing me to skate the route in all directions without fear of collisions. After an exploratory foray, slow and curious, I thrilled to make each iteration different, taking the first alley right away from the river and the second left toward it, circling a warming tent one way, then the other, and edging back on the inland route, taking occasional spurs in unanticipated directions in the exhilarating labyrinth that held me safe in its geometry.
Although the ice trail was quiet, it didn't take long to find Mauricie's winter pilgrims. About 30 miles northeast of town, I checked into Le Baluchon Eco-Resort behind a dozen exhilarated French snowmobilers who were sledding inn to inn.
On the Rivière du Loup, or Wolf River, Le Baluchon offers 89 rooms in a mix of inns and chalets on 1,000 acres featuring about 25 miles of cross-country ski and snowshoe trails, a tubing run and an ice rink with supplied equipment for broomball - a hockey-like game played with brooms and without skates. The sledders headed straight for the Nordic spa to steep in a series of hydrotherapy pools indoors and out.
Later that evening, a full moon lit the riverside trail to the inn's restaurant - acclaimed for its menu using local ingredients in dishes like walleye with Quebec seaweed butter - and waterfalls stilled by ice.
Agritourism
on ice
One winter, when Jean-Pierre Binette and Madeleine Courchesne, beekeepers in rural Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, about an hour north of Trois-Rivières, had three children under age 9, they flooded a small section of woods on their property. Excited by the frozen forest playground, their children invited their friends, who invited their friends. In 1997, the seasonal diversion became a secondary business as Le Domaine de la Forêt Perdue, or the Lost Forest, opened to the public, keeping a form of agritourism alive in winter (in summer, they offer a high-ropes course).
"We were the first skating path in Quebec, and now we are training people who are opening trails around the province," Thérèse Deslauriers, the managing director of the Forêt Perdue, said, as she worked the rustic entry house that doubles as a retail shop for honey products.
Outside, beyond the skate rental tent, more than 9 miles of iceways wove through pine and hardwood forests dotted with farm pens occupied by goats, sheep, ducks, deer and more exotic animals, including an ostrich. Next to the alpaca enclosure, a repurposed phone booth dispensed handfuls of animal feed for a Canadian quarter.
Many skaters brought their lunches. For the less prepared, Forêt Perdue offers a heated snack bar in a tent and a maple candy cabin in the woods.
Inviting though it was, I skipped the snack bar, threw my skates in the car and drove roughly 40 miles east to another of the grand lodges that draw winter fans to Mauricie. Like a castle-size version of a log cabin, Hôtel Sacacomie sits high above frozen Sacacomie Lake, offering wintry panoramas from its pine-hewn dining room with a roaring fire in the fieldstone fireplace - the perfect place to warm up over local smoked trout and duck confit poutine.
A frozen river
After an overnight snowfall of 4 inches, the 5.6-mile skating path on the L'Assomption River at Parc Louis-Querbes in Joliette, about midway between Le Baluchon and Montreal, was already open and plowed by 9 a.m., serving a smattering of speedskaters and slower gliders.
I skated hard for an hour, covering the entire route, and was not alone. Like runners in warmer cities, the earliest Joliette skaters came out to exercise in the light morning traffic. By the time I circled back to the park field house just after 10 a.m., a food shack next to the ice had opened, serving beignets and tea to the growing collection of families teaching their under-10s to skate by holding onto loaner sleds and sharing the wonder of skating on a seasonally stilled river.
I intended to leave the river and head straight to the airport in Montreal but couldn't resist another skating stop so close to it. Diverting 30 minutes north to Bois de Belle-Rivière, I took a final 1.5-mile spin on yet another frozen forest path. In this age of vanishing ice, I skated with a profound appreciation for the transformation of winter and the spirit of ice makers to delight those who love the season.

Texto completo: Dozens of people who say they were bilked out of thousands of dollars and left emotionally and physically abused filed a federal lawsuit this week against NXIVM, the cult-like group that drew international headlines when some of its members were branded with their leader's initials.
The lawsuit accuses Keith Raniere, actress Allison Mack and 13 other NXIVM leaders of playing various roles in a pyramid scheme that doubled as a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, one that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and illegal human experimentation.
The complaint was filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court by actress Sarah Edmondson; Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman who dated Raniere in the 1990s; filmmaker Mark Vicente; and more than 70 former NXIVM members kept anonymous.
They are seeking monetary damages, asking a federal judge to determine how much they are owed for their pain and suffering.
NXIVM, now defunct, was based in the Albany suburbs.
"Defendants exerted power over the Plaintiffs; took their money; made it financially, physically and psychologically difficult, and in some cases impossible, to leave the coercive community; and systematically abused Plaintiffs physically and emotionally," the plaintiffs attorneys, led by Neil Glazer, wrote in the 189-page complaint.
NXIVM leaders found guilty in 2019 The expansive lawsuit explores the various ways Raniere, a Rockland County native who billed himself as one of the smartest men in the world, and NXIVM are alleged to have systematically abused its members, coercing them into spending their money on purported self-help classes and making them psychologically dependent on his teachings.
Raniere, Mack and four other NXIVM leaders — including Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune — were convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes related to the group last year. They are awaiting sentencing.
Mack, one of Raniere's most-devoted followers, is best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville."
Attorneys for Mack and Raniere did not immediately respond to comment Thursday. But Raniere's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told The New York Times he thinks the civil suit will benefit his client's chances on appeal.
"As several of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit testified at trial that they were not planning on bringing a lawsuit, Keith's chances on appeal just increased," Mr. Agnifilo said in a statement, according to the newspaper.
Civil suit details alleged abuse The civil suit recounts much of what was revealed during Raniere's trial and more.
At the trial, Mack was accused of helping run a NXIVM subgroup known as DOS, a master-slave group that was ultimately led by Raniere himself, though some members other than Mack didn't know it.
The women were branded near their pubic area with a logo containing Raniere's initials, while some were groomed to become Raniere's sexual partners. They were forced to give up naked photographs and other damaging information that was held as collateral in case they ever revealed the existence of the group.
Edmondson, who was among those branded, ultimately blew the whistle on the group, setting in motion a criminal investigation that led to Raniere's conviction.
Along with the branding, the lawsuit also details Natalie's years of court battles with Raniere, which came after she ended an eight-year relationship with him.
Raniere and NXIVM officials, backed with Bronfman's fortune, bombarded Natalie with lawsuits and court filings that cost her thousands of dollars and kept her tied up in court for years, even intervening in her and her mother's personal bankruptcy proceedings.
The civil suit lays out 10 different claims, ranging from racketeering to battery to malicious abuse of the legal process.
Along with Raniere and Mack, the lawsuit also names Clare Bronfman, her sister Sara, Nicki Clyne, Nancy Salzman and Lauren Salzman as defendants, along with NXIVM and 11 other individuals or companies with ties to the group.
Clyne, like Mack, was an actress and Raniere follower. She played the role of Cally Henderson Tyrol in the Sci-Fi Channel reboot of "Battlestar Galactica."

26.2-Mile fountain of youth? Training for and finishing a marathon can benefit arteries, new study finds

Texto completo: Complete a first marathon and rejuvenate a major artery. That is the message of an inspiring new study of novice runners and their aortas.
The study finds that training for and finishing a marathon can spruce up arteries, leaving them more flexible, healthy and biologically younger than before, even if runners are older or slow.
But the study also raises some pointed questions about whether a lone marathon is the ideal goal for people hoping to improve their arterial health over the long term.
Inside most of us who are middle-aged or older, arteries are hardening. Our arteries, of course, carry oxygenated blood from our hearts and, when healthy and pliable, expand and contract like bellows as blood pulses through them, keeping the flow smooth and steady.
But with age, our arteries' elasticity declines and they stiffen. Blood begins to jostle and crowd against the vessels' inflexible walls, blood pressure rises, and organs that require an even, gentle stream of blood, like the kidneys and brain, can be affected.
Helpfully, some past research hints that exercise might alter this age-related arterial stiffening. Longtime older athletes, for instance, tend to have relatively supple, responsive arteries.
But most people are not longtime, competitive athletes, and it has not been clear if sedentary people can start to exercise and still improve the state of their arteries.
So, for the new study, which was published in January in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers at University College London and other institutions decided to track the arteries of a group of people who were new to exercise, targeting first-time entrants in an upcoming London Marathon.
The researchers zeroed in on race participants who had reported on entry forms that they were newcomers to the sport and to exercise in general, rarely working out before signing up. The scientists found more than 200 of these men and women, most of them middle-aged and all sedentary, and contacted them six months before race time.
These soon-to-be marathoners agreed to visit the university's lab, completing health and fitness tests and a sophisticated scan of their aorta, designed to measure its flexibility. None of the group showed signs of heart disease or other serious health problems.
Each runner then began his or her preferred marathon-training program, with most jogging a few times a week. This training continued for six months, although some developed injuries or other concerns and dropped out. Ultimately, 136 men and women completed the race, in an average finishing time of 4.5 hours for the men and 5.5 hours for the women. A week or two later, they returned to the lab to repeat the tests.
Their aortas proved to be more flexible now. In fact, their arteries seemed to have shed the equivalent of about four years, in functional terms. The aorta of a 60-year-old marathoner in the study now expanded and contracted about as lithely as that of a 56-year-old participant did at the study's start, and the 56-year-old's arteries worked like those of a prerace 52-year-old, and so on.
These improvements were most marked in older male runners and those whose finishing times had been slowest. They did not depend on changes in runners' fitness or weight, which, in most cases, had been negligible. All that had mattered was that people had kept up with their training and raced.
These findings gratified the researchers, said Dr. Charlotte Manisty, a consulting cardiologist at University College London and the Barts Heart Center, who oversaw the new study. "We had not really known" whether the arteries of sedentary people "could or would benefit" from exercise training, she said, especially if the people were older or notably out of shape. "We just didn't know how much plasticity their arteries still had."
The answer seems to have been plenty, however, she said. "Almost everyone benefited," Manisty said, "and those people whose arteries needed the most help benefited the most."
But these results do not consider the large number of would-be marathon racers in the study who did not make it to the start line. It is also unknown whether the rejuvenation of runners' aortas is likely to last or if the benefits will be lost if they do not continue to run.
"Exercise is great for the entire body, including the arteries," said Dr. Julio Chirinos, an associate professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study.
It's also uncertain whether someone must go the full 26.2 miles to improve arterial health, Chirinos said. "Is this the best dose" of exercise to produce healthier, more-youthful arteries, he asked. Perhaps less training would be sufficient, or different exercises of varying intensities, or any routine people will continue for the long haul.
Manisty agreed. "We really do not know the threshold amount of exercise needed" to gain the benefits seen in her study, she said.
But she and her colleagues expect in the future to study the effects of training for other, shorter events and also include people who have existing heart disease, high blood pressure and other health concerns.

Empty nests branch out Baby boomers are staying in their homes longer - and taking on makeovers and renovations to suit their new lifestyle

Texto completo: After the hectic years of child-rearing end and grown children move out, many empty nesters find themselves in a state of adjustment.
While some rejoice in their leaner schedules and newfound quiet, others deal with loneliness and depression, often referred to as empty-nest syndrome. In either case, most empty nesters eventually reach a point where they ask themselves: Is it time to downsize, upsize or just renovate and configure their current home?
A recent report from Freddie Mac found that baby boomers have stayed in their homes much longer than previous generations. A 2019 report from Houzz, a home-remodeling website, found that 60% of baby boomers - defined as people ages 55 to 74 - planned to stay in their homes for the next 11 or more years. Older Americans tend to move into residential care communities in their mid-80s, according to data available from the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For those who opt to stay in their empty nests, many decide it is a good time to finally do the renovations they might have put off in previous years. These home makeovers tend to fall into three broad categories: fixing a space to make room for a new lifestyle or hobby; sprucing up a now unused space so it can be rented out to create a new revenue stream; or renovating to make a home more comfortable for visits from adult children and their expanding families.
Taking the time to figure out how you want your empty nest to affect your lifestyle will help you figure out how to reconfigure a home, said Robin Baron, an interior designer with her own firm in Manhattan. Many of her empty-nest clients have approached her after deciding they want to "entertain more," but she's had to pick apart what that means.
Do you want to have more dinner or cocktail parties? Do you want to host fundraisers or just have several friends over for a movie night? Will you do the cooking or hire caterers? "The word 'entertain' is too broad, so you must narrow that down, then come up with the design," she said.
Mary Ann Gioeli, a publishing executive, said she knew immediately what she wanted to do when her son moved out. About two weeks after Ryan, now 30, left their Upper West Side apartment for the Air Force in 2014, she threw out the "gross" black leather couch that was in his room and repainted the formerly bright blue space a neutral white. To turn the room into a den, she bought new furniture, including a pullout couch, and moved the television from the living room.
For Gioeli, 67, this was the first step in transforming her three-bedroom apartment into a more adult space. Although she was thrilled her home had been the go-to hangout for her son and daughter, Francesca, now 32, and their friends during their adolescence, she longed to turn the large, bright apartment into a quieter space. "Somewhere you can have a conversation," she said.
When her daughter left to rent her own apartment in 2016, Gioeli turned her bedroom into a proper guest room. Out went the dated furniture, in came a queen-size bed. These renovations cost a few thousand dollars and were paid for from savings, said Gioeli, who is separated from her husband.
In late 2016, she finally tackled what the family had longed to do: a complete revamp of the dated bathrooms. A tub in the master bath was removed, and a walk-in shower was installed. Double sinks and new storage spaces were added, as well as a new marble floor. The guest bathroom was also thoroughly updated, with a glass-encased shower replacing a former closet space. A home-equity loan covered the $65,000 price tag to renovate both bathrooms.
"I told my kids they will always have a home to return to," said Gioeli, whose daughter boomeranged back home last year. "But it's been great to be able to open up my home and have friends stay over."
Some empty nesters decide to turn their now unused space into extra income. Hollis Giammatteo, a writer, used about $180,000 from savings to gut-renovate her daughter's old basement bedroom and turn it into an Airbnb rental. Inspired by a friend who had done something similar, Giammatteo, who lives in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, said she preferred to lease the space short term because the city is a high-demand tourist and business destination and she is able to keep the unit regularly booked. She said that using an online portal had made it easy to block out specific days when friends and family planned to stay with her. She estimated she had grossed around $125,000 since her first rental in 2015.
That said, she advises those interested in turning unused space into a short-term rental to investigate local laws. "You have to be willing to take on bureaucracy," Giammatteo, 71, said. Depending on the area, you may need insurance, a business license and to pay taxes on income, she said.
Updating a home's look, not preparing it for sale, was the goal of 71% of consumers age 50 and older who either had completed a home renovation in the past two years or were in the middle of or planning to begin a remodel in the next six months, according to a survey taken by the Schlesinger Group for Sweeten, an online renovation platform.
"We see renovations ranging from updating a bathroom to include a two-person soaking tub to gut remodels that convert bedrooms into hobby rooms - from art to yoga," said Jean Brownhill, Sweeten's founder.
That said, experts suggest that homeowners check with a local broker before starting a large-scale renovation to see if their design will have resale value.
"Even if you have no plans to sell the home for another 10 years, it's a wise thing to do," said Dave Goscinski, the owner of JJED Remodeling in Dumont, New Jersey. "You're doing the renovation for yourselves, but can you recoup the investment later?"

Texto completo: The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States was "hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
The number of attacks, detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008, highlights the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.
"Both overall enemy-initiated attacks and effective enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded same-period levels in every year since recording began in 2010," said the report, which was released Friday.
The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.
The tally is one of the few remaining public barometers for the United States' war effort in Afghanistan after the U.S. military command there stopped releasing or classified others, such as the number of Afghan casualties and the percentage of districts controlled by the Afghan government versus Taliban forces.
"There's so little you can publicly talk about that garners importance," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said Thursday.
This type of information has been used in the past to extrapolate a trend toward victory or defeat over the course of the war, but ultimately it has foretold little in the United States' longest conflict.
The expansion of the U.S. air campaign seemed to mirror the increase in Taliban attacks.
In 2019, U.S. military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs and missiles - a record number since the Air Force began recording the data in 2006, according to recently released Air Force documents.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Special Operations missions had increased by 124% from 2018, according to military documents, a rate that most likely continued throughout 2019.
In 2019, the U.S. military command in the country, led by Gen. Austin Miller, focused on inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban in an effort to keep its leadership involved in peace negotiations taking place in Doha, Qatar.
The offensives also aimed to push back the insurgent group to both lower Afghan casualties and hold what territory remained under government control.
But the increase in military operations from the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban are not without cost. There were more than 8,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2019, according to U.N. data.
Twenty U.S. troops died during combat operations in 2019, the most in any year since 2014.

Texto completo: The wait for my rental car at Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport last February was slow, but the talk was breakaway fast. I joined the line with a National Hockey League scout for the New Jersey Devils on his way to a tournament to look at promising teenage skaters.
"Skating is a way of life up here," the native Quebecois said, as my sturdy Nissan SUV pulled up, poised to plow through the snowy roads of southern Quebec where I'd come simply to skate.
As a winter lover who once traveled to Winnipeg to skate that city's sculpture-dotted frozen river in below-zero temperatures, I was intrigued by the icy fount of adventurous possibilities in Quebec, Canada's largest province, where it's possible to escape the oval confines of what we normally think of as ice rinks and skate for long, sinuous stretches on frozen trails through forests and snowy landscapes.
Skating trails can be found across Canada. They embrace the landscape when little is growing but frost and hark back to the origins of skating as a means of travel.
In Quebec, many parks and villages host skating areas that take a variety of forms, from ribbons plowed on rivers to forests that are flooded to create skating mazes.
Several of these ice innovations lie in Mauricie and Lanaudière, two of the 17 administrative regions that make up Quebec province, roughly midway between Montreal and Quebec City.
In terms of tourism, winter is among the busiest seasons here. Snowmobilers come to sled inn-to-inn; "glissades," or sledding runs, abound, from public parks to private resorts; and ice-fishing shanties create pop-up villages of down-padded anglers.
With ice skates in my carry-on, I laced up to explore Quebec's long, winding skating trails in a three-day ice quest.
Island
skating trail
At Trois-Rivières, a two-hour drive from Montreal, the broad and swift St. Lawrence doesn't freeze except in some sheltered bays. A pair of islands in the intersecting St.-Maurice River creates three channels where they meet the larger waterway, giving Trois-Rivières or Three Rivers, the second oldest Francophone city in North America, its name.
On one of those islands, Île St.-Quentin, park managers seasonally flood an ice-skating path that's about 1¼ miles. The frozen maze skirts the seaway, flowing with jagged cells of ice, and weaves into the hardwood forest behind it. Following the contours of the land, it had enough gradual downhills to persuade several skaters to wear helmets.
I laced my skates inside the park's generous field house, which offered fat-tire bike rentals for rides on another trail, shared by snowshoers, that runs for about 2 miles around the periphery of the island.
With just a few skaters sharing the ice on a sunny and windy weekday, I had the "sentier de patin," or ice path, largely to myself, allowing me to skate the route in all directions without fear of collisions. After an exploratory foray, slow and curious, I thrilled to make each iteration different, taking the first alley right away from the river and the second left toward it, circling a warming tent one way, then the other, and edging back on the inland route, taking occasional spurs in unanticipated directions in the exhilarating labyrinth that held me safe in its geometry.
Although the ice trail was quiet, it didn't take long to find Mauricie's winter pilgrims. About 30 miles northeast of town, I checked into Le Baluchon Eco-Resort behind a dozen exhilarated French snowmobilers who were sledding inn to inn.
On the Rivière du Loup, or Wolf River, Le Baluchon offers 89 rooms in a mix of inns and chalets on 1,000 acres featuring about 25 miles of cross-country ski and snowshoe trails, a tubing run and an ice rink with supplied equipment for broomball - a hockey-like game played with brooms and without skates. The sledders headed straight for the Nordic spa to steep in a series of hydrotherapy pools indoors and out.
Later that evening, a full moon lit the riverside trail to the inn's restaurant - acclaimed for its menu using local ingredients in dishes like walleye with Quebec seaweed butter - and waterfalls stilled by ice.
Agritourism
on ice
One winter, when Jean-Pierre Binette and Madeleine Courchesne, beekeepers in rural Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, about an hour north of Trois-Rivières, had three children under age 9, they flooded a small section of woods on their property. Excited by the frozen forest playground, their children invited their friends, who invited their friends. In 1997, the seasonal diversion became a secondary business as Le Domaine de la Forêt Perdue, or the Lost Forest, opened to the public, keeping a form of agritourism alive in winter (in summer, they offer a high-ropes course).
"We were the first skating path in Quebec, and now we are training people who are opening trails around the province," Thérèse Deslauriers, the managing director of the Forêt Perdue, said, as she worked the rustic entry house that doubles as a retail shop for honey products.
Outside, beyond the skate rental tent, more than 9 miles of iceways wove through pine and hardwood forests dotted with farm pens occupied by goats, sheep, ducks, deer and more exotic animals, including an ostrich. Next to the alpaca enclosure, a repurposed phone booth dispensed handfuls of animal feed for a Canadian quarter.
Many skaters brought their lunches. For the less prepared, Forêt Perdue offers a heated snack bar in a tent and a maple candy cabin in the woods.
Inviting though it was, I skipped the snack bar, threw my skates in the car and drove roughly 40 miles east to another of the grand lodges that draw winter fans to Mauricie. Like a castle-size version of a log cabin, Hôtel Sacacomie sits high above frozen Sacacomie Lake, offering wintry panoramas from its pine-hewn dining room with a roaring fire in the fieldstone fireplace - the perfect place to warm up over local smoked trout and duck confit poutine.
A frozen river
After an overnight snowfall of 4 inches, the 5.6-mile skating path on the L'Assomption River at Parc Louis-Querbes in Joliette, about midway between Le Baluchon and Montreal, was already open and plowed by 9 a.m., serving a smattering of speedskaters and slower gliders.
I skated hard for an hour, covering the entire route, and was not alone. Like runners in warmer cities, the earliest Joliette skaters came out to exercise in the light morning traffic. By the time I circled back to the park field house just after 10 a.m., a food shack next to the ice had opened, serving beignets and tea to the growing collection of families teaching their under-10s to skate by holding onto loaner sleds and sharing the wonder of skating on a seasonally stilled river.
I intended to leave the river and head straight to the airport in Montreal but couldn't resist another skating stop so close to it. Diverting 30 minutes north to Bois de Belle-Rivière, I took a final 1.5-mile spin on yet another frozen forest path. In this age of vanishing ice, I skated with a profound appreciation for the transformation of winter and the spirit of ice makers to delight those who love the season.

Texto completo: Walking a few extra feet may actually save time compared to wasting 10 minutes seething up and down the lanes.
As you drive up to a crowded shopping plaza, your blood pressure rises quickly.
Circling the parking lot, you search for the closest possible space.
It quickly becomes a fierce competition, filling you with stress and sometimes anger if someone beats you to that one spot that should have been yours.
Several laps and minutes later, you land in a mediocre spot and still have to hike to your destination.
We've all been there. But is there a better approach? What if we flipped it and decided that the absolute best spot is the one furthest from the door? I know what you're thinking, but bear with me.
If you target the furthest spot, your wait time is zero. Absolutely zero stress, no competition and smooth sailing as if the perfect spot was reserved just for you.
Walking a few extra feet may actually save time compared to wasting 10 minutes seething up and down the lanes.
What appears like a bummer outcome actually has additional benefits:
You get some much-needed exercise, and you also build mental toughness.
You now are the person that seeks out challenges, rather than runs from them.
You get to forge your own path and refuse to run with the masses.
You now enter the building with a spring in your step, realizing that you're the rare breed that does things your own way.
As you may guess, what works for parking spots also works in business and life.
When we challenge ourselves to flip the obvious approach in order to discover a better alternative, we unlock fresh possibility.
Sometimes, the very thing that appears the most difficult actually becomes the most rewarding. In fact, embracing the opposite approach has been the foundation of progress — and greatness — for generations.
Now that you've scored the ideal parking spot, look for other areas where you can apply the same oppositional thinking in order to win. Do it your own way, and the rewards will be abundant.
In the words of legendary football star Roger Staubach, "There are no traffic jams along the extra mile."

Texto completo: As you step through the bar on your way into The Lost Fire's dining room, it is impossible to ignore what's happening in the kitchen. Framed by the pass in elongated letterbox, you'll catch the clack and glint of tongs that spark from every direction at once. They chatter as they seize wire racks of blistered sausages and noisily mound embers in the tray of the gigantic charcoal grill. Every action seems to involve a metallic collision of steel against steel.
There, surrounded by his smoldering machinery, one person conducts every turn of the rotisserie spit, every eyebrow-singing blast of heat. Meet your asador, chef GermÃ¡n Lucarelli.
For Lucarelli, also the restaurant's co-owner, The Lost Fire represents an opportunity to introduce Maine to asado, traditional Argentinian barbecue grilling, as well as a way to preserve food traditions from his homeland.
"I was doing a steak night at Ports of Italy (in Kennebunk) that became very successful, but at that time it was with a propane grill. I hoped one day to do the real thing with real wood and charcoal," Lucarelli said. "So I decided to open up an Argentinian grill restaurant where people can get together for an asado, just like every Sunday in Argentina. It's like you're invited to my house where I'd watch my uncle in front of the grill."
The "lost fire" in the Cape Porpoise restaurant's name is an allusion to the rituals of slow, open-flame cooking. Until two years ago, they persisted for Lucarelli only in memories of his early training, when he peeled potatoes and worked as a line cook in the Mendozan foothills of Argentina's Malbec country. And as satisfying as his adventures running kitchens in Spain, Turkey, Florida and New York were, Lucarelli always understood that he'd eventually take another turn as an asador.
It's a safe bet that almost nobody expected it would happen here, in Southern Maine, in a space that, before a gut renovation, boasted taupe wall-to-wall carpet and drop ceilings.
Today, The Lost Fire is broken into three distinct dining areas. The bar space follows a neat, open horseshoe shape that offers sports fans a clear view of at least one of the four mammoth widescreen televisions twitching frenetically overhead. An adjacent addition named "The Gallery," all funky curtains and corrugated iron, runs alongside and provides up to 50 guests a private, outdoorsy-feeling space for parties and events. But the real story is the main dining room. Stylish, with dusty periwinkle walls and ruddy-stained beams that arch overhead like the ribs of a whale, the space successfully straddles the line between upscale and casual.
Larger parties can even opt to dine in one of two semiprivate "cabins" that offer banquette seating, impressionistic ink drawings of herds of cattle, and two sliding barn doors that can be pulled closed for privacy. On my recent visit, one group of diners did just that when noise in the eruptively loud restaurant went from tolerable to Tylenol.
"Good lord," one of them shouted as she hauled the door into place, "I can't hear anything but that man bragging about his boat!"
I sympathized; he was seated at the table next to mine. But I was able to tune him out, focusing instead on the eclectic mixed grill for two ($68) that he and his date were sharing. Served on an enamel replica of a parilla grill, the dish provides an enormous serving of whatever Lucarelli feels like sending the table - everything from rotisserie chicken to sweetbreads, steaks and sausages.
My three guests and I ordered one ourselves and immediately realized that we ought to have stopped the flow of food there; the mixed grill is large enough to serve four people, maybe even five or six. Unsurprisingly, the dish's pivot point is Black Angus beef, every cut of which Lucarelli seasons twice: once with a diluted, parsley-and-oregano chimichurri sauce immediately before the meat is dropped onto the smoking parilla, and then again after it has cooked through - this time finished with Maldon salt and pulverized rosemary and sage that the kitchen dries in house.
On the rosy New York strip and juicy (if rather tiny) filet mignon, the seasoning seemed calibrated nicely. The same held true for the short rib, whose tender shreds fainted off the bone. But on the dry, overcooked skirt steak, it overwhelmed what was left of the meat's original flavor.
The seasoning blend on the golden-skinned rotisserie chicken offered a similar gradient of success: On pieces that were overdone (leg and wing), the meat was too salty, but the well-cooked thigh was one of the best things I ate in January.
Sausages - preseasoned at the Boston butchery that supplies them - are immune to the kitchen's heavy hand with spicing. They also made up most of my favorite elements of the mixed grill. In particular, the chubby link of crisp-skinned pork blood sausage that kept me going back for another bite to excavate its tiny whispers of nutmeg, and a lollipop-like coil of skinny, fennel-scented Italian sausage that the kitchen skewers through its center and grills until browned and perspiring with garlicky oil.
But the best part of the mixed grill was also its most unexpected component: grilled sweetbreads, marinated simply in lemon juice and salt, oiled to keep them from sticking on the parilla, then crisped and basted with more lemon juice and another sprinkle of Maldon salt. Soft and custardy inside, the sweetbreads had an understated flavor that seemed to intertwine bone marrow, oyster and sous-vided chicken breast.
"That really does taste like chicken to me," one of my guests said, when I offered him a piece of the sweetbreads. Then, pointing at the hulking, breadcrumb-and-egg-dredged Milanesa Parmigiana ($28) on the plate before him, added, "This doesn't. It's like something you'd get at a roller skating rink in the '80s." Indeed, the butterflied (not pounded) cutlet was tough and had little flavor apart from sweet marinara sauce.
On the other hand, beautifully cooked fish ($38) reveals that Lucarelli's team is capable of taking a restrained approach toward cooking and seasoning. Here, a thin, South American swordfish fillet is dusted with turmeric, garlic powder and coriander, then grilled over charcoal and topped with a verdant dribble of crushed capers, parsley and olive oil.
When one of my guests asked, "Is it OK for me to order the swordfish even though it seems like a dish from another restaurant?" I could immediately see what she meant. Its nuance, much like that of the delicate, almost mousse-like flourless Torta Caprese ($10), did seem out of place alongside the restaurant's conspicuous red-meat sensibilities and rollicking ambiance. And yet, from sweetbreads to swordfish, Lucarelli's best dishes are his quietest, most understated ones. Despite The Lost Fire's keen attention to the traditions around embers and flame, it is in danger of neglecting its most precious asset: subtlety.

Texto completo: There's something self-defeating about a reader's attempt to solve a mystery: she's trying to crack a code, and yet if she does, the fun is over. Years ago, I solved the puzzle midway through Josephine Tey's "Brat Farrar," and once I finished patting myself on the back, I was stuck slogging suspenselessly through the rest of the book. Readers want something from a mystery novel that we generally don't want from life: to be foiled. Megan Miranda's "The Last House Guest" offers precisely this counterintuitive satisfaction: the pleasure of being outsmarted.
As "The Last House Guest" begins, it's the summer of 2017 and the night of the annual end-of-season bash in the fictional seaside town of Littleport, Maine. Narrator Avery Greer has helped set up the party, held at the Blue Robin, one of the rental properties that she's been managing for the past six summers for the wealthy Loman family, who lives in Connecticut during the offseason.
For Avery, the best thing about the Lomans is Sadie Loman, her closest friend since the summer they met in Littleport as teenagers. Avery's parents died in a car crash when she was 14, and a few years later she was raising some serious hell around town. Sadie took her on as a kind of rescue project: she convinced her parents to spring for business classes for her friend, and Avery has been in their employ ever since.
Sadie is supposed to attend the party at the Blue Robin but doesn't show, which is worrisome to Avery, who tries unsuccessfully to contact her. When two police officers arrive at the house, they ask to see Sadie's brother, Parker. The officers report that Sadie has been found dead on Breaker Beach. While the official cause of Sadie's death is drowning, the following day the police find something of interest in the kitchen trash at the Lomans' summer house. "I never knew what Sadie's suicide note said," Avery reflects .later. "I knew only that it existed, and that it closed the case..."
"The Last House Guest" seesaws between the summer of Sadie's death and the summer that follows, as Avery, who continues to work for Loman Properties and lives year-round in the family's guesthouse, tries to come to terms with her friend's unaccountable demise. One morning, Avery gets a phone call from a renter informing her that someone has been poking around inside the house that he's staying in - the Blue Robin, as it happens. While Avery is inspecting the property following the ransacking, she discovers something of Sadie's in a blanket chest: "Somehow her phone had ended up at the rental house across town while her body was washing up on the shore of Breaker Beach."
Miranda, the author of the New York Times best-seller "All the Missing Girls" and scads of other thrillers, could have packed it in after creating a topflight puzzle, but "The Last House Guest" doubles as a meditation on belonging. Avery should by rights feel at home in Littleport - she's both a native and a full-time resident - and yet she's forever on the periphery, permanently marked by her kinlessness and adolescent missteps. When Avery first met Sadie's parents, she was certain that the Lomans saw her as "something Sadie had found on the beach and would hopefully get over just as quickly." But Sadie didn't get over Avery, and Avery isn't getting over Sadie or the question of why she died.
Given all that she's been through, you can't expect Avery to do all the puzzle solving. That's your job too. Oh, and good luck with that.

Texto completo: She will say she tried her best.
She'll note that she voted for witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Trump, but that vote fell short.
Then, when the final impeachment vote comes on Wednesday afternoon, expect Maine Sen. Susan Collins to fall back into the Republican line and vote to acquit.
Why? Because, you know, she needed more information from those who actually watched Trump make a mockery of the Oval Office. Witnesses who were blocked from testifying by Trump and his minions on Capitol Hill.
Buttressed by pages upon pages of detailed notes, Collins' defense will all sound so logical, so well thought out. When it was all said and done, the reasoning will go, what else could she do?
Here's what: Right now, Collins could do the same thing she did three and a half years ago, when Donald Trump was still just a candidate and few people dreamed that he'd ever darken the threshold of the White House.
Back then, she spoke up. Loudly and clearly.
She denounced the man for who he is and what he stands for.
She demonstrated integrity.
On Friday, as Trump's impeachment trial roller-coasted toward its inevitable conclusion, I called up the Washington Post op-ed Collins wrote on Aug. 6, 2016, under the headline "Why I Cannot Support Trump."
It's a remarkable piece of writing. And now, as Trump shakes off impeachment and looks ahead to another election, Collins' statement of conscience bears revisiting - if only to show that while Trump hasn't changed, the senior senator from Maine most certainly has.
"With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize," Collins wrote of Trump. "But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing - either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level - that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president."
Former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch comes to mind. Even as she testified to the House Intelligence Committee in November about her unceremonious ouster on the cusp of the Ukraine scandal, Trump took to Twitter to heckle her in real time, prompting the committee chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to ask what effect Trump's bullying could have on "other witnesses' willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing."
"It's very intimidating," a visibly uncomfortable Yovanovitch replied.
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
In her op-ed, Collins also stated: "My conclusion about Mr. Trump's unsuitability for office is based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics. Instead, he opts to mock the vulnerable and inflame prejudices by attacking ethnic and religious minorities."
She cited three examples: A New York Times reporter whose disability Trump once mimicked, a federal judge who Trump said could not fairly decide a case because of the judge's Mexican heritage, and the Muslim family of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq.
In all three cases, Collins wrote, she hoped Trump would apologize, admit that he was wrong. He didn't. In fact, he would go on to call victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico "politically motivated ingrates," decry immigrants coming to the United States from "s***hole countries," and fire off countless other invectives on virtually a daily basis.
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
Back then, Collins worried that Trump's "lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so.
It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump's tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control."
She was right. Trump went on to arbitrarily withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear treaty. Just last month, his impulsive assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani came perilously close to spawning all-out war in the Middle East.
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
As the country geared up for the 2016 general election, Collins wrote that she'd hoped for a "new" Donald Trump, "one who would focus on jobs and the economy, tone down his rhetoric, develop more thoughtful policies and, yes, apologize for ill-tempered rants."
Again, she proved prescient: "But the unpleasant reality that I have had to accept is that there will be no 'new' Donald Trump, just the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat. Regrettably, his essential character appears to be fixed, and he seems incapable of change or growth."
That, of course, was long before Trump called House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff "pencil neck," told Russian diplomats that former FBI Director James Comey was a "nut job" and called various women "fat pig," "slob," "dog" and "horseface."
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
Long proud of her Republican heritage - she called it "part of what defines me as a person" - Collins wrote that some might consider her duty-bound to support her party's presidential nominee. But, she countered, "It is because of Mr. Trump's inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy."
And now? As the Senate makes history before our eyes, we find Collins studiously riveted to the process, hiding behind her faux-obligation as a "juror" to avoid having to state the obvious once again.
Donald Trump is indeed "unworthy of being our president," as Collins put it so long ago. He not only solicited a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political rival, but also upped the pressure on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky by withholding $391 million in desperately needed military aid.
Last week, Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz had the temerity to say that as long as Trump thought his re-election is in the public interest, he can engage in such behavior without consequence. Around the same time, more than a few Republicans said the president's transgressions simply don't rise to the level of impeachment.
Susan Collins knows better than that. She knows the kind of man Donald J. Trump truly is. She knows that now more than ever, he's unfit to occupy the most powerful office in the land.
But times have changed. The man she criticized so roundly back then is the same man who can take a flamethrower to her political future now.
So, come Wednesday and the final impeachment vote, look for Collins to express her deep concern at how nasty everyone has become, wring her hands over how difficult her life has grown and then, ever loyal to a party that now devours those who dissent, vote to let Trump off the hook. Or maybe vote "present" in the hope it will satisfy both ends of her ever-shrinking base.
It won't. And long after this national trauma passes into history, Maine's Susan Collins will be forever remembered not for her courage, but for her capitulation.

RIGHTEOUS ANGER TRUMP SUPPORTERS RESPOND TO CONTEMPT

Texto completo: Oh c'mon! Ye people of the right wing, this is a rare moment when you get to have it every which way at once! So sit back and enjoy it, why don't you?
Instead of getting all bent out of shape about Rick Wilson's Ukraine quip, relax sufficiently in victory to admit that it was a pretty funny joke.
And don't forget to savor the lesson it provides, yet again, that anger - if controlled and carefully deployed - is far more effective than contempt. Isn't that a big part of how Donald Trump won in 2016?
The now-viral CNN moment from last weekend just oozes with contempt. Mr. Wilson, a "Never-Trump" Republican consultant, actually causes anchor Don Lemon to have a hysterical, snorting, head-desk moment when he quips that "Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual, physical crane next to it."
You have to acknowledge this is a well-constructed joke, a great word-picture, rehearsed and ready to go as soon as the like-minded anchor provided the setup.
That doesn't mean the joke was fair or apt. In fact, if there's one part of the world Mr. Trump is probably painfully aware of, it's Ukraine, sitting there right next to Russia, along the Black Sea. He can only wish he didn't know.
But the CNN trio (Mr. Lemon, Mr. Wilson and playwright Wajahat Ali) didn't pause a beat before broadening their disdain beyond Mr. Trump to include all his supporters - "the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump," Mr. Wilson continued, "that wants to think Donald Trump is the smart one and all y'all elitists are dumb."
"You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling," Mr. Ali contributed.
It quickly fizzled out; the men were not very quick-witted, repeating themselves and getting lamer each time. Like cocky jerks everywhere, they didn't know when to stop.
It's not quite a "basket of deplorables" or "bitter-clingers" gaffe. Wajahat Ali is no Barack Obama and Rick Wilson is no Hilary Clinton, but what these talking heads lack in status, they made up for with exuberance.
Their bit of self-revealing fun has become a political pinata for the other side. By Tuesday, the Republican National Committee launched a TV ad asserting, "They think you're a joke."
The windfall for the GOP is a cautionary tale for everyone else - the new Exhibit A in why "pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." When your nose is this high in the air - so you can look down upon your fellow citizens - you aren't able to simultaneously watch where you're stepping. Or what you're stepping in.
The well-known quote about pride comes from Chapter 16 of the ancient Book of Proverbs. In Chapter 6 is a lesser-known passage cataloging seven things "the Lord hates." First on the list is "haughty eyes."
What's not on the list is anger. That's because it's not a sin. It is a legitimate human reaction to various provocations - such as being mocked and marginalized. The anger of the Rust Belt's chronically unemployed, of religious traditionalists smeared as bigots, of middle-class strivers who did lose their doctors under Obamacare and whose protests don't make them racists - this is the anger Mr. Trump taps into.
Healthy anger implies mutual respect. It engages the other person and says, "I expect better of you, and I deserve better from you." Haughtiness simply dismisses others - as, you know, "credulous boomer rubes."
Anger is morally superior to pride, but if uncontrolled, it destroys like fire. If the president ever reined in his anger, he might actually attract more voters - those who appreciate his economic strategy but deplore his incendiary style.
Will anger beat contempt again in 2020?
Trump supporters can only hope for another CNN-style moment of total left-wing honesty - ideally in October - and, given human nature, they're likely to get their wish.

Texto completo: He was Jelly's kid. For many of us, that was always the unfathomable aspect of the Kobe Bryant saga. He was Jelly's kid.
Kobe Bryant was the son of a professional basketball player, but not just any ol' professional basketball player. Joe “Jellybean" Bryant was a perplexing player, at the very least a benchwarmer on the All-Squandered Talent Team. He was a technically skilled 6-foot-9-inch forward, a standout at La Salle who had an eight-year career in the NBA, followed by eight additional years in Italy.
Jelly should have been better. Simply put, he was a knucklehead. He was indeed very skilled, but in the end he was a Double A Antoine Walker, a player whose whole was nowhere near the sum of his parts. He just didn't get it.
Exhibit A was his immortal line upon learning he had just been traded from the 76ers to the Clippers. Said Jelly, “I guess this means they don't want a Magic Johnson-type around here.“
So, how did his offspring emerge as such a dedicated, intelligent, and precise player? We'll never know. Perhaps Kobe figured, “I'll just do as Dad didn't do."
Kobe Bryant's precocity has been well-established. At 15, he could hold his own during summer scrimmages with established collegians and professionals in Philadelphia. When he entered the 1996 NBA Draft, he did so with extraordinary self-confidence.
With the exception of Bill Willoughby (488 NBA games, averaging 6 points back in the '70s), it had been big men such as Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins, and in 1995 Kevin Garnett who had jumped from high school to the NBA. Kobe was going to try it as a guard.
His predraft workouts are the stuff of NBA legend. Among those whose eyes were opened was new Nets coach John Calipari, in possession of the eighth overall pick in '96. But when the proverbial push came to shove, Calipari did not have the guts to pull that trigger in what would have been his first big decision as Nets mentor. He went for a safe pick in Villanova's Kerry Kittles.
Kittles wasn't bad. He had an eight-year NBA career. But Kerry Kittles was not Kobe Bryant.
No one was more dazzled than Jerry West. The sagacious Lakers general manager happily traded Vlade Divac to Charlotte on that fateful draft night. Thus did Kobe Bryant, the 13th pick of the 1996 NBA Draft, become a Los Angeles Laker.
From that day forward, Kobe Bryant had no bigger fan than Jerry West. I am telling you that if a billion Kobe fans were lined up, the person at the head of that line would have to be Jerry West.
Now, I must admit I was totally unprepared for the astonishing outpouring of grief and shock over Kobe's death. I didn't realize to what extent Kobe Bryant had become the Star of Stars for a generation of worldwide sports fans.
I mean, Neymar scoring a goal for Paris Saint-Germain and holding up two fingers on one hand and four on the other in tribute to Kobe? The mercurial Nick Kyrgios sporting both 8 and 24 Kobe jerseys at the Australian Open, or a video tribute to Kobe at Rod Laver Stadium? Or the following headline on the Monday Arts section of the New York Times: “Grammys Tinged by Grief Over Kobe Bryant"?
I don't know exactly who came up with the idea to start last Sunday's NBA games with matching hold-the-ball 24-second violations, but let the record show that the first two to do it were Toronto's Fred VanVleet and San Antonio's Dejounte Murray. God love 'em. And Doc Rivers absolutely breaking down? Whoa.
What always struck me about Kobe Bryant was that he was completely different in sensibility than any American-born player. Kobe's formative years were spent not in this country, but in Italy, where poppa Jellybean had established a career. He spoke fluent Italian, and if I'm not mistaken, even did a commercial along the way utilizing his fluency in that language.
I'm playing armchair psychologist here, but I believe Kobe always had a world view and often found it hard to relate to his American peers. He has been described as “aloof" and a “loner," and I think his European upbringing helps explain it.
Actor and comic Robert Wuhl encountered the young, sophisticated Kobe Bryant early on.
“I first met Kobe in 1996 when he appeared on the HBO series 'Arli$$,' " Wuhl explains. “It was only our fifth episode. Kobe had just signed a $3.5 million contract with the Lakers less than a week before shooting.
“I was aware he had spent years in Italy and thought this was a good, fun way to introduce him to a national audience. On the first take, he was flawless. Spoiler Alert: Most cameo athletes are not. Kobe was incredibly poised, friendly, and very funny. And 17."
Another “problem" Kobe may have had getting along with his teammates was that he was, frankly, usually smarter than everyone else. Had he not entered that 1996 draft, he would have gone on to play for Coach K at Duke, and we are told he indeed had the grades to get into that school even if he couldn't take it hard to the hoop or drill a 15-footer.
Some people have mistakenly referred to Staples Center as “The House That Kobe Built." That is not true. Elgin, Jerry, Wilt, Gail, Kareem, Magic, James, and others got that place built. Kobe spent his first three years playing in the Fabulous Forum. What Kobe did was pay off the Staples Center mortgage (with, yes, a little help from Shaq). He took complete control of the household. An LA generation who never saw the Sports Arena or Forum associated Kobe with Staples Center. They cannot imagine an LA sports world without Kobe Bryant. Elgin, Jerry, Wilt, Gail, Kareem, Magic, and James were their grandfather's, father's, or big brother's guys. Kobe was theirs . For anyone else to be known as the Greatest Laker is an unthinkable thought for this generation of Lakers fans.
You've seen all the numbers: Eleven first-team All-NBA. Nine first-team All-Defense. Four All-Star Game MVPs. And, of course, five championship rings. Etc., etc., etc. But my favorite factual tidbit about Kobe is that he is the all-time leader in but one category: most missed shots. He was, in fact, a volume scorer with a lifetime shooting percentage of .447. He was simply indefatigable. By the way, guess who's No. 2 in this fascinating category . . . John Havlicek.
All the truly great ones leave a special memory. Larry was Larry. Magic was Magic. And Kobe was Kobe. In terms of style and competitiveness, he was the closest thing to Michael, yes. No doubt. But he wasn't Michael, he was Kobe.
And how we got from Jelly to Kobe we'll never know.
Hey, Kobe, thanks for everything. Ciao.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - One by one, a majority of senators rose at their desks on Friday to vote against calling any witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, effectively moving the trial to a close in the coming days.
The vote was 51-49, with Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah joining all 45 Democrats and two independents in voting in favor of the measure. The rest of the Republican-controlled chamber stuck together to oppose it.
The consequential vote came after several hours of final pleas from House Democrats for key Republicans to reconsider. But after 36 hours of arguments, 16 hours of questioning and plenty of behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, senators ultimately sided with the White House lawyers and declined to expand the scope of the trial.
Without witnesses, the trial will move forward to deliberations and a final verdict. Mr. Trump almost certainly will be acquitted, as the vote to remove a president from office requires 67 senators.
After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a recess and deliberated over dinner with Republican senators and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
The plan that emerged: The Senate will take the weekend off and reconvene Monday to give the senators the floor to - finally - speak on the case. A final vote on the verdict is scheduled for 4 p.m. Wednesday.
That resolution mapping out the trial's conclusion was approved by a 53-47 vote after the Senate voted down four amendments offered by Mr. Schumer to call specific witnesses and documents.
The Senate's rejection of witnesses sunk House Democrats' last hope to, in their view, show senators a fuller picture of Mr. Trump's misdeeds. And it came hours after yet another disclosure from Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, whom Democrats have been seeking to call to testify.
Mr. Bolton's upcoming book, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," reportedly details a direct demand by Mr. Trump that Mr. Bolton work to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.
On Friday, The New York Times reported that an Oval Office conversation occurred in early May and was attended by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading Mr. Trump's defense in the impeachment trial.
Mr. Trump's hold on the military aid to Ukraine, in addition to the delay of a White House meeting with its new president, was at the center of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry last fall.
In December, the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who leads the team of six House Democrats prosecuting the case in the Senate, began his remarks with The New York Times report.
Mr. Cipollone "said all the facts should come out," Mr. Schiff said in the opening minutes. "Well, there's a new fact that indicates Mr. Cipollone were among those who were in the loop."
Mr. Schiff, speaking for most of the two hours allotted to the Democratic team, portrayed witnesses as part of "any courtroom in America."
Witnesses have been called in every prior Senate impeachment trial of both presidents and federal judges. The Senate called 41 witnesses in President Andrew Johnson's trial and called three witnesses for private depositions in President Bill Clinton's 1998 trial.
"The documents the president is hiding, the witnesses the president is concealing, will tell their stories - and we will be asked why we didn't want to hear that information when we had the chance," Mr. Schiff told the senators.
"The facts will come out in the end," he said. "In all of their horror, they will come out."
White House lawyers used a sliver of their allotted two hours Friday. They have portrayed the House Democrats' time as weak and rushed, without the proper investigatory work required by a fair impeachment proceeding.
Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, told senators a vote to call witnesses would needlessly prolong the trial for months. The White House would have likely demanded Hunter Biden.
"If we go down the road of witnesses, this is not a one-week process," Mr. Sekulow said.
The witness vote took shape in the hours after senators concluded their questioning Thursday.
When Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announced her opposition Friday, the vote was all but dead. In her statement, Ms. Murkowski decried "a low point in division in this country" and said nothing any witness or new document would bring to the trial could change anybody's mind.
"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate," Ms. Murkowski wrote. "I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything."
"It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed," she wrote.
Ms. Murkowski joined Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., as the two swing votes who effectively prevented witnesses in the trial.
Mr. Alexander said he believed Mr. Trump committed the acts alleged by House Democrats but that they did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.
"It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation," Mr. Alexander said. "There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven."
But he stated "the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate."
Pennsylvania senators split on the Friday vote - as they have through the impeachment process.
Democrat Sen. Bob Casey voted for witnesses, while Republican Sen. Pat Toomey voted against the measure.
"The Senate must vote to hear from relevant witnesses and relevant documents to ensure a full and fair trial," Mr. Casey tweeted moments before the vote. "Anything less is a cover-up."
After the vote, Mr. Toomey reiterated what he had told reporters earlier: "The purpose of a witness is to shed light on an important fact that could resolve a disputed issue and help determine the final outcome of the case," he said.
"In my view, the House has brought forward articles of impeachment that do not justify removing President Trump from office, nullifying the results of the 2016 election and denying Americans the right to vote for him in the next election," he said.

Texto completo: Smacked:A Story of White-Collar Ambition, Addiction, and Tragedy
By Eilene Zimmerman
Random House, 272 pages, $27
Should the pet mouse named Snowball, slang for a cocaine-heroin combo, have been a clue? If not, there were many more: the broken promises and missed meetings, the haggard appearance and flu-like symptoms, the lassitude and neglect of his children.
Yet it was only after his death, from a bacterial infection, that freelance journalist Eilene Zimmerman realized that her ex-husband, a hard-charging intellectual property lawyer, was a drug addict. Before that, she had imagined a range of explanations for his odd behavior and failing health — only not this.
Zimmerman's memoir, “Smacked," asks how such a fate could overtake someone so gifted, successful, wealthy, and driven. She first described Peter's plight in a 2017 New York Times essay, “The Lawyer, the Addict," highlighting the prevalence of drug addiction in the legal profession. “Smacked" expands the story in two directions: It offers a much fuller account of Peter's life (and hers), and it reports on the factors — including depression, work stress, and competitive consumerism — that fuel white-collar addiction.
“Smacked" reads like an amalgam of two different books. The first, recounting Zimmerman's love story, her marriage, the subsequent divorce, and Peter's gradual deterioration, is an engrossing narrative laden with elements of pathos and mystery.
The second is a reportorial overview of the culture and causes of “white-collar pill-popping." It is intended as both warning and self-help, a preventative against future tragedies. But it falls short — perhaps inevitably — of illuminating the complex, seemingly unfathomable psychology of Peter's addiction.
What is missing, through no fault of Zimmerman's, is Peter's own voice — specifically, his testimony about how his dependence on drugs, from opioids to speed and cocaine, started, and how and why it got out of hand.
With the benefit of hindsight, Zimmerman describes Peter as someone with an “insatiable need for affirmation and acceptance, for validation and gratitude," whose problems might have originated with his insecurities as an adoptee.
As an adult, he must have been consumed by loneliness. Like most addicts, he lied repeatedly to friends, family, and colleagues. When Zimmerman asked about his deteriorating health, he claimed to be suffering from an ailment called Hashimoto's disease.
Peter died before managing to get sober, or to reflect on his experiences. A former chemist, he left behind no journals — just a macabre record of his pill intake and injections, presumably designed to prevent overdoses.
Zimmerman begins “Smacked" with her dramatic discovery of Peter's corpse in his “architectural trophy" of a house, “all sharp angles and sunlight." Though divorced, they are bonded by their personal history and their two children, and she still worries about him. Unable to reach him, she resolves to check on him “to make sure he's okay and take care of him if he isn't." By the time she finds him, it is too late.
The narrative then flashes back to their first meeting, in April 1987. He's a personnel recruiter; she's in search of a writing job. He's immediately smitten; she is not. But they become friends, staying in touch long-distance while he pursues graduate studies in chemistry in upstate New York. When she finally visits, to see his band play, he is already drinking heavily and doing lines of coke.
Still, they have sex, and she falls in love. Before long, they are living together in Philadelphia. Despite vague feelings of discontent and a distinctly unromantic proposal, she marries him.
Eighteen years later, Peter, having graduated first in his law school class, is a partner in a law firm, working marathon hours. They are living, unhappily, in San Diego. “Marriage," Zimmerman writes, “has made me feel lonelier and more invisible than I have at any other time of my life." But financial dependence keeps her from divorce — until Peter confesses to an affair.
Even after the divorce, they remain in touch, and Zimmerman notices his physical deterioration and unreliable behavior. He is “the king of noncommitment," with excuses for every slip-up. “All I knew," she writes, “was that nothing with him made sense anymore."
Only after his death, when the medical examiner mentions his track marks and drug paraphernalia, do the clues finally snap into place.
In the last 80 or so pages, Zimmerman turns from Peter's personal story to the larger context of white-collar drug abuse, as well as her own efforts to move on with her life. She notes the high number of lawyers suffering from depression and anxiety, as well as the epidemic of alcohol and drug use in the profession.
But the problem goes well beyond law, she writes, to the high-pressure fields of finance, medicine, and tech. Drugs are rampant, too, she says, among millennials and Generation Z, who often smoke marijuana and are prescribed, or overprescribed, psychoactive meds.
Zimmerman manages to end this poignant tale on a gently positive note. Peter's absence looms over her daughter's graduation from the University of Michigan. But she is nevertheless able to appreciate her family's survival, the fact that she and her son and daughter are “alive and happy and together."

Texto completo: AMERICAN OLIGARCHS: THE KUSHNERS, THE TRUMPS, AND THE MARRIAGE OF MONEY AND POWER
By Andrea Bernstein
W.W. Norton, 496 pp., $30
Charles Kushner once owned 22,000 garden apartments and single-family homes in New Jersey. Donald Trump owns apartments, casinos, resorts, and an empire of subsidiaries. Their children met and wed; both a marriage and a merger. The two families, both alike in sometime (in)dignity, is where Andrea Bernstein lays her Shakespearean tale of wealth, power — and the corrupting effect of them both.
There are now dozens, perhaps scores, of Trump-inspired and Trump-infused books on the market. Most are screeds, tales of scandal and infidelity, with tax evasion and crudity mixed in. They comprise a modern genre. “American Oligarchs" occupies this space, to be sure, but Bernstein's account is written with more grace than its cousins, and more care — sometimes even caution.
The story, in its broadest sense, is well-known. The two families — one with German origin, the other Polish — grew rich in real estate in the Mid-Atlantic, where fortunes sometimes require luck, often pluck, occasionally brains, frequently schemes. One of the fathers went to the big house, the other to the White House.
It is a modern American story, as is the tale of the two men's children, living, as Bernstein puts it, in America's “uppermost layer, the crust on the crème brûlée," a deft definition of two people who, working with connections and family money and, it must be said, some measure of intelligence and guile, made at least $82 million in the year the paterfamilias became president.
Today, Jared Kushner, once tasked with solving the tensions in the Middle East, is emerging as the principal figure in Trump's re-elevation campaign; he wasn't involved at all in the most important Middle East development of his father-in-law's presidency, the slaying of Major General Suleimani. His wife, Ivanka, is a constant presence in both the news and society pages of the newspapers her father deplores.
If the Kushner and Trump stories are about money, so, too, is Bernstein's, for the role of money in politics and the emergence of the modern wealth gap are important sub-themes in this account. Naturally the role Kushner and Trump money played in politics, long before the White House was within the president's grasp, is examined by Bernstein. Hers is, she writes, “the multi-generational saga of two emblematic families of our time."
Early in Bernstein's tale we encounter the modern origins of the Kushners, their Polish shtetl roots and the slaughter of many of them at the hands of the Nazis. It is an affecting, poignant story, told well and without the facile irony — struggling family in merciless mid-century war turns into crooked family in late-century New Jersey —that a less accomplished writer might employ.
The Trump story is less romantic, though Fred Trump did once work as a “horse's helper," which is to say that he guided construction wagons along ice-encrusted roads that mules couldn't navigate. The family's rise is summarized in one half of a juicy paragraph this way: “It's the tale of a hustling entrepreneur immigrant grandfather who made money satisfying the appetites of Western lumberjacks and miners for food, liquor and prostitutes; of a builder father whose career included several run-ins with government investigators, and decades of hiding a massive fortune from the IRS."
In this Big Apple story, the apple didn't fall from from the poisoned trees. The Kushner story, marked by annual Passover seders at the Fontainebleau, was soiled by illegal campaign contributions and tax fraud, plus the additional elements of sex tapes and a prison sentence. Donald Trump was a skilled manipulator of the tax and bankruptcy codes, a shrewd creator of shell companies, and a successful seeker of loopholes, sweetheart loans and other swindles. Roy Cohn's name appears in this account. Also Roger Stone's. So does the phrase “moral compromise."
Like so many of these books, Bernstein builds on work done by others, especially The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. But through her own research — the footnotes are impressive — we see Trump's early (1988) relationship with Rudy Giuliani and Jerrold Nadler's early (1995) suspicions of Trump. These would acquire national significance a third of a century later. Cue the videotape.
Bernstein displays deep understanding of these two families, and how the progeny had social status the parents lacked but coveted. This passage is telling: “Donald Trump was gauche, Ivanka Trump was polished; he was unruly, she was disciplined. He was fun, but always a bit of a spectacle, Ivanka had become, to the Manhattan elite, one of us."
Bernstein seems to have embraced Michael Cohen's view that the Trump presidential campaign was principally a marketing opportunity. “The attempts to use the campaign to unleash a cash bonanza started immediately, across the globe," she writes. In the last section of the book she shows how the presidency itself is a marketing opportunity — for Trump's hotel in Washington, for his resorts across the globe, for his daughter's businesses, for his cronies.
The irony of books like this one — and books defending the president, even the one by his own son — is that they reinforce views rather than reshape them. Then again, that is what contemporary media, and contemporary conversation, do every day. In the end, “American Oligarchs" is the American conversation in hardcover.

In the course of putting together this series about quitting, even the project itself wasn't quit-proof, as my one-way correspondence with a writer who accepted the assignment -- then disappeared -- proved.

Texto completo: I Quit Dating Apps.
Five Times.
You're 24 when you get seriously dumped for the first time. It's the kind of dumped that leaves you couch surfing with friends watching old episodes of "Top Chef" on repeat and inhaling bags of mini stroopwafels from Trader Joe's. It's also the kind of dumped that propels you to scramble back to your hometown with a month's notice after spending six and a half years building a meaningful life in another city.
You cry a lot, forgo makeup for a few weeks, and then, because of the arrogance of youth, you decide that you'll meet someone better in mere months (before your ex because, yes, this is definitely a race). You'll try a dating app! People use them now; it's normal! You move to the Lower East Side and download OkCupid and set off a near-decade-long journey -- of seeking ultimately fruitless partnerships.
Still 24: You go on a few dates with an exceedingly nice man who went to college with Lena Dunham, a fact in which you feign interest, and with whom you see "Force Majeure" at the Angelika (it's fine).
You invite him to the Christmas party you're hosting with your roommate because as you are making a crème Anglaise for the cinnamon ice cream that will accompany a pumpkin pie (which you also baked) you suddenly intuit that your ex has already moved on and is celebrating Christmas with his new partner. (Future you: You were right, he did move on first). You decide this nice man should meet your oldest friends because you two are ready for that.
You're at work the next morning and all that bravado has morphed into panic. You have just made a grave mistake and need to rescind the invitation immediately.
You rescind the invitation via a long and garbled but earnest text saying you're just not ready for him to meet your friends because, for you, that would be akin to meeting family. He says he's bummed, but because he's exceedingly nice, he understands and asks to make plans later that week.
You quit dating apps for the first time because you feel like a monster and are probably not ready to date.
At 25: You've just been laid off and you spend your mornings applying to the same dozen newsroom jobs as hundreds of other people while rewatching "The Simpsons," Seasons 1 through 4, because you own them on DVD and you can't afford cable. You're making vegetable potpie because you can use what's already in the freezer and pantry.
You spend your evenings swiping right on what seems like every bearded 20-something man within a two-mile radius. You meet one of these bearded men, whose name you now can't remember, and you end up at a restaurant called Maharlika.
You ask him why he is single because, "You're far too good looking to be single" and spoiler: He does not like that question or qualifier. You also take home a doggy bag because why would you not want to eat that kare-kare later? He does not take home a doggy bag.
You quit dating apps, for the second time, because your friends rightfully clown you for becoming that insufferable man interrogating a woman as to why she's single. You are ashamed, but at least you have leftovers. You also still don't have a job.
At 26: You try Tinder since this is a numbers game and Tinder has the most people on it and no one does OkCupid anymore -- OkCupid is trashy now! You're not trashy! You go on a date with a fellow native New Yorker who also went to a specialized high school and who also has immigrant parents, and you think, this is it: I've found my person. Your therapist says, "You do well with Eastern Europeans -- I have a good feeling about this." He's Russian. He also ghosts you after one date.
You quit dating apps, for the third time, because this one makes you feel much lonelier than it probably should and you promise yourself that you will investigate why, but don't.
At 27: You join Hinge because everyone is telling you it's the dating app for earnest people wanting to be in a proper relationship. Before you go on your first date, your editor calls you to gently suggest taking the voluntary buyouts being offered because "last one in, first one out." (To be clear, this is in a different newsroom than your previous layoff. Your parents were right: You should have been a doctor.)
You meet your date, who is on crutches still recovering from a broken leg or foot or something you can't remember now, and eat happy-hour oysters. He is well read and went to school "in Connecticut." You confide that you're about to lose your job because he's a reporter and gets it.
The next few dates are sporadic because of an already planned vacation that dulls whatever momentum you could have had and then he loses his job. You are disappointed, but you have to be gracious about it or else you will seem callous. You tell yourself this one wasn't because of lack of interest: It was just bad timing! You keep your apps, but shelve them for a bit.
Still 27: You get a job at The New York Times after said buyout and you are so thankful to be working that you will now regard men as superfluous. You are ascetic. You will derive your happiness from your career. You don't need a man!
You delete all of the stray apps from your phone with conviction: OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, Tinder, Hinge. Bumble too, because you forgot you used Bumble for literally one night after realizing it's all just white financiers who take pictures shirtless on boats and they wouldn't like you anyway. This is the fourth time you've quit.
Between the ages of 27 and 30: You spend a fair amount of time performatively complaining about dating apps because you have a strong feeling you will not be meeting your person online, but during your weak moments you download them again and still go on dates and call them target practice. There are memorable losers (looking at you, vegan lawyer).
At 30: You badger a close friend over dinner into setting you up after your ego is seriously bruised by a 36-year-old baby (from Hinge) who rejected you.
You quit dating apps, for the fifth time, but for the first time it's not out of failure. It's because you are in a healthy relationship with a person you met through said friend, as if you're the charmed, clumsy protagonist in a romantic comedy.
At 31: You're hoping neither of you quits each other -- but because you have weathered enough to assume the worst, you tell yourself that if it came down to it, what's a sixth time, anyway?

Texto completo: This week, Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story" received six Oscar nominations, including for best actor (Adam Driver) and best actress (Scarlett Johansson). In the movie, "an amicable split becomes a shattering rupture," A.O. Scott writes in his review. "What is happening is catastrophic, ridiculous and also -- as the lawyers know -- perfectly ordinary."
For readers who have watched the movie, we're curious what the experience was like if you've gone through a divorce or if you grew up with divorced parents. If you're married and watched it with your spouse -- and are still recovering -- we'd love to hear from you too.
Share details of your experience via the form below, and include contact information so The Times can follow up with you. We may publish a selection of the responses. Credit: By The New York Times

Texto completo: I Quit New York
I moved to New York in 2007 from Los Angeles, where I had been living after college at U.C.L.A. You show up in New York for a week in September, and you're like, This is the most magical goddamned place on the planet. This is where all of the things are happening in the world.
I had no job, and figured that New York would just provide for me, and it nearly didn't. I was on the verge of running out of borrowed money when I landed a job at a huge tech company via a temp agency. That turned into a full-time gig, and I ended up working there for 11 years.
I met my wife, Marcella, two weeks after I arrived, at a party. New York was awesome as a couple with no kids. We would go to outdoor movies in Bryant Park, see the symphony in Central Park.
But after a decade or so, I started to burn out. Part of it was that my wife and I had two kids and we were living in an 1,100-square-foot apartment in Brooklyn. It's a common refrain, but trying to raise a kid in New York is like growing an oak tree in a thimble.
Also, I'm originally from Utah, and wanted to be closer to nature, but in New York it's hard to find a tree that's not growing out of cement. One day I was out on a terrace at work and listening to the hum of the city, and it just felt so unnatural.
"Menacing" is too harsh a word, but it's this hum of anxiety. Everyone is so tense, so hunched. Even the cars feel hunched. I thought, I've got to get out of here.
[ Sign up here for Wait ... , our newsletter on how technology and celebrity are changing our lives.]
A buddy of mine had already given me a book called "Tools of Titans," and that got me into the FIRE movement. It stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. The idea is that you learn to cut out luxuries and extra expenses and try to boost your personal savings rate as high as 70 percent of your income.
There's this concept called geo-arbitrage, where you take your savings and move to a place with a lower cost of living.
My wife had always wanted to live abroad, so I started running the numbers. If we moved to a cheaper country, I thought I could just retire, and we'll all be happy. I could write a book.
My wife speaks Spanish, and wanted our kids to learn it as well, so Spain was one option. We went on a fact-finding trip to Granada and Valencia, but life there rhymed too closely with New York. We'd still be living in an apartment building, in a city. It was New York with an accent.
We figured we couldn't look at every single country, so let's just zero in on one. Costa Rica comes up on the list of everyone's favorite places to vacation. It's beautiful, there's tons of outdoors stuff, and it has good international schools, which became sort of the tail wagging the dog for us.
The whole family went down there on spring break and ended up in a town called Playa Potrero. It had this great view of the ocean, and you could hear howler monkeys in the jungle. You get swept up by the beauty of it. Also, it is very New York opposite. There's one road.
My wife was an elementary schoolteacher, but she took time off for the kids, and was just working part-time. She loves New York and was hesitant, but she felt outnumbered. She felt everybody needed more space.
For the most part she was trying to support me on this I've-got-to-get-out-of-here mission. I was in this mind-set of, I'm never going to work for a company again, so I put in notice at work, and then it was a mad dash to start packing up our lives.
We moved to Costa Rica in June 2018. Soon after we got there, Marcella took a job teaching first grade at the dual-language school our kids went to. So we did a swap. I became what they call an "amo de casa," a house husband.
We ended up spending a little more on housing than we wanted to. We knew people who lived a little more rustically, with no washer, dryer, no air-conditioning. You can get that for $ 300 a month.
But we didn't know how long we were going to be down there and we wanted to land in a good spot. So we rented a modern two-bedroom place on the beach. It was $ 3,000 a month, but it had a pool, and we would open up the gates to the backyard, and that was the sand.
I took about three months to decompress, but I realized pretty quickly, I couldn't retire. This is insane. I've worked all my life. I get a lot of joy and fulfillment by creating things.
And so, I started writing a book with a friend of mine back in Utah who wanted to adapt his podcast into a book. That was an interesting part of the move. I was 38 and just starting out as a writer.
People said you can't do that, it's too hard. But moving to a new country was this way to uproot some of these limiting beliefs, the idea that you can't just go and do something totally different. Sure you can.
So I was writing the book, but my full-time job was mostly taking care of the house and grocery shopping. I had this very silly, not-real vision of riding my bike to the store and filling up my little basket with fruits and vegetables, but in reality, the roads are obscenely dangerous.
There's so much rain that they're designed with a drop-off of three feet on either side for drainage, and everyone uses the same road -- and when I say everyone, I mean cars, people on foot, people on bikes, dogs. You try going down the road and all of a sudden a cow appears out of nowhere.
We ended up having to buy a car, a big Toyota S.U.V., but you pay at least 50 percent more for a car there than you would in the United States, because of all the taxes.
The nice thing about the town was that there was a very intense, small-town feel, so breaking into the expat community was not super-difficult. But we were looking for an integrated experience, and it was much harder to break into the local community.
I tried to volunteer a couple of times, but my Spanish wasn't up to snuff. Also, my wife has always been more the social connector, and I'm the introvert who can sit inside all day long. But she was working full-time, so we were in the wrong roles.
Our kids loved it there, and probably would have stayed forever, but we already knew by about three or four months that it wasn't the right place for us. That December, we took a weekend trip to see the Arenal volcano, and I was like, This is going to be great, we're going to go out into nature.
We were staying at this random Airbnb, this giant place like a furniture showroom way out in the middle of nowhere, and there was a bat in the ceiling that was making all this noise. I had just tried to hack a coconut in half with a dull machete and almost cut my toe off, and it was like, All right, what are we doing?
We were already planning to head back to New York for the winter break, and when we got there I met up with a former colleague of mine at my old company, and she was setting up a new team in Austin. I thought, O.K., we've got to start making some moves in another direction.
We moved from Costa Rica to Austin after 11 months, but I think we had to move to Costa Rica to end up in Austin. It was all about that relativity. Speaking for myself, I had to have that swing, to go there and say, "That's not right, the answer is somewhere in the middle."
I now ride my bike to work, safely, every day. It's 15 minutes along the lake. It's beautiful. The kids are going to a Spanish immersion school and they're doing great.
We live in a historic neighborhood called Clarksville, and we checked all the boxes: We got the rescue dog, and my daughter got some cowboy boots. We're settling into this new life. But again, who knows? I might just be a serial leaver.

I Quit My On-Demand Laundry Service

Texto completo: I Quit My On-Demand Laundry Service

Three months ago, on Oct. 18, I ended a five-year relationship with my provider of on-demand clean underwear. I did this first by deleting the app and then later throwing out three bags imprinted with their name. Every week since, I have been tempted to get back together with them.
We met in the spring of 2014, just as I was just starting to dabble with online services that promised to make my life easier: a little Amazon for a $ 5 loofah here; a little Instacart for groceries there.
All of this was O.K. because my girlfriend and I had recently become obsessed with an essay by two Nobel Prize-winning economists, who had achieved professional success and marital bliss by prioritizing time over money through their 30s.
They believed in outsourcing all that could be delegated, no matter the cost. If their savings account was measly, so what? The payout would come later. (I recently revisited the link; it was not an essay and they did not have Nobel Prizes, along with other key differences. Oh well.)
Still, I was committed to my laundromat. It was right across the street. Until, one day, it wasn't. Its lease was up. There were plenty of other laundromats nearby, and yet I spent more than a few days that spring wearing bikini bottoms under jeans, promising to develop a new washing routine tomorrow.
It was around this time that I first noticed the vans with a slogan promising clean underwear on demand. A cartoony drawing of white briefs reinforced the point, even from a distance. And in Brooklyn that year, there was always at least one of these vans in the distance.
The price seemed a bit steep. But as our favorite economists (to misremember) said: time over money! My girlfriend and I fell in love almost immediately. We would open the app, press a button and sometimes within minutes there would be a man bounding up the stairs.
Within hours, we would get an alert that our laundry was available for delivery. "How is this sustainable?" I wondered, but only briefly -- because I was so very busy with all the future-enriching things that outsourcing enables.
One of those things was making a podcast about time. But even though, by 2017, I was obtaining most things in life -- toothpaste, tacos, taxis -- with two clicks, I was having trouble digging in.
"Where are the hours hiding?" I asked Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at N.Y.U.
Modern conveniences rarely save time, she told me, directing me to the work of the technology historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan.
In the 1983 book "More Work for Mother," Dr. Cowan shows that the 19th century was brimming with oodles of innovations that promised luxurious downtime. "There were hand-driven washing machines and taps for indoor cisterns, eggbeaters and pulley-driven butter churns," she writes.
Based on her analysis, however, none of these made life "one whit more convenient or less tiring during the whole of the century. What a strange paradox that in the face of so many labor-saving devices, little labor appears to have been saved!"
In the 20th century, just before World War II, automatic washing machines promised elusive blocks of nothing-to-take-care-of. What actually shifted was that people changed their underwear and sheets more often, creating more work of a different kind.
I was not sure how the laundry service was altering my behavior. Mostly I noticed other people's socks. There was something charming about finding them amid our belongings. Some of my own clothes went missing, too.
But when you love someone and they are growing quickly, silk pants get lost. And if my darling was not maturing, then, to be fair, neither was I. Sometimes when I accused them of losing my shirt, they had lost my shirt. Other times it was just hiding in my closet.
And then one day I realized that most of my best clothing, along with my now-wife's, was gone. Where was that jumpsuit?I hit "Schedule Delivery."
"Error," the app said.
I called and emailed and no one responded. A week passed, and then several more days. I wish I could tell you this was the moment I decided it was over. But no, that was just the moment I decided to become a hostage negotiator. I put in a fake order, gathered my cash and waited.
Philip Zimbardo, the psychologist behind the famous (and possibly discredited) Stanford prison experiment, has a theory that people have different time perspectives -- not totally unlike sexual orientations. Some are focused on the past. Others on the future.
I am a person of the present. And initially with the rise of on-demand apps, I convinced myself that this was the people of the present's moment to thrive. If we had forgotten to do absolutely everything until it was too late, there was an app for that.
These companies were doing such a great job rebranding procrastination as efficiency that I actually believed it.
It was comparably convenient for me to believe the man when he arrived at my house and told me everything would soon be resolved. He then pointed to the service's signature bag across the room. Did we want to put in another order? I am so very, very busy, I told myself. And when it goes well, it is just so very, very easy. We said yes, despite the fact that our clothes were still missing.
Of course, the app was not fixed.
I timed my walk to my new laundromat: 13 minutes there and back. Drop-off service is cheaper than my beloved app and technically available sooner. It has also forced me to get some exercise, the one task I have never figured out how to outsource.
I have come to see that for temporal anarchists, on-demand services only enable our worst tendencies, magnifying our chaos. That satisfying sense of completion we get just from clicking the button -- it's often a trick. Though we resented it, being tethered to old-fashioned commercial space and time was good for us.
And yet when the service finally returned our clothes, after nearly two weeks, I was tempted to try again. I told myself it was O.K. because they were dealing with a change in ownership. Also no one in history had ever willingly given up a timesaving convenience even if it never saved them time.
Right? Not exactly, Dr. Cowan told me when I called her. In the 1970s, as microwave ovens ballooned in popularity, many people were convinced that the home-cooked meal was over.
But though there was a period of frenzied experimentation with cooking everything and anything in microwaves, now they are used primarily for heating stuff up. As I write this, I can proudly say that I have not gone back to the service and the clothes I'm wearing are mostly clean.

Texto completo: The Federal Communications Commission said the intent of the robocalls was to "cause harm" with more than 6,000 such calls in six states.
A man who telecom regulators say was apparently behind a barrage of racist robocalls in six states -- sowing hate in response to the killing of an Iowa college student by an undocumented immigrant and a white supremacist's murder trial in Virginia -- is facing a proposed fine of nearly $ 13 million by the Federal Communications Commission.
The man, Scott D. Rhodes, who anti-hate groups say is a white supremacist and runs the website Road to Power, was "apparently" responsible for more than 6,000 robocalls in 2018 "with the intent to cause harm," the F.C.C. said on Thursday.
The commission said that in addition to Iowa and Virginia, Mr. Rhodes targeted people in California, Georgia, Florida and Idaho with the robocalls.
Most recently, Road to Power took credit for a flurry of racist robocalls made to Columbia University employees after Tessa Majors, a Barnard College freshman, was killed in a mugging in December in New York City. The calls, which promoted a white supremacist ideology, were not part of the F.C.C. action on Thursday.
The F.C.C. said it traced 827 spoofed robocalls that were made to residents in Brooklyn, Iowa, in August 2018 after the slaying of the University of Iowa student, Mollie Tibbetts, by an undocumented farmworker from Mexico. Ms. Tibbetts, whose murder has been invoked by President Trump in his push for a border wall, was from the small town.
The commission said Mr. Rhodes used an online calling platform to intentionally manipulate caller ID information to display local phone numbers as the source of the calls. That practice, known as neighbor spoofing, violates the Truth in Caller ID Act, the commission said.
"As if this tragedy were not enough, just two days after her funeral, Mollie's family, friends, and the close-knit community of Brooklyn began to receive a barrage of spoofed robocalls," Ajit Pai, the commission's chairman, said in a statement on Thursday. "Preying on the tragedy, the calls contained inflammatory prerecorded messages and a woman's voice apparently intended to impersonate Mollie Tibbetts saying 'kill them all.' "
Mr. Pai said the caller had been referring to undocumented immigrants from Mexico.
Attempts on Thursday to reach Mr. Rhodes, who has used several aliases, were unsuccessful.
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Rhodes will face criminal charges for the robocalls, which the commission said were all made in 2018. A spokesman for the commission said he could not comment about possible violations outside the agency's jurisdiction.
Mr. Rhodes has 30 days to respond to the commission's findings before the agency votes on the proposed fine. If the fine is imposed and Mr. Rhodes cannot pay, the matter would be turned over to the Department of Justice for collection, the F.C.C. spokesman said.
The Justice Department declined to comment.
The Anti-Defamation League, which monitors hate groups, said Thursday that it was critical to hold bad actors accountable.
"It's a great first step," Oren Segal, the director of the organization's Center for Extremism, said Thursday of the action taken against Mr. Rhodes. "Hopefully, the message is clear to extremists and bigots who want to use this technology in the future that there are consequences."
The commission said that Mr. Rhodes made 2,023 robocalls in November and December 2018 to residents of Charlottesville, Va., blaming the mayor and police chief for the murder of Heather Heyer in August 2017. Ms. Heyer was killed when James Fields Jr., who had traveled to Virginia to participate in a white supremacist rally, steered his car into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. Mr. Fields pleaded guilty to federal charges and was sentenced to life in prison.
The commission said Mr. Rhodes was also responsible for 766 robocalls in October 2018 targeting Andrew Gillum, who was the first black nominee for Florida governor from a major party.
In the audio of one of the robocalls obtained by The New York Times, a man pretending to be Mr. Gillum could be heard talking in the exaggerated accent of a minstrel performer. "Well hello there," it begins, "I is Andrew Gillum." He then spoke for a little over a minute about mud huts and unfair policing practices, and asked repeatedly for the listener's vote. In the background were the sounds of drums and monkeys.
The F.C.C. spokesman declined to comment about the robocalls that Road to Power took credit for in December in New York, which were condemned by Columbia University officials.
Sergeant Jessica McRorie, a New York Police Department spokeswoman, said Thursday evening that the case was still under investigation.
"There is no place for hate or intolerance in New York City, or anywhere," she said. "The N.Y.P.D.'s Racial and Ethnic Motivated Extremism unit is aware of this incident and looking into the matter." The F.C.C. said Thursday that Scott D. Rhodes, seen above on a podcast from his website, Road to Power, targeted people in six states with racist robocalls. (PHOTOGRAPH BY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: I Quit Buying Things
I grew up in Omaha, in a suburban household that had normal consumer routines. But even as a child, some of those patterns troubled me.
I would wear shoes until they had holes in them because I couldn't stomach the thought of buying new ones. I remember receiving Christmas gifts and afterward saying to my mom, "O.K., this thing, I don't need it. Can we return it?"
A lot of that moral critique was inculcated by my Catholic faith. I couldn't in good conscience participate in structures that exploit people and damage the earth, that preference my wants and desires over someone else's needs.
So after I graduated from college in 2018, I moved into the Su Casa Catholic Worker house in Chicago.
The Catholic Worker movement was started in New York City by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin during the Great Depression. They were looking for a way to put their faith into action to respond to the destitution they saw all around them.
Su Casa offers hospitality to immigrant families, families seeking asylum and families in the Chicago area who are facing homelessness, many of whom are fleeing domestic violence.
Workers like me come to live in the house because there's a tradition in the Catholic Worker movement of voluntary poverty. We want to share the same living conditions that we're offering to folks.
But I've been blessed with a great education, and if I burned my diploma and promised never to speak about it in a job interview, my life has still been enriched by that education. I don't know what it's like to go to the under-resourced schools that the kids who live in our community go to.
The Su Casa workers receive room and board, and work on a stipend. For most of the time I've worked there, it's been $ 100 monthly, but that's recently gone up to $ 200 a month. Our food is all donated; most of it comes once a week from two Trader Joe's on the North Side of Chicago. They give us food that they can no longer sell because of an expiration date or because the box is damaged. What we can't eat, we then compost.
Most of my stipend goes into public transportation so I can get around the city. There's not much left to make purchases with at the end of the day, but there's a freedom in that.
I'm on my mother's health insurance, but that doesn't work well because I live in a different state, so I usually go to free clinics. I recently had to go to a regular clinic for a strep test and paid $ 120. That took me about five months to pay off.
The first few months of being away from purchasing things were just pure joy. It was easier then because I still had things from my purchasing days that I could get more use out of. It did get harder, and yet, another wave of creativity came with that; that spark of necessity.
I teach a catechism class at our local parish that doesn't have a lot of resources. There are whiteboards and markers that I use in class, but no erasers, and I didn't have the extra money to go buy one.
I had a pile of clothes in my room that were torn up beyond repair, but I wanted to find a way to use them. One day I thought, "I'm going to use my old underwear to wipe off the whiteboard every week." It works great, and nobody else has to touch it.
My fiancée has been a champ and supports me emotionally. She's in medical school right now. We have learned to do different fun things together, like playing the piano. We both love to talk endlessly, so a lot of our time is inexpensively spent in conversation. She has also been really open and gracious if we do want to go out and eat together and disproportionately picks up the bill.
Not buying things has freed me to have more time, space and energy for relationships with others. Time for my fiancée, for my friends, for my housemates, for the vulnerable and the poor, time to listen to their stories, feel what their needs are and try to help those needs be met. It's also given me more freedom in my relationship with God; more time to pray and to simply receive my daily needs from divine providence.
I often find myself wishing that this decision could have an even greater impact, but little decisions do make a difference.

I Quit My Elaborate Skin Care Routine

Texto completo: I Quit My Elaborate
Skin Care Routine
Mine is a before-and-after of the kind that is often promised in midafternoon infomercials: a transformation so stark that it's impossible not to derive a little stab of pleasure from people's faces when I show them pictures of what my face looked like in 2015.
A moth-eaten curtain, Swiss cheese, the surface of Mars as zoomed back by the Curiosity rover: There is no dearth of resemblances I could invoke for the before, a pimple-dotted landscape that I used to bear with all the piousness of a reluctant martyr.
Now, in the after, sunlight bounces off the medication- and money-induced smoothness with a glare similar to that emanating from car windows covered in tint film.
My skin cleared up around the same time that I came into earning a reasonably livable salary. Like the many unmoored people of my generation who, in absence of the markers of stable life denied to us, embraced the deceptively seductive cult of skin care, I began spending madly on serums, exfoliants, humectants and occlusives.
I became fluent in the language of acids (lactic, azelaic, mandelic, glycolic), learned the difference between phenols banned in Europe but permitted in America, and subsequently ran out of space on my dresser to store my many many bottles of stinking, stinging substances and my arsenal of cruel-looking implements.
For the first time in my life, I could afford these middling indulgences and soak in the modest glamour they beheld, even if they didn't work the miracles they promised. There was the $ 105 lactic acid serum that the internet swore would give even nobodies like me a glow as youthful as a 1 percenter with a good cosmetic dermatologist. (It did not.)
I could experience the act of tending to my face as a luxury and not as the tedious medical maintenance of past years: holding my breath to swallow the nausea-inducing pills that were meant to dry out my pus-filled cysts so that they wouldn't burst and bleed on the pillowcase; gently scraping flakes of skin dandruff off my chin, the side effects from a rubbery acne ointment that smelled like burning tires.
When examined against the ancient and often gory tradition of men and women who got carried away in a feverish pursuit of preserving the elasticity of their visages, my hapless collection of nightly peels and acids hardly merits consideration.
But what had begun as an endeavor that brought me some materialistic joy somehow evolved into a personal Olympics of overcompensation, in which my new and improved self, aglow with its barely visible pores and its newfound class-passing brought about by La Prairie, was ready to obliterate the memory of who I was before.
Look at me now, I wanted this new money-infused face of mine to scream, whether at myself or at the world (I still do not know). Not only have I fought against my genes and my body and won -- WON -- I have also acquired enough meaningless outward signifiers to pass comfortably through the cordoned-off domains of an unfair world where your pore size screams out your tax bracket.
My reign as the sore winner of this imaginary competition lasted a year, at the end of which a hillock of breakouts suddenly emerged along both cheeks. Unlike the volcanic craters that had once been in their place, these were merely a signal that my post-age 25 hormones were in a tumult, nothing that a prescription wouldn't cure (and it did).
But the resurgence sent my insides roiling, first into panic, then resentment and ultimately into a reluctant peace, once the realization set in that no amount of money (of which I don't have much) or the entire spectrum of AHAs, BHAs or PHAs can rein in what is really just a medical affliction, and which must be treated as such.
The class cosplay with clinking glass bottles was nice while it was still a novelty. But now it is tiresome. It is boring. It is expensive. And I have neither the willingness nor any motivation to go on performing this elaborate toilette for an audience of one. Iva Dixit is an associate editor at The New York Times Magazine.

Texto completo: I Quit My Job After a Particularly Good Beach Day
Once upon a time, I worked at a magazine, reporting to a white woman who, early in our working relationship, told me that she didn't consider me a threat because "a black woman will never have this job."
She then proceeded to use every one of my ideas to completely redesign the magazine we worked for. It was the end of a moment in publishing when such a thing as a "big magazine job" still existed. I hung on because I really wanted to be an editor in chief one day and knew that quitting would take me out of the game.
One Labor Day weekend, my husband and I went away for a last gasp of family beach time. On the following Tuesday, our young daughter was scheduled to start kindergarten at a school that I had dreamed of getting her into for over a year, and I would return to work.
But I just could not leave the beach. It was Monday. We had splurged and gotten a cabana to enjoy. Lying on the beautiful beach that weekend, I knew that if I did not decide, right there, it would be another year before I could find the courage to quit that job.
[ Sign up here for Wait ... , our newsletter on how technology and celebrity are changing our lives.]
I stayed on that beach collecting courage. At 3 p.m. we checked out of our room and stored the bags. At 5 we were still on the beach, and home was now, with traffic, a five-and-a-half hour drive away. My husband, who is a saint, said, "Take all the time you need."
By 6, I had decided to quit. I changed my child into pajamas. I fed her In-N-Out at a rest stop on the freeway. She was asleep in the back seat by 8.
None of it was what I had planned for the night before her first day of school. But at least for the both of us, the day ahead meant new chapters. The next morning, I dropped her off at school bleary eyed and a little worse for wear. Then I walked into my office and quit.
I grew up with that Olivia Pope mentality that as someone with my race and gender, you have to work twice as hard to get half as far. I think that also meant that I had to work twice as hard to gather half the courage it took to quit a workplace that did not deserve my talents but still benefited from my excellence. It was hard to walk away from what looked, at least on paper, like a very good job.
I'm a woman of color and a first-generation American. It is practically encoded in my DNA to put up with inordinate amounts of microagression, if not outright aggression. I talk about this with my girlfriends who share that DNA, a lot. For us, quitting requires more than the "take this job and shove it" swagger that sometimes presents when people of a different hue and class do it.
But the woman I worked for refused to take my resignation. She refused to allow me to quit for three weeks. It was a move I hadn't expected, but so her -- she never accepted what wasn't convenient for her. She kept saying, "I'll accept this resignation when we've explored all of our options."
When she finally gave in, she insisted that I give her four weeks notice or she would blackball me. (A little irony there, since I'm black and she treated me like the help.)
Finally, eight weeks later, I walked out of that office, a free woman.
What came next was that I wrote four New York Times best sellers. I won two James Beard awards. I had a novel optioned by a producer I had long admired. I taught at Stanford University and Smith College. I was able to carve out an extraordinary amount of time to spend with my poor daughter who had started kindergarten sleep deprived and with a slight bellyache from me shoving fries down her throat in a moving car and calling it dinner.
I didn't want to just quit my job, I wanted to make a better life for myself. That came with a lot of hard work, and even overworking myself, but I did it for myself and on my own terms.
The topper of it all was the summer I rented an apartment in Madrid and enrolled my daughter in a camp at a museum there, just because I damn well felt like it. Me -- who in the years before had never taken off more than five days in a row.
When you're constantly shown to the back of the career bus, quitting what looks like a good job can be a vital moment of reclaiming the self-esteem that unlocks a world of possibility. At least it was for me. Photo Illustration by Tony Cenicola/The New York Times

Texto completo: I Quit My Smartphone
About a year ago, I noticed a distressing tendency in myself to drift off while the people I loved were talking. It didn't matter if they were talking about a book they had read or recent health problems or crushing grief or revelations from therapy.
Never before had I struggled to listen, but now I couldn't help checking out. Several times in the last year, my husband has had to ask in the middle of a conversation, "Where did you go?"
Where did I go? Nowhere good. Usually my mind returned me to the small computer in my pocket, to an unanswered email, to a "like" or a retweet, to a comment I found threatening or flattering (though increasingly, any kindness I received through a device acted on my nervous system like derision).
Suffice to say, I went away. In giving my attention to the device, I withheld it from the person I value most.
And there were other troubling symptoms. It was hard to read or write for sustained periods, which is concerning because that is my job. I was forcing myself to push through a handful of pages before reaching for the phone as reward -- orienting toward the activities I loved as if they were chores, and toward the object as a source of pleasure (though it was more often a source of anxiety).
I hadn't deliberately chosen to worship my smartphone, but when you repeatedly bow your head to something, stroking it thousands of times a day, it begins to shine like an idol.
I tried to moderate, leaving the phone off or at home when I went for a walk. But rather than feeling free, I felt more tightly leashed, worried about missing phantom emergencies. I'd reflexively pat my body down, like I did when I first quit smoking: the addiction policing the addict. Come to think of it, this was all beginning to feel very familiar.
Once upon a time, I smoked a half a pack a day. Sometimes I smoked more, sometimes less, but I was a smoker through and through. Before I quit, I couldn't imagine life without cigarettes, my constant companion, my carcinogenic security blanket!
I leaned on them for everything. They calmed my stress, anger and fear. They underscored celebration and increased pleasure.
I used them as an excuse to be outdoors, to escape socializing, or as entree to a circle of others. I loved the good will fellowship of smokers, the gift economy of bumming. I loved the ceremony of packing a fresh pack, undressing the cellophane, lighting up, stubbing out. I loved it all. Frankly, I still think smoking looks cool, and quite often sexy.
No one thought I would quit smoking -- least of all me -- but I did. Not because I was fed up with smelling bad, or being sick all the time, or because I knew smoking caused cancer and heart disease.
Instead, it was because every hour on the hour, no matter where I was, who I was talking to or what I was doing, an internal timer would go off alerting me to my master's need, pulling my focus away no matter how desperately I wanted to stay in the moment.
"Each cigarette causes the craving for the next, to fill the emptiness caused by the nicotine leaving your body."
I had read this in "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking," a 1985 book by Allen Carr that helped me (and purported millions of others) to quit cold turkey. To paraphrase a key point: You do not smoke because you need something to do with your hands, or because you love the ritual of it, or any of the other excuses people make. You smoke because you're addicted to a powerful drug called nicotine.
"Get it clear in your mind," he writes. "CIGARETTES DO NOT FILL A VOID. THEY CREATE ONE!"
I wound up kicking nicotine by never smoking another cigarette. It was that simple. It was hellish at first, and then I got used to it.
Smartphones are not cigarettes (I'd argue their charms are fewer), but like cigarettes, those who design and peddle them have worked hard to cultivate addiction in their users, creating voids that only they can fill. I don't deny the convenience and timesaving benefits in having a smartphone, but I don't think convenience is what is driving people to stroke their screens about 2,600 times a day.
So I got rid of my smartphone. And brother, it was approximately one million times easier than quitting smoking. I can check my email and social media platforms on a laptop as needed, but now that they are out of my pocket they no longer nag at me.
Turns out using a dumbphone is like riding a bike; T9 (the old-fashioned texting we used to do using the nine numerical buttons) is not nearly as bad as I'd remembered. I have a gazetteer in the car, and when that fails, I ask people for directions. (This typically prompts the Samaritan to pull out a smartphone.)
It took about 72 hours to teach my body that we had gone back to the old ways, and though I had assumed it would take much longer, the change was almost instantaneous. Moderation requires effort and will power, but when the device is gone there is nothing to resist. I can read a book for hours in a sitting, and when my loved ones speak I hear the story they're telling.
Which is to say, I am free again to enjoy the things I have always loved, to worship the god I choose.

Texto completo: I Quit the Priesthood
I grew up in a very Roman Catholic atmosphere in western Kansas and had always been drawn to the priesthood.
I joined the Capuchin religious order in 1976, and I was ordained in 1978 at age 28. Almost immediately, the underlying tension I had felt about intimate relationships really came to the fore. I struggled greatly.
I was in various flirtations with women, or little romantic relationships, but that's a normal part of life. The Roman Catholic priesthood, though, with its mandatory celibacy, discourages any close contact with women.
I would look at my brothers and sister and the families they raised, and I couldn't accept the notion that I was making a greater sacrifice than they were in their jobs and raising children.
I went on a leave of absence from the priesthood in 1989 and started dispensation two years later, which means I had to write up a paper to John Paul II in Rome to explain why I wasn't able to continue. I wrote that there were two things that prompted my leaving: that I wanted to be more involved in social justice and peace work, and that I felt I could not successfully live a celibate life.
I sought dispensation both for my own peace of my mind and for my family. I knew it would soften the blow for my parents -- it was a heartbreak for them.
A lot of priests did not get dispensations. Their applications would be in a pile someplace for years. One priest said to me, "They haven't gotten back to me in 11 years."
In my case, by the grace of God, I received a letter and document in January of 1992 granting me "a dispensation from the obligations of priestly ordination, including celibacy, and from religious vows."
Then I was considered, in the eyes of the church, a lay person. I was free, and in June of that same year, I got married in a Catholic church in Seattle.
I knew my wife for seven years before we got married. I had met her when I was still a pastor of a church in Denver. She had been in a religious order of nuns, but had left three years prior to our meeting.
We became friends, and by the time I left the Roman Catholic priesthood in 1989 we were in a relationship. We weren't married until 1992, and part of that was just my slowness to mature. I had to work through a lot.
The transition was huge. I had gone to a high school seminary and a college seminary, where it's a celibate atmosphere and an all-male atmosphere, and both psychologically and on a sexual level, I was quite immature. The first 10 years of my relationship with my wife, Nancy, were about learning how to be in a romantic relationship, and it was a long learning curve.
By the grace of God we have been married now for 26 years. You have to learn how to be a "we" rather than a "me" -- the celibate priesthood is kind of honing you to be individualistic, yet also an overly generous servant of the church.
When you leave, you have very little financially. I worked in lots of labor jobs. I was a furniture laborer. I worked day jobs for $ 5 an hour. I dug ditches. I unloaded trucks. During what I call the 14-year hiatus, I wanted to get back to ministry as a priest, but there wasn't an avenue to do that in the Roman Catholic church.
It wasn't until 2004 when I found the Ecumenical Catholic Communion that I could be a priest again.
We are one of the expressions of independent Catholicism, which are churches that follow the practices, the beliefs and the teachings of the Catholic church but are not under Rome, not under the pope. The pope is not our superior. I'm still functioning as a priest because I was accepted by the founding bishop of this Ecumenical Catholic Communion.
There's another way of being Catholic. There's another way of being to be complete. That's what all transitions are about. I've taken everything that I learned in my life as a Capuchin and as a Roman Catholic priest.
It's with me all the time, but I have gone beyond the limitations of that to a much more extensive consciousness.

Texto completo: I Quit the Presidential Campaign
There's a difference between form and content. Forms change, but content doesn't. As long as you're focused on content then you're more emotionally and psychologically able to let form go.
I think sometimes in life, we grasp at form and that never ultimately serves, because when the wind isn't at your back, that doesn't necessarily mean your ideas are wrong. It simply means that a form isn't thriving. Sometimes in life you have to let one form die before another one can be born.
It was difficult getting to the decision to end the campaign, but once the decision was made, there was some level of peace and relief. When you commit to a goal, you are hoping that goal materializes. So there's always some level of grief connected to letting go the form of a dream or of a goal you have.
I told a supporter in New Hampshire that we had beautiful flowers, but that I failed to create a vase. And she said, that's O.K., because now we're going for the garden.
I feel I have a somewhat small window of opportunity, during which to take the energy that was created on this campaign and harness that in some movement going forward.
So, I'm not on vacation. I'm not on vacation at all. I'm planning a conference called the Repair America conference that will be held in late March in Washington, D.C., with people convening to continue talking about the issues that this campaign stood for.
I have long felt that people in the transformational and higher consciousness, religious and spiritual communities are the last people who should be standing on the sidelines in regard to the great economic, political and social questions of our day.
Because if you know what changes one heart, you're the one who has a clue as to what would change the world.
Throughout our history, some of the greatest social justice movements have emerged from religious and spiritual circles. What is happening now is an aberration. The way the left has pushed to the sidelines a larger spiritual perspective -- at least when that perspective is articulated by me -- is an aberration.
Bobby Kennedy was the one who said that the war in Vietnam was a contest for the soul of America. John F. Kennedy said, "This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor." Martin Luther King said it was time "to inject a new dimension of love into the veins of our civilization."
I grew up in a generation where you read Ram Dass and Alan Watts in the morning, and you went to a Vietnam antiwar protest in the afternoon. The countercultural tumult of that time was all across the board. It was personal, it was sexual, it was cultural, it was musical, and it was political.
They were all mixed in together. And the separation of those things into categories has diminished our capacity to present to the American people the kind of holistic vision of change that I believe is necessary.
[ Sign up here for Wait ... , our newsletter on how technology and celebrity are changing our lives.]
I think the emotional tenor in the last campaign, among the electorate, it was rage, and it was legitimate rage. It was rage based on the fact that millions and millions of people knew that the system was rigged against them. And they were right about that.
Now this time, however, some of the underlying forces have shifted. And I think that the emotional tenor of this moment is not rage. I think it's exhaustion.
How you exit a situation is very important in any relationship, in any endeavor. And this exit was done with a lot of conversation among my supporters and those closest to me. So it wasn't like we didn't process what was happening.
It was important to me that people understood what was happening, what I was thinking and feeling. And it was important that I understood what they were thinking and feeling. And because of that there was among quite a few people a consensus.
There were multiple conversations. And it was difficult. It was emotionally difficult, but I'm sure it was emotionally difficult for Kamala. It was emotionally difficult for Beto. It was emotionally difficult for Cory. I mean, we're all grown-ups here.
Everybody understands this is tough. It's tough for people. Candidates are human beings. And you're deeply exposed and we're living in a very meanspirited moment. So everybody could step back and appreciate everybody's humanity a little more than we do.
Americans sometimes have an odd idea about what makes up failure and what makes up success. My effort failed as a presidential campaign, but it succeeded in putting a lot of ideas out there that I feel belong in the national debate.

Texto completo: I Quit Dating Entirely
I started having sex at 16, and I didn't have my first orgasm during sex until I was about 25. In 2013, I decided to stop dating and having sex with other people entirely.
I have never really had a boyfriend or long-term relationship. It has always been a sexual thing. I had two long-term friends with benefits: one for seven years and another for 10. After my last relationship ended, I was like, why am I doing this? I was good enough to have sex with, but not good enough to be taken on dates or introduced to friends.
It just made me feel so bad about myself, like I was a dirty secret. I thought, I'm over this -- I don't want to deal with men anymore. I am not a big dater as is, so I just got over dating. The urge went away.
Often people don't understand when I say I'm celibate. They ask if I like women, or if I'm a nun. And then they will say, "So are you asexual?" and that is a totally different thing. There is also always that element of whether it's for religion. I was raised in a Buddhist household, but my decision has nothing to do with religion.
People ask, "Aren't you horny?" Well, yes, but I can take care of myself in every way, and more women should try that. I think people often just don't know what celibacy is, or they don't believe it. They'll say, "Oh, you'll find him." But why do I have to? Why do I have to be sexual with anybody, like I'm not allowed to just be by myself?
It's not a big issue with my friends or my family. But it is annoying when I go to family events and all my aunts are asking if I'm seeing anybody and I'm like, "I've already told you, that's not going to happen."
Over the years, I have been getting to know myself better. I used to let guys treat me any type of way, and at some point, you just realize: I am worth more than this. I deserve to be taken on dates. I'm not a sex toy. The buildup to the decision was that I saw myself giving so much to these people.
I also think dating has changed so much. You don't meet people in real life, and dating online means everybody has every single person in the palm of their hand, and they are always looking for the next best thing.
My whole attraction to men has turned off -- I don't have any interest in going on dates anymore. I will meet people out and they will ask for my number and I say, "No, I don't date."
Maybe it is also an empowerment thing, that I don't need attention from a man at all, that I have myself. All of my sleepless nights staying up crying, wondering if he's ever going to call me again, if he still likes me, do I have worth outside of my vagina -- all these doubts just left when I quit dealing with men. I have never been happier. It's such a freeing experience.
Women who don't have kids or don't get married, we are looked at as so much lesser in society. We need to try and make it more normal. Most of my friends are in relationships or have children, but I do see a lot more women in my age range who are just not into dating or don't want to have kids.
My mom has seven kids, and was always a stay-at-home mom, so I've always been kind of headstrong in that way that I don't need a man to survive. Even when I was younger, I never saw myself with kids, living in a house with a white picket fence. It's O.K. to be alone.
I am free to do more art, find out what I really like, and what I am going to tolerate when it comes to how I'm treated by people.
It has even helped in other situations. I just became so much more confident in my own abilities, because I didn't need someone to make me feel fulfilled or complete. I can take myself to the movies. Ms. Dixon lives in Denver, Colo. This interview has been edited.

Texto completo: I Quit Chewing Gum
Forget about "Drynuary," which I broke on Jan. 2 with that insouciant leftover chardonnay in the door of the fridge. Or diets, long feminized and scorned, and now rebranded by annoying tech bros as "intermittent fasting."
What I really want is to eschew the chew. To give up gum.
Yup, your harmless little post-meal breath freshener has been my tormentor for over a decade. It was around 2009 -- stressed by a leadership change at my former job, two toddlers at home and probably the Great Recession -- that I began my harmless-seeming pack-a-day afternoon habit: a substitute for the sugar forsworn on the advice of a reproductive endocrinologist.
Orbit, Sweet Mint, its packet pale green, like money, like the approximately $ 5,500, conservatively calculated, I've spent on gum since then. If I had invested in Netflix instead of little rubbery sticks, I could have paid for those toddlers' college educations.
But the other occupant of my shared office had been laid off, and so in lonely luxury before the open-plan revolution yet to come, I would sit behind a closed door, the refuse from my spicy Chipotle lunch in the trash can, grinding away at two, three, four or more calming, cooling pieces as I processed piles of cub reporters' copy until the violet hour.
Sometimes someone would burst in without knocking, and I'd be mortified at having to spit out what had accumulated before conversation could begin.
This was better than a recurring nightmare I had, however, in which a growing wad refused to budge from my mouth, and my dream self would begin to panic, pulling out stretchy strands and teeth.
"I will not assert that the interpretation of dreams due to dental stimulus as dreams of masturbation (the correctness of which I cannot doubt) has been freed of all obscurity," wrote Freud with typical puckishness. "I carry the explanation as far as I am able, and must leave the rest unsolved."
Was I mired in the "oral stage"? Past my aching mandible I coughed up a few repressed childhood memories. Hiding some "a.b.c." (already been chewed), verboten grape-flavored Hubba Bubba inside an empty Simon electronic-memory game box. Crackling the waxy comics that came with Bazooka Joe. Wanting to watch the long kisses in Big Red commercials.
I was likely just masticating anxiously in my sleep, the repercussions of which have earned me a super-sexy custom mouth guard in clear plastic covered by dental insurance.
In the meantime, my afternoon habit had followed me to The New York Times -- and why not? According to studies cited for years in the venerable science and opinion sections, chewing sugarless gum helps prevent tooth decay by stimulating the production of saliva, which washes away or neutralizes corrosive food particles.
"I think gum was ominous because maybe socially it wasn't accepted," said Dr. Alice G. Boghosian, a spokeswoman for the American Dental Association, which has put its Seal of Acceptance on several brands, including Orbit. "If you can't get to a toothbrush and you feel like popping a piece of gum, it's a good thing."
Gum is also said to quell hunger pangs (though undermining the "mindfulness" and purity of an intermittent fast; moreover the sucked-in air and an excess of certain artificial sweeteners may cause gastric distress), and increase focus and alertness.
When I was assigned to a jury on a second-degree murder case in Downtown Brooklyn, the guard advised us to chew gum to stay awake during the long hours of testimony. Not respectful of the lawyers, I thought, and anyway not necessary; the trial was so riveting that I briefly considered becoming one myself.
Instead, I returned to a newsroom soon stripped of cubicles, where chewing gum became a peppy communal experience, thanks in part to noise-canceling headphones and A.D.A.-accepted Extra spearmint vended from a machine by the restrooms at $ 2 a pop.
Then a colleague started bringing in canisters of chewable Mentos -- the Freshmaker! -- which she would place sociably on her desk. I was done for, gorging on the gratis gum as if I were Melissa McCarthy parodying Sean Spicer, virtuously recycling the plastic empties.
But in a burning world, gum itself is among the worst kind of garbage: non-compostable, occasionally sticking embarrassingly to clothing or important papers. The thought of the accumulated mass I'd consumed and discarded over the years was repellent, like my own personal version of London's infamous fatberg.
Not long ago I happened upon an artist friend, Gerardo Blumenkrantz, making Banksy-like chalk drawings around a few of the many sooty blobs that New Yorkers spit out that have flattened and coagulated onto city sidewalks, with titles like "Babylonian pet playing with a ducky," which he displays on the Instagram account @splatista, making temporary beauty of the ugliness. With our iPhones and smart sneakers, how can we urban gum chewers still be so disgustingly medieval?
The final disincentive, though, was learning from one dermatologist, Jessica Wu of Los Angeles, that enthusiastic, repetitive gum chewing is believed to widen both the masseter muscles, creating a jowl-like effect, and those muscles around the temples. "In extreme cases, it can make your face look like a peanut," she told me.
The remedy is Botox (never!), or simply ceasing the rampant chompery, which Dr. Wu advised that I not try to do all at once. "Switch to smaller portions," she said. "Half a Trident!"
But like the song "All or Nothing at All," I only wanted "Nothing -- or Every Piece I Can Get My Hands On." Cutting back on gum was simply not going to cut it. I had to cut it out. And so I have. Pass the chardonnay! Photo Illustration by Tony Cenicola/The New York Times

Emotional Labor
Around a month and a half ago, one of my mentors passed away unexpectedly. He was a former boss of mine, but also a friend, and the most supportive person in the world. He was one of the few people in my life who supported me 100 percent.
My current boss knows what I'm going through, but seems completely uninterested in supporting me through this very painful moment. He doesn't say a word to me in person, and only talks to me through work chat to ask about upcoming tasks. I've told him what I'm dealing with, and he hasn't given me much of a response aside from "I'm sorry, dude." This is made a thousand times worse because we sit right next to each other. I've tried to spend as much time as possible working from home in order to avoid this anguishing office environment, but he chided me for "abusing work-from-home privileges."
There's a massive hole in my heart, and his complete neglect for my feelings is tearing me apart. I lost what was probably the best boss in the world, and instead of feeling supported in my office, I feel cold and isolated. Every single day in the office feels like a poisonous dagger in my heart. Nobody likes feeling ignored, but this feels so powerfully suffocating emotionally. What's the best way to confront this? Do I need to find a new job, or is there some other way to ease all this anguish?

Before doing anything else: Schedule an appointment with a therapist. Neither your boss nor your newspaper columnist is a viable substitute for a mental health care professional. Exploring your distress with a trained guide could help you recalibrate in the wake of this death. PsychologyToday.com and other sites have therapist search tools that allow you to filter by factors like location, insurance and specialization. Select "grief."
Few environments are less conducive to grieving than the average American office, devoid of privacy and irradiated with fluorescent lighting. We do not have good norms for grieving at work. In fact, since the practice of wearing mourning garb for prolonged periods fell out of favor around World War I, we have not really had any norms for grieving anywhere. Today, employees are lucky if we receive three paid days off for the death of an immediate family member, after which we are gently expected to return to work and make our colleagues uncomfortable for the foreseeable future. (Is it O.K. yet to instant message him office gossip? Or is he still upset that his sister died?) Grief is like an injury; workplaces should make more room for it. Of course, they should also offer good parental leave. It's all mostly dreams at this point.
It can be a source of great distress -- and stress -- to not feel supported by your boss. But it sounds like you're expecting a lot from this man, and resenting him for a reasonably professional reaction to the news that an employee's former boss died several weeks ago. (Of course, while emotional support peaks in the immediate aftermath of an event and dwindles over time, grief is not necessarily linear.) Your high-key reaction to his low-key reaction may be making your boss apprehensive to get personal with you, creating a cycle of perpetual dissatisfaction for both.
The only person you should rely on to support you 100 percent is you. Your boss's job is not to offer you unconditional comfort and encouragement; it's to make sure you're doing your job, which is to perform work tasks the way he expects. If you can't, that's on you to manage by, for instance, going to therapy or seeking out a grief support group. You cannot make your emotional labor a collaborative project with co-workers.
If you truly feel your workplace is cold to the degree that you can no longer handle being present, look for a new job. If you don't want to leave, you should discuss with a therapist how to communicate with your boss before he decides independently it would be best for you to go.
Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Board?
I work for a tiny nonprofit. I love my job, my supervisor and the rest of our team, but I hate the very "engaged" board of trustees. They frequently interfere with my work, upset our partners and disregard the staff.
When I was hired two years ago, I made it clear to the board that I was interested in eventually pursuing a graduate degree. It looks like I'll be doing that next fall, pending acceptance to a program, which I'll find out in the spring. I've already given my supervisor a heads-up that I was sending in applications, and he was supportive. I'm nervous that if I let them know before I hear back from the programs and then don't get in, they might end my contract anyway. If I wait too long to tell them, I'll put my organization into a tough spot for hiring my replacement, Either way, they could make my last months with this organization miserable. What do I owe the board and my team?

This is the beauty of supervisors: They run interference with scary people in exchange for better titles and salaries than their subordinates. It's easy to prioritize an underresourced workplace's interests over your own, especially if you admire its purpose. Work, however, will not reciprocate selflessness. It will become accustomed to it. You owe only your agreed-upon terms of notice. (Maybe your contract requires two weeks in exchange for paying out unused vacation?) It was considerate to loop your supervisor in early. Since you two have a good relationship, keep him updated. He can worry about what, when and how to tell the board.
Blood Simple
I'm a 70-year-old man who is happy to still be employed and evolving. Almost all my co-workers are much younger than I. We have a great relationship. I enjoy (most of) their conversations and look forward to work each day.
Just one concern: Two women tell us each month when they are on their period or when it is approaching. I don't know what to say or do when they tell me this. I never worked with other women who made their periods public.
What, if anything, should I say when my co-workers announce they're on their period?

Be grateful you are not on your period and say nothing.

Texto completo: I Quit Cars
I was born and raised in L.A., and my mom is an environmentalist. We've always composted and she's always had some sort of garden. She also never threw anything away because she could see the second life in it.
I grew into a similar lifestyle. My personal journey into environmentalism was heightened after the presidential election of 2016. The topic of offshore drilling was getting very loud and getting a lot of attention. I've always gone to the beach and been a big ocean enthusiast, so I knew I had to kick it into high gear. I started taking extension classes to get a certificate in sustainability at U.C.L.A., and I started assessing my carbon footprint and consumption.
As a result, I decided to give up my car for one month in May of 2017. I just wanted to test if I could do it.
If I needed a car, I was going to borrow someone's to prove that I had the community to support this decision. I only ended up borrowing a car once, and I realized it didn't make sense to own a car, finance it and pay for gas. So in September, I fully quit and sold my car.
It was totally liberating. A constant theme I've found in not owning a car is liberation. I like not sitting in Los Angeles traffic and the peace that brings. I take the train now to see my boyfriend in Orange County, and I always joked that when I used to see him on Friday nights, I'd get out of the car and be ready to punch somebody in the face because that traffic takes years off your life. Now, taking the train is so easy. There's only one transfer. I can work. I can read. I can take my time, and I'm in such a good mood.
After I sold my car, I was able to save around $ 6,000 a year with the payment, gas, maintenance, tolls and everything that owning a car took, which helped me knock out a huge chunk of my student loan.
I also live within walking and biking distance to work, so that only amplified the reason to get rid of my car.
So I bike a lot. I spent a little bit of money on a bike with a big basket in the back for running errands. I figured, if it was going to replace my car, it had to be comfortable and have a good lock and a light. And I've learned so much about bike lanes and the best roads to take in L.A.
There's also a Metro line that goes downtown, and sometimes I use e-bikes and Bird scooters.
I'm also lucky I live in L.A., where the weather isn't too crazy. Sometimes though, I'll be the person riding their bike in the rain. It's fun. I take an Uber or Lyft if I really need to, but sometimes I'll feel guilt or shame because I'm trying to quit all cars, not just my car.
I also fly a lot for work, and on my ticket from the travel agency, it will include how many tons of carbon you're emitting from just your single seat, which is like a punch in the gut.
As a result, it has become habitual for me to offset my carbon emissions. There are many ways to do it, but I just found one that works for me. I calculate my carbon emissions, and go onto carbonfootprint.com and purchase an offset in the form of a donation. Some campaigns you can donate to focus on regenerative foresting and planting more trees, some are socially sustainable programs focused on educating women and children.
If we're going to pollute the environment this much, we have to be doing something that's going to offset the carbon in return until there's a carbon tax, which I truly hope is where we will go next.
In conversations on sustainability and environmentalism, it's also really important to talk about what we could see the future as, because it gets so dark so fast when people talk about climate change and how many years we have left. When we talk about the future and ask "What would it look like if everyone was cooperative? What would it look like if everyone was contributing, or just aware?"
In college, I sometimes felt lost and didn't know my purpose or passions, and now I realize it's so obviously this. I don't know what the impact or the effect is of me not having a car, but I hope it's something that I can't necessarily see.

Texto completo: I Quit the Act of Quitting
I'm a quitter, in the right sense of the word, by present-day standards. I, like so many brave men and women with the means to do so, have gotten by for days at a time without any bread items, without any sweets, without any alcohol, without any meat.
I change when these dietary changes are afoot. I become slighter, I spend less money, I spend more time in bed, my energy drained. I become a being with less of a connection to the outside world.
Similar effects occur when I give up other types of behavior -- socializing, for instance, or engagement with social media. Suddenly I turn into one of those people with a beatific air exuding from the face, someone who gets asked, "Do you meditate?" (I do.)
It's as if, in these altered states, I have already died. I have ascended into some perceived higher plane, become the perfect version of myself I so long to manifest, floating above the meat-eating, carb-addicted, phone-holding rabble.
No wonder, perhaps, that my vows to reduce social interactions go so well at these times. Who, after all, would want to spend time with me?
The connection between insufferability and perfection has not escaped me. At those times in my life that I undergo some disciplinarian makeover, and quit some or all collectively-deemed-as-such vices, I become, in my mind, representative of both qualities. Inevitably, my world constricts.
I feel superior to the many lifestyle gurus who today attempt to achieve perfection in plain sight, because I do not benefit financially from my deprivations. No one pays me to promote any products, because I have likely eschewed all of them, dumped everything with a label into a trash bag and vowed to live off coconut oil -- the all-around product of choice for the apocalyptic-minded, impressionable minimalist -- alone.
I have learned, however, a surprising lesson from my various ascents into periods of insufferable perfection. They are not, I think, worth it.
I lose touch with the qualities that are enhanced by intimacy with vice, with choice, with plenitude. What sort of willpower does it take to resist a sweet when one's house contains nothing but green powders? What is the worth of peace of mind if it necessitates a blockade against the goings-on of the world?
Moderation has become something of a lost darling these days, in the world of lifestyle trends. Gone are the days when everyone with a mic preached that eating everything in moderation, experiencing everything in moderation, is the way toward a happy and fulfilled and balanced life.
A physician whose offices I visited a year ago suggested that I cease my moratorium on alcohol. She told me that studies indicate a bell curve, in terms of mortality -- no alcohol at all can hasten it, in the same way that too much can.
But there seemed to be an infinite number of reasons behind the conclusion. Perhaps people who drink a few times a week are the types who regularly meet up with friends. Perhaps they are the types who don't take themselves or life so seriously.
The Swedish famously developed the national philosophy of "lagom," or "just the right amount." One may shift its slant out of a deprivational focus into an expansive one. Just the right amount of frivolity, but seriousness as well, may be a key aspect of a life well lived. Self-deprivation could, after all, be rebranded as a form of vanity, of narcissism, of immoderation -- taking more than one's due by another script.
Why should I exist on any higher, ultra-curated plane than anyone else? Thus, with the freshness of a new decade upon me, I plan to return to an original, humane, childlike and sociable state: to quit the act of quitting.
I will try everything that comes my way and, in so doing, hopefully learn how to conduct myself in a world populated with more people than just me.

Texto completo: I Quit Giving a Damn
The first time I dipped my toe into a world devoid of other people's opinions was by accident. I'd quit my job after burning out badly (this was a few years before "burnout" had entered the lexicon, and thus I was just crazy), and immediately spent a week giddily driving around the Florida Keys in a red Mustang convertible, top down -- a portrait of freedom that instilled envious approval from all those around me.
Upon my return, however, unable to put things back together, I had slowly come untethered from all the expectations that come with being a recognizably functioning person in the world.
For months when people asked me what I did, I'd blithely respond, "Nothing." Their uncomfortable silence was thrilling. Who knew you could leave people speechless by doing nothing? It also worked as a balm; there was some perverse pleasure in seeing my own inability to figure out my life reflected in others.
Their interest in my situation lasted only, at best, about 60 seconds, and therein lay one of life's most powerful (if alarming) lessons: Unless you are paying their bills, very few people care or think about what you are doing and why.
As it turned out, this was a good practice run for what came next. Namely, getting older. Whatever residual concerns I had for people's thoughts on how I was living (or how I looked doing so) loosed their grip considerably when I reached a certain age.
It's easier in many ways to stop being consumed by what the world thinks of you when you so promptly disappear from the stories the world tells about you. For some women this sudden invisibility feels like a punishment, but for me, a white educated woman with a reasonable amount of resources, it was a huge release.
Not that there is a historical scarcity of women who have stopped caring what other people think. We know these women; they are always older, and usually aunts or witches. They either have their own money or supernatural powers. Consider Aunt March in "Little Women," Shakespeare's Weird Sisters or the O.G., Auntie Mame.
These days, however, not caring has become its own industry. A quick search on Instagram for the hashtag #DGAF produces more than a half million results, which suggests that we as a culture are actually quite interested in people believing we do not care.
The most successful influencers, the current president included, appear largely to have curated an image of themselves predicated on the idea they do not care about what you, their legion of followers, think.
This raises the very Carrie Bradshaw-esque question: In a world that runs on likes, is it even possible to be unlikable?
And yet, perhaps there's never been an easier time to go cold turkey on other people. The truth is, now that we're in the midst of an apocalyptic news cycle, the only opinion I find I'm interested in is history's. Too bad the future doesn't have an influencer account.

Texto completo: Save energy by making small changes to your habits when using the dishwasher, dryer, and refrigerator.
There's no shortage of earnest advice about all of the ways you can reduce your energy use at home. Beyond the obvious stuff like setting your thermostat wisely, many of the tips, tricks, and optimizations take a lot of effort for a small payoff -- or cost a lot of money in replacing old appliances or HVAC equipment.
In collaboration with Wirecutter, a product review site owned by the New York Times Company, here are three often-overlooked ways that you can save a chunk of energy, and maybe some time and frustration, without having to shell out the big bucks.
Don't pre-rinse before loading your dishwasher
Using a dishwasher is almost always more efficient than washing your dishes by hand. But you can save even more energy, water, and drudgery by skipping the pre-rinse, too. Just load those crusty, greasy dishes right into the dishwasher. It's best to scrape off big globs of food, especially anything leafy or starchy, but basically anything goes.
This isn't exactly news: Everyone from dishwasher makers like Bosch to the Environmental Protection Agency has been spreading the word about this for years. But 65 percent of households still pre-rinse (or even wash their dishes) before loading them into the dishwasher, said Elizabeth Kinney, a senior communications manager at Procter & Gamble, the maker of Cascade detergents. "It's something so simple, but a tough habit for people to break," Ms. Kinney wrote in an email.
If you've tried to skip the pre-rinse but haven't had great results, you may need to supplement with a new detergent. Modern powder-based detergents, including tabs, are your best bet because they tend to include enzymes that break up proteins and starches so that they're easier to rinse away with water. Rinse aids and softening salts can also help.
When you skip the pre-rinse and let the dishwasher do what it's designed to do, you'll easily save a few thousand gallons of water (the most efficient kitchen faucets use almost 2 gallons per minute) and likely dozens of kWh of electricity (or the equivalent in gas) for your water heater per year. The savings on your utility bills will be modest -- but you'll get back so much spare time, at least 24 hours' worth by the most-conservative estimates.
If you still want to rinse your dishes before washing them (maybe to prevent odors while you're waiting to collect a full load), consider using the rinse-only feature on your dishwasher, if it has one (most do). It uses much less water than hand-rinsing in the sink.
Hang dry your clothes as often as you can
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electric clothes dryers account for 5 percent of all residential electricity use nationwide -- that's massive amounts of energy for a task that does itself, given enough time and air.
By ditching a dryer altogether, an average household could realistically save $ 90 worth of electricity per year, according to the Department of Energy's energy-savings calculator, though you could save a lot more or a lot less depending on your local utility costs, the type of fuel your dryer uses (gas dryers are more efficient), and how often you run it. Even hanging some but not all of your laundry can make a big difference.
Hang-drying also helps your clothes last longer, with less shrinkage and fiber damage. It's hard to give an honest estimate because some materials hold up just fine in a tumble dryer, according to Gajanan Bhat, Ph.D., head of the Textiles, Merchandising, and Interiors Department at the University of Georgia's College of Family and Consumer Sciences. Dr. Bhat also said that tumble drying does cause damage through abrasion, which affects the quality of material and is something hang-dried clothes don't endure.
Outdoor line-drying is also great if you have the option. The elements usually help clothes dry faster with fewer wrinkles and lingering odors, and can brighten whites. But if weather, space, or community restrictions (you live in a state without a "right to dry" law, for instance) make this impractical, indoor hang-drying also works, even in small homes. Great, compact drying racks can cost less than $ 30. (Wirecutter recommends the Polder Wall-Mount 24-Inch Accordion Drying Rack, which works well in small spaces.)
Washing most of your laundry in cold water can be another good way to trim your energy use -- though if you already own a high-efficiency washer, the energy savings will be modest.
Turn off the ice maker in your fridge
If your fridge has a built-in ice maker, you should know it causes your fridge to use 12 to 20 percent more energy, according to tests by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Ice cube trays do the same job using no extra energy.
Built-in ice makers can be finicky, and they're expensive to fix, too. Shirley Hood, an appliance specialist at Abt Electronics, said that ice-maker issues account for about 10 percent of the service calls the store makes on new refrigerators. The problem is usually related to a dispenser or water line that has frozen shut, but if the ice maker itself needs to be fixed, it will cost at least $ 240 for parts and labor.
If you're shopping for a fridge and a built-in ice maker is one of your must-have features, consider picking a model that has the ice maker and dispenser inside the freezer compartment. Refrigerators with dispensers in the fresh-food, refrigerator-side compartment are more prone to problems, Hood said, because they're fighting an uphill battle against warmer temperatures.

Texto completo: On Fox, a bizarre competition series returns, and Jennifer Lopez and Shakira perform in the halftime show.
What's on TV
THE MASKED SINGER 10:30 p.m. on Fox. You may ask yourself two questions while watching this vocal competition: Who's behind the mask, and how can they breathe in that thing? The series, back for Season 3, has celebrities compete against one another by belting out pop songs while decked out in elaborate disguises. The contestants' identities are only revealed after they are voted off the show. (Previous singers include a shimmering butterfly and a fox in a top hat.) Nick Cannon returns as host, joined by the panelists Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger and Robin Thicke.
GREAT PERFORMANCES AT THE MET: MADAMA BUTTERFLY 12 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The film director Anthony Minghella revives this timeless opera by Puccini. The soprano Hui He plays the title role, a geisha waiting for her American husband (Bruce Sledge) to return to Japan in the early 20th century. Pier Giorgio Morandi conducts.
SUPER BOWL LIV 6:30 p.m. on Fox. The San Francisco 49ers go up against the Kansas City Chiefs in Miami. The 49ers were last seen at the Super Bowl in 2013, while this is the Chiefs' first time on football's biggest stage in 50 years. Jennifer Lopez and Shakira perform during the halftime show, while President Trump and the 2020 presidential candidate and former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg present dueling ads during the commercial breaks. Expect plenty of star power in the other spots, including Bryan Cranston channeling "The Shining" in an ad for Mountain Dew.
THE EE BRITISH ACADEMY FILM AWARDS 2020 9 p.m. on BBC America. This annual awards show, commonly known as the BAFTAS, is Britain's equivalent of the Oscars. Todd Phillips's comic book flick, "Joker," leads the contenders with 11 nominations. In the best film category, it's competing with "1917," from Sam Mendes; "The Irishman," from Martin Scorsese; "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," from Quentin Tarantino and "Parasite," from Bong Joon Ho. Graham Norton (of "The Graham Norton Show") hosts.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
PRECIOUS (2009) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Gabourey Sidibe will be back on the big screen this month in a new comedy, "Come As You Are." More than 10 years ago, she burst onto the scene with her breakout role in "Precious," a drama drawn from the novel "Push." Set in 1980s New York, the film follows Claireece "Precious" Jones, an illiterate teenager who has never had it easy. Her classmates bully her; her mother (Mo'Nique, in an Oscar-winning role) is physically and verbally abusive; and her father has impregnated her -- twice. But there is a glimmer of hope when Precious is transferred to an alternative school and meets a caring teacher (Paula Patton) and social worker (Mariah Carey). A.O. Scott named the film a Critic's Pick in his review for The New York Times and wrote that Sidibe is the glue that holds it together.

Texto completo: I Quit the Evangelical Church
I Grew Up In
For me, there was only ever one kind of church. It sat just off a single-lane highway, not far from the beaches of North Florida, and was wrapped in corrugated tin siding. Coming down that highway, one's arrival was confirmed by a row of flag poles holding international flags, tattered and generally ignored. They were meant to signal that this was a place with global aspirations.
This house of worship was a house of extremities, from the interior design (faux Venetian with a stuffed male lion in the foyer for flair) to the people (a bishop who wore Versace-patterned tops and, when really moved by the spirit, had an inclination to wave large battle swords onstage) to the message itself (people journeyed to our church to hear the voice of God).
We were quixotic and cliché. Down that highway back home, sitting around the television, we would grimace and go silent at portrayals of hypocritical Christians as seen in movies and shows -- sweaty buffoons preaching the prosperity gospel.
It was us versus them from early on. I was a somber child soldier in a culture war that had been raging long before my arrival. As best I can remember, I tried to play the part, making up the quasi-lingual annunciations of the holy spirit with some creative zest. I shouted when we were told to shout, strained to have tears, stifled my thoughts and silenced my mind to clear out some space for his voice.
We could quantify our extremes: 24-hour prayer groups, 30,000 person gatherings, big-dollar offerings, number of souls saved. My numbers were low. I am not someone who ever once saved another lost soul, at least not by any agreed-upon standard.
"Such effort!" I now think about our little modern tribe, afflicted by economic crisis, pestilence and Atlantic hurricanes (which we always tried to pray away toward some other tribe).
The other cliché about such extremes is the unnerving ease with which they tend to fall away. I can't remember when I quit the church. And the same could be said for my parents, my friends, even my three uncles who started it. We just fell away, each of us, like a fashion that faded after years.
Everyone had their reasons. Purity tests. Personal politics. The boom and bust of beach town economies. For some, the voice of god.
Now, over a decade after falling out, or quitting, whichever it is that happened, a few of us will rehash the church times. I'm still not used to the funny, faded tenses we use to recall these stories. Our shared nostalgia has all the qualities of nausea.
I once was found ... until I realized I was lost.
People will ask me what the whole thing was about, why I stopped.
My reason, the one I have perfected in my head, has just enough context for moments like these. It must have happened in the spring of 2003. The Iraq war was just underway, a glistening new front in our holy wars. I tell the part where one of my pastors, a tall blonde woman who wore pantsuits and spoke with utter authority, announced during a service that our God would uncover Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. We were the kind of church that did these things on Sunday afternoons, you see.
Our God would do it quickly too, she added -- in seven days or less.
Looking at pictures of the church now on Facebook, I see what's changed. Faux Venetian has become hotel lobby rustic. (The lion remains.) There's a Patton-sized American flag behind the stage now. Combing through pictures online in the hopes of seeing just a few familiar faces, I mostly notice how empty the rows are now. Nathan Taylor Pemberton is a writer and editor from Florida.

Texto completo: I Quit Yale
My first time quitting something academic was during my first year at Cornell. I was a textiles and apparel major, and I quit that after my first semester. It felt right. Fashion wasn't for me, and the English major suited me much better. I loved fiction, I loved school and I was good at it.
In my senior year, I briefly toyed with the idea of going to law school ... but I quit that, too. In fact, I walked right out of the L.S.A.T. after the first section of the test. As the other students continued taking the test for hours, I wandered around campus wondering how it was that I wasn't in there with them. This felt so unlike me.
But it was the right decision. After, I excelled at my studies. I racked up all the honors and awards you could as an undergraduate English major and thought, "Well, maybe this is a career path."
That's how I landed at a graduate program at Yale. For the first two years, I loved it. I loved the people, who were inconceivably smart and cared about books in a way not many of my other friends did. I loved the students I taught. And best of all, I loved that I didn't have to go into debt. My tuition was subsidized; I had a small stipend and didn't need much. My parents, Russian immigrants who graciously embraced my career path, were able to help me financially in small ways -- a car, my books.
And James Franco was in my program. He smelled nice and only attended every other class.
The academic profession is so closely tied in with your sense of your moral self. It's not just a career, but a comment on who you are as a human being. Helping young people to think critically and love literature is noble; trading stocks is not. Everyone who studies humanities in graduate school is there because it feels like a calling. For me, this zeal made it hard to have the kind of healthy distance I think you need from your work.
Sometimes, when the thing you love becomes the thing you do as your job, it can become the thing you hate. My field was postwar American fiction, which meant it was my job to read novels. But then reading novels became so fraught and professionalized that I didn't have that as an outlet anymore.
I took my oral exams after my first two years and did great, but as soon as I started working on my dissertation, I felt incredibly stuck in a way that I had never felt in my academic career.
It was a really strange feeling to not have a clear path forward. I kept thinking, if James Franco can do this, surely I can as well.
Before you write your dissertation, you write a prospectus, which is like a proposal for the dissertation. We were supposed to turn ours in during the first semester of our third year, and I just never got it together. At some point, my adviser said, "It's unexpected that Anna can't pull this together, and it's not what I know of her."
My adviser gave me an additional semester to work on it. I let it drag on and continued to work on it over the summer. At this point, my friends had already started on their first chapters of their dissertations and mine was just not going anywhere.
I spent that summer opening the Word document that held my prospectus, staring at it, and closing it again. I also used the summer to think about whether I wanted to continue on. I asked myself, is it worth finishing a program that I didn't feel confident about, or should I cut my losses and try something different?
You've read the headline, so you know where this story is going. I should pause here to tell you that there's no one reason I quit the program, but if I had to pinpoint one thing it would be the overwhelming suffocation of procrastination.
I kept delaying my decision because actually saying the words "I'm going to quit this program" was just too difficult. I was living in Brooklyn when I had a phone call with my adviser about leaving the program. She encouraged me to just do it, and I kept walking around a single block crying. You don't know what to do with your body in moments like that, but I had to do something, so I was just pacing.
Yet I still couldn't bring myself to fully quit. After my third year in the program, I took a leave of absence. I was even signed up to teach a course in the fall that I had written a syllabus for, but it was so obvious that I was never going back, even if I wasn't ready to admit it. Every time I drove past New Haven, my heart would start racing. Just the thought of New Haven would give me severe anxiety, which is a shame because they have great pizza.
During that time, I was working a job copy editing romance novels for an e-book distributor. Then, a friend of mine started at Digg and needed help, so I started working there. Getting that job helped me fully quit. I could finally see how I could have a career that I loved but that didn't define me. I could read novels again as an escape.
I had extended my leave of absence for an entire year, until I received an email from an administrator asking me to withdraw if I didn't intend to return.
I started to think about what I wanted my life to look like. I was 22 when I started graduate school and had an idealized image of what being a professor would be like. A small college town, a life of the mind. Now that I was a little older, I realized that what I wanted was something completely different.
I wanted to live in New York. I wanted a job that I could detach from on the weekends. So much of academia is sitting in a room alone, writing and not collaborating, and it took me 25 years to realize that I don't work well that way.
So, after two semesters and one summer spent on leave, I told my adviser I didn't intend to return. I had quit the program, but I had also quit being indecisive.
It was an incredible relief. I threw out all the paper copies of my prospectus. I stopped carrying around a pen to annotate my books.
Quitting graduate school was the hardest thing I've ever done -- and I've given birth without an epidural.

Texto completo: I Quit Sex for 12 Years
I was 27. I had had a boyfriend for five years. I always had done what I thought everybody expected from me. Suddenly, very frankly one day, I asked myself if I was really happy with this idea of pleasure. Was it disappointing or not?
I answered that it was very boring for me. It was difficult to admit this. If you admit your sex life is boring, maybe it means you are not sensual, maybe it means you have a problem. Especially in France, where we are supposed to be so erotic. We are supposed to love food and sex.
I didn't keep it secret. I said to my boyfriend that I wanted to be alone. All my friends asked me, "Are you in love with another man?" I said to everyone, "I want my body to get some rest. I want my body to understand what my body really wants. Maybe my body wants some caresses but nothing more."
I had the intuition that pleasure could be something very important. What I expected from sex was to trust someone so much that I could be fully there, my soul and my body. Sometimes, physically, I was there, but my mind was in exile. Sometimes, my soul was there, but very far from my body.
I had the courage to say, "That's enough."

The first days and weeks after my decision, I was so happy. I was happy because instantly I realized I was not wrong. I noticed that I started to desire. But it was not desire for a man; it was a desire for everything. I went to Greece. I went swimming. I was taking pleasure in the water on my skin. Taking a bath, laughing with friends -- my body was open to every pleasure.
When you are not focused on the boring sex you had, you are no longer blind; you see very deeply into another person. The other aspect is you feel very shy with people because everybody is making love, and if you're not making love you say to yourself, "Have I the right to talk about life?"
Everyone worried about me. My attitude was like a mirror that I put in front of them. Maybe everyone was wondering if their own sex lives weren't that good.
When my book was published in France, I was invited on a big radio show. The journalist talked to me as if I were a curiosity. Then there was an advertising break. The host said to me, "There are a lot of people calling in to say they're in similar situations."
Not having sex does not mean you are someone who is very sad or very boring. It means that you are free. Because if you want your body to make love, you can make love. It's not a prison.
Sexuality defines a huge part of us. It's something very natural. But we went too far with this idea. We let sex be the kingdom. We made it the most important thing in life. I don't think it's the most important thing in life. For me, the most important thing in life is love, poetry.
For me, the body is not a machine. It was a long process to realize this. Because when I was young my body was a machine.
My time of no sex ended because suddenly, in front of a guy, I was very honest. Instead of pretending, instead of protecting myself, I just said that I didn't know if I was able to make love again. Maybe I forgot everything. This honesty opened the honesty of the guy in front of me.
I'm now 57. I sometimes have moments in my life without any sexual activity, but it's not a problem. What I know now is if you can share with someone something that's very true, even if it doesn't last a long time, it's a miracle in itself.
Sophie Fontanel is a writer and a fashion columnist in Paris and the former editor in chief of Elle France. "The Art of Sleeping Alone," her memoir about giving up sex, was published in 2013. This interview has been edited.

Texto completo: American embassies appeared to sympathize with an Iranian woman who feared returning to Iran after an image of her looking like she was not wearing a hijab circulated online.
The Iranian chess official said she began seeing the messages of support from American government officials soon after she said she was afraid of returning to her country.
An image of the official, Shohreh Bayat, appearing not to wear a hijab at a world chess tournament in China had circulated online and in Iranian media and she quickly went public with her fears that she would be arrested if she returned to Iran. It is against Iranian law for a woman to appear in public without a head scarf.
"No wonder Shohreh Bayat is afraid of returning to #Iran," the United States Embassy in Lisbon said on Twitter on Jan. 24, about a week after her story began appearing in news outlets around the world. "Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women risk harsh prison sentences for violating the mandatory hijab law."
Similar messages on the Twitter accounts of American embassies in Armenia and Madrid and the United States Consulate in Barcelona appeared around the same time.
Ms. Bayat, 32, a high-level chess referee, said on Friday she was grateful but also confused.
"It does seem a little ironic to outwardly support individual Iranians while simultaneously barring their entry to the country," she said in an email.
Iran is one of five Muslim-majority countries that face restrictions under a policy enacted in 2017 by the Trump administration, which argued that those countries needed to satisfy security requirements for travel into the United States.
The administration has said the countries, which also include Yemen, Syria, Libya and Somalia, had failed to thoroughly assess the security threat of citizens traveling into the United States.
On Friday, the administration added six countries to the list of nations facing stringent travel restrictions, including Myanmar, where the Muslim minority is fleeing genocide.
Aaron Testa, a spokesman for the State Department, declined to say whether the tweets about Ms. Bayat signaled a change in how the administration viewed cases like hers and other Iranians who could be considered dissidents in their country.
"We cannot speculate on whether someone may or may not be eligible for a visa," Mr. Testa said. "Whenever an individual applies for a U.S. visa, a consular officer reviews the facts of the case and determines whether the applicant is eligible for that visa based on U.S. law."
Ms. Bayat was in Shanghai on Jan. 8 presiding over a chess match during the Women's World Chess Championship, which began in China and concluded in Russia.
During a break, she turned on her phone and saw a picture of herself at the tournament circulating on Iranian media, which is heavily monitored by the government. The picture appeared to show her without the hijab, and Ms. Bayat said Iranian media were accusing her of flouting Iranian law.
Ms. Bayat said she was wearing the scarf but it had slipped to the back of her head and the angle of the photograph made it appear as if her entire head was uncovered.
"At first, I was deeply shocked and panicked," she said. "If I could be condemned on Iranian media, with false motives ascribed to me, on the basis of a deceptive photo, without anyone from Iran having even contacted me, then the stark implications of returning home were clear."
She decided that day to stop wearing the hijab, which she said she never wore willingly. Ms. Bayat said she was soon getting supportive messages from around the world, including the American embassies.
Ms. Bayat asked to be interviewed by The New York Times by email because she wanted to answer questions carefully and "make sure my answers won't cause a problem for me or my family."
The tweets from the embassies also linked to an article about Ms. Bayat on ShareAmerica, a website run by the State Department that describes itself as "a platform for communicating American foreign policy worldwide."
The article described how "Iranian women continue to strive for equality" and noted the case of Kimia Alizadeh, an Olympic bronze medal winner who recently announced she was defecting from Iran.
The tweets underscore the hypocrisy of the Trump administration "when it comes to Iran," said Mariko Hirose, litigation director of the International Refugee Assistance Project in New York.
She noted how the Trump administration verbally supported Iranian Christians, who face discrimination and persecution in Iran, but declined to allow many of them entry into the United States.
"Now, while the American embassies express support for a woman fearing return to Iran, the president has doubled down on a ban that has for three years blocked Iranian families from reuniting with their loved ones in the United States," Ms. Hirose said.
Ms. Bayat is in London where she is trying to sort out her options. She declined to say whether she is seeking asylum.
But she said she would not ask for permission to come to the United States, primarily because she is ineligible under the current restrictions.
"I had a U.K. visa so I came to the U.K., which is a lovely country," Ms. Bayat said.
She added that most chess events held by the International Chess Federation are in Europe.
She remains in contact with her husband and parents in Iran.
"For some time they were so emotional that it was even difficult for them to talk to me, but now they are recovering," Ms. Bayat said. "It is extremely difficult to be far from my family, but I am doing my best to stay strong."

Sanders on Opposing War, Crossing the Aisle and Medicare for All

Texto completo: The Vermont senator has made exaggerated claims or statements that lacked context about "Medicare for all," his antiwar record and his history of bipartisanship.
Before the first votes are cast in the Democratic presidential contest, The New York Times reviewed statements Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has made promoting his signature "Medicare for all" proposal, highlighting his long-held opposition to military intervention and arguing that he can work across the aisle. Here's a fact-check.
Mr. Sanders omitted context in claiming broad Democratic support for Medicare for all and its costs.
Judy Woodruff, PBS anchor: "Senator, a couple of questions on domestic policy. There are polls now that show most voters would prefer to build on Obamacare, rather than go to a single-payer system, which is what you advocate."
Mr. Sanders: "Well, depending on the poll that you look at. The vast majority of people in the Democratic primaries absolutely support a Medicare for all, single-payer system"
-- in an interview with PBS in January
This is exaggerated. Mr. Sanders is correct that surveys show that a majority of Democratic voters support Medicare for all, but Ms. Woodruff is correct that other options to improve the health care system have polled better.
Given a choice between four positions on health care -- a public option, a single-payer system, reforms without a public option, or only minor changes to the current system -- 58 percent of Democratic voters sided with the public option while 25 percent chose single-payer, in a December poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times.
In other polls in which voters did not need to choose between proposals, Medicare for all garnered more support, but still trailed a public option. A November poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 77 percent of Democrats either somewhat or strongly favored a single-payer system, while 88 percent felt that way about a public option. That same month, a poll from Quinnipiac University found 58 percent of Democrats viewed Medicare for all as a "good idea" compared to 73 percent for a public option.
A September poll from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed 63 percent of Democratic primary voters support Medicare for all and 78 percent support a public option.
Similarly, 64 percent of Democrats agreed that Medicare for all is a "good idea," according to a poll in July from NPR, PBS NewsHour, and Marist College. The same poll found 90 percent felt that way about a system the pollsters described as "Medicare for all that want it."
Norah O'Donnell, anchor for CBS News: "You don't know how much your plan costs?"
Mr. Sanders: "You don't know. Nobody knows. This is impossible to predict."
Ms. O'Donnell: "You're going to propose a plan to the American people, and you're not going to tell them how much it costs?"
Mr. Sanders: "Of course, I will. Do you know exactly what health care costs will be, one minute, in the next ten years if we do nothing? It will be a lot more expensive than a Medicare for all single-payer system."
-- in an interview with CBS in January
This is disputed. Mr. Sanders has a point that a large degree of uncertainty exists in projecting how much a Medicare-for-all system would cost, though he has also been comfortable offering his own estimates in the past. And his claim that a single-payer health care system would be less expensive than the status quo is disputed by some health economists.
Mr. Sanders said in July that Medicare for all would cost "somewhere between" $ 30 trillion and $ 40 trillion over a ten-year period. That is in line with estimates from several major studies: $ 34 trillion over a decade, according to the liberal Urban Institute; $ 32.6 trillion, according to the conservative Mercatus Center; and $ 24.7 trillion, according Kenneth E. Thorpe, a health policy economist at Emory University. (Lower estimates include $ 13.5 trillion from a study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and $ 9.6 trillion from Gerald Friedman, a health economist at the same university who did not contribute to that study.)
These estimates vary so widely because many key details of Medicare for all remain unsettled, including how doctors and hospitals would be compensated and how prescription drug prices and administrative fees would change. Other effects, like whether a single-payer system would lead to people using more health care services, are difficult to predict precisely. These myriad factors are why the Congressional Budget Office previously declined to estimate the cost of Medicare for all.
Just as it is difficult to put a price tag on a single-payer system, it is similarly difficult to say with certainty that it will cost less than the current health care system, despite Mr. Sanders' assertion that it will. Some analyses back his argument while others contradict it.
The Urban Institute found that total health spending would reach $ 52 trillion from 2020 to 2029 under existing law compared to $ 59 trillion under Medicare for all. The RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan research group, estimated the current system costing $ 3.8 trillion in 2019 versus $ 3.9 trillion if a single-payer system had been in place.
On the flip side, the University of Massachusetts Amherst study projected that national health expenditures would be $ 5.1 trillion lower over a 10-year-period under Medicare for all. Mr. Friedman estimated savings of $ 5.5 trillion to $ 12.5 trillion during that period.
Mr. Sanders exaggerated elements of his antiwar record.
"You're looking at somebody who has voted against all of Trump's budgets, military budgets, and voted against them previously as well. Thinks it's not a great idea we're spending more than the next ten nations combined. You're looking at somebody who in one of his very first votes -- I was elected to Congress in 1990, went to the House and I voted against the first gulf war. That's ancient history now. Remember the first gulf war? Saddam Hussein. And believe me that was not a popular vote."
-- in an interview with The Keene Sentinel in December
"You're looking at somebody who led the opposition to the war in Iraq, gulf war."
-- in an interview with The Des Moines Register in December
This is exaggerated. Each of the claims Mr. Sanders offered as examples of his antiwar bona fides is slightly overstated.
He did vote against military spending legislation for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, but he missed the vote for the 2020 bill in December while he campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination. Before President Trump took office, Mr. Sanders also largely voted against the defense budgets in his three decades in Congress, with exceptions in 2010, 2009, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002.
In 2018, the United States spent more on its military than the next eight countries combined -- not quite 10, as Mr. Sanders said -- according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Mr. Sanders' statements about his opposition to wars in the Middle East require more context. While he did vote against authorizing the first Persian Gulf war -- along with a third of House Democrats and nearly every single Senate Democrat, including Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- in 1991 and the war in Iraq in 2002, he supported some engagement in Iraq between the votes.
When the United States, along with France and Britain, bombed Iraq in 1993 after President Saddam Hussein violated United Nations resolutions by raiding Kuwait, Mr. Sanders said he supported those actions.
Mr. Sanders sided with President Bill Clinton in September 1996, when the United States again launched missile strikes at Iraqi military targets after Mr. Hussein sent troops into Kurdish territory. Mr. Hussein "must learn that military aggression will not be tolerated by the international community," Mr. Sanders said at the time.
A year later, when Iraq expelled American weapons inspectors, Mr. Sanders said that, though he hoped to avoid violence, "the bombing of selected military targets in Iraq certainly remains an option."
In October 1998, Mr. Sanders voted for the Iraq Liberation Act, a bill that "made the previously unstated policy of promoting regime change in Iraq official, declared policy," according to the Congressional Research Service. He voted again to reaffirm support for that policy in December of that year, though he spoke out against Mr. Clinton's ordering of airstrikes on Iraq that month.
Mr. Sanders made an overstated case for his ability to reach across the aisle.
Kathleen Kingsbury, deputy editorial page editor of The New York Times: "I was just going to ask, how do you respond to studies that show that you have one of the worst records in terms of bipartisan deal-making in the legislature right now?"
Mr. Sanders: "Really?"
Ms. Kingsbury: "Make the case for us that you're a deal maker."
Mr. Sanders: "Well, first of all, I'm not quite sure -- I have not seen that study. You may want to go back to my role in the House where year after year after year, guess which member of Congress got more amendments passed on the floor of the House than any other in a bipartisan way. So I don't accept that."
-- in an interview with The Times' editorial board, published on Jan. 13
This is exaggerated. Ms. Kingsbury was referring to an annual index of bipartisanship from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University that assesses how often a lawmaker's bill is joined by members of an opposing party and how often that lawmaker will join a bill introduced by the opposing party. By this measure, Mr. Sanders was the most partisan senator from 2017 to 2018, and the fourth most partisan out of 250 senators from 1993 to 2018. Since 2007, he has ranked as one of the top 10 most partisan senators every year but one, said Jamie Spitz of the Lugar Center.
Similarly, for the past five years, Mr. Sanders has ranked last or tied for last among senators for the number of bills he has introduced that included a co-sponsor of the opposing party, according to GovTrack, a website that tracks legislative actions.
Mr. Sanders pointed to his record on passing amendments, though that's generally "more as a measure of legislative success or position-taking than bipartisanship per se," said Laurel Harbridge-Yong, a professor at Northwestern University who researches partisan conflict in Congress.
As Vermont's at-large representative in the House from 1995 to 2007 -- when Republicans controlled the chamber -- he sponsored the greatest number of amendments that passed by roll-call votes at 17 and the second-greatest number of amendments overall at 49, behind only former Representative James A. Traficant, Democrat of Ohio. Mr. Sanders has a point that many of these amendments passed with or even because of sizable Republican support.
But he did not mention that this record has waned in recent years. Since he was elected to the Senate in 2007, a period that includes years when Republicans controlled the chamber, Mr. Sanders has sponsored 46 amendments that passed. Of the four that passed by roll-call votes, two had near unanimous support, indicating a lack of controversy rather than notable bipartisan support, while the other two had few Republicans on board, said Ms. Harbridge-Yong.
Those numbers place Mr. Sanders ahead of the three other Democratic candidates who currently serve in the Senate, but behind 10 other senators for amendments passed and 14 others for amendments passed by roll-call vote since 2007.

Texto completo: Sandeep Mathrani will take over the operator of shared office space, which was on the brink of financial collapse last year.
WeWork, the troubled operator of shared office space, has named Sandeep Mathrani, a senior executive at the commercial real estate company Brookfield Properties, as its new chief executive.
Mr. Mathrani, whose appointment was announced on Saturday, replaces Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, the co-chief executives. Mr. Minson and Mr. Gunningham took over in September from Adam Neumann, the WeWork co-founder whose growth-at-all-costs strategy brought the company to the brink of financial collapse last year.
In a statement, Mr. Mathrani said WeWork had "redefined how people and companies approach work with an innovative platform, exceptionally talented team and significant potential if we stick to our shared values and maintain our members-first focus."
The appointment of Mr. Mathrani, who is set to start on Feb. 18, would be an important part of WeWork's attempts to build a business that could sustain itself in the fast growing but highly competitive market for flexible office space. Mr. Mathrani has been chief executive of Brookfield's retail division since August 2018, according to his LinkedIn page.
The naming of an experienced real estate executive is a clear indication that WeWork is moving on from Mr. Neumann's strategy of building a sprawling company with lofty aims that included transforming how people work and live together. He had promoted WeWork as if it were a groundbreaking technology company set on upending its industry. The firm had also branched out well beyond office space, establishing sleek dormitories for working professionals and even a private school in Manhattan.
WeWork withdrew its much anticipated initial public offering in September. SoftBank, WeWork's largest outside shareholder, agreed in October to bail out the company. Marcelo Claure, a senior SoftBank executive, became WeWork's executive chairman and has been overseeing the company's overhaul, which involves pulling back from certain markets, selling off noncore businesses and finding new ways to finance its operations. Mr. Claure will continue as executive chairman.
Mr. Mathrani, who did not respond to a request for comment, faces some daunting challenges, not least the struggle to fill all the new locations that WeWork expects to open in 2020. The company has said that it could open 600 spaces this year, almost doubling the size of its network.
Commercial real estate executives said Mr. Mr. Mathrani probably had strong relationships with large landlords, which might prove useful as WeWork goes through its restructuring. In an interview in December with The New York Times, Mr. Claure said WeWork might seek to renegotiate leases with building owners at some locations. "We've been very straight with landlords and said, 'Look, this is its own independent business,' and if things don't work out, sure we'll have conversations with landlords," Mr. Claure said. "There will be some of that that's starting soon."
Commercial real estate executives also said that Mr. Mathrani's experience in retail could prove particularly valuable. In retail, the goal is to create locations that customers want to keep coming back to. WeWork would benefit if its customers stayed in locations for longer. A big weaknesses in the company's model is that it leases space from landlords for far longer than its customers rent space in WeWork locations.
WeWork leases office space, refurbishes it and then rents it out to individuals and companies. This type of real estate business has grown quickly because it allows customers to rent for shorter periods than would be available under traditional leases. Mr. Neumann had tried to give the business a special allure, saying it gave rise to a sense of community in the workplace that would drive creativity and bring meaning into people's lives.
SoftBank has agreed to plow over $ 6 billion of new money into WeWork, with the hope that the financing will give the company breathing room to build a sustainable business. WeWork needed the investment because it was spending far more money than it was taking in as it expanded rapidly.
In January, WeWork said it had sold its minority stake in the Wing, a collection of work and community spaces for women, to a group of new and existing investors in the Wing. It also announced that it had sold Teem, a company that builds software for sharing office space, to iOFFICE. WeWork did not disclose the financial terms of the deals.

Texto completo: The pop singer and songwriter shared what she watched, wore, listened to and read over 48 hours.
"For me, music is mind-altering," said the 32-year-old pop hell-raiser Kesha. "It can force me into a better mood, or it can force me into a more introspective mood when I don't want to go there."
She hopes her new album, "High Road," can do both, too. Out on Friday, it features a star-studded hodgepodge of cameos from Big Freedia, Sturgill Simpson and Brian Wilson (though not all on the same song). While working on her fourth album, Kesha said she often found herself blasting Queen ("on amazing speakers, to hear how the vocals and harmonies are mixed") and perking herself up with the infectious energy of Cardi B, Lizzo and Ariana Grande: "Anything that keeps me from descending into an existential crisis first thing in the morning."
She tracked her cultural intake for 48 hours in mid-January and called from Los Angeles to break it all down. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Wednesday Morning:
I was going to a photo shoot and on the way I was listening to "Nebraska," my favorite Bruce Springsteen record. I know an unusually large amount of people from New Jersey, and I remember once having a conversation about Bruce Springsteen with one of them. Of course, I liked Bruce Springsteen's hits and I respected him, and then someone was like, well, if you're ready to have your mind blown, then you need to listen to "Nebraska." And I did, and my whole perspective of him changed. I had a newfound love for him. Especially "Atlantic City" -- that's one of my favorite songs ever.
That record makes me nostalgic for some reason, the same way that [Bob Dylan's] "Nashville Skyline" does. I also had an interview that day, so I wanted to be in a genuine, soul-bearing kind of mood, and there are a couple of records that I put on to encourage honesty. Because when I listen to music that I really relate to, it can almost inspire me to be the most authentic version of myself.
Wednesday Afternoon:
At the shoot, I was really inspired by a lot of the designers I was wearing. There was an amazing Versace dress that reminded me of 1960s Palm Springs, and then there was a Delpozo pantsuit with this very powerful silhouette, and a Thierry Mugler vintage-future look that was almost like "Barbarella." I love fashion because I find it to be walking art. You put it on and it can inspire you to feel a certain way.
When I was leaving someone sent me this video of Nikki Tutorials, an amazing woman who does makeup on YouTube. I've been watching her stuff for years. In this video she came out as transgender. It was so brave and inspiring -- it gave me full-body chills and made me cry. I'm always out there saying, "Be yourself!" but anytime I see someone else truly being themselves and seeming so free, it inspires me to continue being that way and to practice what I preach.
Wednesday Night:
That night I went to the premiere of "Color Out of Space," the new Nicolas Cage movie. It's based on an H.P. Lovecraft short story. I loved it. I'm obsessed with anything that's about space. It's the final frontier of magic. And there were also some wonderful themes in the movie about how the beautiful things or the things you chase in life can kill you if you don't watch out. For me, that was a metaphor for fame. If you chase fame or money or success or power without ever checking in on yourself, it can lead to your demise. [Laughs] So that's what I took away from the movie!
I had also been wanting to meet Nicolas Cage. We've been friendly for a while, but that was the first time we actually got to meet. He's everything you imagine, and more. He's just wildly funny, incredibly charismatic, super kind and so talented. Sometimes I've had experiences where I've been like, "Do not meet your idols," but this was definitely the opposite of that. I've always wanted to meet certain people that come across as strange, unique, interesting individuals, and I was not disappointed.
On the way home I watched the most recent "Colbert." Especially now with the impeachment, I like to try to stay as informed as possible without being completely consumed. I try to check The New York Times website a couple times a day, and ["Colbert"] is a nice way to consume information that also adds some humor. If you can't laugh at things, you're [expletive].
Thursday Morning:
The next day I woke up and then went to work out. When I do Pilates I usually don't listen to music, but if I go on a bike ride or runs or even just a walk around the block I do listen to music, and I'm so into the new Selena Gomez record, ["Rare"]. It makes me happy. I love listening to women who have been through things but come out still fully badass. I can especially relate to people who have to go through things publicly and then get to put out music that reclaims their power, positivity and strength. And I very much feel like that's what I'm doing on my new record, so I have a lot of love for other women who do that.
Then I went to the photo shoot [for this piece] at an interactive art space called Flutter. I just loved it. There was one room that was completely covered in blue fake fur. Every single thing: The floor, the walls, there as a toilet, a bathtub, all covered in this fur. It reminded me of some kind of weird Dario Argento movie. Very trippy.
And then another one of the rooms was covered in depictions of women. Different takes on what a woman feels like she is or looks like, her essence. I really liked that, because I saw myself in some of them. The artist, Katie Stout, had made a statue of this tigress with wings and golden eyes. I related very much to that, because that's what I feel like I am. I don't feel like the quintessential woman, I feel more like some sort of mystical tiger being. [Laughs]
Also at the photo shoot, there was this Helmut Newton book that I ended up buying called "Pages From the Glossies." I love to look at something like that before I do a photo shoot because it reminds me to try to be as cool-looking as possible.
Thursday Afternoon:
Then I went to the La Brea Tar Pits. I'm just obsessed with them -- they're naturally occurring tar pits that are in the middle of Los Angeles. They were a staple from my childhood and it gives me that nostalgic feeling of being a kid, because there are all these sabre-toothed tiger animatronic things in the museum, and I just am a sucker for anything like that. I love animatronic things. I'm like a 32-year-old 5-year-old.
Then I came home briefly to feed my cats. I'm rewatching "Twin Peaks" for like the fourth time, so I watched an episode of that while I was cleaning up my house. And then I just started "The Morning Show." I'm pretty A.D.D. so I'll watch one episode of something while I'm cleaning, and then one episode while I'm putting my clothes away. It seems like a really interesting and relevant show, and I also love all the actors and actresses in it.
Thursday Night:
I went with some friends to see my boyfriend D.J. I love listening to music on vinyl. It's how I grew up listening to music, and nostalgia is my favorite drug. I requested Hot Chocolate, "Every 1's a Winner" [starts singing]. I love that song. Also a song by Suicide. I heard a lot of different songs that night, but those were my requests.
And then I just came home and I was reading a little bit before I fell asleep. I'm rereading this Iggy Pop book called "Total Chaos." I'm obsessed with Iggy Pop. There are certain people that I just look to for everything, and he's definitely someone who shaped the music I make and my perspective on the world and life and performance. It's more like a coffee-table book, you can open it to any page and just read a little bit. And then I fall asleep with one of my favorite humans. I'm talking about Iggy Pop, not my boyfriend [laughs]. He wasn't home yet, so I had to find my other boyfriend.

Texto completo: The release of the highly anticipated survey was canceled after Pete Buttigieg's campaign raised concerns that he was not included in at least one phone call.
DES MOINES -- A highly anticipated poll of Iowa Democrats, set to be released two days before the presidential caucuses, was shelved on Saturday night because of concerns about irregularities in the methodology.
The apparent problem, raised by aides to Pete Buttigieg, prompted CNN to cancel an hourlong special organized to release the results of their survey, conducted with The Des Moines Register.
The results were held back after the Buttigieg campaign said that an Iowa supporter received a poll phone call from an operator working for the polling operation, but that the name of the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was not listed on the menu of options.
Lis Smith, a senior adviser to the Buttigieg campaign, said they shared the information with the media organizations, which conducted an internal investigation. "We applaud CNN and the Des Moines Register for their integrity," she wrote on Twitter.
The poll is conducted by telephone from a call center, where operators read from a prepared script of candidates' names to determine who a voter plans to support. One operator had apparently enlarged the font size on their computer screen, perhaps cutting off Mr. Buttigieg's name from the list of options, according to two people familiar with the incident who did not have permission to speak about it publicly.
After every phone call, the list of candidates' names is randomly reordered, so Mr. Buttigieg may not have been uniquely affected by the error, one of the people said. But the poll's overseers were unable to determine if the mistake was an isolated incident.
The survey, published by The Des Moines Register for 76 years, is considered the gold standard for polling in the notoriously hard-to-predict state and is carefully watched as an early indicator of strength in the caucuses.
David Chalian, CNN's political director, said on-air that CNN and The Register decided "out of an abundance of caution" not to release the poll after the network learned of a potential problem with the way the survey was conducted.
"It was brought to CNN's attention earlier this evening that somebody who was questioned for the survey raised an issue with how their interview was conducted," Mr. Chalian said. "We weren't able to determine exactly what happened during this person's interview and we don't know whether it was an isolated incident."
This supporter then relayed what had happened to Mr. Buttigieg's campaign, which contacted J. Ann Selzer, a respected Iowa-based pollster whose company conducts the poll, about it. But the Buttigieg aide, who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation, said the pollster offered little information about how many surveys the one-time Iowa front-runner was left off.
Carol Hunter, the executive editor of The Des Moines Register, said the newspaper could not confirm "with certainty" that the polling irregularities were limited to one respondent.
"It is imperative whenever an Iowa Poll is released that there is confidence that the data accurately reflects Iowans' opinions," she wrote, in a statement on the paper's website.
Iowans typically finalize their choice late in the campaign, often deciding in the days before the caucuses occur. The late-breaking nature of the state's political culture lends the poll outsized influence, with the power to fuel a last-minute surge in the state or can be an early dirge for candidates struggling.
Ms. Selzer called the cancellation "heart-wrenching."
"Because of the stellar reputation of the poll, and the wish to always be thought of that way, the heart-wrenching decision was made not to release the poll," she said in a statement on Saturday night. "The decision was made with the highest integrity in mind."
Recent surveys have shown a fluid race, with Senator Bernie Sanders gaining momentum as other leading candidates trail close behind.
The poll was scheduled to be released as the leading candidates were making the final push toward Monday's caucuses, the beginning of the nominating process to select the Democratic nominee. Candidates crisscrossed the state Saturday, several of them targeting Mr. Sanders, who was leading in the last Register poll several weeks ago and also recently topped a New York Times/Siena College poll last week.
Art Cullen, editor of The Storm Lake Times and a prominent figure in Iowa news media, said he did not envy the paper's decision to cancel a poll that is a national calling card for the publication. But he praised The Register's editors for making a tough decision in the name of journalistic integrity.
"I hope people understand that they're sticking up for accuracy and it enhances their position, and that people don't go nuts on Twitter and trash them," Mr. Cullen said. "They just don't need this, and Iowa doesn't need it."
At least one candidate immediately sought to exploit the uncertainty arising from the scrapped poll. Taking the stage in a Des Moines hotel ballroom, Andrew Yang told an audience dotted with black-and-white "Math" hats that the sudden cancellation had fueled all manner of rumors.
And then he shared one of them.
"They said they're not releasing it and we're like, 'What happened? What happened?"' Mr. Yang said, adding, "One of the rumors that we've gotten is we did really, really well in that poll."

Texto completo: Have rules limiting changes in historic districts become too restrictive and elitist, as one opinion writer suggested?
To the Editor:
Re "Historic Preservation Is Hurting Cities," by Binyamin Appelbaum (Editorial Observer, Jan. 27):
Historic preservationists around the country were dismayed that The Times would publish a broadside against preservation based on the complaints of one resident in one Washington historic district who was (initially) denied the right to place solar panels on his rooftop.
First, the suggestion that historic preservation interferes with the ability of communities to respond to the climate crisis is untrue. Historic preservation is one of the most successful strategies for urban sustainability that any city can employ. Reusing existing building stock conserves energy and avoids the high environmental costs of new construction.
And sustainability is but one benefit of historic preservation. A new report by PlaceEconomics elucidates 24 benefits of preservation, including jobs, environmental responsibility, affordable housing, economic stability and density -- not to mention preserving the uniqueness and livability of our neighborhoods.
Finally, the goal of preservation is not to "freeze" properties in time, but to manage change in a way that preserves community character. It is an effective way to ensure the sustainability, livability and economic vibrancy of changing cities, and it can and should be a movement as dynamic as the places it saves. Let's not obscure the many benefits of historic preservation by repeating common misconceptions.

To the Editor:
While I agree that we need to be sustainable and harness the power of the sun on as many buildings as we possibly can, even on historic ones, I take issue with the blanket statement "Historic preservation, in practice, is not about preserving history. It is about preserving the lifestyle of an affluent urban elite."
I am an archaeologist and a historic preservationist and have worked in many different facets of the field. There is absolutely no way in which historic preservation is only about preserving the lifestyles of the affluent; historic preservation is about learning how people lived, how they built, how they decorated and ate and socialized. There is as much value in learning about the common tradesman as there is the affluent.
That being said, I am not such a purist that I don't support the use of solar panels on private homes. I don't believe that they should be so visible that they take away from the general aesthetic of a historic district, but I have also seen ways in which they don't have to. It is unfortunate that Washington officials would be unwilling to budge for something so important for our collective future. On the other hand, people who can afford to live in historic districts generally do so because they like the aesthetic of living in a historic neighborhood.
For the sake of saving the planet, I say, Let them ruin it for the purists. But if you can afford it (and you probably can), camouflage is greatly appreciated.

To the Editor:
I live in a local historic district that operates much as Binyamin Appelbaum describes, with a historic district commission of architects and aesthetic purists obsessing over minutiae, brushing off the urgent need for affordable housing and mobilization against the climate crisis, and safeguarding a sterile, static version of the past.
It is a neighborhood that was spared from destruction by New Haven's infamous "urban renewal" bulldozers through the intervention of preservationists who understood the built environment as not just a collection of buildings but as a fragile ecosystem, and the mission of historic preservation as not just conserving architectural details but as stewarding the social and cultural fabric of intact traditional neighborhoods.
It is troubling to see historic preservation turn away from this humanistic ethos into a set of arcane bureaucratic procedures that appear to the layperson as reactionary, elitist and contrary to social solidarity. "Putting people first" is the preservation ethos that saved my neighborhood from annihilation and to which I will always subscribe.

To the Editor:
To say that historic preservation exacerbates global warming by obstructing change for the better is a reductionist stance for a field that has fought to revitalize and defend our nation's most treasured sites. If this position is to be taken seriously, then Binyamin Appelbaum must broaden his blame to encompass thousands of homeowners' associations that impose similar restrictions regardless of a building's pedigree.
The larger question at hand is who decides what is worthy of preservation in the first place? The preservation process democratizes this vital question. Framing historic preservation as a detrimental regime serving the needs of the affluent is irresponsible. A more apt description is that preservation acts as a forum for communities to engage and negotiate our shared cultural resources.
This rough and rowdy attempt to define preservation as an instrument of class conflict is as convenient as it is misguided. Are we honestly to believe that limits on renovation are causing the proliferation of tent cities? Could there be other factors aside from preservation at fault? If only my window choices had that much power.
Andre P. Jauregui

To the Editor:
Binyamin Appelbaum sets up a straw man in order to advance an attack on preservation that has been mounted in recent years by a number of developers and economists. His neighborhood in the Capitol Hill District has some of the toughest zoning regulations in the country and is not at all reflective of the rather weak or nonexistent protections in most of the country.
In centering his argument on solar panels, Mr. Appelbaum seeks to try tug at environmentalists' heartstrings, when, in fact, preservation has been shown to be far greener than new construction.
It is the very nature of the Capitol Hill District's historic character that has made it such a desirable and therefore expensive place to live. Indeed, those cities that preserve and maintain their historic character count among the most desirable places to live.
Here in upstate New York, Hudson and Troy have experienced a booming revival thanks to their beautiful architecture and human scale, while Albany, which for generations has been only too happy to demolish any building, no matter how important, remains far behind.
Maintaining the character of walkable neighborhoods that support local businesses has everything to do with preservation of a habitable planet, and those who do not care about the urban environment are much the same as those who do not care about the natural environment.
Peter Lacovara
Albany, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Of course, the requirements that landmarks preservation commissions impose on buildings in historic districts can seem nit-picky, but preserving the charming character is one of the things that keeps a neighborhood like mine, Greenwich Village, from turning into a generic Midtown. When tourists come here, they are looking for the quaint Village they've seen in movies or read about, which is fading away. We are currently in the midst of fighting to protect the historic buildings that provide affordable housing from being demolished so that hotels, office towers and luxury high-rises can rise in their stead.Apartments in many of these high-rises remain unsold or are owned by investors who don't live there.
As for environmental changes, like solar panels, there are ways to integrate them into historic buildings. I know of several instances in which New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission permitted structural changes to historic townhouses as long as they weren't visible from the street.
Nine years ago, our large co-op building had to replace our bronze window frames with aluminum ones to restore the look of our building when it was constructed in 1954, but at the same time we installed green roof plantings and a cogeneration system, and switched from heating oil to natural gas. Yes, you can preserve history and still have progress.

Texto completo: The groups supporting the president's re-election bid also made 150 payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, Federal Election Commission filings show.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee together spent more than $ 9 million on polling, digital ads and fees paid to Trump-owned properties in the last three months of 2019, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission released on Friday.
The filings detail how the Trump campaign, the Trump Victory committee, a third entity called the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and the national party committee spent their cash from October through the end of December. Together, they previously reported raising $ 154 million over those months, and closed the year with $ 195 million in cash on hand.
The Trump apparatus has raised an outsize sum, but it has faced questions about how, exactly, it is spending its reserves. Even though he is not funding his own bid this time around, Mr. Trump has repeatedly grilled his advisers about where and how they are spending money.
According to a New York Times analysis, the biggest expenditure in the final three months of the year was on digital advertising. From October to December, the campaign spent more than $ 6 million on digital ads. The T-MAGA committee spent another $ 3.2 million on digital ads.
The campaign also spent $ 525,000 on polling in that period. The Republican National Committee spent $ 2.2 million on polling.
The Trump campaign spent about $ 194,000 at Trump-owned properties. The filings show that the groups supporting Mr. Trump's re-election together made 150 separate payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, totaling nearly $ 600,000 for the three-month period, and $ 1.7 million for the year.
One of the biggest changes in the last quarter of 2019 was to the compensation of the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, whose company had been paid more than $ 16 million through the various Trump entities and the national committee last year, according to the filings. But in the past three months, his company made just over $ 200,000 from the four committees, a drastic scaling back that came after scrutiny of how much he was making, including questions raised by Mr. Trump himself.
Campaign officials have said the money paid to Mr. Parscale's company in the past was for employee salaries, and they have insisted that Mr. Parscale is not pocketing a percentage of either donations or the ad buys. They also noted the sharp reduction to the amount of money his company was bringing in.
"For as much transparency as possible, Brad Parscale has severely limited the pass-throughs going through his firm," Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said about the change. "As has always been the case, he is paid a salary by the campaign and takes no percentages."
Among the top candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised the most money in the fourth quarter of 2019 ( $ 34.4 million) and entered January with the most cash on hand ( $ 18.2 million).
Mr. Trump's spending demonstrates his advantage as an incumbent with no competitive primary race. The Trump campaign was vastly outspent by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is self-financing a campaign. Mr. Bloomberg spent an eye-popping $ 188 million of his own money in the fourth quarter.
The president also spent less in the last quarter then some of the top-tier Democratic candidates running more traditional races, who went on sprees as they tried to break out in a tight primary. Mr. Sanders, for example, spent $ 50 million last quarter. Over all, the Democratic candidates spent more than $ 500 million.

Texto completo: This from a company that says employees should "do the right thing."
To understand how some companies have lost their souls, consider what happened after U.S. Bank stiffed a customer before Christmas.
Marc Eugenio had deposited a $ 1,080 paycheck into his account at U.S. Bank. The bank put a hold on most of the sum, and he spent many hours in a branch office over two days, trying to get access to the money so he could buy presents for his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son.
On Christmas Eve, Eugenio found himself parked at a gas station in Clackamas, Ore., a Portland suburb, both his fuel gauge and his bank balance on empty. A bank employee had told him that money would soon show up in his account -- perhaps a ruse to get him out of the branch office. For hours Eugenio then tried his debit card at the gas pump, so he could buy a few gallons and get home to his wife and children.
"I was stranded," he told me. "I could have walked home, but it would have been five miles in the cold."
That's when Eugenio found an angel.
He telephoned the bank's toll-free number and spoke with Emily James, a senior officer at a call center in Portland. She spent an hour on the phone with Eugenio, trying to get some money released so he could at least get home. She soon realized that he had been misled, and that money wouldn't reach his account any time soon. Feeling badly for a customer stuck on Christmas Eve, James offered to drive over from her call center and personally hand him $ 20.
"No, no, no," Eugenio told her. He couldn't impose. But she suggested she could use her break, and she received permission from a supervisor to drive 20 minutes to Eugenio. She later recalled that when she arrived, she wished him Merry Christmas and handed him $ 20 of her own money.
"Twenty dollars wouldn't break me," she explained to me, "and it would enable him to get home to his family."
When U.S. Bank found out that it had such a generous employee, what did it do? It fired her.
"She broke the rules, putting herself and the bank at unnecessary risk," U.S. Bank said in a statement. The company bars call center workers from meeting customers, so it dismissed both her and the manager who had approved her trip. The manager, Abigail Gilbert, told me that James's account was essentially correct.
James had worked at the bank since 2017 and had received numerous commendations and awards that I examined, but the bank paid her no severance. She is single and used her last paycheck to buy sacks of food for her two dogs, Domino and Harley Quinn. She is now reduced to selling blood plasma, at $ 25 a visit.
"I won't let myself be homeless," she told me.
Eugenio is horrified at what happened. "I was lied to and treated like dirt" by the bank, Eugenio said, and he can't understand why the bank axed the one employee who was helpful. "I felt really bad," he told me. "How could she get fired?"
U.S. Bank's vision statement boasts: "Our employees are empowered to do the right thing." So I tried to ask the company's C.E.O., Andrew Cecere, why the bank fired an employee who, with permission, rescued a frustrated customer on Christmas Eve.
Cecere wouldn't return my calls. David Palombi, a bank spokesman, told me that an internal "investigation" had concluded that James misled her manager to get permission, that James could have found other ways to get money to Eugenio, that the $ 20 came from the manager (which Gilbert confirmed to me) and that James previously had disciplinary "issues." I found the bank's "investigation" a whitewash and its explanations to be incoherent, meanspirited and contradicted by a series of internal bank messages that I reviewed.
The bottom line is this: Cecere, who was paid $ 14.1 million in 2018, presides over a company that has smeared a much-decorated employee who helped a customer and as a result survives by selling blood plasma. I suggest Cecere apologize, reinstate James and promote her; he might also show contrition by selling his own blood plasma and donating the proceeds to a charity of James's choosing.
When young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to "socialism" than to "capitalism," it's because of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank.
I've often noted that companies have enormous capacity to help their communities. But too often they act like American tobacco companies, which killed more people than Stalin did, or pharma companies peddling opioids, or McKinsey & Company advising a business to "get more patients on higher doses of opioids," or Boeing mocking regulators. That's one reason to seek stronger private-sector labor unions: At least unions and corporations can then provide some check on each other.
One bit of reassurance: Some chief executives do seem more enlightened than Cecere. After The Oregonian wrote two excellent articles about James, other companies reached out to her, saying that she's the kind of caring person they want to attract.
"No job offers yet," she told me, "but there are a couple of possibilities I'm really excited by."
Update: On Saturday evening, after this article went online, I had a contrite phone call from Andrew Cecere, the C.E.O. of U.S. Bank. "This is not who we are," he said. He added that companies sometimes make mistakes, and that he accepted ownership of what went wrong. He also telephoned Emily James and expressed concern for her and for her supervisor, Abigail Gilbert. "I will fix this," he told me.
The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips . And here's our email: letters@nytimes.com .

Already Labyrinthine Path to an Iowa Caucus Winner Gets a Few More Twists

Texto completo: As if the caucusing wasn't confusing enough, officials will release raw vote totals that could allow candidates to spin the results.
DES MOINES -- Once upon a time, the winner of the Iowa caucuses was obvious to everyone.
For years, after the chaos ended at 1,600 precincts, the Iowa Democratic Party reported one set of results: the number of state delegates each candidate had secured. Whoever had the most was the winner.
The same is true this year. But there are new wrinkles that might confuse things a bit on Monday night.
Instead of the usual one result, the Democratic Party will report three sets of results: a projection of delegate totals (state delegate equivalents, often called S.D.E.s), the raw vote totals at the beginning of the caucuses (the first alignment), and the final totals after nonviable candidates, or those who did not receive 15 percent support at a precinct, have been eliminated and their supporters have chosen another candidate or decided to sit it out (the final alignment).
So what if one candidate wins the first alignment and another wins the most delegates? There is a lot of chatter about this at the bar at the Des Moines Marriott, which serves as the unofficial Iowa headquarters of the national press corps.
Again, officially, it's all about the delegates. The eventual nominee will be the candidate who wins 1,991 delegates -- a simple majority -- at the Democratic National Convention, and the state delegates determine the national delegates.
And while the Iowa Democratic Party has said its job is to report results, not to declare a winner, it is encouraging news outlets to use the state delegate numbers.
But in terms of influencing the presidential nomination race, the caucuses have never really been about delegates. Iowa has only 41 of them this year, an inconsequential number in the national game. What makes Iowa so important is the perception it creates of who is ahead, who is "viable," who has that most prized and nebulous of assets: momentum.
And with three sets of results now being publicly disclosed, candidates could spin the results, emphasizing whichever number makes them look strongest.
So how do some media outlets and campaigns plan to decide the winner of the Iowa caucuses? We did a quick survey, and the results suggest there is some disagreement among the candidates, at least -- and that caucus night could be a bit of a mess.
How the media will identify a winner
The Associated Press
The Associated Press has said that although it will report all three numbers, it will "declare a winner in Iowa based on the number of state delegates each candidate wins."
The Des Moines Register
Carol Hunter, the executive editor of The Des Moines Register, said the newspaper "plans to report out the first alignment, final alignment and state delegate equivalents, but will determine the winner by state delegate equivalents."
"That's the historical measure that has determined the winner," she added.
The New York Times
The Times, too, will base the winner of the Iowa caucuses on state delegate equivalents, though our results pages and coverage will report all three numbers.
CNN
CNN has said it will "project the winner of Iowa based on the candidate who receives the most state delegate equivalents."
Fox News
A spokeswoman for Fox News said the network would determine the winner of the caucuses based on who wins the most state delegate equivalents. But it will also look closely at how each candidate performs in the first and final alignments to understand and report on the dynamics shaping the caucuses, she said.
How party officials will handle the results
Democratic National Committee
David Bergstein, a D.N.C. spokesman, said: "The party doesn't declare a winner of the caucuses, it reports results. The only way to become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee is by winning a majority of national convention delegates, so we strongly encourage anyone who wants to understand who is winning the race for the nomination to pay attention to those results."
What the campaigns will highlight
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The Biden campaign said that both the tight four-way race in Iowa as well as the new numbers the Iowa Democratic Party plans to release will make this caucus night particularly unique. But the campaign also argued that in the end, the candidates will be fighting for delegates.
"There's a pretty clear sense that the state delegate equivalent is the metric that people will use to base their decision on who won and lost," Bill Russo, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
A spokesman for Mr. Sanders declined to comment on its strategy. But his campaign has long argued for increased transparency around first and final alignment results
"We're trying to win all three" tallies, Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders aide told reporters in the spin room in Iowa earlier this month.
But pressed on the issue, he said: "At the end of the day, I think that the first impression is probably the most accurate portrayal of who won the night."
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
The Warren campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
Mr. Buttigieg's campaign has said they will focus on how many delegates they win.
"The only thing that counts in Milwaukee is delegates," a campaign spokesman, Chris Meagher, said, referring to the Democratic National Convention in July. "We're playing to win. And this year more than any other, Democratic voters are looking for a nominee who knows how to win."
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
"The number that matters for the national delegate allocation is the state delegate equivalents, so that's the true metric of the Iowa caucuses, and we built a campaign to maximize our strength in those delegates," Norm Sterzenbach, who leads Ms. Klobuchar's caucus strategy, said at a Bloomberg News roundtable in Des Moines on Thursday.
But, he added, the campaign will highlight whatever numbers "show Amy's strength on caucus night."
The entrepreneur Andrew Yang
Mr. Yang is polling in the mid-single digits in Iowa and will need significantly more support to win delegates, because candidates need 15 percent support in a precinct to be eligible for any. Asked how they would assess the winner, Mr. Yang's campaign said only that it was "looking at a few different scenarios and outcomes" and expected "to have a good caucus night."
The hedge-fund executive Tom Steyer
Like Mr. Yang, Mr. Steyer appears unlikely to reach the 15 percent threshold he will need to be viable. His campaign argued that the state delegate equivalents could be misleading because of the wide variance in the size and demographics of each voting precinct.

Texto completo: Newly released emails show officials at NOAA told the agency's scientists it did "not approve or support" a controversial agency statement issued after the president falsely said that Alabama was at risk from Hurricane Dorian.
WASHINGTON -- Senior officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration privately disavowed an unsigned statement issued by the agency last year that rebuked its own weather forecasters for contradicting President Trump's false warnings that Hurricane Dorian would most likely hit Alabama, new documents show.
Emails obtained under public records laws show top leaders scrambling to do damage control in the days after Mr. Trump appeared in the Oval Office on Sept. 4 with an altered map of Hurricane Dorian's path, and forecasters in the Birmingham, Ala., office of the National Weather Service then contradicted him by assuring the public they were safe.
Multiple people familiar with the matter have said the White House pressured NOAA to "clarify" that forecast. On Sept. 6, the agency's communications office issued an unsigned statement suggesting that the president was right all along, and that Alabama forecasters had acted improperly by suggesting otherwise.
"The Birmingham National Weather Service's Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time," NOAA said in the statement.
The backlash from the government's own scientists was fast and furious, according to internal emails.
In response to one angry scientist, both Neil Jacobs, then the acting director of NOAA, and Tim Gallaudet, a retired Navy admiral who is assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere at NOAA, emailed responses privately walking back the statement.
Mr. Jacobs wrote that "the forecast office did the right thing to calm the nerves of citizens."
And Mr. Gallaudet, in the clearest indication yet that the statement rebuking National Weather Service scientists came from political overseers, assured the scientist that Mr. Jacobs's reply served as "a sincere acknowledgment of a news release we did not approve or support."
NOAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about that email.
Mr. Jacobs was copied on that email, as were other senior Trump administration political appointees like Stuart Levenbach, who at the time was chief of staff at NOAA. Both NOAA and the National Weather Service operate under the Commerce Department. Several people familiar with the matter told The New York Times that Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, ordered NOAA to rebut the forecasters' contradiction of Mr. Trump or face firings. Mr. Ross has denied that he threatened to fire anyone in connection with the incident.
In a separate email to a colleague, Mr. Gallaudet confided he was close to quitting.
"I'm having a hard time not departing the pattern right now," he wrote to John D. Murphy, the chief operating officer at the National Weather Service, using aviation lingo to describe his desire to leave.
"Hang in there, sir," Mr. Murphy replied and suggested the agency needed strong leadership to counteract the creeping political influence on science. "Is this battle to die for or better to stay and fight for what's right. It's latter for me ... we can do more in pattern."
The stress the White House moves placed on rank-and-file NOAA employees was evident in the reaction of Dennis Feltgen, a normally unflappable spokesman for the agency's National Hurricane Center. In response to an inquiry by the news media about the president's altered map, he wrote a one-word email to higher-ups: "HELP!!!"
The documents released Friday under the Freedom of Information Act offer the clearest picture to date of the turmoil brought about by Mr. Trump's initial remark and subsequent false statements about the path of Hurricane Dorian, as well as his decision to trot out a map in the Oval Office that appeared to have been altered with a black marker to suggest Alabama was in the potential path of the storm.
The emails show top NOAA officials knew full well that the map Mr. Trump presented had been altered, even as days later the agency issued an unsigned statement essentially chastising the Birmingham forecasters for having contradicted the president.
"The chart shown in the briefing is old and doctored to extend the cone to Alabama," Corey Pieper in NOAA's press office told colleagues on Sept. 4, as the agency received a barrage of requests from the news media to understand the source of Mr. Trump's comments.
"Are you sure it was doctored? Was Alabama never in the cone to that extent?" asked Susan Buchanan, another communications officer.
"Yes, that was doctored," Mr. Pieper replied.
Two days later, after Mr. Trump had continued to insist on Twitter that he was right about Alabama lying in Hurricane Dorian's path, NOAA issued its unsigned statement rebuking Birmingham forecasters. Staff hit back immediately.
"You are not going to believe this BULL," Maureen O'Leary, a longtime public affairs specialist at NOAA, wrote to a colleague. She followed up, relaying some of the most choice public comments she was finding including, "Should I call the White House for my weather forecasts from now on?", adding an expletive.
Others made their concerns about the situation known to those higher in the chain of command.
"This statement is deeply upsetting to NOAA employees that have worked the hurricane and not fully accurate based on the timeline in question," Alek Krautmann, who works with NOAA's satellite and information service office, told communications officials.
Craig McLean, NOAA's acting chief scientist who later filed a complaint with the agency alleging the unsigned statement violated its scientific-integrity policy, took his concerns straight to the top.
"What's next? Climate science is a hoax?" he asked in an email sent to Mr. Jacobs and other top political appointees at NOAA and the Commerce Department. "Flabbergasted to leave our forecasters hanging in the political wind." He signed off, "Embarrassed, Craig."
Mr. Jacobs, who has since been nominated to formally lead the agency, spent several days afterward trying to calm the waters.
Gary Shigenaka, a NOAA marine biologist, emailed Mr. Jacobs urging him to address "this crisis of moral leadership our agency is facing" and asking for reassurance that "we are not mere pawns in an absurd game" pitting science against politics.
"You have no idea how hard I'm fighting to keep politics out of science," Mr. Jacobs replied.

Texto completo: John Bolton could face legal challenges as he pushes ahead with a book describing conversations he claims to have had with President Trump while serving as his national security adviser, experts said, setting the conservative icon on a potential collision course with the administration he once served.
Bolton's book, 'The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,' is still scheduled to be released in March, even after the National Security Council warned his attorney last week that it will have to be revised because it contained 'significant amounts' of classified material. Bolton's lawyer has disputed that.
Amid the standoff, details about the contents of his manuscript are continuing to leak out, with the New York Times reporting Friday that Trump directed Bolton in May to call the Ukrainian president and urge him to meet with Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Trump denied Bolton's account. 'I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelensky,' the president said in a statement.
As Trump and his GOP allies have lambasted Bolton, the former national security adviser has sounded a defiant note. During a private appearance in Austin on Thursday, he defended officials who testified during the impeachment proceedings.
'The idea that somehow testifying to what you think is true is destructive to the system of government we have " I think, is very nearly the reverse " the exact reverse of the truth,' Bolton said, according to Austin's KXAN television station.
White House officials declined to comment Friday on whether Bolton has been asked to delete certain portions of his manuscript or whether the administration has been in touch with Bolton's team in recent days. A spokeswoman for Bolton declined to comment.
A representative of Simon and Schuster, which is scheduled to publish the manuscript, declined to comment.
A person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the dispute, said Bolton's team expects a lengthy fight over the issue but appears determined to see it through.
Legal experts and former government officials said the White House has several tools available to try to halt or delay publication of Bolton's book, including the pre-publication review process.
'If the administration simply doesn't want the manuscript to see the light of day, they could just drag it out far beyond the March publication date,' said Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speechwriter to then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
A book by Snodgrass was held up for five or six months by the Defense Department last year for a security review " and released only once he filed a suit alleging the department was blocking its publication.
Legal experts said the White House might also challenge Bolton's account as a violation of executive privilege or national security, subjecting him to possible legal challenges or even criminal prosecution if he proceeds.
'The president has ultimate authority for deciding what is classified and what is not classified, and Mr. Bolton has an uphill battle to convince the president that there's no classified information in there,' said John Ficklin, former senior director for records and access management at the NSC from 2014 to 2016.
Bolton's attorney, Charles Cooper, has said his client is confident there is no classified material in his manuscript. Nonetheless, a Jan. 23 White House letter to Cooper warned the manuscript contained a significant amount of classified material, including some considered top secret.
The letter, written by Ellen J. Knight, the National Security Council's senior director for records, access and information security management, said Bolton would be breaking his nondisclosure agreement if he published the book without revisions.
'The manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information,' she wrote.
Cooper had submitted the manuscript to the National Security Council for vetting on Dec. 30.
'Ambassador Bolton has carefully sought to avoid any discussion in the manuscript of . . . classified information, and we accordingly do not believe that prepublication review is required,' Cooper wrote to Knight. 'We are nonetheless submitting this manuscript out of an abundance of caution.'
In the past, the U.S. government has had mixed success in its attempts to block the publication of books by former officials. Many experts say the system for reviewing manuscripts for potential classified material is dated, opaque and in need of reform.
'The whole prepublication review system is a mess,' said Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School who previously served in the Defense Department.
'Each agency has its own set of rules. . . . There's a rationale behind the system, but it's badly managed, it's not well organized, it's not centralized, there are no clear rules, and it is very much open to abuse,' Hathaway said.
Nonetheless, she said, the government has a 'Damocles sword' hanging over Bolton, noting that 'they could sue him if he doesn't get the government's permission, and they could make him give up everything he earns on the book.'
The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that employees who evade pre-publication review can suffer financial repercussions. The case involved former CIA agent Frank Snepp, who described the CIA's role in Vietnam but failed to submit the publication for review. The decision effectively permitted the government to seize the profits.
Most writings by former government officials make it through the National Security Council review relatively smoothly. Smaller issues are often resolved via email or in sit-down meetings with the author, according to people familiar with the process.
But people who violate the procedures can face severe consequences. Courts have allowed the government to seize multimillion-dollar advances and royalties from authors who violated their nondisclosure agreements. The government could also bring charges under the Espionage Act, though that's rare.
In 2016, the Navy SEAL who wrote a best-selling book about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden had to pay the federal government at least $6.8 million to avoid prosecution for not getting pre-publication approval.

Texto completo: When Leonard Steinhorn hosted Thanksgiving at his Logan Circle apartment in November, a friend and fellow baby boomer surprised the 20-somethings in attendance with special gifts: T-shirts printed with the viral put-down 'OK boomer.' Generation Z's mocking dismissal of out-of-touch old people had ricocheted across the Internet earlier that month, and playing it up in front of Steinhorn doubled as a good-natured inside joke: The longtime American University communication professor, and author of the 2006 tome 'The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby Boom Legacy,' is perhaps the nation's biggest boomer booster.
Teens on TikTok may resent Americans born between 1946 and 1964 for failing to act on climate change and leaving behind economic inequality " Steinhorn acknowledges this 'unfinished business' " but he still believes that his age cohort is unfairly maligned. 'Boomers have been the villains ever since the 1980s,' the 63-year-old Steinhorn told me when I called him for an interview, 'in large part because boomers changed an America their elders didn't want to see changed.'
Starting in the 1960s, he explains, the generation ushered in a cultural revolution that brought about historic strides in racial justice, feminism and gay rights. Boomers 'turbocharged the environmental movement' with the first Earth Day in 1970 and replaced the conservative 'culture of conformity' " which had prevailed in the 1950s " with the liberal 'live and let live' norms of 'baby boomer individualism,' norms that have persisted and proliferated to the present. Steinhorn welcomes criticism from younger generations " 'We can take it,' he says gamely " but argues that 'millennials and Gen Z are living those social norms boomers made possible.'
'The Greater Generation' was a conscious retort to decades of boomer bashing. 'Hating boomers,' Steinhorn recalls, 'had become the last acceptable prejudice. When I was writing that book, everyone was blaming boomers for every ill that was going on in society.' NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, who famously lionized 'the Greatest Generation' that fought World War II, had written in Newsweek that boomers 'seem to have forgotten the example of their parents' who 'made extraordinary sacrifices and never whined or whimpered.' First deemed too selfish to have kids, then too involved in their kids' lives, overly relativistic in their morals, then moralizing in their political correctness, 'boomers have been a piñata for cultural critics,' Steinhorn says. He wanted to publish 'a corrective' to these narratives.
'The Greatest Generation deserves every bit of credit for protecting democracy when it was threatened; but Baby Boomers deserve even more credit for enriching democracy and fulfilling its promise,' he wrote in the book. 'Two generations stared at the same shortcomings, inequities, and hypocrisies of American life, but it was the Baby Boom generation that chose to tackle them, to hold this country to its grand ideals, to agitate for justice when it would have been easier to remain docile and silent.'
As a millennial raised by a pair of liberal boomers, I'm instinctively sympathetic to Steinhorn's case. I'm close to my parents, and I share their values, so it made sense when Steinhorn told me there's much less of a cultural 'generation gap' between boomers and younger cohorts than between boomers and their parents. 'Whereas boomers and the prior generation had a difference in kind,' he said, 'what you have now is a difference in degree.'
But then I think about my generation's frustration. Gallup polling shows that millennials and Gen Z are significantly more concerned about global warming than boomers. And exit polls showed that most boomers ended up voting for Donald Trump in 2016. (In December, The Washington Post published a striking photo of a 65-year-old New York diner owner's shrine to the president, complete with framed posters for the Beatles and the Who.) Indeed, as Steinhorn notes, 'Trump represented something very, very 1960s and very, very baby boomer, which is to stick a thumb in the eye of the establishment.'
Yet Steinhorn doesn't think this negates boomers' overall progressive legacy. Liberal boomer Hillary Clinton, he reminded me, won the popular vote. And the popular vote winner in 2000? A boomer named Al Gore, whose prescience on climate change earned him the nickname 'the Goracle.' At least some of the boomers are, well, OK.
Steinhorn thinks 'OK boomer' identifies the wrong villains in the matter of the warming planet and worsening economic prospects. 'It's not generational " it's political,' he told me. 'There's a political party in this country that prefers to put the interests of corporations over the interests of the environment.' The problem is caving to Wall Street, not bowing to boomers.
He isn't cranky about 'OK boomer,' though; he was as amused as anyone when his 23-year-old daughter sent him the October New York Times article announcing the meme. He knew his friend was bringing the T-shirts on Thanksgiving " including some for his children, who might wear them on an upcoming family vacation. If anything, all the eye-rolling at older generations conjures fond memories of the Mad magazines boomers read growing up " classic satires that spoofed their parents.
It's not the only cross-generational similarity he sees, either. The Times observed that 'OK boomer' is a retort to 'basically any person over 30 who says something condescending about young people' " and, as Steinhorn points out, that's a lot like the '60s youth mantra 'Don't trust anybody over 30.'
Boomers, Steinhorn thinks, are capable of taking all this criticism in stride. 'My sense is that boomers are going to be far more embracing of the implied mockery,' he says, 'because ultimately we do want our kids to make a better life for themselves and complete the unfinished business of our generation.' In other words, perhaps we aren't doomed to endless online generational warfare, and we can have peace in our timelines. As a couple of boomer icons told us many years ago, 'War is over, if you want it.'

Texto completo: Trump appears to suggest with tweets that the leader was killed
The United States conducted an airstrike against the leader of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, which is likely to have resulted in his death, according to people familiar with the matter.
The leader, Qassim al-Rimi, has been described as a possible heir to al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, according to terrorism experts. His death would deal a significant blow to the terrorist organization, eliminating one of its most prominent members.
Over the years, U.S. officials have said the Yemen branch was especially dangerous because of its ability to produce sophisticated bombs and its ambition to launch attacks against targets in the United States and Europe.
President Trump on Saturday appeared to confirm the United States had killed Rimi, retweeting an intelligence expert and a reporter who pointed to a targeted U.S. strike.
Officials familiar with the strike indicated it was carried out by the CIA and not the military. A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment.
The White House declined to confirm the operation or comment further.
The strike took place last weekend, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak for the record.
The U.S. government had been tracking Rimi for years and was particularly intent on targeting him since he took over leadership of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemen branch is known, the official said. 'He was extraordinarily adept at protecting himself, but . . . clearly opened himself up for a strike,' the official said.
'This was the biggest counterterrorism accomplishment' in terms of weakening al-Qaeda 'in quite a few years,' the official said.
Though Rimi had been focused more internally on Yemen lately, AQAP's franchise was external operations and targeting the United States, the official noted. AQAP had developed an expertise in aviation plots, creating explosives that could be smuggled onto cargo planes in printer cartridges, for instance.
The operation against Rimi follows several strikes on high-profile terrorists and militants, as well as the targeted killing of a senior Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani.
There, too, Trump confirmed the operation obliquely, tweeting an image of the American flag after the United States conducted a drone strike against Soleimani in Iraq.
Trump's Saturday morning retweets about Rimi included an analysis from Rita Katz, head of the independent SITE Intelligence Group. She wrote that the terrorist leader had almost certainly been 'killed in a U.S. drone strike' on Jan. 24.
The Yemen branch, 'although reduced in vitality in recent years, remains dangerous' and is becoming a rival to Houthi and Islamic State militants in the country, Katz had tweeted Friday.
Among Katz's tweets that Trump retweeted was a link to a New York Times article, which was the first to point to a U.S. hand in the killing. Trump also retweeted an article from Yahoo News on the subject.
AQAP has suffered significant losses as American airstrikes have targeted bombmakers and other key members, officials and experts have said.
Local news reports in Yemen said that a senior al-Qaeda leader had been killed in a U.S. drone strike in January in the Wadi Ubaidah district, in central Yemen, but they didn't identify him.
As of Saturday, al-Qaeda had not publicly confirmed Rimi's death.
The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to kill prominent terrorists and militants, and Trump has often been the one to confirm successful strikes.
In September, Trump publicly confirmed that a U.S. operation had killed Hamza bin Laden, the son of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. Experts have debated Hamza's importance in the terrorist organization, but his death was a sign that Trump intended to aggressively pursue prominent figures.
The following month, Trump confirmed that the United States had killed a notorious AQAP bombmaker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, two years earlier. Al-Asiri's death had been reported on in 2018. The president didn't explain the delay in his remarks.
'The United States will continue to hunt down terrorists like al-Asiri until they no longer pose a threat to our great nation,' Trump said in a statement at the time.
Later that month, Trump revealed the most high-profile terrorist strike of his tenure, announcing in an address from the White House that the United States had killed Islamic State commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in what Trump called a 'dangerous and daring' nighttime operation in Syria, involving U.S. helicopters and Special Operations troops.
The strike targeting the Yemen al-Qaeda chief is the second high-profile operation there in recent weeks.
On the day that Soleimani was struck, American forces also conducted an airstrike against Abdul Reza Shahlai, a financier and key commander in Iran's elite Quds Force who has been active in Yemen, according to four U.S. officials familiar with the matter, who said that the strike did not result in his death.

Texto completo: Frank Press, an eminent geophysicist and authority on earthquakes who became one of the guiding forces behind national scientific policy in the late Cold War era, serving as science adviser to President Jimmy Carter and then as chief of the National Academy of Sciences, died Jan.-29 at a retirement community in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 95.
His death was announced by the academy, which Dr. Press led over two terms from 1981 to 1993, the longest a president may serve. The cause was complications from a fall, said his daughter, Paula E. Press.
A son of Jewish immigrants from modern-day Belarus, Dr. Press grew up in what he described as a Brooklyn tenement and found an early introduction to his future profession in the pages of Popular Science and Popular Mechanics magazines.
He forged his careers in science and government during a period when the two fields intersected in consequential ways, as tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union at times seemed to take the world to the brink of nuclear war.
From his early 30s, his expertise in seismology " the study of earthquakes and vibrations of the earth " made him a sought-after authority when the two superpowers sought ways to police underground tests of nuclear weapons.
'There are few men who have known the pulse of the earth so intimately as Frank Press " its tremors, its free oscillations like those of a reverberating bell and all its other movements that tell about the planet's rigid, not-so-rigid and liquid interior,' a New York Times reporter wrote in a 1977 profile.
But he 'has spent enough time in Washington,' the profile continued, 'to know not only the forces that have shaped the earth, but also those that shape political and scientific decisions.'
Dr. Press was chair of the geology and geophysics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977 when the newly elected President Carter, reviewing a list of candidates for the job of White House science adviser, alighted on his name. Candidates traditionally came from the field of physics, but Carter had in mind another kind of scientist.
'I looked over the list, and your background is the one that interests me most,' Dr. Press recalled the president saying, according to an oral history he provided to the National Archives. 'I do have concerns about environment, about energy, about natural resources, arms control, relations with countries like the Soviet Union, and you've been involved in all of these things and that's why I selected you. Will you take the job?'
Dr. Press did, and also became chief of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Over the next four years, he sought to promote government funding of basic research, to effectively analyze the economic effects of federal science regulations, and to provide a solid scientific undergirding for federal energy policy. He also spearheaded student exchanges between the United States and communist China.
'It just doesn't make sense not to cooperate with the world's most populous nation,' Dr. Press, who also supported research cooperation with the Soviet Union, said in 1978 when the program was announced.
The exchanges came about after Dr. Press traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng, who led the economic modernization of communist China, was so excited by the prospect of sending students to the United States that Dr. Press called Carter at the White House at 3 a.m. to confirm the administration's interest.
'Mr. President, he has asked me if they could send five thousand, and he wants an answer directly from you,' Carter, who recorded the incident in his memoir 'Beyond the White House,' recalled Dr. Press asking.
'Tell him to make it fifty thousand,' replied Carter, who wrote that by the year 2000, 400,000 Chinese students had enrolled in American universities.
After Carter was defeated for reelection by Republican Ronald Reagan, Dr. Press briefly returned to MIT but soon was recalled to Washington as head of the National Academy of Sciences. The academy is a private, nonprofit group established by Congress. Members are elected on the basis of their research achievements and are tasked with providing the government with independent guidance on scientific matters.
When Dr. Press took over, he laid out an ambitious agenda.
'I was in the government, so I know how you have to think there,' he told the Times in 1981. 'You have to worry about your four years in office. … It's very rare you have the time in an important government office to think about what this country will be like 20 to 30 years from now. So there are certain things we should take on to help the government.'
Under his leadership, the academy produced a 1986 report warning of the potential toll of the HIV/AIDS crisis without greater containment and treatment.
He sought to promote science education in schools, where he argued against including creationism in science textbooks, and at universities, where he opposed funding through the often unmeritocratic lobbying process derided as 'pork-barrel' politics.
He drew attention to the shortage of engineers in the United States and vigorously supported international exchanges of research and scientists. International commercial competition, he urged, should not interfere with the greater good of scientific progress. Neither, he said, should the wrangling over precious federal research dollars among U.S. scientists, which he found to be 'bordering on the unseemly.'
'At a time when we should revel in dazzling progress in almost every field of science,' he said in 1988, 'this sniping and carping among scientists is disturbing and destructive.'
Frank Press was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 4, 1924. His father, who worked in the wholesale grocery trade and later in auctioneering, and his mother, a homemaker, immigrated to the United States from Minsk and spoke Yiddish in their home.
Years later, in an oral history with the American Institute of Physics, Dr. Press recalled the thrill of scavenging in junkyards for scrap materials for his mechanical experiments, as well as his grief when a New York librarian snatched away his library card because his hands were dirty.
He received a bachelor's degree in physics from the City College of New York in 1944 and a PhD in geophysics from Columbia University in 1949. At Columbia, he studied with Maurice Ewing, a noted earth scientist. Together they developed what became known as the Press-Ewing seismograph, a tool widely used to measure energy waves created by earthquakes.
Dr. Press ran the seismological laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, where his research was credited with expanding scientific understanding of the makeup of the interior of the earth, before joining MIT in 1965.
He served on science advisory boards during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations and as a consultant to agencies including NASA. During the Apollo missions, he was credited with helping to design the seismographic equipment taken to the moon.
Dr. Press's wife of 62 years, the former Billie Kallick, died in 2009. Survivors include two children, William H. Press of Austin and Paula E. Press of Chapel Hill; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
Dr. Press's honors included the Japan Prize in 1993, the Vannevar Bush Award from the National Science Board in 1994 and a National Medal of Science, also in 1994, honoring his 'contributions to the understanding of the deepest interior of the earth and the mitigation of natural disasters, and his service in academia, as a government official, and at the National Academy of Sciences.'
He used his knowledge of plate tectonics not only in the pursuit of preventing earthquakes " and perhaps even nuclear war " but also for the simple purpose of understanding the constitution of the earth. He was among the scientists who argued, correctly, that Antarctica was a continent and not a massive piece of ice. In his honor, a mountain on Antarctica is named Mount Press.

This impeachment charade will fade quickly

Texto completo: With the end in sight to what can only be called 'the impeachment pageant,' we can now expect a flood of 'What did we learn?' essays.
There are no 'lessons' here other than the abuse of power by members of a partisan majority in the House to raise profiles and profits for themselves. This chapter leaves a constitutional scar. This behavior is not what impeachment was intended for. President Trump's phone call did not include any offense, much less any impeachable one.
What we can expect to be remembered about this sorry episode is, sadly, 'fake history.'
And fake history, it should be noted, is about to have a big weekend. Amazon is running an ad in the Super Bowl Sunday to promote Alexa. In a very funny commercial featuring Ellen DeGeneres wondering aloud what life was like before Alexa, a series of made-up events in history are amusingly recalled to contrast life today with life before Alexa was around. (The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive and founder of Amazon.)
The last sequence " funny even to me, the president of the Nixon Foundation " shows a make-believe Richard M. Nixon in the Oval Office telling an assistant to 'remind me to delete those tapes.' (The assistant is shown balking at Nixon's 'request.')
Of course, Nixon never ordered the tapes deleted.
But it would not surprise me if, in the future, when someone asks Alexa, 'Alexa, what's an example of 'fake history'?' the device answers this way: 'A television commercial about Alexa in the 2020 Super Bowl is an example of 'fake history.' '
I raise this possibility as a reminder that our collective memory about an event often turns out very differently from the event itself. Trump is going to be acquitted, but what will the Super Bowl ads of 2070 say? Perhaps the writers of Sunday's Alexa ad genuinely thought Nixon ordered his tapes deleted, or perhaps they didn't care and wanted a laugh. The effect, though, will be to promote 'fake history.' And 'fake history' distorts collective memory.
An example: People today believe that at the time of his confirmation, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was guilty of the sexual harassment of Anita Hill. That is not what was believed at the time. A New York Times/CBS News poll taken Oct. 28, 1991, found the opposite: Fifty-eight percent of the respondents then believed Thomas's account; 29 percent believed Hill's.
We won't know for 50 years what the impeachment of Trump does to his place in history, and we won't know how today's impressions will change tomorrow's opinions.
My guess? Not much, given his outsize personality and growing list of achievements. These include (and you might want to take a seat here, Trump haters): rebuilding a U.S. military with a current budget of $716 billion (and a new service branch, the Space Force); the appointments of (so far) two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 133-district court judges; a massive tax cut; 3.5 percent unemployment; the country's exit from the Iran deal and the Paris climate accords; clarity on China as the nation's chief strategic competitor; a renewed Israeli alliance anchored in the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; the caliphate of the Islamic State destroyed, and 'most wanted' terrorists Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani eliminated; partial construction of the border wall and significant immigration reform through executive order; a massive regulatory rollback; the passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement; Obamacare's individual mandate repealed; and 'right to try' and justice reform legislation passed.
A partisan House's impeachment is a pebble thrown at the political battleship that is that list. His most significant failing may lie ahead in the slow-out-of-the-gate response to the Wuhan coronavirus, but it surely won't be his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump accomplished all of the above despite the burden of the Mueller investigation, which could not, despite massive investment and effort, prove any collusion whatsoever between Russia and the Trump campaign in Russia's attack on our 2016 election. That investigation was followed by this impeachment charade.
All that remains are ashes of the left's hopes and a scar on the Constitution. And perhaps a forced attention on the Beltway when all eyes ought to have been on Wuhan.

Texto completo: Some dream about moving onto a ship to see the world. Others do it.
Ralph Bias loves cruise ships " has since he was a child and watched the disaster movie 'The Poseidon Adventure.' The South Florida resident sells cruises, takes six to eight a year himself and plans to spend even more time at sea after retirement.
'We're not going to build a second home,' said Bias, who will keep Miami Beach as a base. 'We plan on just staying on board the ship. We will probably do about three to four months every year on one specific ship.'
Who better to spend long days at sea or leisurely nights at the buffet than retirees who don't have to be at work on Monday? According to the Cruise Lines International Association, a third of the 28.5 million people who took a cruise in 2018 were 60 or older. But what everyone may not know is that people can turn their retirement into a constant voyage.
There are no statistics from the industry trade group about people who live full-time on cruise ships; the figure appears to be the smallest fraction of the cruising public. But a handful of avid cruisers have made headlines for their seafaring ways.
There was Lee Wachtstetter, who wrote a memoir about living on cruise ships for 12 years after her husband died. Mario Salcedo earned the nickname 'The Happiest Guy in the World' from the New York Times for spending the bulk of two decades on ships " while still running a business. And 94-year-old Morton Jablin told Forbes in late 2018 that his life was 'very routine but comfortable' after living on a luxury ship for 13 years.
Most cruise operators contacted by The Washington Post said they did not have any current full-time residents. But one line stands apart because it was built for long-term cruisers: The World " Residences at Sea, which bills itself as 'the largest privately owned, residential yacht on earth' with 165 units and an average resident age of 66. Several other plans to create similar floating communities for full-time residences, including one by Crystal Cruises, have been axed or repeatedly delayed.
In a 2016 report, Wachtstetter said her average daily costs on the luxury Crystal Serenity were about $450. That's for a high-end, more inclusive trip. Budget-friendlier cruises cost much less " as little as $50 a day for a small windowless room, not including taxes, fees, gratuities and extras like soda or alcohol.
'It runs the gamut,' said Jennifer Crivelli, an assistant manager of product training at the Cruise Web, a travel agency that organizes extended retirement-at-sea trips. 'There's a cruise line that fits almost everybody's budget.'
A 2004 study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society compared cruise ships and assisted-living facilities as options for seniors, noting room size, facility amenities, medical care, the potential for visits and cost. The study estimated the cost of staying on a Royal Caribbean ship at the time to be about $33,260 a year, compared with the national average of $28,689 annually for an assisted-living facility.
'Cruise ship care is a legitimate alternative option for seniors unwilling to settle for traditional assisted living or [nursing home] care,' the study said. It added: 'If this option succeeds, seniors could have a much more enjoyable experience and, for a change, look forward to the time when they become less independent.'
Although cruise lines aren't exactly marketing themselves as alternatives to assisted living, many do offer extra-long sailings without repeating ports to appeal to those with plenty of time and money and an acute case of wanderlust. In other words, something that might appeal to retirees.
On the Viking Sun, 54 people are sailing on a full 245-day world cruise that visits 111 stops on six continents. Nearly 100 people are taking an entire 146-day voyage around the world on the Seabourn Sojourn.
Oceania Cruises introduced what it called a 'groundbreaking new concept' in 2016 called Snowbirds in Residence, offering a 'tropical ultimate vacation home' on two of its ships for 58 or 72 days. Prices started at $15,999 for the shorter trip and $19,999 for the longer one. Although the line no longer offers the specific program, executives still want to appeal to vacationers with the flexibility for lengthy getaways.
'For many of our regular repeat guests, they consider Oceania ships an untraditional vacation home,' James Rodriguez, executive vice president of sales and marketing, said in an email. 'The food is plentiful, fresh and accommodating of every diet, medical and wellness facilities are at the ready, and the freedom to travel safely around the entire world makes it incredibly attractive to retirees.'
Although Holland America Line doesn't solicit full-time residents, the operator encourages 'Collectors' Voyages,' or back-to-back cruises that have minimal repeating ports. Passengers who book those trips typically see a discount of 10 to 15 percent, depending on the itinerary, spokesman Erik Elvejord said.
He points out, however, that the ships are 'not really set up as a retirement community' with the same kind of medical facilities, banking options or other long-term amenities residents might need.
Financial planner Rick Kahler, 64, a South Dakota resident and frequent cruiser, has written about the possibility of cruise retirement. He cautioned that such a move would require 'careful research and consideration.'
'While it's not cheap, a person can probably spend $4,000 to $10,000 a month, and everything is included,' Kahler said. 'And there's so much support for older people on ships that it's an attractive option.'
Kahler said those who spend long stretches at sea should have health that is stable, but he thought the option could also be good for those who might have more challenges with other kinds of travel.
'If you do have some limited mobility and are older, I can see the advantage of getting on to the ship and unpacking once and the world comes to your door,' he said.
The Cruise Web started advertising its Senior Living at Sea program in 2018 and is working with clients who are interested in extended multi-month trips in the coming years. One client, Crivelli said, is planning to fill an eight-month gap between selling their house and building a new one in a senior living community with a long voyage.
'They are already budgeting for it and preparing for this type of retirement,' Cruise Web vice president Karolina Shenton said. Considerations include making sure passengers are in the same suite or stateroom week after week, have their dining arrangements set in advance and have the flexibility to take breaks to visit family " or bring them on board.
Dave Hughes, a retirement lifestyle expert and founder of the site Retire Fabulously, isn't convinced. Although he enjoys cruising, Hughes wrote in 2016 in U.S. News - World Report 12 reasons people shouldn't retire on a ship. He warned about the level and cost of medical care available on ships, the lack of long-term friendships, charges for Internet access and drinks and eventual boredom.
'When you go on this vacation, it's an escape,' he said in a recent interview. Nice meals, entertainment and amenities tend to offset the typically small room. 'All that is okay for a week or so, but once that becomes your new reality, there are a lot of drawbacks.'
But Lee Lindquist, chief of geriatrics at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and lead author of the study that compared cruises and assisted living, took to Twitter to highlight for whom the experience could be best-suited. She said candidates should have at least some mobility, be able to manage their own medications and should not be experiencing cognitive issues. Lindquist said many who sail long-term have physicians in a port they visit frequently who can do routine exams; those stops are perfect for picking up 90-day supplies of medication as well.
'You can always quit cruising, you can always choose to move back to where you used to live,' she said, urging people to try a long cruise before committing to an even longer one. 'It's overall a fun vacation, which you could actually make into a lifelong vacation.'

Texto completo: ON MONDAY, Iowans will participate in the first presidential nominating contest. The results could greatly influence the Democratic race. But Iowans won't vote like most Americans, who participate in primary elections. Instead, they will caucus. That means the results will be less fair and democratic than they should be.
Caucusing demands that voters arrive on a weekday evening in the cold of winter, wait in often long lines to enter caucus locations and spend perhaps hours with their neighbors deciding which candidates will get delegates. The arcane process involves allegiance-switching and deal-brokering among different camps. Followers of a candidate who does not get enough support in the early going can swing to others. Realignment requires caucus-goers to walk between areas of the high school gyms, college conference centers, churches and libraries where caucuses are held. That's tough if you cannot walk. Good luck even showing up if you're an employed single mother, a bedridden patient or a night-shift worker.
The caucus system's byzantine method for apportioning delegates means that the statewide 'winner' might not be the candidate who turns out the largest number of supporters " but the one who corrals enough supporters in the right proportions at the right places. A reform this cycle requires the parties to report tallies of total initial supporters as well as final counts, after caucus-goers have realigned. That could result in multiple candidates claiming victory Monday night.
Sensitive to the caucus system's manifest problems, particularly for working people and the disabled, Democrats are this year allowing 'satellite' caucuses in areas such as nursing homes and even in foreign countries " and at varying times " along with other accommodations for those with disabilities. But those who participate in satellite caucuses will have far less influence on the results than those who go to regular caucuses.
Moreover, the New York Times reports that other party efforts to open the caucus process to those who, say, cannot wait outside in the cold for long periods of time or who might need to lie down during the caucuses have not helped many. Accommodation options are poorly advertised and not guaranteed. The Times found Iowans who asked for help and have failed to get needed assurances, some left wondering if they will even be offered a chair.
There is a better way. It is the one most Americans are familiar with: voting. Let Iowans " and, for that matter, people in other states that cling to caucus systems, such as Nevada " show up to their polling place any time of the day. Let them vote early. Let them vote absentee. Iowa has not switched to primary elections like almost every other state because it wants to preserve its first-in-the-nation status in the presidential nominating season, and rival New Hampshire, which comes a week later, insists on holding the first primary. This is a poor reason to continue using a fundamentally flawed system guaranteed to exclude vulnerable people from the process.

U.S.-European Friction Over Wiring Is Latest Complication for 737 MAX Return; FAA chief Steve Dickson expected to decide whether to require fixes

Texto completo: Potentially hazardous wiring inside Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jets is the latest flashpoint between U.S. and European regulators and a further complication in the grounded fleet's return to service, according to people familiar with the details.
Technical experts at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency want certain electrical wires relocated to reduce what they say are dangers from potential short circuits, which in a worst-case scenario could disrupt flight-control systems, according to these people.
In addition to the Federal Aviation Administration's ongoing safety review of proposed fixes to the MAX, the European agency is independently vetting such changes.
But engineers at the Chicago plane maker and high-ranking FAA managers, including the agency's top safety official, contend moving the wiring isn't necessary, one of these people said. Boeing hasn't yet submitted its formal recommendation, though the issue is headed for a decision in the next few weeks by FAA head Steve Dickson.
The disagreement over whether to take action on the wiring, which hasn't been reported before, has prompted the FAA to hold off scheduling a key certification flight for the MAX. It also highlights the emergence of a series of new technical challenges and delays confronting the Chicago plane maker as it strives to get the MAX back in the air world-wide. The planes have been grounded since last March, following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
The planes are expected to gradually start resuming commercial flights sometime in the summer, with major U.S. carriers having removed them from schedules until June.
On Saturday, the FAA released a statement saying Boeing recently informed the agency "about concerns associated with the location of wiring in certain areas of the MAX." Since then, according to the statement, "the FAA has closely monitored the company's analysis and how the issue might affect the ongoing certification efforts." The wiring concerns were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Reiterating earlier statements, the FAA said the MAX will be approved to carry passengers again "only after our safety experts are fully satisfied that all safety-related issues are addressed."
A Boeing spokesman said the company is cooperating with international regulators on a thorough certification process, "and we are working to perform the appropriate analysis." He said, "It would be premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes."
A spokeswoman for EASA, which also hasn't submitted its final position to the FAA, declined to comment. The issues still could be resolved with a compromise, but Boeing's priority at this point, according to some of the people familiar with the details, is avoiding any wire modifications.
The wires, which help control movable panels on the tail and power other systems, may be too close to each other in a dozen locations from the rear of the aircraft to the main electronics compartment beneath the cabin and behind the cockpit, according to the people familiar with the issue.
A short circuit, or "arcing" of electrical current between wires, could cause control problems for pilots that the FAA characterizes as hazardous or in some cases even catastrophic, according one of the people briefed on the details.
EASA and FAA technical experts, along with some other FAA officials responsible for certifying aircraft designs, have taken the position that safety rules require wiring modifications in such instances, this person said.
The relevant international rules relate to safety enhancements put in place more than a decade ago after an in-flight fire caused a Swissair jet to plunge into the water near Nova Scotia in 1998, killing all on board.
The current concerns about potential wiring problems stem from Boeing's analysis of how short circuits could cause problems with some flight-control systems, and how quickly pilots could react to those emergencies .
Since the two fatal crashes, safety regulators have been reassessing certain MAX flight-control systems, changing software, adjusting related computers and modifying pilot training.
Last month, industry and government officials revealed the latest software glitch , a problem that prevents the jet's flight-control computers from powering up and verifying they are ready for flight, and said Boeing was working to resolve it.
Addressing the wiring issues would pose tough logistical and financial hurdles. How the agency mandates fixes may depend on who owns the aircraft, according to another person familiar with the details. The FAA may require Boeing to fix wiring on approximately 400 undelivered aircraft now in storage at airfields dotting the Puget Sound area, this person said.
For planes previously delivered to carriers, the agency would likely perform a risk analysis to determine whether the wiring should be repaired either before the planes fly again or during routinely scheduled maintenance, this person added.
Relocating the wiring bundles would take roughly two weeks per plane, according to industry and government experts. Such fixes could be performed at the same time as software and training updates, depending on available manpower, to try to minimize additional delays.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Senate narrowly rejected Democratic demands to summon witnesses for President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial late Friday, all but ensuring Trump’s acquittal in just the third trial to threaten a president’s removal in U.S. history. But senators pushed off final voting on his fate to next Wednesday.
The delay in timing showed the weight of a historic vote bearing down on senators, despite prodding by the president eager to have it all behind him in an election year and ahead of his State of the Union speech Tuesday night.
Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke by phone to lock in the schedule during a tense night at the Capitol as rushed negotiations proceeded on and off the Senate floor. The trial came to a standstill for about an hour. A person unauthorized to discuss the call was granted anonymity to describe it.
The president wanted to arrive for his speech at the Capitol with acquittal secured, but that will not happen. Instead, the trial will resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting is planned for 4 p.m. Wednesday, the day after Trump’s speech.
Trump’s acquittal is all but certain in the Senate, where his GOP allies hold the majority and there’s nowhere near the two-thirds needed for conviction and removal.
Nor will he face potentially damaging, open-Senate testimony from witnesses.
Despite the Democrats’ singular focus on hearing new testimony, the Republican majority brushed past those demands and will make this the first impeachment trial without witnesses. Even new revelations Friday from former national security adviser John Bolton did not sway GOP senators, who said they’d heard enough.
That means the eventual outcome for Trump will be an acquittal “in name only,” said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a House prosecutor, during final debate.
Trump was impeached by the House last month on charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress as he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid as leverage as the ally fought Russia. He is charged with then blocking the congressional probe of his actions.
Senators rejected the Democrats’ effort to allow new witnesses, 51-49, a near party-line vote. Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah voted with the Democrats, but that was not enough.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called that decision “a tragedy on a very large scale.” Protesters’ chants reverberated against the walls of the Capitol.
But Republicans said Trump’s acquittal was justified and inevitable.
“The sooner the better for the country,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant. “Let’s turn the page.”
The next steps come in the heart of presidential campaign season before a divided nation. Democratic caucus voting begins Monday in Iowa, and Trump gives his State of the Union address the next night. Four Democratic candidates have been chafing in the Senate chamber rather than campaigning.
The Democrats had badly wanted testimony from Bolton, whose forthcoming book links Trump directly to the charges. But Bolton won’t be summoned, and none of this appeared to affect the trial’s expected outcome. Democrats forced a series of new procedural votes late Friday to call Bolton and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others, but all were rejected.
In an unpublished manuscript, Bolton has written that the president asked him during an Oval Office meeting in early May to bolster his effort to get Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to a person who read the passage and told The Associated Press. The person, who was not authorized to disclose contents of the book, spoke only on condition of anonymity.
In the meeting, Bolton said the president asked him to call new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and persuade him to meet with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was planning to go to Ukraine to coax the Ukrainians to investigate the president’s political rivals. Bolton writes that he never made the call to Zelenskiy after the meeting, which included acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
The revelation adds more detail to allegations of when and how Trump first sought to influence Ukraine to aid investigations of his rivals that are central to the abuse of power charge in the first article of impeachment.
The story was first reported Friday by The New York Times.
Trump issued a quick denial.
“I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelenskiy,” Trump said. “That meeting never happened.”
Key Republican senators said even if Trump committed the offenses as charged by the House, they are not impeachable and the partisan proceedings must end.
“I didn’t need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing,” retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a late holdout, told reporters Friday at the Capitol. “But that didn’t rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she, too, would oppose more testimony in the charged partisan atmosphere, having “come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.’’ She said, “The Congress has failed.”
Eager for a conclusion, Trump’s allies nevertheless suggested the shift in timing to extend the proceedings into next week, acknowledging the significance of the moment for senators who want to give final speeches.
To bring the trial toward a conclusion, Trump’s attorneys argued the House had already heard from 17 witnesses and presented its 28,578-page report to the Senate. They warned against prolonging it even further. The House impeached Trump largely along party lines after less than three months of formal proceedings, making it the quickest, most partisan presidential impeachment in U.S. history.
Some senators pointed to the importance of the moment.
“What do you want your place in history to be?” asked one of the House managers, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger.
To hear more witnesses, it would have taken four Republicans to break with the 53-seat majority and join with all Democrats in demanding more testimony. But that effort fell short.
Chief Justice John Roberts, in the rare role presiding over the impeachment trial, could break a tie, but that seemed unlikely. Asked late Friday, he told senators it would be “inappropriate.”
Murkowski noted in announcing her decision that she did not want to drag the chief justice into the partisan fray.
As protesters chanted outside the Capitol, some visitors watched from the Senate galleries.
Bolton’s forthcoming book contends he personally heard Trump say he wanted military aid withheld from Ukraine until it agreed to investigate the Bidens. Trump denies saying such a thing.
The White House has blocked its officials from testifying in the proceedings and objected that there are “significant amounts of classified information” in Bolton’s manuscript. Bolton resigned last September – Trump says he was fired – and he and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.

“Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus” was a revolutionary book when it came out in 1992. Its author, relationship counselor John Gray, based the work on his belief that most common relationship problems for heterosexual individuals are a result of fundamental psychological differences between the sexes (exemplified by the title’s metaphor that men and women are from different planets).
However, several studies done between 2015 and 2019 have disproved much of Gray’s work based on neuroscience.
“The idea of the male brain and the female brain suggests that each is a characteristically homogenous thing, and that whoever has got a male brain, say, will have the same kind of aptitudes, preferences and personalities as everyone else with that ‘type’ of brain,” neuroscientist Gina Rippon told The Guardian in a 2019 interview. “We now know that is not the case.”
So, why is “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus” still a beloved New York Times bestselling book and acclaimed off-Broadway play coming to The Lincoln Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, this month? We asked the one-man-show’s lead, Ryan Drummond.
“I’m sure there will be some person in every crowd that doesn’t buy this, but the important thing is that the info at its heart is just as pertinent today as it was when the book came out,” Drummond said by phone. “It’s not about putting genders into certain boxes, it’s all about human behavior, and that never really changes. I think the show has done a good job of updating it in a way.”
Drummond recalled first reading the script for “Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus” as he was taking the train from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan to appear on “The Rosie O’Donnell Show” in December 1998. More than two decades later, he’s been performing the role since 2017.
The original off-Broadway director, Mindy Cooper, was a former colleague of Drummond’s, and she immediately thought of him when she got involved with the play’s first national tour. However, his child-ren were quite young at the time (around 3 and 5 years old), and he wasn’t in a place to join a touring production that would keep him away from home for long stretches of time.
About four years ago, she reached out again, and the timing was much better. Cooper still thought he’d be a great fit, and Drummond was still intrigued by the script, particularly as a husband and father in a heterosexual marriage. So, he auditioned for the owner of the show and snagged the part.
“I’ve been doing theater for about 40 years and had never done a one-man show, so it was kind of a bucket list thing in my mind,” he said. “I had read the book so long ago and was fascinated by it ... I have a few passions in life, but my top one is human behavior, more so even than acting, I love learning about humans and the reasons we do the things we do, so I thought, ‘Oh, this will be really really fun.’”
Drummond started rehearsing the part in late 2016 and performed his first show in January 2017. He has a map at home on which he sticks a pin in every city he’s traveled to for the show, and he guesses he’s now reached about 50 pins.
The biggest challenge, he said, of those early days, was getting used to being the only person onstage. If he messed up, there wasn’t another person to improv with or save the scene somehow – it was up to him to fight through his mistakes. But being alone up there also offered him some exciting opportunities he never got from sharing the stage.
“The script is a skeleton, and you get to add your own experiences from your own life,” he said. “The director was big on ‘let’s make this you, let’s make it yours and bring yourself to the show.’ That ended up being a big benefit, so when I’m preparing to do the show, I don’t have to get into character, it’s just me. I make sure my water bottle is filled and head out there and just start talking to people.”
When he gets up in front of the audience, it also helps that the message he’s getting across is one he believes in. He said he likes that “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus” doesn’t pick on one sex more than the other and instead gives relatable, real-life examples of scenarios in which both sexes cause relationship issues.
Gray has a thoughtful and easily digestible way of explaining his points, Drummond added, that avoids tired stereotypes like men being lazy beer-drinking husbands.
“You find out that, according to him, we have different wiring and chemicals that work in different ways, so he talks, for example, about how men and women think,” he said. “How men are very single-file action creatures, our minds are like conveyor belts. We close a box and move it along … but women have the ability to open 73 boxes all at once, and men just can’t do that ... because that’s not how we’re wired.”
Drummond said he thinks the reason the show works is because of how this material is presented. The play is set up similarly to a stand-up comedy act, so everything is humorous and meant to be relatable – so relatable and try-it-at-home-friendly, that Drummond said he’s successfully used tactics explained in the show in his own marriage.
“The show does a good job of showing women how to get into a man’s heart and vice versa,” he said. “I’ve had numerous people throughout the years tell me they started doing these things and quoting the show at my house and it’s helped, it’s like a marriage counseling session snuck into a comedy routine, and you get to put it into your life and reap the benefits of it.”

Texto completo: From adopting puppies to planning our 50th anniversary bash, we've been busy. Here's the inside scoop from our Paonia, Colorado, headquarters and elsewhere across the West.
Over Christmas, Editorial Fellow Helen Santoro's wife, Ky, impulsively brought home a 9-week-old fluffy ball of energy with razor-sharp baby teeth. Nana is thought to be part Australian shepherd, mainly due to her looks and her aptitude for herding Helen's two chagrined cats. Meanwhile, Associate Editor Emily Benson soaked up scientific knowledge at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in December, where she learned about analyzing arsenic in Pacific Northwest ponds and earthquake early warning systems.
Some readers noted the absence ofHCNs annual holiday party. Fear not: We are planning a major 50th anniversary party and picnic in Paonia this summer, and everyone is invited - details to come. Which reminds us: We'd love to see you at our 50th anniversary gala Friday, June 12, at the Denver Botanic Gardens. Dan Flores, longtime JfCiVcontributor and author of The New York Times bestseller Coyote America, is the keynote speaker. Early-bird ticket pricing ends Feb. 28. Visit hcn.org/gala for more details.
We're also thrilled to announce HCN's Virginia Spencer Davis Fellowship. "Ginny" grew up on a ranch in California's Sacramento Valley and was a lifelong conservation advocate. She and her husband, Dick, were active in local land trusts, and after meeting Betsy and Ed Marston in the 1990s, she became an avid HCN fan. She died in 2013, and the fellowship was established by one of her daughters in honor of Ginny's love of the land and commitment to a healthy environment and good journalism. Yours truly is the grateful first recipient. I'm honored.
Finally, two corrections. We stated that 30 million tons of uranium were removed from the Navajo Nation; it was 30 million tons of uranium ore ("Editor's Note," 11/25/19). We also incorrectly stated that the Yurok Tribe is based in Washington ("The Latest," 12/9/19). It is actually based in California. We regret the errors.

WASHINGTON
A torrent of tumbling tumbleweeds stranded a half-dozen travelers on New Year's Eve near Richland in eastern Washington. Winds of up to 50 mph sent the huge plants rolling until they almost engulfed the cars. Oregon Live reports that the highway was shut down for 10 hours while transportation workers evicted the tenacious Russian thistles.
CALIFORNIA
Who knew there was money in maggots? Maggot-farming was just about nonexistent a decade ago, reports Bloomberg, but now it's become "increasingly fashionable" because it uses organic waste that would otherwise end up in landfills. Jason Drew, chief honcho of AgriProtein, has been on a maggoty spree, recently selecting California to host one of his industrial-scale farms. The Jurupa Valley plant will be modeled on a Cape Town facility that raises black soldier flies on about 25 metric tons of organic waste daily. The flies' larvae, which go through several stages prior to maggothood, are harvested to produce 4,000 tons of protein meal a year. The place is buzzing: "At any one time ... there are 8.4 billion flies in the factory." Aquaculture is the primary market, with insect feed "eventually displacing fishmeal that's made from wild-caught fish and fed to salmon." But believe it or not, human consumers are also customers: A restaurant in Cape Town has begun serving dishes "including ice cream made from ground-up maggots."
MONTANA
Rocky Mountain goats are handsome beasts with massive haunches and a bold demeanor that probably stems from their predator-free lifestyle - unless you count hunters. But they're defenseless against a new enemy: climate change, which, according to Colorado State University wildlife biology professor Joel Berger, is melting glaciers and drying up the snow the goats roll on to cool off during sunny winter days. Berger, who is also a senior scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, co-authored a study on how human-caused climate change causes heat stress and hypothermia in mountain goats. "They just don't seem to have the thermal flexibility that we see in some of these other large animals," he told VICE.
CALIFORNIA
There's a lot to admire about the Golden State, The New York Times reports, starting with its robust economy, the fifth largest in the world. Then there's the intrepid way its Legislature wades into controversy, banning the sale of fois gras, fur coats, alligator skin boots and those disposable shampoo bottles in hotels. You can also no longer smoke cigarettes in state parks - "even on a deserted beach" - or build a new house unless you install solar panels. But California really wins when it comes to making voting easier: "While other states are purging their voter rolls, California has gone the other direction to encourage mail-in ballots." And now, forthe first time, "ballots come with postage prepaid envelopes."
UTAH
Hog waste may be a huge and smelly pollution problem, but Dominion Energy, which provides natural gas to 1 million customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho, sees it as an unexploited resource, theDeseretNews reports. Now, Dominion's director of gas development, Ryan Childress, says his company is partnering with Smithfield Farms, the world's largest pork producer, to become "the most sustainable energy company in the world." At Smithfield's 26 hog farms in Utah, anaerobic digesters will break down waste and produce methane, aka renewable natural gas. Childress calls the project a triple win: "clean renewable energy to customers, taking greenhouse gas emissions out of the atmosphere, and giving farmers a new way to make money."
MONTANA
A few miles from the National Bison Range - and much, much farther from the nearest ocean - a man in Mission Valley has begun what might be Montana's first shrimp-raising business. Jim Vaughan told the Billings Gazette that he got his first batch of white Pacific shrimp from his brother in Idaho, who learned about the business while working as a miner in Indonesia. (That brother's business, Cowboy Shrimp, ended with his divorce, but the idea - along with some starter shrimp - inspired Vaughan.) He buys baby shrimp, which come in bags of 10,000 nearly invisible juveniles from farms in Texas or Florida, and raises them in five huge 8,000-gallon covered tubs filled with 84-degree saltwater. They're easy to farm, needing only salt and circulating water, and he "uses a type of bacteria that eat the shrimp waste." A former cattleman, Vaughan says that shrimp are much more efficient at creating protein than cattle. He sells his shrimp live by the pound: "There's a lot of interest," he says. "I gotta turn the interest into sells."

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" — that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
"Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued at the Senate hearing on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued on Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump's behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.

'Xenophobia' posting draws ire, apology

Texto completo: At first glance, the informational handout recently shared by the University of California at Berkeley's health services center on Instagram looked like many of the others that have been promoted amid rising worry over the global spread of the deadly coronavirus.
This post, which was widely circulated Thursday, focused on "managing fears and anxiety" around the pneumonia-like virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last month and has since infected people in countries worldwide, including the U.S. In addition to offering mental health tips and resources, the handout identified a handful of "normal reactions" people may be experiencing as the crisis continues to unfold.
It would be reasonable, the university's health center wrote, for people in the coming days or weeks to feel panicked, socially withdrawn, and angry, among other emotions. But the last "normal" feeling listed was, as one person put it, "very much not like the other."
"Xenophobia: fears about interacting with those who might be from Asia and guilt about those feelings," the handout said.
As Asians, especially Chinese people, worldwide have experienced heightened tensions in their communities and an increasing number of racist incidents sparked by fears of coronavirus contamination, the post struck a nerve. Many critics slammed the graphic, expressing disbelief that a prominent university with a large Asian student body appeared to be "normalizing racism."
The outcry prompted university officials to take swift action, removing the Instagram post later in the day and issuing an apology for causing "any misunderstanding."
"We apologize for our recent post on managing anxiety around Coronavirus," said a statement shared by Berkeley's Tang Center, which is named after Hong Kong businessman Jack C.C. Tang. "We regret any misunderstanding it may have caused and have updated the language in our materials."
Thursday's controversy coincided with the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus outbreak a "public health emergency" and the State Department elevating its travel advisory for China to Level 4: Do Not Travel. The continuing developments are likely to stoke more fear over the virus' spread, as experts say a vaccine will not be ready any time soon.
That does not bode well for Asians already being subjected to discrimination and vitriolic attacks.
The hashtag "#ChineseDon'tComeToJapan" has been trending on Japanese social media, and Singaporeans are petitioning their government to bar Chinese nationals from entering the country, the New York Times reported.
In France, Asian citizens launched a hashtag, "#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus" ("I'm not a virus"), to fight back against racism, the BBC reported. Le Courrier Picard, a French newspaper, also recently apologized after weathering backlash for running a front-page headline that read, "ALERTE JAUNE," or "YELLOW ALERT." So far, the country has confirmed five cases.
Reports of xenophobic behavior in Toronto prompted Mayor John Tory to issue a public statement Wednesday rebuking the treatment of the city's Chinese Canadian community. Canada has reported three cases of infection.
The Berkeley University Health Services coronavirus handout went viral Thursday after a screen grab of the Instagram post was shared on Twitter. Critics, a number of whom are current or former students, blasted the university, suggesting that the post amounted to condoning racism against Asians. According to Berkeley's fall enrollment data, more than 40% of last year's freshman class are Asian.
Reactions ranged from shock to disgust as several people demanded answers from the university.
"This just in from the number one public university in the world: it's okay to be xenophobic as long as you also feel sort of guilty about it," one person tweeted.
The revised version of the health-center handout makes no mention of xenophobia. Under "Ways to Manage Fears & Anxieties," a bullet point reads, "Be mindful of your assumptions about others."
"Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus," the handout said. "Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community."

Where was Kobe born? Not in Philly

Texto completo: Ever since Kobe Bryant's tragic death Sunday, he's been embraced by Philadelphia more closely than he ever managed during his Hall of Fame NBA career.
Obituaries and remembrances referred to the basketball superstar as "Philadelphia-born." Sports columnists detailed how alike Bryant and his tough, competitive, basketball-mad hometown were. A New York Times article was headlined, "Kobe Bryant, Philly Guy."
So it's somewhat jarring to find out that Bryant, who played high school basketball at suburban Lower Merion High, wasn't a native Philadelphian at all. Despite what his birth certificate said, he was born just across the border in Montgomery County.
It's a minor but not insignificant difference given the Lower Merion High graduate's complicated relationship with Philadelphia and its fans. While many here adored him, others felt he disrespected the city with comments he made as a Laker. In particular, Bryant agitated the locals in 2001 when he called Los Angeles "my hometown."
The geographical distinction of his birth came to light with the discovery of a brief Sports People item in the Aug. 24, 1978, Inquirer, the day after Bryant was born.
"A third child was born to 76er forward Joe (Jellybean) Bryant and his wife, Pam, at Lankenau Hospital."
Founded in 1866 by John Lankenau as the German Hospital, Lankenau had been situated in North Philadelphia for nearly a century. But in 1953 it moved to the former site of Overbrook Golf Club, near City and Lancaster Avenues, in Wynnewood, Lower Merion Township.
"That property has always been in Lower Merion Township," said Jody Kelley, the township's secretary.
Contemporary newspaper accounts correctly placed the new hospital in Lower Merion, but Lankenau, perhaps because associating itself with the city's rich medical history lent it prestige, used Philadelphia on its stationery.
When Bryant was born there 23 years later, Philadelphia was listed in the Lower Merion facility's official address, According to Kelley, that section of Wynnewood then shared a 19151 Philadelphia zip code with the neighborhood across City Avenue.
As a result, for decades birth certificates issued for Lankenau-born babies cited Philadelphia as the place of birth.
Eventually, Kelley believed it was "sometime in the 1980s," just about the time Joe Bryant brought his family back from Italy and settled in Lower Merion, the hospital got a Wynnewood zip code, 19096.

Texto completo: In May 2019, President Donald Trump asked then-National Security Adviser John Bolton to help make sure Ukraine's newly elected leader met with Rudy Giuliani about investigations he sought into Democrats, according to an unpublished manuscript of Bolton's book.
Bolton writes that Trump issued the directive in an Oval Office meting where Giuliani, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading Trump's defense in the Senate impeachment trial, were also present.
Bolton writes that he never called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a person who has read the unpublished book and shared details of its contents with the Associated Press. The person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss what is in the book, spoke Friday on condition of anonymity.
The revelations add new details to Trump's role in pushing Ukraine to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee, and come as the Senate inches closer to the president's all-but-certain acquittal in his impeachment trial. Democrats have pushed to call Bolton as a witness in the trial, but do not have enough support from GOP senators.
Bolton has said he is willing to testify, including about matters included in his book, which is due to be published in March.
The discussion at the meeting in early May was first reported by the New York Times.
Bolton writes that the president asked him to call Zelensky and persuade him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the president's political rivals - the heart of the impeachment inquiry.
In a statement, Trump denied the account in Bolton's manuscript.
"I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelensky," Trump said. "That meeting never happened."
The House impeached Trump last month on two charges - first, that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations. Democrats say Trump asked the vulnerable ally to investigate Biden and debunked theories of 2016 election interference, withholding American security aid to the country as it battled Russia at its border. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.

Clarity's cost: The $5 million comma

Texto completo: Clarity is in short supply across America, but no longer at dairy farms in Maine.
In 2014, you see, drivers for a dairy company in Portland, Maine, sued their employer for overtime pay because a state law pertaining to overtime-pay exemptions failed to include the Oxford comma.
What is the Oxford comma?
It's the final comma in a list of things, Grammarly explains. In Grammarly's example, the Oxford comma appears after the word "eraser": "Please bring me a pencil, eraser, and notebook."
Few use the Oxford comma anymore. Most newspapers, for instance, edit articles according to the Associated Press Stylebook, which does NOT use the Oxford comma.
What's the big deal? According to some pedantic humorists, proper Oxford-comma use is a huge issue, one that could even save lives.
"Let's shop, then eat, Grandma" suggests something much less harmful than "Let's shop, then eat Grandma!"
And "I love cooking my dogs and my family" is much more appalling than "I love cooking, my dogs, and my family."
Which brings us back to that overtime pay dispute.
According to The New York Times, "Maine law requires time-and-a-half pay for each hour worked after 40 hours, but it carved out exemptions for:
"The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of:
"(1) Agricultural produce;
"(2) Meat and fish products; and
(3) Perishable foods."
The dispute concerned the words "or distribution of." The Times reports that since there was no Oxford comma before "or" the "court ruled that it was not clear whether the law exempted the distribution of the three categories that followed, or if it exempted packing for the shipment or distribution of them. Had there been a comma after 'shipment,' the meaning would have been clear."
Had there been an Oxford comma, "distribution of the dairy goods" would have clearly been exempt from overtime pay, but it wasn't clear. Thus, the dairy company had to cough up $5 million in overtime pay that it wouldn't have had to pay had an Oxford comma been properly used.
In any event, this story illustrates the importance of clarity in our laws and government processes. If ambiguity in a state law can cost one company $5 million, what might Americans' increasingly unclear understanding of our government and political landscape be costing us?
Here are some disturbing findings from Annenberg Institute surveys:
"More than half of Americans (53%) incorrectly think it is accurate to say that immigrants who are here illegally do not have any rights under the U.S. Constitution;
"More than a third of those surveyed (37%) can't name any of the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment;
"Only 39% can name all three branches of government."
Ignorance is dangerous to a representative republic. Voters must be well-informed to prevent smooth-talking, self-serving charlatans from attaining and abusing political power.
The solution to our increasing lack of clarity? Here are two options, one with a comma, one without:
"Wake up, America!" – or "Wake up America!"

Texto completo: "He's from Michigan and gravitates toward Midwestern people and people that are nicer. I think that's a sentiment that a lot of people have needed recently."
Jaime MacDonald, sister of Jason Polan
It was clear that Jason Polan would be an artist.
In middle school, he got permission to turn in a book report in the form of a comic book, his mother, Jane Polan, recalled.
He noticed patterns in weeds and saw smiley faces in electric plugs, she said.
"I once asked him — I said, 'If you couldn't make a living doing art, what would you do?' and he gave me a look as if to say, 'There's nothing else that I would do,' " she said.
The Michigan native died of cancer Monday in New York at the age of 37, having accomplished many goals and touched lives around the world with his art.
Polan, born in 1982 in Ann Arbor and raised in Franklin, was esteemed in the New York art scene for, among other works, taking on the incredible task of drawing every person in the city.
A former Birmingham Groves High School student and a University of Michigan graduate of 2004, his efforts culminated in a book, "Every Person in New York," with more than 30,000 portraits and a foreword by former "Saturday Night Live" star Kristen Wiig. It continued in a blog.
He also penned "The Every Piece of Art in the Museum of Modern Art Book." His work was featured in publications including the New York Times and the New Yorker, and he had commercial success with companies such as eyeglass retailer Warby Parker, furniture retailer West Elm, clothing line Levi's, and clothing line Uniqlo, where last year he debuted a Marvel Comics collection.
But for all his success, he was just as happy back in Michigan drawing the biggest tree in Manchester for the local newspaper The Manchester Mirror, said co-owner of the paper, University of Michigan lecturer and friend Fritz Swanson.
Polan did just that in 2017. The sketch, still available online, includes an extra outline just in front of the tree's trunk, along with an arrow and a disclaimer, "smaller tree."
Once Polan's writing composition teacher, Swanson said Polan became a teacher to him in many ways, as well as a project collaborator.
"He was gracious in the old sense," Swanson said. "... He was patient and generous and people just loved it."
Polan loved people, too, said longtime friend Jake Brege, 37, of Ann Arbor. The two are responsible for a mural in that city's downtown.
The two met in a drawing class during their freshman year at U-M and bonded over their mutual respect for each other's work on the first assignment — drawing shoes, Brege said.
He recalled times when Polan, who was best man at his wedding, called him just to share something nice another person had done, even just at a fruit stand.
"The attention to his surroundings and drawing things and kind of trying to see the art in everyday life, he applied that same sort of attention to details and perception to the way he interacted with people as well," he said.
Following graduation, Polan worked on the traveling art museum Artrain and then moved to New York. He pursued art while working at Border's, family said. Then he worked as a full-time artist.
"His interest was really, very much making people feel good, making people happy, making people laugh," Jesse Polan said of his son. "It made him feel good that other people felt good as a result of seeing, thinking about and being involved with the kind of things that he was doing."
In sharing his work, Polan also became known for his Taco Bell Drawing Club.
No matter where he was in the country, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Wednesdays he would find a Taco Bell and draw. Anyone was invited to join him, and many did.
The final drawing posted to his "Every Person in New York" blog was of a man at a Taco Bell.
Of his legacy and lasting impact, his sister Jaime MacDonald thinks back to a recent poster he made. It read, "Work Harder at Being Better."
"He's from Michigan and gravitates toward Midwestern people and people that are nicer," she said. "I think that's a sentiment that a lot of people have needed recently."
Jason Polan is survived by his parents, a sister, a brother-in-law and a nephew. He was preceded in death by his sister Jennifer.
A funeral is scheduled for noon Thursday at Ira Kaufman Chapel at 18325 W. Nine Mile Road in Southfield. Burial will follow at Franklin Cemetery in Franklin.
In lieu of a donation, the family asks that everyone check with their doctors about the appropriate age for colon cancer screening.
"He's from Michigan and gravitates toward Midwestern people and people that are nicer. I think that's a sentiment that a lot of people have needed recently."

Biden criticizes rivals Sanders and Buttigieg

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized two of his top rivals in the Democratic presidential race Thursday as tensions in the race ratcheted up four days before the Iowa caucuses.
Biden spoke to a group of reporters Thursday afternoon at a Dairy Queen in Pella, where he was asked about U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The three candidates are among the polling leaders in Iowa, along with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found Sanders in the lead with 20% support among likely Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Warren (17%), Buttigieg (16%) and Biden (15%).
Biden first told reporters the contrasts between himself and his top rivals were "self-evident," according to the New York Times. Asked to explain, Biden criticized Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats in the U.S. Senate, for his party affiliation.
"I'm a Democrat," Biden said.
"Well, he says he's not. He says — you know, he's not registered as a Democrat, to the best of my knowledge," Biden said, according to the Times.
New York Times reporter Katie Glueck also asked Biden if he worries about Sanders' record on guns.
"I think Bernie has made his verbal amends for his record on guns," Biden responded, before bringing up Sanders' past votes against gun control measures, including a vote against a 1993 bill that would have established national background checks. Sanders was in the U.S. House at the time.
"I think he's regretted that, I think he's changed his mind. So I take him at his word," Biden said.
At an event in Ottumwa later on Thursday, CBS reporter Bo Erickson asked Biden about Sanders' criticism of his record on Social Security, which the two campaigns have sparred over in recent weeks.
Biden reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a card with his talking points on the issue, handed it to Erickson and said "for you."
"I knew you'd ask so I decided to write it up for you, so you knew," Biden said.
The card was labeled "Bernie false attack on Social Security." Sanders campaign officials have stood by their criticism of Biden.
Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir responded to Biden's criticism Thursday night. "Last-minute, cheap barbs borne of desperation aren't a good look for a candidate who proclaims his desire to unite the party," Shakir said.
Biden also responded to criticism from Buttigieg.
"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new," Buttigieg said in Decorah. "But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take, with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments, and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump."
Biden did not respond directly to Buttigieg Thursday while campaigning in Waukee and Newton, but the former vice president answered a question from reporters later that afternoon.
"I don't know what Pete's talking about. He's a good guy and I'm not going to get into it. He must be deciding things are getting a little tight," Biden said. "A Washington playbook — I'm not sure what he means. What I'm advocating is for the American people, the middle class and giving people a shot."
Register reporter Barbara Rodriguez contributed to this report.

Leader, actress hit with big lawsuit over NXIVM cult

Texto completo: Dozens of people who say they were bilked out of thousands of dollars and left emotionally and physically abused filed a federal lawsuit this week against NXIVM, the cult-like group that drew international headlines when some of its members were branded with their leader's initials.
The lawsuit accuses Keith Raniere, actress Allison Mack and 13 other NXIVM leaders of playing various roles in a pyramid scheme that doubled as a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, one that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and illegal human experimentation.
The complaint was filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court by actress Sarah Edmondson; Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman who dated Raniere in the 1990s; filmmaker Mark Vicente; and more than 70 former NXIVM members kept anonymous.
They are seeking monetary damages, asking a federal judge to determine how much they are owed for their pain and suffering.
NXIVM, now defunct, was based in the Albany suburbs.
"Defendants exerted power over the Plaintiffs; took their money; made it financially, physically and psychologically difficult, and in some cases impossible, to leave the coercive community; and systematically abused Plaintiffs physically and emotionally," the plaintiffs attorneys, led by Neil Glazer, wrote in the 189-page complaint.
NXIVM leaders found guilty in 2019 The expansive lawsuit explores the various ways Raniere, a Rockland County native who billed himself as one of the smartest men in the world, and NXIVM are alleged to have systematically abused its members, coercing them into spending their money on purported self-help classes and making them psychologically dependent on his teachings.
Raniere, Mack and four other NXIVM leaders — including Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune — were convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes related to the group last year. They are awaiting sentencing.
Mack, one of Raniere's most-devoted followers, is best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville."
Attorneys for Mack and Raniere did not immediately respond to comment Thursday. But Raniere's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told The New York Times he thinks the civil suit will benefit his client's chances on appeal.
"As several of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit testified at trial that they were not planning on bringing a lawsuit, Keith's chances on appeal just increased," Mr. Agnifilo said in a statement, according to the newspaper.
Civil suit details alleged abuse The civil suit recounts much of what was revealed during Raniere's trial and more.
At the trial, Mack was accused of helping run a NXIVM subgroup known as DOS, a master-slave group that was ultimately led by Raniere himself, though some members other than Mack didn't know it.
The women were branded near their pubic area with a logo containing Raniere's initials, while some were groomed to become Raniere's sexual partners. They were forced to give up naked photographs and other damaging information that was held as collateral in case they ever revealed the existence of the group.
Edmondson, who was among those branded, ultimately blew the whistle on the group, setting in motion a criminal investigation that led to Raniere's conviction.
Along with the branding, the lawsuit also details Natalie's years of court battles with Raniere, which came after she ended an eight-year relationship with him.
Raniere and NXIVM officials, backed with Bronfman's fortune, bombarded Natalie with lawsuits and court filings that cost her thousands of dollars and kept her tied up in court for years, even intervening in her and her mother's personal bankruptcy proceedings.
The civil suit lays out 10 different claims, ranging from racketeering to battery to malicious abuse of the legal process.
Along with Raniere and Mack, the lawsuit also names Clare Bronfman, her sister Sara, Nicki Clyne, Nancy Salzman and Lauren Salzman as defendants, along with NXIVM and 11 other individuals or companies with ties to the group.
Clyne, like Mack, was an actress and Raniere follower. She played the role of Cally Henderson Tyrol in the Sci-Fi Channel reboot of "Battlestar Galactica."

Texto completo: ST. PETERSBURG  Dr. Vai Alandikar lifted a set of four boxes from his spot behind the counter at Baileys Pharmacy on 34th Street North.

These are worth their weight in gold right now, he said with a little grin.

Each of the boxes contained 50 standard face masks  the kind that cover the mouth and nose and loop around the ears. Back behind the counter, he had two smaller boxes with 20 masks each, but that was it.

These masks have become a hot commodity in the past few days as Americans watched the spread of Wuhan coronavirus, which as of Friday had infected nearly 10,000 people worldwide, more than 9,600 in China, according to the Associated Press. Six cases have been confirmed in the U.S. as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The outbreak has prompted some to buy the masks in bulk and hoard them, the New York Times reported this week, even though masks do little to safeguard most healthy people. Business Insider reported Tuesday that Amazon retailers were selling out of masks, and Gothamist noted that New York City pharmacies were running out, too.

The demand for masks is present in St. Petersburg, too: Jessica Bucko, another employee at Baileys, said people had been calling the store to ask about masks and saying that other stores were out. An employee who answered the phone at Healthmed Pharmacy on Central Avenue said the stores supplier was out of masks.

We ordered some from one of our distributors ... and they rejected the order until they replenish, said Judy Callahan, who works in retail sales at Suncoast Medical Supply on Tyrone Boulevard. Right now, its hard to find them anywhere.

Studies have shown that masks are effective in keeping health care workers from getting sick, the Times noted, and most hospitals consider it common sense that wearing a mask helps prevent sick people from spreading germs. But Alandikar said those worried about coronavirus in the U.S. dont need masks unless theyre sick or in contact with people who have recently been in Wuhan.

Alandikar said the same thing to everyone whos asked him how to best prepare for the possibility of coronavirus expanding: Wash your hands; take basic precautions like seeing a doctor if you feel sick; keep your home clean. And dont assume you need to prepare for the worst.

Theres no need to panic, he said. Panic makes it worse.

Court rejects death row appeal

Texto completo: A federal court in Atlanta has rejected the latest appeals of James Dailey, the death row inmate who says he is innocent of a 1985 Pinellas County murder.

In an opinion issued Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals disputed Daileys claims that new evidence suggests he was not involved in the murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggio.

Daileys arguments are essentially the same ones he has raised for years, the court concluded. Other courts have repeatedly turned them down.

Carol Wright, Daileys lead federal attorney, decried the ruling in a statement Friday.

This opinion is a prime illustration of the serious deficiencies in our appellate review system, she wrote. The court today says that new evidence is not enough. The court today says that proof of innocence is not enough. The court today says even if the states theory of the conviction is disproved, if the court can imagine any scenario of guilt however implausible an innocent man can be executed. The system is broken.

Dailey, now 73, was one of two men found guilty of Boggios murder. The girls body was found one morning in the Intracoastal Waterway near a bridge in Indian Rocks Beach. She was beaten, choked, stabbed more than 30 times and ultimately drowned. Evidence suggested the crime was sexually motivated.

While Dailey was sent to death row, his co-defendant, Jack Pearcy, received a life sentence. Daileys attorneys have argued that Pearcy alone is responsible for the crime.

Pearcy and Dailey were seen with Boggio the night before she was found dead. The men lived together with Pearcys girlfriend. When investigators questioned Pearcy, he implicated Dailey. There was no physical evidence.

But three jailhouse informants testified at Daileys trial that they overheard him make incriminating statements. The defense has questioned the reliability of informants, who include Paul Skalnik, whose prolific history as a jailhouse snitch was the subject of an investigative report published in December by ProPublica and the New York Times Magazine.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Daileys death warrant in September, setting his execution date for Nov. 7. But a federal judge issued a stay of execution to give his attorneys more time to research and present their case.

The same judge later rejected a number of Daileys claims after a thorough review of the case. That led to the appeal to the 11th Circuit.

The judges wrote that Dailey has not met the high burden of showing that he is innocent.

Daileys new evidence, at most, casts some degree of doubt on some of the testimony the State presented at trial, Chief Judge Ed Carnes wrote. The credibility of one of the three jailhouse informants, Paul Skalnik, has been called into doubt. But we are not jurors deciding in the first instance whether the State has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt ...

We are a court of appeals deciding more than 30 years after a murder whether the inmate who was convicted of it, and whose conviction has been upheld at every turn for three decades, has shown a reasonable likelihood of meeting the extraordinarily high burden of making a truly persuasive demonstration that he is actually innocent, the judge wrote. Dailey has not done that.

Dailey still has an appeal pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. His attorneys are also seeking a full hearing on claims of new evidence in the circuit court in Pinellas County.

The governor has not set a new execution date.

Former T.M. Landry students discuss abuse allegations

Texto completo: A nontraditional, unlicensed school in Lafayette is receiving national attention again, as the Tamron Hall Show featured two former students of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School.
Broadcast journalist Tamron Hall interviewed Doraian Givens, Nyjal Mitchell and his mother Mary Mitchell on her live daily talk show in an episode Tuesday focused on education.
The three were included in reporting by The New York Times in late 2018 that alleged leaders of the school abused students and falsified college applications.
Hall asked Nyjal about physical abuse allegations he made against Michael Landry, who founded the school with wife Tracey in 2005. He said there were three instances of abuse.
"The first time he slammed my neck against a table and the second time he shoved me in front of a door," Nyjal told Hall. "The third time was the worst one, where he came up to me, grabbed me and put me in a chokehold, slammed me on a concrete floor and then dragged me by my hoodie."
Greg Davis, chairman of the school's board of directors since December 2018, told The Daily Advertiser on Wednesday those incidents were reported to Breaux Bridge Police at the time.
The Breaux Bridge Police Department received about 10 complaints involving T.M. Landry in the month following The New York Times publishing its article.
Michael Landry was cited for simple battery, according to records provided by the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office to the Advertiser.
Nyjal and his mom said he is in a public school now and taking extra classes online to catch up as a senior. He said he was a year behind after his time at T.M. Landry.
Davis, in his interview with the Advertiser, said the talk show interview seemed to be "a rehashing of what was already alleged in the New York Times article."
"It doesn't seem like it was anything new," he said.
The 4-minute clip of the show about T.M. Landry was shared to the show's Facebook page, which has 155,000 followers. The video had 28,000 views in 20 hours.
Hall said on her show that she reached out to school officials who said they didn't feel they had enough time to respond. She read part of a statement from a T.M. Landry spokesperson.
"We only want the truth, the whole truth to be told," Hall read. "We make no claims of being a model of perfection, but you can see why we are reasonably reluctant and cautious about doing anything that would jeopardize opportunities for our students."
Another former student, Doraian Givens, told Hall that she doesn't have a diploma showing she graduated from high school after attending T.M. Landry her senior year.
"I don't have anything that says I graduated from high school," she said.
She was accepted into New York University and is currently a junior.
"At this point I have no choice but to graduate college, which was going to happen anyway — let's make that clear," Givens said on the show.
Davis said Wednesday in an interview that the school is transparent that it is nontraditional and not licensed by the state Department of Education. It provides nontraditional diplomas, he said, which are accepted at universities, like in Givens' case.
"The evidence of that is our kids successfully gain admission to schools like Harvard," Davis said.
The Advertiser contacted Givens for further comment Wednesday.
"The show was my last time speaking about the situation," she said in a Facebook message.
The school currently has 49 children enrolled in first through 12th grade. That total is down from 110 when The New York Times article published, Davis said.
"Our parents are solidly supportive of the school," he said.
Davis said the students at the school now are excelling, including the senior class of about eight students.
"Our students have great outcomes," Davis said in December. "They've already applied for admission into colleges."
The school was founded 15 years ago with five students at a kitchen table, according to the school's profile and mission statement.
It describes the school as "an independent co-educational year round college prep school" for "for intellectual, 'out of the box' thinkers who want to pursue a serious, purposeful education, with the ultimate goal of achieving success in college and beyond."
It is is not funded through or accredited by the Louisiana Department of Education.

Texto completo: BY LISA MASCARO, ERIC TUCKER and ZEKE MILLER
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The Senate narrowly rejected, 51-49, Democrats' demands to summon witnesses for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial late Friday, all but ensuring Trump's acquittal in just the third trial to threaten a president's removal in U.S. history. But senators pushed off final voting on his fate to next Wednesday.
The delay in timing showed the weight of a historic vote bearing down on senators, despite prodding by the president eager to have it all behind him in an election year and ahead of his State of the Union speech Tuesday night.
Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke by phone to lock in the schedule during a tense night at the Capitol as rushed negotiations proceeded on and off the Senate floor.
The president wanted to arrive for his speech at the Capitol with acquittal secured, but that will not happen. Instead, the trial will resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting is planned for 4p.m. (EST) Wednesday, the day after Trump's speech.
Trump's acquittal is all but certain in the Senate, where his GOP allies hold the majority and there's nowhere near the two-thirds needed for conviction and removal.
Despite the Democrats' singular focus on hearing new testimony, the Republican majority brushed past those demands and will make this the first impeachment trial without witnesses. Even new revelations Friday, leaked to the New York Times from former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book, did not sway GOP senators, who said they'd heard enough.
"The sooner the better for the country," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant. "Let's turn the page."
Trump was impeached by the House last month on charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress as he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid as leverage as the ally fought Russia. He is charged with then blocking the congressional probe of his actions.
Senators rejected the Democrats' effort to allow new witnesses on a near party-line vote. Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Mitt Romney, of Utah, voted with the Democrats.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called it "a tragedy on a very large scale."
But Republicans said Trump's acquittal was justified and inevitable.
Key Republican senators said even if Trump committed the offenses as charged by the House, they are not impeachable and the partisan proceedings must end.
"I didn't need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing," said retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, a late holdout. "But that didn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense."
The next steps come in the heart of presidential campaign season. Democratic caucus voting begins Monday in Iowa and four Democratic candidates have been chafing in the Senate chamber rather than campaigning, including Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who the latest polls show is running neck-and-neck with former Vice President Joe Biden.
The Democrats had badly wanted testimony from Bolton, whose forthcoming book links Trump directly to the charges. But Bolton won't be summoned, and none of this appeared to affect the trial's expected outcome. Democrats forced a series of new procedural votes late Friday to call Bolton and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others, but all were rejected.
In an unpublished manuscript, Bolton has written that the president asked him during an Oval Office meeting in early May to bolster his effort to get Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to a person who read the passage and told The Associated Press. The person, who was not authorized to disclose contents of the book, spoke only on condition of anonymity.
In the meeting, Bolton said the president asked him to call new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and persuade him to meet with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was planning to go to Ukraine to coax the Ukrainians to investigate the president's political rivals. Bolton writes that he never made the call to Zelenskiy after the meeting, which included acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
The revelation adds more detail to allegations of when and how Trump first sought to influence Ukraine to aid investigations of his rivals that are central to the abuse of power charge in the first article of impeachment.
The story was first reported Friday by The New York Times.
Trump issued a quick denial.
"I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelenskiy," Trump said. "That meeting never happened."
Key Republican senators said even if Trump committed the offenses as charged by the House, they are not impeachable and the partisan proceedings must end.
"I didn't need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing," retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a late holdout, told reporters Friday at the Capitol. "But that didn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense."
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, said she, too, would oppose more testimony in the charged partisan atmosphere, having "come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.'' She said, "The Congress has failed."
Eager for a conclusion, Trump's allies nevertheless suggested the shift in timing to extend the proceedings into next week, acknowledging the significance of the moment for senators who want to give final speeches.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made the offer to Schumer, but it was not yet final.
Under the proposal, the Senate would resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting would be Wednesday.
To bring the trial toward a conclusion, Trump's attorneys argued the House had already heard from 17 witnesses and presented its 28,578-page report to the Senate. They warned against prolonging it even further after House impeached Trump largely along party lines after less than thee months of formal proceedings making it the quickest, most partisan presidential impeachment in U.S. history.
Some senators pointed to the importance of the moment.
"What do you want your place in history to be?" asked one of the House managers, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger.
Trump is almost assured of eventual acquittal with the Senate nowhere near the 67 votes needed for conviction and removal.
To hear more witnesses, it would have taken four Republicans to break with the 53-seat majority and join with all Democrats in demanding more testimony. But that effort fell short.
Though protesters stood outside the Capitol, few visitors have been watching from the Senate galleries.
Bolton's forthcoming book contends he personally heard Trump say he wanted military aid withheld from Ukraine until it agreed to investigate the Bidens. Trump denies saying such a thing.
The White House has blocked its officials from testifying in the proceedings and objected that there are "significant amounts of classified information" in Bolton's manuscript. Bolton resigned last September - Trump says he was fired - and he and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.

Texto completo: Senate Republicans made a monumental call of immediate and long-term consequence Friday when they voted not to allow any new witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.
But in fact there were witnesses -- at least to a process intended to protect the president, not the Constitution.
Take it not just from Democrats, but from Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, who said before Friday's vote that ending the trial without witnesses is "only a job half done." Seemingly a partial trial fully convinced some Republicans, including Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, that Trump acted improperly.
"There is no need for more evidence to conclude that the president withheld United States aid, at least in part, to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens [Joe and his son Hunter]," Alexander said in a statement. "The House managers," he continued, "have proved this with what they call a 'mountain of overwhelming evidence.' "
But few of Alexander's GOP colleagues were willing to climb that mountain, and he ended up joining them in voting 51-49 to defeat a motion to call witnesses. Many continued to parrot the president's characterization of the shakedown as a "perfect" call. That's why new witnesses were warranted -- including potentially the key witness, former national security adviser John Bolton.
A leaked manuscript of Bolton's unpublished book indicates that he directly contradicts the president's account of why military aid to Ukraine was withheld.
Further revelations emerged before Friday's vote. According to the New York Times, Trump directed Bolton "to help with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on Democrats from Ukrainian officials" during an Oval Office meeting that included acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- one of the other witnesses sought by Democrats -- as well as the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the White House counsel leading the impeachment defense, Pat Cipollone.
"That meeting never happened," Trump said in a statement on Friday. If only sworn testimony could determine who is telling the truth.
Americans, despite deep divisions, appear to concur. A new Quinnipiac poll found that 75% of registered voters agreed that "witnesses should be allowed to testify in the Senate impeachment trial" -- including a plurality of 49% of Republicans.
Instead, senators supporting Trump appeared headed toward an acquittal, although the timing of that vote was uncertain late Friday. No doubt Trump would like to celebrate a big win in his Super Bowl pregame interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, or crow about during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday.
Trump got a jump on his end zone dance on Thursday, when he told a Des Moines rally that it was "a happy period because we call it 'impeachment light.' "
Sadly, he's right. What former President James Buchanan apocryphally called "the world's greatest deliberative body" didn't bring the bodies to deliberate. Instead, House managers had to rely on previous testimonies -- that is from those not blocked or intimidated by the White House.
"The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did," Alexander wrote in his statement, adding: "Let the people decide."
And so they will render a verdict, in November -- on the president and his Senate defenders, who failed to live up to Buchanan's lamentably outdated description of their institution.

Texto completo: Minnesotans with ties to Myanmar and Eritrea raised concerns on Friday that President Donald Trump's new executive order restricting immigration from those countries could interfere with families reuniting.
The Trump administration said it would block most immigration from those and four other countries in the interest of national security. Immigrant visas, issued mostly to foreigners intending to live in the United States, will be banned from Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea and Kyrgyzstan. The ban would prevent immigrants from Sudan and Tanzania from obtaining diversity visas drawn from a lottery.
"The plan is not very clear to us yet, but there is a lot of apprehension by the Eritrean community and what it means to have this travel ban," said Essey Asbu, host of Eritrean Community Radio on KFAI-FM (90.3 and 106.7) in the Twin Cities.
Eritrea is recovering from war, and living standards are poor, he said, and people want to come to America and reunite with their families.
"It's just a sad day in the relations of American and Eritrean history," he said.
U.S. Homeland Security and State Department officials said some immigrants would be able to obtain waivers from the restrictions. The total number of countries on the restricted travel list, including Somalia and others banned previously by the Trump administration, now stands at 13. Immigration advocates are paying close attention to whether it could affect refugees, a group that is not explicitly included under the expanded travel ban.
"At a time when so many of these countries are going through crisis, now is not the time for the U.S. to close its borders to these countries," said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, one of the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the nation. She added: "Our fear is that this expanded ban will operate as a policy preventing families from reunifying."
Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said, "We're adding a couple of countries. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe. You see what's going on in the world."
The administration has argued that the ban, originally enacted in 2017 to restrict travel from Muslim-majority countries, is necessary to ensure that countries satisfy security requirements for travel into the United States, or face restrictions until they do. It says that the countries on the list have harbored terrorists, maintained outdated passport systems or failed to ensure adequate information-sharing.
The expansion of the restrictions, which already affected more than 135 million people in seven countries, is likely to hinder more than 12,300 potential immigrants from resettling in the United States or reuniting with their families.
Myanmar, formerly Burma, has been one of the largest sources of refugees to Minnesota in recent years as the Karen ethnic minority flees persecution. Many still have family members who travel back and forth. Earlier this week, some were concerned about whether the ban would affect visas for temporary visits, but the administration says that there would not be restrictions on that type of travel for the new countries on the list.
"It would definitely become challenging and a concern if that ban took place," said Eh Tah Khu, co-executive director of the Karen Organization of Minnesota.
Hsa Moo Sheemo, a pastor at K'nyaw Baptist Church in St. Paul, had been concerned about whether relatives in Myanmar would be able to make it to his daughter's summer wedding in Minnesota.
"We should see if there's a way to do a better job of screening people. … [The new policy] is putting everybody in the same bucket whether or not they are causing the problem, so it's not a good thing," said Sheemo, who came here as a refugee and is now an American citizen.
Veena Iyer, executive director of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, denounced the ban for targeting African countries, on top of Somalia, which was a target of the first ban. And she noted that it would affect family members living abroad of significant numbers of refugees and immigrants who came here from Myanmar and Eritrea.
"This action will directly harm Minnesota communities," she said in a statement.
The executive order comes as the 2020 election heats up. Trump is expected to use his travel ban, as well as his efforts to cut refugee admissions, to rally his political base. Democrats condemned its expansion.
"The expansion of the administration's latest travel ban to add additional countries including Myanmar, where many families in our state are from, is wrong," said U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, in a statement.

Texto completo: Across the Twin Cities, nonprofits are boosting substance abuse treatment services specifically for women to meet a growing demand for help.
In south Minneapolis, the Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge bought a new 65,000-square-foot building to expand its programs and services for women. In Wayzata, the nonprofit the Retreat opened a new center for women last year as part of a $10 million project, designed for women with more gathering spaces for the community.
And across the state, the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation is launching a virtual services program this year to reach more people, especially women who face special barriers to treatment.
"We know there are as many female alcoholics as there are males, and yet there are twice as many beds in this country for men as there are for women," said Andrea Bruner, women's program coordinator at the Retreat in Wayzata. "So there are some difficulties for women in accessing treatment, and I think that this often results from their role in the family, especially if they're moms, and I think it also has to do with the kind of social stigma we continue to struggle with."
Experts say women have often waited longer to get mental health treatment since they are usually the primary caregivers in a family and also face a sometimes harsher stigma when seeking help.
"Drinking has become normalized for women … of all ages," Bruner said. "For women, there's a certain special shame in being an alcoholic woman."
The wine culture that pops up in popular TV shows and merchandise comes at a time when alcohol abuse is on the rise among women. Alcohol-related deaths among women increased 85% from 1999 to 2017, with more than 18,000 deaths in 2017, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, as reported in the New York Times. Meanwhile, the number of men who died from alcohol during that time rose 35%.
Tenth-grade girls are now as likely to drink as boys, according to the institute.
One challenge is that while women are physiologically less able to metabolize alcohol than men, many have little idea of how much wine is too much. Only 5 ounces of wine (slightly more than 1/2 cup) equals a shot of distilled spirits or 12 ounces of beer. Women are advised to have fewer than three drinks a day, according to the National Institutes of Health.
In Minnesota, more than 600 people died from excessive alcohol use in 2017, a number that's risen over the last two decades, according to the state Department of Health. And while men are more likely to die from alcohol-related causes, nearly half of alcohol-related deaths among Minnesotans who are 65 years and older in 2016 were women.
But more women are now seeking out help for addiction. As they do, service providers need to help reduce barriers such as child care, said Lydia Burr, the clinical director of outpatient services at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation in St. Paul. Burr said that she sees some women who struggle to either access or stay in residential treatment because they need to take care of their children. That's partly why the large nonprofit is starting virtual services this year with an outpatient program that will have video counseling and other services available from a person's home computer, eliminating the need for someone, especially in a rural area, to travel to get help.
"We're doing our part to reduce stigma around seeking help," Burr said. "There's no shame in having a health condition."
At the Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge, the nonprofit has seen a 77% increase in women seeking services in the last five years. In 2019, nearly 1,000 women went through its programs, an increase from about 550 women in 2015.
As a result, the nonprofit, which has buildings from Duluth to Rochester, is adding its 12th building, purchasing for $4.5 million a building near Lake Street and Interstate 35W in south Minneapolis from another nonprofit, Tubman.
The building will be renovated this summer and reopened in 2021 with apartments for up to 74 women, education rooms, a fitness area and salon, among other services. It will more than double the current space the nonprofit operates for women, who can stay up to a year in its residential programs.
"We're responding to the need," said Tim Walsh, vice president of long-term programs at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge.
Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge is also adding outpatient programs to all of its centers and developing sober homes.
In Wayzata, the Retreat also expanded the number of women it serves by adding 12 beds last year with its new National Center for Women's Recovery, a 25,000-square-foot wing of its campus. The center has a total of 32 beds and women's spaces -- from a chapel to fitness and yoga rooms.
Women typically stay at the Retreat -- which follows the Twelve Step recovery principles -- for 30 days, but more are choosing to stay longer, knowing that support may lead to long-term recovery, Bruner said.
"There is a beauty and dignity to this space that also supports the recovery experience," Bruner said. "It reflects back to them their own worth and value."

Resumen: Soon the questions surrounding Trump’s actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine’s leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The letter, written by Parnas’ lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Senate voted to bar new evidence in the impeachment trial Friday, paving the way for President Donald Trump’s acquittal even as several top Republicans acknowledged that his actions toward Ukraine were not appropriate.
Eleven days into the trial, the highly anticipated vote, which was decided 51-49, revealed the partisan divisions in the chamber over whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, a step Democrats argued was crucial to weighing whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals. Among Republicans, only Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah supported the resolution.
In declining to add to the case presented by House Democrats, the Senate delivered a victory for the White House that all but guaranteed that Trump will remain in office. With a final vote on the articles of impeachment set for Wednesday afternoon, Democrats argued that Trump’s expected acquittal will be illegitimate, an acknowledgment of their looming defeat.
"If (a) judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald Trump," said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, one of the House impeachment managers. "They will make the argument that you can adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the party without hearing from a single witness, without reviewing a single document. ... I would submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with."
Soon the questions surrounding Trump’s actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election.
House Democrats have promised to continue investigating Trump, and new, potentially damaging information could emerge as it has at times during the trial from an indicted former associate of Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and a forthcoming book by John Bolton, a former national security adviser.
But on Friday, Senate Republicans said they had finished weighing the matter and were ready to move on — though members offered varying and at times conflicting reasons for their impending votes to acquit.
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine’s leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached Trump in December on two counts — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York called the result of the trial "one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome."
"Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents," Schumer told reporters after the vote. "It is a tragedy on a very large scale."
As the Senate concluded its business for the weekend, Trump accused Democrats of "scamming America."
"The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting ‘fairness’, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress," he tweeted.
The Senate approved a resolution setting up closing arguments Monday. Senators will have an opportunity to give speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about how they plan to vote.
Postponing the final stage of the trial until next week will allow senators to have a full weekend and was a relief for many who have complained about long hours and uncomfortable conditions in the Senate chamber.
But extending the timetable into next week also means the trial will collide with two other major events on the political calendar — the Iowa caucuses Monday, in which four Democratic senators are competing, and Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Trump on Friday evening to brief him on the updated timetable, and the president signed off on it, according to an official familiar with the conversation.
Trump left for Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.
The impeachment managers’ effort to convince Republicans to support calling witnesses was confirmed as a failure earlier in the day when pivotal swing vote Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would oppose the motion.
In a sharply worded statement, Murkowski decried the impeachment process that started last fall in the House, while declining to weigh in on Trump’s actions.
"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate," Murkowski said. "I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed."
Murkowski could have provided the third vote for witnesses, which would have resulted in a 50-50 outcome. Democrats were pushing for Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, to weigh in at that point and permit witnesses or other evidence rather than let the motion fail on the tied vote. But he said Friday that he would not intervene.
"I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed," he told senators.
While Murkowski said her decision was based on her distaste for the process, other Republicans acknowledged to varying degrees that the president was culpable.
Among the Republicans who argued Trump’s behavior was wrong or problematic but not impeachable were Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rob Portman of Ohio, Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
Alexander told The Washington Post on Friday, after announcing the previous night that he would not support calling witnesses, that "there’s a difference between inappropriate conduct, which that clearly is, and treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. There’s a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct."
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Springfield said he had hoped Alexander would have a "Howard Baker moment," referring to the Tennessee Republican senator who played a key role in ending Richard Nixon’s presidency during Watergate and for whom Alexander was a protÃ©gÃ©.
"But it appears he will not," Durbin said.
Illinois’ other senator, Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Hoffman Estates, similarly bemoaned Republicans’ conduct, saying in a written statement that she wished they upheld their oaths to serve as impartial jurors "instead of helping the White House perpetrate a cover-up."
Republicans staked out their positions as new revelations from Bolton’s unpublished manuscript seemed to undercut key elements of Trump’s defense.
The New York Times reported Friday that Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that Trump told him in early May to call newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and ask him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the Bidens and a widely contested theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to undermine Trump during the 2016 election.
The directive to Bolton was reportedly given during a meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who has led Trump’s defense on the Senate floor. If true, it would represent the earliest reported example of Trump’s direct involvement in the pressure campaign against Ukraine.
Trump denied the report in a statement, saying the meeting "never happened."
But Schiff seized on it in making his argument for witnesses. "The facts will come out," he said.
Also citing Bolton’s manuscript, the Times reported Sunday that in a conversation with Bolton in August, Trump directly tied his hold on $391 million of military aid to investigations into Democrats.
New revelations have also come from Lev Parnas, the ex-Giuliani associate now facing campaign finance charges, who submitted a letter to McConnell on Friday offering to testify about his participation in an effort to oust former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and gather damaging information about the Bidens.
The letter, written by Parnas’ lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California.
Parnas had disclosed much of the information included in the letter in recent media interviews. His claims have been disputed by various Republican leaders, including Pence and Barr.
Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, who said earlier in the week that he believed Bolton, called the Senate trial "half a trial" if no witnesses are called.
"In my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism," Kelly said in an interview with N.J. Advance Media. "It’s a job only half done. You open yourself up forever as a Senate that shirks its responsibilities."

Resumen: Soon the questions surrounding Trump’s actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine’s leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The letter, written by Parnas’ lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Senate voted to bar new evidence in the impeachment trial Friday, paving the way for President Donald Trump’s acquittal even as several top Republicans acknowledged that his actions toward Ukraine were not appropriate.
Eleven days into the trial, the highly anticipated vote, which was decided 51-49, revealed the partisan divisions in the chamber over whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, a step Democrats argued was crucial to weighing whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals. Among Republicans, only Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah supported the resolution.
In declining to add to the case presented by House Democrats, the Senate delivered a victory for the White House that all but guaranteed that Trump will remain in office. With a final vote on the articles of impeachment set for Wednesday afternoon, Democrats argued that Trump’s expected acquittal will be illegitimate, an acknowledgment of their looming defeat.
"If (a) judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald Trump," said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, one of the House impeachment managers. "They will make the argument that you can adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the party without hearing from a single witness, without reviewing a single document. ... I would submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with."
Soon the questions surrounding Trump’s actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election.
House Democrats have promised to continue investigating Trump, and new, potentially damaging information could emerge as it has at times during the trial from an indicted former associate of Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and a forthcoming book by John Bolton, a former national security adviser.
But on Friday, Senate Republicans said they had finished weighing the matter and were ready to move on — though members offered varying and at times conflicting reasons for their impending votes to acquit.
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine’s leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached Trump in December on two counts — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York called the result of the trial "one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome."
"Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents," Schumer told reporters after the vote. "It is a tragedy on a very large scale."
As the Senate concluded its business for the weekend, Trump accused Democrats of "scamming America."
"The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting ‘fairness’, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress," he tweeted.
The Senate approved a resolution setting up closing arguments Monday. Senators will have an opportunity to give speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about how they plan to vote.
Postponing the final stage of the trial until next week will allow senators to have a full weekend and was a relief for many who have complained about long hours and uncomfortable conditions in the Senate chamber.
But extending the timetable into next week also means the trial will collide with two other major events on the political calendar — the Iowa caucuses Monday, in which four Democratic senators are competing, and Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Trump on Friday evening to brief him on the updated timetable, and the president signed off on it, according to an official familiar with the conversation.
Trump left for Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.
The impeachment managers’ effort to convince Republicans to support calling witnesses was confirmed as a failure earlier in the day when pivotal swing vote Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would oppose the motion.
In a sharply worded statement, Murkowski decried the impeachment process that started last fall in the House, while declining to weigh in on Trump’s actions.
"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate," Murkowski said. "I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed."
Murkowski could have provided the third vote for witnesses, which would have resulted in a 50-50 outcome. Democrats were pushing for Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, to weigh in at that point and permit witnesses or other evidence rather than let the motion fail on the tied vote. But he said Friday that he would not intervene.
"I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed," he told senators.
While Murkowski said her decision was based on her distaste for the process, other Republicans acknowledged to varying degrees that the president was culpable.
Among the Republicans who argued Trump’s behavior was wrong or problematic but not impeachable were Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rob Portman of Ohio, Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
Alexander told The Washington Post on Friday, after announcing the previous night that he would not support calling witnesses, that "there’s a difference between inappropriate conduct, which that clearly is, and treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. There’s a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct."
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Springfield said he had hoped Alexander would have a "Howard Baker moment," referring to the Tennessee Republican senator who played a key role in ending Richard Nixon’s presidency during Watergate and for whom Alexander was a protÃ©gÃ©.
"But it appears he will not," Durbin said.
Illinois’ other senator, Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Hoffman Estates, similarly bemoaned Republicans’ conduct, saying in a written statement that she wished they upheld their oaths to serve as impartial jurors "instead of helping the White House perpetrate a cover-up."
Republicans staked out their positions as new revelations from Bolton’s unpublished manuscript seemed to undercut key elements of Trump’s defense.
The New York Times reported Friday that Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that Trump told him in early May to call newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and ask him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the Bidens and a widely contested theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to undermine Trump during the 2016 election.
The directive to Bolton was reportedly given during a meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who has led Trump’s defense on the Senate floor. If true, it would represent the earliest reported example of Trump’s direct involvement in the pressure campaign against Ukraine.
Trump denied the report in a statement, saying the meeting "never happened."
But Schiff seized on it in making his argument for witnesses. "The facts will come out," he said.
Also citing Bolton’s manuscript, the Times reported Sunday that in a conversation with Bolton in August, Trump directly tied his hold on $391 million of military aid to investigations into Democrats.
New revelations have also come from Lev Parnas, the ex-Giuliani associate now facing campaign finance charges, who submitted a letter to McConnell on Friday offering to testify about his participation in an effort to oust former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and gather damaging information about the Bidens.
The letter, written by Parnas’ lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California.
Parnas had disclosed much of the information included in the letter in recent media interviews. His claims have been disputed by various Republican leaders, including Pence and Barr.
Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, who said earlier in the week that he believed Bolton, called the Senate trial "half a trial" if no witnesses are called.
"In my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism," Kelly said in an interview with N.J. Advance Media. "It’s a job only half done. You open yourself up forever as a Senate that shirks its responsibilities."

Texto completo: (Bloomberg) – President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial reached a critical day as the Senate rejected the idea of witnesses late Friday, all but ensuring his eventual acquittal. But senators considered pushing off final voting on his fate to next week.
The vote on allowing new witnesses was defeated 51-49 on a near party-line vote.
Here are the latest developments: No Agreement on Vote Timing, Schumer Says Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said there’s no agreement with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on when a final vote on the impeachment articles may be held.
"There is no agreement between leader McConnell and myself," Schumer told reporters. "We do not want this rushed through, we do not want this in the dark of night."
Schiff Cites Report on Cipollone in Meeting Top House manager Adam Schiff said an argument for witnesses is made by a New York Times article Friday about John Bolton’s upcoming book that names Trump’s lead lawyer, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, as having been present during an Oval Office meeting on Ukraine.
"There is a new fact which indicates that Mr. Cipollone was among those who were in the loop, yet another reason why we should hear from witnesses," Schiff said.
The Times said Bolton’s book describes an Oval Office meeting in early May in which the president directed Bolton to pave the way for Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to meet with Ukraine’s new president during Giuliani’s planned trip to that country to discuss the investigations sought by Trump.
The meeting was attended by Trump, Bolton, Giuliani, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Cipollone, the Times said.
"The facts will come out, they will continue to come out," Schiff said. "And the question before you today is whether they will come out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgment as to the guilt or innocence of the president."
Murkowski Will Vote Against Witnesses Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said she’ll vote against additional witnesses, almost certainly ending House prosecutors’ effort to introduce new evidence in Trump’s Senate trial and paving the way for an acquittal.
Murkowski was the last Republican considered a potential vote in favor of hearing from witnesses like former National Security Advisor John Bolton. With Murkowski’s announcement, the vote is expected to fall short of a majority, even if backed by all 47 Democrats and independents, as well as both Republicans who announced support, Mitt Romney and Susan Collins.
"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate," Murkowski said. "I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed."
Senate Nears Vote on Calling Witnesses The Senate opened Friday’s session that will lead to a pivotal vote on whether to call witnesses in Trump’s impeachment trial. Two Republicans, Susan Collins and Mitt Romney, say they will join Democrats in backing new witnesses and documents.
Top Court Sets Argument on Trump Records The U.S. Supreme Court set arguments for March 31 on Trump’s bid to keep his financial and tax records secret, a fight that will shape Democrats’ power to investigate the president after the impeachment fight ends.
Trump is challenging subpoenas from the House and a New York grand jury to his banks and accounting firms. He is asking the court to sharply limit Congress’s powers and give the president immunity from state criminal probes while in office.
The cases are separate from the Senate impeachment trial. The House panels say they are pursuing legislative goals, including updating ethics laws and trying to guard against foreign influence in the 2020 election.
A ruling is likely to come in late June, in the heat of the presidential campaign.
White House Says Trial Could Go to Next Week The Senate trial could stretch past Friday’s session and into next week because of Senate rules on debate, according to two senior White House officials.
Democrats have said they will push for senators to explain their votes in public, which could take hours. That process would be determined by a majority vote in the Senate.
Next week’s calendar is complicated because of Monday’s Iowa caucuses and Tuesday’s State of the Union address. Senate Republicans have been pushing to end the trial Friday, although it could extend into a Saturday session.
Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said he would gladly state the reasoning for his vote in public, and he would be okay with the trial continuing to next week, though he would rather it end today.
Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, said he doesn’t see the trial going into next week since the Democratic senators seeking their party’s 2020 nomination want to get to Iowa.
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, said it wouldn’t be in Democrats’ interest to let the trial’s conclusion slip to next week.
"I think it’s a mistake and it will blow up in their face," Graham said. "There’s no reason for it."
Democrats Push to Open Final Deliberations Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said Friday he plans to file a motion to make deliberations public after closing arguments, rather than held in a closed session. Brown declined to discuss the specifics of the measure, but it could amend Senate impeachment rules that allow senators to deliberate behind closed doors.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also said he wants each senator to be able to explain their final vote in public. Schumer said he would discuss with Democratic lawmakers at lunch about what other types of motions they would like to file."I believe the American people should hear what every senator thinks and why they’re voting the way they’re voting," he said.
Any change to Senate rules would require at least 51 votes, meaning that four Republicans would have to join all Democrats and independents in voting for such a motion. Giving each senator time to discuss their vote in public could extend the trial, possibly into next week.
Democrat Resigned to Acquittal, No Witnesses Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, a member of Democratic leadership, said his party is "resigned" to the Republican-led Senate acquitting Trump without calling any additional witnesses, a vote expected to happen on Friday.
"We are resigned to this happening," Durbin said. "It’s clear after all the days we spent on this: Republicans are afraid of a trial and afraid of the truth."
Durbin said he doesn’t think Chief Justice John Roberts would weigh in to break a tie on the vote to call witnesses.
If only three Republicans join all 47 Democrats and independents to call witnesses, then the vote would be 50-50 and fail to reach the simple majority needed to accept the motion.
Utah Republican Mitt Romney will vote in favor of seeking new evidence, according to a GOP aide. Maine Senator Susan Collins said Thursday she will vote for witnesses, but Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander said he will oppose the motion. The effort to call new witnesses could reach 50 votes if Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski supports it, but that would not be enough for the measure to pass -- unless Roberts steps in.

Resumen: Soon the questions surrounding Trump’s actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine’s leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The letter, written by Parnas’ lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, Sen.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Senate voted to bar new evidence in the impeachment trial Friday, paving the way for President Donald Trump’s acquittal even as several top Republicans acknowledged that his actions toward Ukraine were not appropriate.
Eleven days into the trial, the highly anticipated vote, which was decided 51-49, revealed the partisan divisions in the chamber over whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, a step Democrats argued was crucial to weighing whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals. Among Republicans, only Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah supported the resolution.
In declining to add to the case presented by House Democrats, the Senate delivered a victory for the White House that all but guaranteed that Trump will remain in office. With a final vote on the articles of impeachment set for Wednesday afternoon, Democrats argued that Trump’s expected acquittal will be illegitimate, an acknowledgment of their looming defeat.
"If (a) judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald Trump," said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, one of the House impeachment managers. "They will make the argument that you can adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the party without hearing from a single witness, without reviewing a single document. ... I would submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with."
Soon the questions surrounding Trump’s actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election.
House Democrats have promised to continue investigating Trump, and new, potentially damaging information could emerge as it has at times during the trial from an indicted former associate of Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and a forthcoming book by John Bolton, a former national security adviser.
But on Friday, Senate Republicans said they had finished weighing the matter and were ready to move on — though members offered varying and at times conflicting reasons for their impending votes to acquit.
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine’s leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached Trump in December on two counts — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York called the result of the trial "one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome."
"Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents," Schumer told reporters after the vote. "It is a tragedy on a very large scale."
As the Senate concluded its business for the weekend, Trump accused Democrats of "scamming America."
"The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting ‘fairness’, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress," he tweeted.
The Senate approved a resolution setting up closing arguments Monday. Senators will have an opportunity to give speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about how they plan to vote.
Postponing the final stage of the trial until next week will allow senators to have a full weekend and was a relief for many who have complained about long hours and uncomfortable conditions in the Senate chamber.
But extending the timetable into next week also means the trial will collide with two other major events on the political calendar — the Iowa caucuses Monday, in which four Democratic senators are competing, and Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Trump on Friday evening to brief him on the updated timetable, and the president signed off on it, according to an official familiar with the conversation.
Trump left for Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.
The impeachment managers’ effort to convince Republicans to support calling witnesses was confirmed as a failure earlier in the day when pivotal swing vote Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would oppose the motion.
In a sharply worded statement, Murkowski decried the impeachment process that started last fall in the House, while declining to weigh in on Trump’s actions.
"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate," Murkowski said. "I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed."
Murkowski could have provided the third vote for witnesses, which would have resulted in a 50-50 outcome. Democrats were pushing for Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, to weigh in at that point and permit witnesses or other evidence rather than let the motion fail on the tied vote. But he said Friday that he would not intervene.
"I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed," he told senators.
While Murkowski said her decision was based on her distaste for the process, other Republicans acknowledged to varying degrees that the president was culpable.
Among the Republicans who argued Trump’s behavior was wrong or problematic but not impeachable were Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rob Portman of Ohio, Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
Alexander told The Washington Post on Friday, after announcing the previous night that he would not support calling witnesses, that "there’s a difference between inappropriate conduct, which that clearly is, and treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. There’s a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct."
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Springfield said he had hoped Alexander would have a "Howard Baker moment," referring to the Tennessee Republican senator who played a key role in ending Richard Nixon’s presidency during Watergate and for whom Alexander was a protÃ©gÃ©.
"But it appears he will not," Durbin said.
Illinois’ other senator, Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Hoffman Estates, similarly bemoaned Republicans’ conduct, saying in a written statement that she wished they upheld their oaths to serve as impartial jurors "instead of helping the White House perpetrate a cover-up."
Republicans staked out their positions as new revelations from Bolton’s unpublished manuscript seemed to undercut key elements of Trump’s defense.
The New York Times reported Friday that Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that Trump told him in early May to call newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and ask him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the Bidens and a widely contested theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to undermine Trump during the 2016 election.
The directive to Bolton was reportedly given during a meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who has led Trump’s defense on the Senate floor. If true, it would represent the earliest reported example of Trump’s direct involvement in the pressure campaign against Ukraine.
Trump denied the report in a statement, saying the meeting "never happened."
But Schiff seized on it in making his argument for witnesses. "The facts will come out," he said.
Also citing Bolton’s manuscript, the Times reported Sunday that in a conversation with Bolton in August, Trump directly tied his hold on $391 million of military aid to investigations into Democrats.
New revelations have also come from Lev Parnas, the ex-Giuliani associate now facing campaign finance charges, who submitted a letter to McConnell on Friday offering to testify about his participation in an effort to oust former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and gather damaging information about the Bidens.
The letter, written by Parnas’ lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California.
Parnas had disclosed much of the information included in the letter in recent media interviews. His claims have been disputed by various Republican leaders, including Pence and Barr.
Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, who said earlier in the week that he believed Bolton, called the Senate trial "half a trial" if no witnesses are called.
"In my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism," Kelly said in an interview with N.J. Advance Media. "It’s a job only half done. You open yourself up forever as a Senate that shirks its responsibilities."

Texto completo: It doesn’t matter whether the impeachment trial of President Trump is already over or it drags on for months.
Two-thirds of the U.S. Senate is never going to find the president guilty of the House Democrats’ vague and bogus charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
Everyone’s always known that’s how it will end, even the deranged Democrats.
But Adam Schiff and his supporting cast still wasted several days of the country’s time in the Senate this past week declaring over and over that President Trump must be removed from office.
Among other hysterical things, they charged Trump is a threat to our national security, an archenemy of the Constitution and a corrupt dictator who intends to steal the 2020 election.
Democrats have proved for the last three years now that they can spot a new impeachable crime in every other presidential tweet or executive order.
But as Jay Sekulow of the Trump defense team warned the Senate on Tuesday, in their rage to take down Trump the House Democrats have made a serious mistake.
By drastically lowering the bar of impeachment, he said, Democrats have put the constitutional framework of our republic in “unimaginable” danger.
Sekulow also said he thought the impeachment of President Trump is not based on whether or not he exceeded his constitutional authority but is actually a political fight over “deep policy concerns” and “deep policy differences.”
There’s nothing new about wide policy differences between Congress and the White House and between the White House and the State Department.
One reason for that is because members of Congress and the employees of the State Department usually serve for 20 or 30 years while a president lasts eight years at most.
When a new president comes into office with his new policies - getting tough with the Soviets, expanding government health care, putting tougher economic sanctions on Iran - he often meets resistance from veteran congressmen and career bureaucrats in the state department who have their own long-held policy positions.
We saw exactly that kind of White House-State Department tension on display during the House impeachment hearings into President Trump’s Ukraine policy.
The hard anti-corruption policy the president wanted to pursue in Ukraine was criticized, resisted or subverted by state department officials who had been hired by previous presidents.
Making policy is a complicated process for any president. It’s like making sausage. It’s messy, has lots of ingredients and not pretty to watch being made.
It’s the piece of sausage - Obama’s Iran policy, for example, or Trump’s Ukraine policy - that counts in the end.
When my father had to make important decisions on national security and foreign policy matters he would have the National Security Council write up three different versions of what he could do.
The NSC - which is made up of the vice president, cabinet officials, military leaders and other top advisers - and my father would discuss all three options. Then my father would make his decision and the policy would go forward.
No one at the New York Times ever saw those other policy choices and the arguments that went on in those NSC meetings were never leaked to the media.
If transcripts of those meetings had fallen into the hands of today’s deranged Democrats, Adam Schiff would have impeached my father because he didn’t accept one of the other two choices.
Jay Sekulow was right to warn the Senate about the danger to our republic of lowering the bar of impeachment.
If we start impeaching presidents just because we don’t agree with their policies we’re never going to have another one who can get anything done.

If you base your political and social systems on the idea that the autonomous self-interested individual is the basic unit of society, then you will wind up with an individualistic culture that widens the maneuvering room between people but shreds the relationships and community between people.
You will wind up with a capitalism in which superstar performers get concentrated in superstar cities and everybody else gets left behind.
This is the flaw of unrestrained liberalism, what the radicals call “neoliberalism” or “late capitalism.”
And they are not entirely wrong.
Populists on the right and the left look at this current reality and they come to a swift conclusion: The game is rigged! Liberalism is a con!
Then they come to a different conclusion.
The essential logic of society is not actually individuals seeking their self-interest. It’s groups struggling for power.
On the Trumpian right it’s the coastal cultural elite trying to crush and delegitimize the white Christian patriots of the heartland. On the economic left it’s the Bernie Sanders class war. The greedy capitalist class rigs the system and immiserates the working class.
These are very different views of human nature, but they have something in common: Both narratives make us miserable! That’s because both of these political tendencies are wrong about human nature.
Human beings didn’t evolve into the world’s dominant species because we are more autonomous or more vicious in tooth and claw.
We thrived as a species because we are better at cooperation.
We evolved complex social networks in our brains to make us better at bonding, teaching and collaborating.
Thus, the best future for American politics is not based on individual competition or group war.
It’s based on this narrative: We are an incredibly diverse society that got good at collaboration because we had to. The best future politics puts collaborative pluralism, weaving, at the center.
That means, first, electing leaders who are masters at cooperation.
No offense, but if you’re supporting Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders this year, collaboration skills are not high on your list of priorities.
It means infusing cooperative weaver values into all of our organizations and reforming institutions so they encourage collaboration.
America has an enormous task of institutional reform ahead of it, just as it did in the Progressive era.
The final task of this kind of politics is transformative policies that directly address our most serious divides. For example, reparations are a way to acknowledge the wrongs inflicted on African-Americans and to begin to heal that breach.
The politics of weaving grows out of the acknowledgment that there is no dominant majority in America.
There is no moderate center.
Your group will never pulverize and eliminate your opposing group.
There’s no choice but to set up better collaborative systems across difference.
This is not a problem, it’s an adventure.
Yes, human beings are partly selfish and self-interested.
But we are also supremely social and collaborative.
This is the part we have to work on now.

Texto completo: Park City • A runaway bride, wildly rambunctious women and two quietly resolute girls — the Sundance Film Festival is one movie celebration where the so-called second sex consistently comes out on top. Now in its 36th year, the festival has long made room for female filmmakers even when there weren’t all that many. In 1985, its inaugural year, it presented 85 movies, 10 from female directors, about half non-Americans like Lina Wertmüller, one of the few such filmmakers on anyone’s radar back then. Of this year’s 128 features, nearly half are from women. (The festival ends Sunday.)
These numbers are impressive; the movies even more so. At some events, female filmmakers sometimes seem to have been invited simply to check a box, a practice that, however well-intentioned, inevitably suggests that women are second-class talent. This year’s Sundance, by contrast, underscores that when women receive real opportunities — serious money and institutional support — the pool of work expands, bringing new stories, styles and worldviews. For the 2020 edition, you didn’t need to dig to find female talent, make excuses for substandard work or politely yawn through another worthy endeavor. It was right on the screen, blissful and unbound.

In the case of the very different documentaries “Time” and “Saudi Runaway,” the desire to make movies isn’t simply about having a say — getting the chance to pick up a camera and share your vision with the world freely — it is also a matter of life itself. Each documentary centers on an extraordinarily gutsy woman who put her everyday existence on camera, detailing her days and nights in intimate, pointillist detail much like a diarist. Each woman subsequently handed over what she had shot to a female director, who then shaped the material, turning self-expression into collective vision.
One of the most critically admired titles at the festival, Garrett Bradley’s “Time” tells the story of Fox Rich, a Louisiana activist, family woman extraordinaire and impressively dedicated memoirist. (The movie is a coproduction of The New York Times.) Processed in black-and-white, it tracks Rich over her decade-plus efforts to support her six sons and find her sense of a whole self all while advocating for the release of her husband from a punishing 60-year prison sentence. Using both original material and a trove of vivid home videos that Rich shot herself, Bradley creates a portrait of a woman that exponentially expands into a complex chronicle of a marriage, a family, a community and finally a country.
“Saudi Runaway” is a starkly complementary story of incarceration, liberation and self-determination. Directed by Swiss-German filmmaker Susanne Regina Meures, “Runaway” is the nail-biting chronicle of a fearless young Saudi — known only as Muna — as she covertly plans to leave the country for good. Using a couple of smartphones, Muna clandestinely serves as her own dauntless cinematographer, shooting herself, her family and, in fugitive glimpses, the larger world. It’s a perilous activity given women’s traditionally subordinate status there, and transforms selfie-style narcissism into radical resistance. (The movie was shot before new rights were granted to women.) As her plans solidify, “Saudi Runaway” progressively resembles a thriller, one filled with harrowingly close calls and an exhilarating countdown.
The increased presence of women behind the camera at Sundance marks a crucial shift, given that not long ago the more celebrated women at the event were performers like Parker Posey and Lili Taylor (here playing a mom in the clichéd “The Evening Hour”). For years, women’s roles at this festival seemed best symbolized by the “Sundance It Girl,” a dubious honor that stretches at least back to Andie MacDowell, a star of “sex, lies, and videotape.” That’s the 1989 Steven Soderbergh game-changer that helped kick-start an era in indie cinema, one that often proved as sexist as Hollywood and just as blindingly white.
The number of African American female filmmakers in this year’s lineup offered further evidence of what seems to be a significant, perhaps lasting sea change. A perfect example, and a highlight of the U.S. dramatic competition, “The 40-Year-Old Version” hasn’t secured distribution but deserves the widest release possible. Written and directed by playwright Radha Blank — who also stars — it traces the rebirth of an artist with lacerating insight, a great deal of warmth and terrific comic timing. It was shot in black-and-white, a visual choice that nods to iconic New York films, most instructively from Woody Allen and Spike Lee. Here, Blank makes the city and its promise her own from the first scene to a last expressive burst of rapturous color.
The colors pop bright and hard in “Zola,” a kaleidoscopically hued, periodically discomforting, comically ribald adventure from Janicza Bravo (“Lemon”). Narrated by the title character (played by game newcomer Taylour Paige), the story unwinds in extended flashback, with Zola detailing an improbable, ridiculous, often funny and sometimes dangerous adventure involving another woman, Jessica (the reliably bold Riley Keough), a stripper with execrable judgment. Bravo skims the surface with impressive control and a great deal of visual wit and, every so often — as with a shot of a Confederate flag — gestures toward deeper, unrealized ideas. (The movie is based on an epic, rather more grim Twitter thread.)
A different odyssey is undertaken in Eliza Hittman’s “Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” which tracks a teenager, Autumn (Sidney Flanigan), who travels to New York City to obtain an abortion. With unforced realism, a minimum of music, spare dialogue and no histrionics, Hittman nicely sketches in Autumn’s home life — her mom dresses the kids and the dad both — but mostly concentrates on Autumn and her relationship with the cousin (Talia Ryder) who accompanies her. By refusing to grandstand, Hittman, who wrote and directed, has made the most moving, cleareyed American fiction movie about a woman’s right to abortion since “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” (1982).
Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering’s much-publicized documentary “On the Record” looks at several women — notably Drew Dixon, a music executive — who have accused the music giant Russell Simmons of sexual misconduct (allegations he denies). Much of the movie includes interviews, including with writers like Joan Morgan, who puts the personal into larger context. The women on camera make their case strongly; they also legitimize the documentary, which had come to the festival tainted by criticism from Oprah Winfrey, a former executive producer, who cut ties to it, citing creative differences. The filmmakers make some unfortunate choices, particularly in some staged scenes, but the movie belongs to these women, whose truth feels unassailable.
Time and again at the festival, you saw real diversity in both the snowy streets and in the theaters, where the American experience in all its complexity was being told and retold in movie after movie. Proof of that came in two of my favorite selections from the 2020 edition, the dramas “Minari” and “Farewell Amor.” To a degree, we have seen these stories before or at least think that we have: each turns on a hardworking family of ostensible outsiders trying to find their place in a not always welcoming country.
In “Minari” (written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung), the family is Korean American and moves from California to Arkansas to pursue the father’s dream of farming vegetables. In “Farewell Amor” (from writer-director Ekwa Msangi), an Angolan refugee brings his wife and daughter to America after a long, anguished separation, moving them into a crowded Brooklyn apartment. Each movie solicits well-earned tears and turns on a profound crisis that can only be solved when the family pulls together, unity that works as a welcome and, in its underlying optimism, deeply moving metaphor for life in what too often feels like the Disunited States of America.

George Soros: Mark Zuckerberg should not be in charge of Facebook

Texto completo: At a dinner last week in Davos, Switzerland, I was asked if I thought Facebook was behaving more responsibly today than it did during the 2016 presidential election.
“Not at all,” I answered. “Facebook helped Trump to get elected and I am afraid that it will do the same in 2020.” I explained that there is a longstanding law — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — that protects social media platforms from legal liability for defamation and similar claims. Facebook can post deliberately misleading or false statements by candidates for public office and others, and take no responsibility for them.
I went on to say that there appears to be “an informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebook” in which Facebook will help President Trump to get re-elected and Mr. Trump will, in turn, defend Facebook against attacks from regulators and the media.
“This is just plain wrong,” a Facebook spokesman told Business Insider.
I disagree. I believe that Mr. Trump and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realize that their interests are aligned — the president’s in winning elections, Mr. Zuckerberg’s in making money.
Let’s look at the evidence: In 2016, Facebook provided the Trump campaign with embedded staff who helped to optimize its advertising program. (Hillary Clinton’s campaign was also approached, but it declined to embed a Facebook team in her campaign’s operations.) Brad Parscale, the digital director of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and now his campaign manager for 2020, said that Facebook helped Mr. Trump and gave him the edge. This seems to have marked the beginning of a special relationship.
More recently, direct contact between the two men has raised serious questions. Mr. Zuckerberg met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Sept. 19, 2019. We don’t know what was said. But from an interview on the sidelines at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 22, we do know what Mr. Trump said about the meeting: Mr. Zuckerberg “told me that I’m No. 1 in the world in Facebook.” Mr. Trump apparently had no problem with Facebook’s decision not to fact-check political ads. “I’d rather have him just do whatever he is going to do,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zuckerberg. “He’s done a hell of a job, when you think of it.”
The president’s 2016 campaign mounted a robust data-centric communications effort and has continued to build on that program over the past few years, using Facebook as a key part of their strategy.
Facebook’s decision not to require fact-checking for political candidates’ advertising in 2020 has flung open the door for false, manipulated, extreme and incendiary statements. Such content is rewarded with prime placement and promotion if it meets Facebook-designed algorithmic standards for popularity and engagement.
What’s more, Facebook’s design tends to obscure the sources of inflammatory and false content, and fails to adequately punish those who spread false information. Nor does the company effectively warn those who are exposed to lies.
I expressed my fear that with Facebook’s help, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election. The recent hiring of a right-wing figure to help manage its news tab has reinforced those fears. In my comments in Davos, I also pointed out that Facebook has been used to cause worse damage in other countries than the United States. In Myanmar, for example, military personnel used Facebook to help incite the public against the Rohingya, who were targeted in a military assault of incredible cruelty including murder, rape and the burning of entire villages: Around 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. The International Court of Justice in The Hague is currently deliberating whether these atrocities qualify as genocide.
But within the last year, Facebook has introduced new features on its mobile app that actually intensify the fire of incendiary political attacks — making them easier and quicker to propagate. The system is cost-free to the poster and revenue-generating for Facebook. Good for Facebook, bad for democracy.
The responsible approach is self-evident. Facebook is a publisher not just a neutral moderator or “platform.” It should be held accountable for the content that appears on its site.
Speaking at a cocktail party in Davos on Jan. 22, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, repeated the worn Silicon Valley cliché that Facebook is trying to make the world a better place. But Facebook should be judged by what it does, not what it says.
I repeat and reaffirm my accusation against Facebook under the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. They follow only one guiding principle: maximize profits irrespective of the consequences. One way or another, they should not be left in control of Facebook.

Texto completo: Andy Gill, whose slashing, dissonant guitar playing in Gang of Four inspired waves of post-punk to come, died Saturday in London. He was 64.
The band announced his death on its website. A band spokesman said the cause was pneumonia.
Gang of Four’s music was stark and bristling, yet danceable. Reimagining punk, funk and reggae with analytical rigor, the band set telegraphic lyrics and shards of guitar noise against austerely propulsive beats and syncopated silences. Its brusque, angular style would directly or indirectly influence post-punk and indie-rock bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers (who chose Gill to produce their debut album), the Jesus Lizard, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Franz Ferdinand and Protomartyr. Michael Hutchence of INXS once said that Gang of Four’s music “took no prisoners,” adding, “It was art meets the devil via James Brown.”
Andrew James Dalrymple Gill was born on Jan. 1, 1956, in Manchester, England. He was an art student at Leeds University when he started Gang of Four with lead singer and main lyricist John King, bassist Dave Allen and drummer Hugo Burnham. (It was named, mockingly, after the Communist Party leaders who ruled China during its Cultural Revolution years.) He and King, friends from high school, had used travel grants to visit New York City’s burgeoning punk scene in 1976.
From the beginning, Gang of Four was determined to avoid all clichés, musical and verbal. “You could tell by listening to Gang of Four music that punk had happened. But it definitely wasn’t punk music,” Gill told online music magazine Perfect Sound Forever in a 2000 interview.
“Every part of it had to be radical. It was building musical tension in a precise way,” he told The New York Times in 2005. “It would be the juxtaposition of tight, fixed patterns that were very physically energizing and relentless, which would largely be supplied by the bass and drums, and the guitar, which would sometimes completely go along with that and sometimes not. If you took one of these elements out and made it ordinary, the whole thing would lose its authenticity.”
The band matched its caustic music to lyrics that confronted sociopolitical power structures as much as personal impulses. Its debut single, “Damaged Goods,” released in 1978, was an anti-romantic song about sex and consumerism; its debut album, “Entertainment!,” released the next year, included “At Home He’s a Tourist,” an anatomy of alienation, and “Not Great Men,” a ground-level theory of history. Onstage, King would often add to the band’s percussive attack by slamming pieces of scrap metal.
Gang of Four made an immediate impact in British and American punk circles. Its original lineup lasted for one more album, “Solid Gold,” and Gill and King went on to work with other musicians while Gang of Four’s music began adapting some pop elements. Its 1982 album, “Songs of the Free,” included “I Love a Man in a Uniform,” its closest approach to a pop hit, with backup choruses sung by the band’s bassist at the time, Sara Lee. In Britain, the song was banned from BBC playlists as the Falkland Islands war began.
Gill and King led Gang of Four on the 1983 album “Hard” before going their separate ways. Gill, who had shared production credits for Gang of Four, produced other acts, including Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1984, and released a solo EP, “Dispossession,” in 1987.
He and King regrouped to lead Gang of Four for two 1990s albums, “Mall” and “Shrinkwrapped,” before another hiatus, during which Gill returned to producing, including a 1997 EP by the Jesus Lizard, the Stranglers’ album “Written in Red” (1997), Michael Hutchence’s posthumously released 1999 solo album and the Futureheads’ debut album, released in 2004.
Gill, who lived in London, married Catherine Mayer, a journalist who leads the Women’s Equality Party in Britain, in 1999. She survives him, as does his brother, Martin Gill.
In 2004, Gang of Four’s original lineup regrouped, touring (including a performance at the 2005 Coachella festival) and releasing new recordings — on better equipment — of songs from its first albums. The full reunion didn’t last, but Gill and King made one more album together as Gang of Four, “Content,” in 2011 before King chose to give up touring. Gill continued to lead Gang of Four, with John Sterry on lead vocals.
The group released two albums, “What Happens Next” in 2015 and “Happy Now” in 2019, still making political statements, and toured until late 2019. The band wrote that Gill had been listening to mixes of an unfinished album while hospitalized.
Gill’s “final tour in November,” the band wrote in its statement, “was the only way he was ever really going to bow out: with a Stratocaster around his neck, screaming with feedback and deafening the front row.”

Texto completo: Potentially hazardous wiring inside Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jets is the latest flashpoint between U.S. and European regulators and a further complication in the grounded fleet's return to service, according to people familiar with the details.
Technical experts at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency want certain electrical wires relocated to reduce what they say are dangers from potential short circuits, which in a worst-case scenario could disrupt flight-control systems, according to these people.
In addition to the Federal Aviation Administration's ongoing safety review of proposed fixes to the MAX, the European agency is independently vetting such changes.
But engineers at the Chicago plane maker and high-ranking FAA managers, including the agency's top safety official, contend moving the wiring isn't necessary, one of these people said. Boeing hasn't yet submitted its formal recommendation, though the issue is headed for a decision in the next few weeks by FAA head Steve Dickson.
The disagreement over whether to take action on the wiring, which hasn't been reported before, has prompted the FAA to hold off scheduling a key certification flight for the MAX. It also highlights the emergence of a series of new technical challenges and delays confronting the Chicago plane maker as it strives to get the MAX back in the air world-wide. The planes have been grounded since last March, following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
The planes are expected to gradually start resuming commercial flights sometime in the summer, with major U.S. carriers having removed them from schedules until June.
On Saturday, the FAA released a statement saying Boeing recently informed the agency "about concerns associated with the location of wiring in certain areas of the MAX." Since then, according to the statement, "the FAA has closely monitored the company's analysis and how the issue might affect the ongoing certification efforts." The wiring concerns were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Reiterating earlier statements, the FAA said the MAX will be approved to carry passengers again "only after our safety experts are fully satisfied that all safety-related issues are addressed."
A Boeing spokesman said the company is cooperating with international regulators on a thorough certification process, "and we are working to perform the appropriate analysis." He said, "It would be premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes."
An EASA spokeswoman declined to comment.
The wires, which help control movable panels on the tail and power other systems, may be too close to each other in a dozen locations from the rear of the aircraft to the main electronics compartment beneath the cabin and behind the cockpit, according to the people familiar with the issue.
A short circuit, or "arcing" of electrical current between wires, could cause control problems for pilots that the FAA characterizes as hazardous or in some cases even catastrophic, according one of the people briefed on the details.
EASA and FAA technical experts, along with some other FAA officials responsible for certifying aircraft designs, have taken the position that safety rules require wiring modifications in such instances, this person said.
The relevant international rules relate to safety enhancements put in place more than a decade ago after an in-flight fire caused a Swissair jet to plunge into the water near Nova Scotia in 1998, killing all on board.
The current concerns about potential wiring problems stem from Boeing's analysis of how short circuits could cause problems with some flight-control systems, and how quickly pilots could react to those emergencies .
Since the two fatal crashes, safety regulators have been reassessing certain MAX flight-control systems, changing software, adjusting related computers and modifying pilot training.
Last month, industry and government officials revealed the latest software glitch , a problem that prevents the jet's flight-control computers from powering up and verifying they are ready for flight, and said Boeing was working to resolve it.
Addressing the wiring issues would pose tough logistical and financial hurdles. How the agency mandates fixes may depend on who owns the aircraft, according to another person familiar with the details. The FAA may require Boeing to fix wiring on approximately 400 undelivered aircraft now in storage at airfields dotting the Puget Sound area, this person said.
For planes previously delivered to carriers, the agency would likely perform a risk analysis to determine whether the wiring should be repaired either before the planes fly again or during routinely scheduled maintenance, this person added.
Relocating the wiring bundles would take roughly two weeks per plane, according to industry and government experts. Such fixes could be performed at the same time as software and training updates, depending on available manpower, to try to minimize additional delays.

Texto completo: On Wednesday, astronomers released what they said were the most detailed images ever taken of the surface of our sun.
As seen through the brand-new Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii, the sun looks like a boiling pot of popcorn, belying the notion of a bland yellow orb.
Seen from afar, stars are gentle twinkling harbingers of romance and of the mysterious secret order of the universe. Grist for campfire philosophizing and armchair astrobiology.
Up close it is a different story.
Here, 93 million miles from the nearest star - the one we call the sun - the creatures of Earth eke out a living on the edge of almost incomprehensible violence. Every second, thermonuclear reactions in the center of the sun turn 5 million tons of hydrogen into pure energy. That energy makes its way outward, through boiling gas pocked with magnetic storms that crackle, whirl and lash space with showers of electrical particles and radiation.
Space weather, these showers are called. On Earth it can shut down the power grid and render satellites blind. A recent study by scientists at the University of Warwick in England concluded that the sun’s most powerful “superstorms” occur about once every 25 years.
In outer space the sun’s stream can endanger astronauts. Next to weightlessness and boredom, the radiation hazards from space weather are considered the biggest obstacles to human travel to Mars and beyond.
Caught in striking detail, the sun’s face is divided into “kernels”: cell-like structures, each about the size of Texas, that carry heat from the inside of the sun to the outside. Hot gas rises in the bright centers of the cells, cools and then sinks back down in the dark lanes separating the cells.
The images were taken as part of the initial test, known as “first light,” of the Inouye telescope, which was built by the National Science Foundation atop Haleakala, an ancient cratered volcano, sacred to native Hawaiians, on the island. Haleakala means “house of the sun” in Hawaiian. What better place to build the world’s biggest telescope devoted to the sun?
The telescope was named for Daniel Inouye, the Hawaii senator who died in 2012 and is credited with helping build Hawaii into an astronomical powerhouse. The telescope has a primary mirror that is about 158 inches in diameter.
More than 7 miles of underground pipes are needed just to get rid of the solar heat the telescope collects, and to keep the instrument cool. The greater size of the mirror, abetted by adaptive optics that reduce atmospheric blurring, offers higher resolution - more detail of the pop, crackle and snap on the sun’s surface.
Somehow this process heats the solar gases from about 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit as they rise from the surface. In the corona that billows outward from the surface in streamers seen during solar eclipses, temperatures reach 1 million degrees. How does it happen?
Joining the Inouye telescope in this coronal detective work are NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, now orbiting the sun, and the joint NASA-European Space Agency Solar Orbiter, scheduled to be launched next week, in what amounts to a new coordinated effort to investigate our old shining friend.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa—As Iowa's leadoff caucuses approach, Democratic presidential hopefuls are vying for the nomination and President Trump is showing off his campaign muscle.
But for the Republicans seeking to wrest the GOP nomination from the incumbent, Iowa largely presents an opportunity to remind voters that they exist.
The Republican outcome in Iowa and beyond is considered a foregone conclusion, with the party firmly behind the president. Still, former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld are pitching themselves as alternatives to Mr. Trump, arguing that some voters may be receptive to another GOP approach.
"I believe in my bones that Donald Trump is unfit," said Mr. Walsh, 58, who served in Congress for one term. "And I thought it was really important that there was a Republican out there—a Republican—every day making that case. I knew it would be difficult."
It's been an uphill battle. A number of states have canceled their Republican primaries and caucuses this year, a move both parties have made when there is an incumbent president. State party operations are strongly behind Mr. Trump, and 91% of Republicans approve of his job performance, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
The challenge for GOP challengers was evident Friday night in Des Moines, as Mr. Walsh appeared at a community forum put on by urban groups. As he was questioned about issues like climate change, minimum wage and sentencing laws, there appeared to be few Republicans in the crowd.
At one point, Mr. Walsh jokingly said: "You probably won't caucus for me. It's great to be here."
Mr. Walsh acknowledged during his remarks that he had supported President Trump before turning on the president, saying, "If I could take that vote back, I would," and adding that any of the Democratic options would be "better in the White House." A former radio show host, Mr. Walsh has a history of controversial comments, including the false suggestion that President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Walsh has expressed regret for those remarks in a New York Times opinion piece.
While Mr. Walsh has made a number of trips to Iowa, Mr. Weld, 74, has put more attention on New Hampshire. Still, he was coming to Iowa on Saturday for his own campaign events, touting an endorsement from former Iowa Congressman Jim Leach, a Republican.
Calling his Iowa expectations "modest," Mr. Weld said he wants people "to understand that there is an alternative to the president to anybody who may not be totally bought in to everything."
Mr. Weld emphasized that he was pitching himself as an economic conservative with concerns about environmental protections. He said he disagreed with Mr. Trump's trade policies and stressed that he had concerns about the president's fitness for office.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh showed little concern about the president's intraparty foes.
"We spend zero time thinking about anything else other than beating whoever the Democratic opponent is," he said.
While the caucus results aren't in doubt, Mr. Trump is using the moment to unleash a show of campaign strength. He held a massive rally in Des Moines Thursday night and is sending roughly 80 surrogates to the state on caucus night, seeking to boost enthusiasm for Monday night, as well as build his organization for the general election.
Asked about the prospects for Mr. Walsh and Mr. Weld, Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann was blunt.
"They are not taking Iowa seriously and my expectation is that Iowans are not going to take them seriously," he said, adding that "even if they were spending time here, I don't know what case would be made."
Mr. Walsh and Mr. Weld, who are friendly with each other, both argued the party was controlled by the president. "The state party in every state is the Trump organization," Mr. Weld said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is blocking two dozen documents containing emails on President Donald Trump's involvement in the decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine, the government said in court filings.
Justice Department and Office of Management and Budget attorneys acknowledged in the late Friday night filings the existence of emails explaining the president's thinking about withholding about $400 million in Ukraine aid. Hours earlier, the Senate voted largely along party lines to not call witnesses in the impeachment trial. A final vote on whether or not to acquit Trump is expected Wednesday.
"Specifically, the documents . . . are emails that reflect communications by either the President, the Vice President, or the President’s immediate advisors regarding Presidential decision-making about the scope, duration, and purpose of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine," Heather Walsh, deputy general counsel for the Office of Management and Budget, wrote.
At the center of the impeachment case against Trump is whether he withheld the military aid last year in part to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations that would help Trump in his 2020 reelection bid.
Congress had appropriated $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine to be administered by the Defense and State departments. Last June, the Defense Department announced it is providing $250 million of the aid. But the agency and the Office of Management and Budget later "received inquiries" from the president about the funds, the House said in its impeachment report.
In early July, the Office of Management and Budget announced the funds are being withheld at Trump's direction, according to the report. No reason was provided. In a call with Zelensky days later, Trump asked the Ukrainian president "to do us a favor" by investigating Burisma, a Ukraine energy company, and Hunter Biden, a member of its board and son of Democratic presidential front runner Joe Biden.
The aid was released in September. A whistle blower filed a complaint to Congress a month earlier detailing concerns about the July phone call and the withholding of the aid.
William Taylor, the former top diplomat in Ukraine, testified in October that the White House dangled the military aid and a meeting with Trump to pressure Zelensky to open investigations into Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
Former national security adviser John Bolton wrote in his upcoming book that Trump had explicitly told him he wanted to withhold the aid until Ukrainian officials turned over documents related to the 2016 election and Joe Biden, according to a New York Times report that cited people who had seen the manuscript.
The Friday filings were in response to a lawsuit filed by the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity, which is seeking records, including memos and emails, concerning military aid to Ukraine. Walsh, the Office of Management and Budget attorney, explained that the agency is not disclosing dozens of documents that are considered privileged.
Among them are 24 redacted documents containing emails that are considered presidential communications, Walsh said.
"The withheld information consists of either the status of an ongoing decision-making process involving the President, information that was solicited and received by the President as part of his official duties, or information that was solicited and received by the President’s immediate [advisers]," Walsh wrote.
The government's lawyers have asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, saying they have fulfilled the center's requests for documents.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , denounced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , for the Senate vote that rejected witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
"It is a sad day for America to see Senator McConnell humiliate the Chief Justice of the United States into presiding over a vote which rejected our nation’s judicial norms, precedents and institutions which uphold the Constitution and the rule of law," Pelosi said Saturday on Twitter.
The Republican-controlled Senate on Friday voted down the motion to hear from witnesses, including Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, by a 51-49 vote. Just two Republicans, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, joined Democrats in their votes for witnesses. The Senate vote made this the first presidential impeachment trial not to hear from witnesses.
What comes next: Senators will vote next week to acquit or convict Trump
Democrats were pushing for enough Republican senators to tip the vote in favor of calling witnesses such as Bolton, who was expected to give testimony contradicting Trump's defense. The New York Times reported that Bolton wrote in his forthcoming book that Trump told him nearly $400 million in withheld military aid was tied to Ukraine pursuing investigations into Trump's political rivals.
Bombshell book: What we know about John Bolton's allegations about Trump and Ukraine
Republicans and Trump's impeachment defense team argued that it was not up to the Senate to call additional witnesses, and that the Democrats leading the House impeachment inquiry could have pursued subpoenas of witnesses they wanted through the courts.
Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was considered a potential swing vote on witnesses until she announced Friday she was a "no. " She also indicated she had Roberts on her mind, saying she would “not stand for or support” efforts to “drag the Supreme Court into the fray. ”
Who is John Bolton?: The former national security adviser is now a focus in Trump's impeachment trial
Contrary to claims by Trump and some Republican allies, House Democrats did seek testimony from Bolton, but he declined to appear for his deposition under White House orders. The House did not issue a subpoena because, Democrats said, it would only prolong the process. Since then, Bolton has said he would be willing to testify in the Senate.
Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. , a vocal Trump supporter, accused Democrats of attacking "the legitimacy & credibility of everything in sight: the 2020 election, the Judiciary, & more. "
"First Sen. Warren, & now Speaker Pelosi question the legitimacy of Chief Justice Roberts & the Judicial Branch," Biggs tweeted.
He was referring to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , who submitted a question during the trial pointed at Roberts and his role in the process.
“At a time where large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus far refused witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, Supreme Court of the United States and Constitution?” Warren's question read.
‘He shouldn’t have done it’: GOP senator who scolded Trump on Ukraine explains why he backs acquittal
Throughout the trial, it was unclear whether Roberts could or would play a deciding role in the attempt to have witnesses appear. He said Friday he felt it would be "inappropriate" to break a tied vote.
As it turned out, Roberts was able to keep out of the middle of a drawn-out tug of war. Republicans had the votes to reject witnesses, opening the door to a final vote on whether to convict or acquit Trump on Wednesday.

Texto completo: Famed Nike track coach Alberto Salazar, already banned from the sport for doping violations, on Friday was temporarily suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport pending an investigation of allegations of misconduct, according to the center's centralized disciplinary database .
The exact nature of the allegations couldn't be determined. Neither Salazar nor SafeSport immediately replied to requests for comment.
USA Track & Field, the sport's governing body, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
SafeSport implements temporary measures when the center believes they are necessary to protect sport community or athletes, according to information on its website.
In September, Salazar was handed a four-year ban by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct. He is appealing the decision. Salazar oversaw the elite running team the Nike Oregon Project until Nike disbanded it shortly after the suspension .
In the wake of Salazar's doping suspension, several women who ran for the Nike Oregon Project said coaches pressured them to lose weight, sometimes with harmful health consequences, and publicly shamed them about it.
Amy Yoder Begley, a former middle-distance runner with the group, tweeted that she was told she was too fat and "had the biggest butt on the starting line."
Mary Cain, a young prodigy who trained under Salazar, said in a New York Times video in November that she had been "emotionally and physically abused" by a system designed by Salazar. She said she was pressured to lose weight and stopped menstruating for three years.
In previous statements, Salazar has said he had frank discussions with male and female runners about the impact of weight on performance, but disputed that he encouraged female athletes to maintain an unhealthy weight, and denied that any athlete suffered abuse or gender discrimination while running for the Oregon Project.
While SafeSport is best known for investigating allegations of sexual harassment and abuse, athletes including Cain increasingly have spoken about the need to police other harmful forms of behavior, particularly in coaching.
Cain told Sports Illustrated in November that it was "unfortunate that we can seemingly only take full action in terms of banning people when it comes to doping violations. And of course programs like SafeSport have created more of a platform to enforce abuses in sports and make sure young athletes are in a more appropriate environment.
"But the truth is, until my story broke, I didn't even know that they were a platform that I could go to outside of sexual abuses. So anything that was emotional or psychological, I've since started to get in contact and get the ball rolling. But I think it's important to kind of enforce the knowledge that there can be action taken even when it's not almost as egregious as sexual abuse and/or doping incidents."
Cain couldn't be reached for comment.

Texto completo: DES MOINES — Democratic presidential campaigns are trying an old strategy to gather new supporters. But no one is admitting it's actually working.
Candidates and officials from Democratic presidential campaigns have told reporters in Iowa that rivals' campaign officials have reached out about forming a caucus night alliance, in where supporters of one candidate would switch to another if their first choice didn't get enough votes to move on to second round voting.
Andrew Yang said in a Bloomberg News roundtable that he had been contacted by other candidates about making a caucus night alliance, but that he did not plan to make a deal.
U. S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has not confirmed whether other campaigns have approached her, as the New York Times reported Tuesday, but she told Radio Iowa that the idea does not interest her.
Making caucus night alliances is common practice for presidential campaigns, according to former U. S. Rep. Dave Nagle, a longtime Iowa Democrat. In fact, he said front runners should try to make alliances and recommended former Vice President Joe Biden, U. S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren's campaigns do it.
"Biden and Sanders, too, and Warren, should all be reaching out to the ones that we know going in will probably not be viable," Nagle said. "And that would be (Tom) Steyer and Yang. "
If supporters of Yang, Klobuchar and Steyer, who have not polled above the 15% in the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll all year, moved en masse to another candidate in second-round voting, it could push that new candidate into serious contention.
An alliance between two weaker candidates could help them both on caucus night. If two candidates with 8 or 9% support each combined forces, one of them could become viable in a precinct. Done strategically, both candidates could pick up delegates across the state.
How would it work?
Candidates must attract at least 15% of the crowd at a caucus site to be declared viable. If, after the first alignment, a candidate is not viable, their supporters must pull more people into the group or re-align with a second choice candidate.
But if the non-viable candidate's crowd moved to back another campaign, that process changes a bit. A campaign representative for the non-viable candidate would encourage supporters to choose the ally, rather than scatter among other viable groups.
Former U. S. Sen. John Edwards and U. S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich tried the strategy in 2004. The Democratic candidates announced in January that, if one of them were not viable in a precinct, their supporters should caucus for the other.
Edwards came in second place on caucus night. Kucinich came in fifth, with just 1% support in the state.
But by announcing the alliance publicly, rivals seized on the strategy as a sign of weakness. A spokeswoman for former Gov. Howard Dean's campaign told CNN in 2004, "We are planning on being viable in all the precincts. We have no strategy to coordinate with another campaign. "
Today, rather than a candidate announcing such a strategy, precinct captains from the campaigns would direct voters on caucus night to go toward a certain second choice.
"That's why the candidates need as many precinct captains in as many of the precincts as they can, who can speak and address (supporters) and do that manipulation," Nagle said. "That comes back to organization. "
Does it work?
Even a perfectly planned caucus alliance faces a major challenge: The will of the people.
Paul MacGregor is going into Caucus Day with a short list. The 71-year-old retired physician is trying to choose between former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Steyer.
MacGregor said if his first choice for president isn’t viable in the first alignment, he would be open to hearing suggestions from staffers of his initial preferred candidate — but only to a point.
“Ultimately, I’m an adult. I make my own decision,” the Mason City resident said. “I wouldn’t blindly go against my second choice just because a campaign asked me to. ”
MacGregor also doesn’t think other Iowans will be persuaded on this kind of alliance strategy, either. He noted some Iowans have spent months vetting candidates, and they’ve put a lot of thought into second choices.
“I don’t know how powerful that would be, that a campaign asked you to switch,” he said.
Patrick Pope, a 46-year-old Biden supporter in Council Bluffs, Iowa, said he might be persuaded to go along with another campaign, but he wouldn't caucus for just anybody.
"I think it would depend on who they were telling me to go to," the education administrator said. "I have some problems with Buttigieg, so I don't know if I would go over to Mayor Pete's room, if that's what they were directing me to do. But I would have no problems with Warren or Bernie. "

Democrats Play Game of Expectations Ahead of Iowa Vote; For lower-polling candidates, a surprisingly strong finish in the state's caucuses can fuel momentum heading into New Hampshire

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa—In hotel bars, at campaign events and on television screens across this state, it is peak season for the expectations game.
Iowa voters will finally speak Monday at their caucuses that open the Democratic presidential nominating process. Until then, however, the campaigns are working hard to manage expectations for how well they need to perform to claim success.
The campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have been emphasizing that Iowa is only the first in a series of states to hold nominating contests. Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign says it will be tracking metrics beyond the delegate number traditionally used to determine who wins the caucuses.
For lower-polling candidates, a surprisingly strong finish can generate momentum heading into New Hampshire, where the first primary takes place eight days later. For the top tier, a weaker-than-anticipated showing could be a serious blow.
Finishing in the top three in Iowa has traditionally been considered a ticket to move on to the next contest. But in this year's crowded and closely bunched field, the metrics of success may well be messier.
Recent polls in Iowa have shown the lead changing between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden. Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., each led in the state earlier in the campaign. A new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, considered the gold standard in the state, is due Saturday night.
For Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a fourth-place finish could be credibly sold as an impressive late surge. Even as a neighbor to the north who has invested heavily here, she has mostly been polling in fifth place in Iowa.
Mr. Buttigieg would give his campaign a major boost if he manages to surpass Mr. Biden. The two men are competing in the party's centrist lane, and Mr. Buttigieg has recently begun to more directly engage Mr. Biden .
This Year's Iowa Caucuses Are Different. Here's How They'll Work.
Mr. Sanders could bolster his standing by beating Ms. Warren. Both have tried to consolidate support among liberal voters, but Mr. Sanders appears to be having more success .
Ms. Warren has recently sought to play down Iowa's importance. She released a memo last week that suggested the Democratic race was unlikely to be decided by the first four states on the calendar and that she had done extensive hiring in those that will vote in March.
Mr. Biden's team has also sought to temper Iowa expectations.
"We've always viewed the second two states as equally important to the first two," said Mr. Biden's campaign adviser Anita Dunn, referring to February contests in Nevada and South Carolina. "That is how we view this, which is, Iowa is the beginning of the process, it's not the end of the process."
Complicating things, for the first time the Iowa Democratic Party will release three sets of results. State and national officials say the traditional share of delegates won is the proper measurement of success. But the raw counts from the two rounds of voting that will be held will offer the campaigns additional metrics to tout.
Mr. Sanders has sought to drive up voter turnou t by appealing to people who typically caucus at lower rates, including college students and Latinos. His advisers have said the raw vote totals will serve as the true barometer of success and an indicator of which candidate can mobilize the party's electorate.
The jockeying for support in the final days is intense in Iowa because many caucus-goers are known to deliberate on their decisions until the end.
"I've never seen this much indecision," said David Nagle, a former Democratic congressman from Iowa who once served as his party's state chairman.
Bill Badie, an independent from Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, said that, after seeing Mr. Biden Wednesday at an event in Sioux City, he remained undecided among the former vice president, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg.
"To be honest, I'm trying to decide between my head and my heart and my knowledge," said Mr. Badie, who works for the local railroad. "There have been years when I've voted my head, years when I've voted my heart. This year, it's gotta be who can win."
Several Klobuchar supporters interviewed at one of her events earlier this week said they were contemplating the need to have a second choice ready, in case she didn't meet the 15% threshold required to be viable in their precincts.
"I think it's possible she won't be viable," said Barb Hall, a 61-year-old project manager for an advertising agency who lives in Des Moines. "I'm with Biden then."
A poll in Iowa released this week by the New York Times and Siena College showed that when Ms. Klobuchar's backers were asked whom they would support if they were left with only four choices—Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren—the former vice president was the favorite among 55%.
That makes sense to former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. "It's not surprising to me that people would be looking at her and then looking at Joe because much of what they talk about is a practical approach to governing," he said.

Some Biden advisors floated the idea of a deal that would have Ms. Klobuchar encourage her supporters to back Mr. Biden if she didn't meet the viability benchmark in their precincts, though no such agreement had been reached, according to people familiar with the situation.
Ms. Klobuchar's campaign manager told reporters this week at an event hosted by Bloomberg News that he expected his candidate to be viable. "We have no plans to cut any deals with anybody," said Justin Buoen.

Texto completo: Senate impeachment trial

WASHINGTON -- The Senate rejected the idea of summoning witnesses for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial late Friday, all but ensuring his acquittal. But senators considered pushing off final voting on his fate to next week.

The vote on allowing new witnesses was defeated 51-49 on a near party-line vote.

Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah voted along with the Democrats for witnesses, but that was not enough.

Despite the Democrats singular focus on hearing new testimony, the Republican majority brushed past those demands to make this the first Senate impeachment trial without witnesses. Even new revelations Friday from former national security adviser John Bolton did not sway GOP senators, who said they'd heard enough.

That means the eventual outcome for Trump would be an acquittal "in name only," said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a House prosecutor, during final debate. Some called it a cover-up.

The impeachment of the president now lands squarely in an election year before a divided nation. Caucus voting begins Monday in Iowa, and Trump gives his State of the Union address the next night.

Trump was impeached by the House last month on charges the he abused power and obstructed Congress like no other president has done as he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and then blocked the congressional probe of his actions.

The Democrats had badly wanted testimony from John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser whose forthcoming book links Trump directly to the charges. But Bolton won't be summoned, and none of this appeared to affect the trial's expected outcome.

In an unpublished manuscript, Bolton writes that the president asked him during an Oval Office meeting in early May to bolster his effort to get Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to a person who read the passage and told The Associated Press. The person, who was not authorized to disclose contents of the book, spoke only on condition of anonymity.

In the meeting, Bolton said the president asked him to call new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and persuade him to meet with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was planning to go to Ukraine to coax the Ukrainians to investigate the president's political rivals. Bolton writes that he never made the call to Zelenskiy after the meeting, which included acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.

The revelation adds more detail to allegations of when and how Trump first sought to influence Ukraine to aid investigations of his rivals that are central to the abuse of power charge in the first article of impeachment.

The story was first reported Friday by The New York Times.

Trump issued a quick denial.

"I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelenskiy," Trump said. "That meeting never happened."

Key Republican senators said even if Trump committed the offenses as charged by the House, they are not impeachable and the partisan proceedings must end.

"I didn't need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing," retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a key hold out, told reporters Friday at the Capitol. "But that didn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense."

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she, too, would oppose more testimony in the charged partisan atmosphere, having "come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.'' She said, "The Congress has failed."

Eager for a conclusion, Trump's allies nevertheless suggesting the shift in timing to extend the proceedings into next week and it shows the significance of the moment for senators in casting votes in only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.

The situation remained fluid, but senators have indicated they want more time to publicly debate the charges and air their positions on the coming vote, according to a Republican familiar with the proposal but unauthorized to discuss it. The person was granted anonymity.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made the offer to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the person said. Senators were considering it while the proceedings were underway on the Senate floor. Schumer had not yet agreed to it.

Under the proposal, the Senate would resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting would be Wednesday.

To bring the trial toward a conclusion, Trump's attorneys argued the House had already heard from 17 witnesses and presented its 28,578-page report to the Senate. They warned against prolonging it even further after House impeached Trump largely along party lines after less than thee months of formal proceedings making it the quickest, most partisan presidential impeachment in U.S. history.

Some senators pointed to the importance of the moment.

"What do you want your place in history to be?" asked one of the House managers, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger.

Trump is almost assured of eventual acquittal with the Senate nowhere near the 67 votes needed for conviction and removal.

To hear more witnesses, it would have taken four Republicans to break with the 53-seat majority and join with all Democrats in demanding more testimony. But that effort fell short.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in the rare role presiding over the impeachment trial, could break a tie, but that seems unlikely.

Murkowski noted in announcing her decision that she did not want to drag the chief justice into the partisan fray.

Protesters stood outside the Capitol as senators arrived on Friday, bu few visitors have been watching from the Senate galleries.

Bolton's forthcoming book contends he personally heard Trump say he wanted military aid withheld from Ukraine until it agreed to investigate the Bidens. Trump denies saying such a thing.

The White House has blocked its officials from testifying in the proceedings and objected that there are "significant amounts of classified information" in Bolton's manuscript. Bolton resigned last September -- Trump says he was fired -- and he and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.

Texto completo: We've been watching old episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter" on Justice Network. Beth, his wife, was so pretty. Let us know about her death. And is Dog ill now?

Beth Chapman, the wife of Duane "Dog" Chapman, died in June 2019 after a recurrence of throat cancer. Her final days were chronicled on the series "Dog's Most Wanted." A mid-January profile of Chapman in the New York Times said that after Beth's death Dog suffered a pulmonary embolism. Since then he has worked at losing weight and cutting back his smoking. "But sunblock and quitting tanning salons aren't happening," the Times said of the man with "beet-red tanned skin." He still has trouble sleeping and eating well and he has gout. But the Times reported that Chapman has plans for another TV show and wants to write a book about Beth. As for the scandal around his use of a racial slur, he is still apologizing for it, telling the Times that "I was wrong."

I know the actress Bridget Hanley played a role in the TV series "Here Come the Brides" in the late 1960s. I'm wondering what other TV shows she was in.

For those of you tuning in late, "Here Come the Brides" aired on ABC in 1968-70 and was inspired by the movie "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." In the series, the operator of a logging camp arranged for 100 women to come to Seattle so the men there would keep working. The cast was noteworthy for a couple of rising stars, David Soul and Bobby Sherman. Hanley played Candy Pruitt, the "straw boss" of the women according to "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable Shows." Before that show, she had been a regular on "The Second Hundred Years," a 1967-68 comedy about a prospector (Monte Markham) who thawed out after being frozen since 1900. She would be back in a series a decade later, co-starring with Barbara Eden in "Harper Valley P.T.A.," a comedy inspired by Jeannie C. Riley's hit song of the same name. She also guest-starred on an abundance of comedies and dramas according to the Internet Movie Database, up to 1996, as well as working in theater.

Resumen: Actor/producer Ryan Reynolds wants to sell the concept of cheap $15 monthly wireless monthly plans, saying there's little reason to spend hundreds.

Texto completo: A year ago, a small wireless startup from Costa Mesa, California, seeking to grow its business, spent $5 million to introduce itself to the world on the 2019 Super Bowl game with a 30-second ad.
The pitch: a super low-cost alternative to the hundred dollar plus wireless packages from Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint. Instead, full service starting at $15 monthly. The catch: Less data is available, but it's cheap.
So cut to a year later, and MintMobile isn't returning to the Super Bowl, which kicks off Sunday with a host of broadcast and streaming options to watch. And the firm has a new "owner" in actor Ryan Reynolds, best known for movies like "Deadpool" and "The Proposal. "
Reynolds this year is pitching a new deal – three months of free service, but only if you sign up during a certain time period. Like during the game itself.
The actor, in a full-page ad that ran in the New York Times this week, explained why he's ditching spending another $5 million to be on the Bowl.
Instead of spending $5 million, "we could literally give away over 300,000 months of free service and still save money. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do. ”
Hype about the largest audiences in TV land (the Super Bowl averaged nearly 100 million viewers in 2019) brings out companies appealing to that most basic consumer desire – to save money. This week, another wireless firm, TextNow, announced plans for a totally free phone service, with a catch. Unlimited calls and texts, with ads, but no web surfing unless you're willing to pay a minimum of $9. 99 monthly.
Which is less than Mint's starter price of $15.
David Glickman, the founder and CEO of Mint, says the $5 million spent for last year's ad was worth it. "It paid for itself economically. It brought us so many new customers and the halo of being a Super Bowl advertiser carried through to new partnerships. "
Like an alliance with Reynolds, who Glickman says is a "majority owner," sharing shares with Glickman himself. (He declined to reveal how much Reynolds paid for his stake. )
Reynolds tells USA TODAY that he hooked up with Mint through founder David Glickman, whom he knew from their work together at the Michael J. Fox foundation charity. Glickman, the actor recalls, "was relentless in asking me to try Mint Mobile and like most people, I thought, “How can cell service so inexpensive be any good?”
He relented, gave it a shot, liked it, and then "it kind of got in my head of how unusual it would be for a celebrity to buy a telecom company and how much I liked the mission of making cell service more affordable on a mass scale and to use celebrity to elevate something so pragmatic. "
Reynolds, who replied to questions from USA TODAY via e-mail from the set of his new Netflix film, "Red Notice," currently in production, says he's very involved in the firm, "especially in business strategy and marketing. "
Beyond acting, Reynolds also has a production company, Maximum Effort and owns a gin company, Aviation Gin, as well.
"We create movies, TV shows, marketing content and have bet big on gin cocktails and now cell service," he says. "These things seem pretty disparate, but when done very well, they are all highly collective experiences that can bring people together in a world that seems to generate more and more ways to drive us apart. "
Glickman says Reynolds gives the brand visibility to an audience "we couldn’t reach before. " (The actor has a combined 50 million-plus followers on Twitter and Instagram, compared to just over 40,000 for Mint Mobile. ) The Mint motto is that with an unlimited data plan, we pay for service we don't use or need. Even for an actor like Reynolds, who Glickman says is surrounded by Wi-Fi.
"It's at home, school, restaurants. There's just not a huge need to have wireless data everywhere," he says.
Mint's rates are $45 for the first 3 months of service, and if you're ready to commit to a full year afterward, you can lock in the $15 rate, or pay $20 monthly for a six-month commitment.
Or, of course, if you respond to the promo on Sunday, during the game, the first three months are free.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos, already the world's richest man, just got even richer. After announcing earnings, Amazon CEO Bezos saw his shares improve by $13 billion. Additionally, Amazon announced a new milestone. The company now has 150 million members of the Amazon Prime program.
Ginni Rometty, the first female CEO of IBM, said she's stepping down. The move is effective in April.
Facebook introduced a new tool to show how you're being tracked online.
In the end, Roku and Fox made nice, and viewers will be able to see the Super Bowl in Ultra High Definition 4K on the Roku streaming player after all. Thursday, Roku pulled Fox smart TV apps from its channel store over licensing issues. By Friday night, they had returned.

Fact-checking Amy Klobuchar remarks in Iowa

Texto completo: WATERLOO, Iowa — Despite polling below the top tier of Iowa caucus hopefuls, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., drew a near-capacity crowd to a ballroom where she described her vision for a post-Donald Trump presidency.
PolitiFact is traveling through Iowa to fact-check Democratic caucus candidates. Klobuchar joked at times about PolitiFact being present for the event in Waterloo, which is about an hour north of Cedar Rapids .
At one point, she echoed a line attributed (wrongly) to then Alaska-Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008, saying that as a Minnesota resident, “I can see Canada from my porch.”
Klobuchar quickly referenced PolitiFact staff in attendance and emphasized with mock exasperation, “It’s just a metaphor!”
“This president was given $413 million over the course of his career from his dad.”
This claim is shaky on the details. Trump’s finances remain a mystery to outsiders, and neither Trump’s lawyers nor investigative journalists have said irrefutably how much he is worth or how he made his money. The $413 million Klobuchar cited comes from a New York Times investigation that looked back decades and relied on thousands of documents and many interviews.
“Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day,” the New York Times concluded.
The article talks about how much the dollars would be worth today, not how much Trump got from his father at any one time. Trump has said his father loaned him $1 million, which he repaid with interest.
However, the Times found that when Trump was just 3 years old, his father set up an account in his name and regularly added thousands of dollars to it. In today’s dollars, Trump was a millionaire by the time he was 8.
A National Journal financial journalist estimated that Trump’s wealth shot up $40 million when he took over his father’s real estate business in 1974. Ultimately, only Trump and his accountants know the full details.
Before she was elected to Congress, the pharmaceutical industry got a provision “in the law that says that Medicare can’t negotiate for better prices” on drugs.
This is correct.
Medicare Part D is a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare proposed by Republican President George W. Bush. It became law in 2003 and has been in place since 2006, the year Klobuchar entered the Senate.
Under the law, insurance plans can negotiate prices with drug makers, but the government cannot. President Barack Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices, but then backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his Affordable Care Act, earning a Promise Broken on PolitiFact’s Obameter campaign pledge tracker.
“The Affordable Care Act is now nearly 10 points more popular than the president of the United States.”
Klobuchar is basically accurate. The word “nearly” is key.
In the most recent Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, 52% of adults had a favorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act. At about the same time, Gallup found a slightly lower number of 50% who approve of the health care law.
Trump’s popularity can shift a couple of points from month to month. At the time of the health care polling, Gallup found that 43% of adults approved of the job he was doing. The Real Clear Politics polling average had about the same approval level at the same moment, 43.7%.
Obama “wanted to bring premiums down with a non-profit public option.”
This is technically accurate, but it wasn’t Obama’s major priority. A public option was part of his health care plan, which said, “any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan.”
In 2009, as a public option became a sticking point in the debate over the Affordable Care Act, Obama said, “I didn’t campaign on a public option.” And during his campaign, it wasn’t central.
He gave a major address in Iowa on May 29, 2007, outlining his health care plan in considerable detail. There’s not one mention of the public option in his speech.
“You only have 64 public (mental) health beds in the state of Iowa.“
Correct. We checked this in June 2019. According to the Iowa Department of Human Services, there were 64 staffed psychiatric beds for adults younger than 55 at the mental health institutes in Iowa.
“Every single time (I’ve run for the Senate), I have won Michele Bachmann’s district.”
Correct. Bachmann was an outspoken conservative Republican who represented Minnesota’s 6th congressional district from 2007 to 2015. Election results sifted by J. Miles Coleman at the University of Virginia Center for Politics show that Klobuchar carried the district in her three U.S. Senate campaigns. The last one, though, was a squeaker.
In 2006, she won by 3 percentage points, in 2012 by 21 points, and in 2018 by a slender one-tenth of a percentage point.

IMPEACH PUSH IS DOOMED; Don to be cleared of any crimes as GOP foils bid to hear witnesses

Texto completo: Senate Republicans killed a bipartisan effort to call witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial Friday, clearing the way for a virtually certain acquittal of the commander-in-chief and putting the proceeding on track to become the shortest congressional trial in history.
In a 49-51 vote, the GOP-controlled chamber rejected a motion that would have allowed senators to consider subpoenas of witnesses and records withheld from House impeachment investigators as part of Trump's all-out stonewalling campaign.
Two Republicans - Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah - defected and voted with the Senate's 47 Democrats in favor of calling outstanding witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book has landed like a bombshell in the impeachment trial.
But, since it needed 51 votes to pass, the measure failed, meaning Trump's trial will be the only one ever to not feature witnesses and documents.
"It's a grand tragedy, one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome," Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters after the vote. "The Senate turned away from the truth and went along with a sham trial ... With no witnesses, no documents, the acquittal will have no value because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial."
Democrats forced votes on four amendments late Friday, including one that would have authorized a subpoena for Bolton. All of the additions failed.
The only crucial part left in the trial is a final vote on the two articles of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his bid to pressure Ukraine for politically-motivated investigations and subsequent efforts to cover up those alleged misdeeds.
Under a planning resolution, the Senate is expected to recess over the weekend and return Monday for closing arguments and floor speeches.
The vote on the articles will then take place Wednesday afternoon, according to the resolution.
Trump's acquittal is practically already a done deal, as two-thirds of the Senate would need to vote in favor of either or both of the articles for the president to be removed.
The expected acquittal will come just over four months after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched impeachment proceedings in the lower chamber.
The abrupt end to the rancorous impeachment process will take place during a busy week in national politics, with the Democratic Iowa caucuses Monday and Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday.
The only other two impeachment trials in history - Bill Clinton's in 1999 and Andrew Johnson's in 1868 - featured witnesses and documents.
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) defended Friday's vote against evidence.
"There is no need for the Senate to re-open the investigation which the House Democratic majority chose to conclude and which the managers themselves continue to describe as 'overwhelming' and 'beyond any doubt,'" McConnell said in a statement.
Trump, who left the White House in the early afternoon to spend the weekend at his private club in Florida, echoed McConnell's sentiment.
"They didn't do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!" the president tweeted.
The Democratic impeachment managers spent days of trial proceedings arguing that, while they were confident in the record they presented to the Senate, Trump blocked all current and former administration officials from complying in any shape or form with House investigators.
In spite of the unprecedented blockade, the House obtained reams of records and testimony from 17 diplomats and national security officials who in excruciating detail described how Trump used the power of the U.S. government to strong-arm Ukraine into doing his political dirty work before the 2020 election.
Nonetheless, testimony was never taken from some key witnesses - including Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. As a result, Democrats wanted to call them in the trial.
"A trial without witnesses is simply not a trial. You can call it something else, but it's not a trial," said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager.
Friday's failed evidence vote came after two moderate Republicans who had mulled calling more witnesses fell back in line with McConnell's plan for a swift acquittal.
First, Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander announced shortly before midnight Thursday that he would vote against evidence - even though he acknowledged Trump attempted to cheat in the 2020 election by withholding $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine while pressuring the country's president to announce investigations of Joe Biden and other Democratic rivals.
Then, minutes before the Friday session got underway, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, announced she was following Alexander's lead, sealing the witness-free deal.
Even as the Senate blocked evidence, more damning details emerged about Trump's Ukraine pressure campaign.
Citing a leaked portion of Bolton's yet-to-be-released book, The New York Times reported Friday afternoon that Trump ordered the ex-national security adviser during an Oval Office meeting in early May 2019 to assist in his push for Ukrainian dirt on Democrats by brokering a meeting between Rudy Giuliani and Volodymyr Zelensky, the country's then-newly elected president.
The explosive revelation marks the earliest known episode of Trump instructing his top officials to put the squeeze on Ukraine. Giuliani has admitted he was planning to travel to Ukraine to meet with officials about Trump's desired investigations at the time of the reported Oval Office meeting.
Over two months after apparently telling Bolton to connect Giuliani with Zelensky, Trump infamously asked the Ukrainian president over the phone to do him "a favor" by announcing investigations of Biden and a debunked right-wing conspiracy theory about the 2016 election - a request that sparked the impeachment inquiry.
Trump denied the latest Bolton account, as did Giuliani.
"If it's Bolton, he's lying again," Giuliani told the Daily News.
The White House is actively trying to block Bolton's book from being published and even threatened legal action against the ex-national security chief earlier this week.
Earlier this month, another portion of Bolton's book revealed Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep holding up U.S. aid to Ukraine until Zelensky announced the investigations.
The seven impeachment managers said Republicans will "be hard-pressed to explain why" they would vote against evidence, considering the continuous drip of fresh revelations.
"There is more direct evidence of the president's corrupt scheme only a subpoena away," they said in a statement. "Senators chose instead to set a dangerous precedent that will have long-lasting repercussions for the United States Congress, the balance of powers, and our democracy as a whole."

Texto completo: The Trump administration on Friday added six countries to the nations facing stringent travel restrictions, virtually blocking immigration from Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria, and from Myanmar, where refugees are fleeing genocide.
Beside Nigeria, varying degrees of restrictions will hit three other African countries, Eritrea, Sudan and Tanzania, and one former Soviet state, Kyrgyzstan. Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya could also be caught in the crossfire. The total number of countries on the restricted travel list now stands at 13.
Immigrant visas, issued mostly to foreigners intending to live in the United States, will be banned from Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea and Kyrgyzstan. The ban would prevent immigrants from Sudan and Tanzania from obtaining diversity visas. Homeland Security and State Department officials said some immigrants would be able to obtain waivers from the restrictions.
The proclamation, which President Donald Trump was expected to sign Friday, will take effect Feb. 22.
The administration has argued that the ban, enacted in 2017 to restrict travel from Muslim-majority countries, is necessary to ensure that countries satisfy security requirements for travel into the United States, or face restrictions until they do.
The expansion of the restrictions, which already affected more than 135 million people in seven countries, is likely to hinder more than 12,300 potential immigrants from resettling in the United States or reuniting with their families. The effect on Nigeria, not only Africa's most populous country but also its largest economy, could be particularly severe.
A U.S. government official said the administration was adding Nigeria and Tanzania to the list because of the number of people who come from the African countries on a visa and end up illegally staying in the United States. The official said Sudan and Eritrea had not satisfied the administration's information-sharing requirements.
The extension of the travel ban comes at a delicate time for international travel. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines began on Friday to voluntarily curtail flights to the United States from China to combat the coronavirus, and further restrictions are likely.
But it also comes as the 2020 election heats up. Trump is expected to use his travel ban, as well as his efforts to cut refugee admissions, to rally his political base as his administration contends with a Senate impeachment trial. Immigrants, citizens and students have already experienced the effect of Trump's increased vetting at ports throughout the border.
"We're adding a couple of countries," Trump said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe. You see what's going on in the world. Our country has to be safe."
The administration has contended that the countries on the list have harbored terrorists, maintained outdated passport systems or failed to ensure adequate information sharing. Trump has also made disparaging comments about African nations in the past, complaining that Nigerians who entered the United States on visas would never "go back to their huts."
Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, said Nigerian officials had not been advised their country would be included in the ban.
"It would be quite unfortunate if for any reason Nigeria were on the list," Mohammed said, noting the two government's cooperation in combating terrorism. "It would be a double jeopardy: The country has committed a lot of resources to fight terrorism. Any travel ban cannot but be inimical to the growth of the country."
He added, "Once a travel ban is imposed on a country, the consequences are not always pleasant."
Democrats, who have long opposed the ban, condemned its expansion.
"President Trump and his administration's continued disdain for our nation's national security and our founding ideals of liberty and justice dishonor our proud immigrant heritage and the diversity that strengthens and enriches our communities," Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement.
Doug Rand, who helped found Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards, said the additions to the ban would not just affect foreigners but also American citizens.
"It has become a de facto family separation policy besides the obvious one at the border," Rand said. "This will just magnify the pain to extend it to other countries."

Texto completo: Michael Sheen has made cardigans dangerous. On the Fox drama "Prodigal Son," he plays Dr. Martin Whitly, also known as The Surgeon, a brilliant Manhattan doctor who is responsible for at least 23 murders, most of them gruesome. Convicted and confined to a psychiatric hospital, he spends his days swathed in a nubbly, oatmeal sweater, playing mind games with his son, Malcolm (Tom Payne), a profiler for the New York Police Department.
Enjoying "Prodigal Son," which returned with its midseason premiere last week, requires a hefty suspension of disbelief surrounding cops, journalism and secure psychiatric facilities. But it offers the grisly pleasures of a murder-of-the-week procedural, as well as Sheen's twinkly, delirious performance. Told that a man has murdered 19 people, he says, "It's what they call a serial killer's dozen," then convulses in a wheezing laugh.
"If you want to feel like a good writer, write a line of dialogue and have Michael Sheen say it," said Sam Sklaver, one of the show's creators. "Because all of a sudden you seem like you're Shakespeare. He's just so, so good."
About 8.7 million weekly viewers across all platforms agree, making "Prodigal Son" the fall's top-rated new broadcast series. Fox has already renewed it for a second season.
A Welsh actor who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Sheen dominated the London stage before segueing into movies and scripted series. He combines impeccably average looks with a very un-average intelligence and emotional volatility. On the surface: a protective camouflage of niceness, ordinariness. (On "30 Rock," he played Liz Lemon's "settling soulmate.") Underneath: something darker and weirder. As Sklaver put it, "He's delightfully disturbing."
On a springlike morning several days before the midseason premiere, Sheen, 50, entered a cafe near a location shoot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, having traded Martin's prison scrubs and sweater for a plaid flannel shirt, a clashing tartan scarf and dad jeans. He was relaxed -- or maybe that was just the protective camouflage working -- and he had the bags under his eyes that are the go-to accessory for the father of a newborn. His daughter with actress Anna Lundberg, Lyra, is nearly 4 months old. He also has a 20-year-old daughter, Lily, with his former partner Kate Beckinsale.
Over a plate of poached eggs and a flat white, Sheen cheerfully discussed the banality of murder and taking psychopathy home, while also revealing a knitwear-related spoiler.
Q: Why do you think we have such a fascination with serial killers?
A: We like to think that they're an aberration, an extreme version of what is possible. And yet, underneath, we know that they're not separate. They are a reflection of us in some way. They're the monsters we don't want to own. We have to integrate them, assimilate them in some way. To turn them into entertainment is one way to do it.
Q: That seems like such a perverse impulse.
A: The alternative is to not engage with it, which would make it more frightening.
Q: In "Prodigal Son," is there some romance around the idea of the killer's being so much smarter than everyone else?
A: Well, I liked the challenge of playing someone who seems very likable, sort of charming. He uses that disguise like animals do: bright colors to lure prey. If you're a hunter, what you want is to be able to disguise yourself as something that will bring your prey to you. And so I came at it from that point of view -- maybe this is me just rationalizing with myself, but this is genuinely what I found interesting about it -- rather than looking at the character as someone who falls into that trope of the genius serial killer. So it's less about him being smart and more about him being dazzling.
Q: Why does Martin kill?
A: Well, that's what the show is about. He represents himself and what he's done in a totally unreliable way. It's always squalid reasons. It's always furtive, secretive, shameful reasons based on trauma.
Q: So how do you make sure that you're not carrying any of that home from the set?
A: I don't think you can, really. I think that's what you sign up for. I've found that if the subject matter has an innate risk to it, it doesn't matter how you approach it. It will affect you. It works on you. On an unconscious level, it just makes things happen. So you can either go with that and accept that and embrace that or not. But if you don't embrace it, it doesn't mean it's not going to affect you in some way.
Q: Tell me about Martin's cardigan.
A: Well, this is a massive spoiler, but I may have a new cardigan. I know. I was shocked. There is something that happens that means that my old cardigan may get a little spoiled. That cardigan is comfortable and soft and part of his disguise. Yeah, you just want to go up and hug him, don't you? Which means you'd have to cross the line into his cell, which means he's got you!
Q: Is the new one as cozy?
A: I resisted it, but the new one is actually better.
Q: During the midseason premiere, Martin learns that his son has been abducted by another serial killer. How does that affect him?
A: He has a terror of not having control. Which of course is the ultimate challenge for parents: How do you negotiate your child wanting to have more independence from you? So, when his son is now in the hands of someone else, in a way it doesn't matter that it's a serial killer; it's scary for him. It manifests itself is as a panic attack. He may up until that point have thought that he was pretending to love Malcolm, but in that moment, it becomes clear that something else is going on.
Q: That gets to the crux of the show, this question of can you be a bad person and a good father?
A: I'm not interested in that. I think that's sort of slightly meaningless. From an acting point of view, you can't play "good father," you can't play "monster."
Q: Are you a good father?
A: What is a good father? What does that mean? I mean, God knows I don't know. You try your best in the circumstances. You can see that there's a process going on where this little person is trying to find their own feet and yet needs you as well. Negotiating that is very complicated. And that's the struggle, no matter if they're a few months old or in their 20s.

Texto completo: "He's from Michigan and gravitates toward Midwestern people and people that are nicer. I think that's a sentiment that a lot of people have needed recently."
Jaime MacDonald, sister of Jason Polan
It was clear that Jason Polan would be an artist.
In middle school, he got permission to turn in a book report in the form of a comic book, his mother, Jane Polan, recalled.
He noticed patterns in weeds and saw smiley faces in electric plugs, she said.
"I once asked him — I said, 'If you couldn't make a living doing art, what would you do?' and he gave me a look as if to say, 'There's nothing else that I would do,' " she said.
The Michigan native died of cancer Monday in New York at the age of 37, having accomplished many goals and touched lives around the world with his art.
Polan, born in 1982 in Ann Arbor and raised in Franklin, was esteemed in the New York art scene for, among other works, taking on the incredible task of drawing every person in the city.
A former Birmingham Groves High School student and a University of Michigan graduate of 2004, his efforts culminated in a book, "Every Person in New York," with more than 30,000 portraits and a foreword by former "Saturday Night Live" star Kristen Wiig. It continued in a blog.
He also penned "The Every Piece of Art in the Museum of Modern Art Book." His work was featured in publications including the New York Times and the New Yorker, and he had commercial success with companies such as eyeglass retailer Warby Parker, furniture retailer West Elm, clothing line Levi's, and clothing line Uniqlo, where last year he debuted a Marvel Comics collection.
But for all his success, he was just as happy back in Michigan drawing the biggest tree in Manchester for the local newspaper The Manchester Mirror, said co-owner of the paper, University of Michigan lecturer and friend Fritz Swanson.
Polan did just that in 2017. The sketch, still available online, includes an extra outline just in front of the tree's trunk, along with an arrow and a disclaimer, "smaller tree."
Once Polan's writing composition teacher, Swanson said Polan became a teacher to him in many ways, as well as a project collaborator.
"He was gracious in the old sense," Swanson said. "... He was patient and generous and people just loved it."
Polan loved people, too, said longtime friend Jake Brege, 37, of Ann Arbor. The two are responsible for a mural in that city's downtown.
The two met in a drawing class during their freshman year at U-M and bonded over their mutual respect for each other's work on the first assignment — drawing shoes, Brege said.
He recalled times when Polan, who was best man at his wedding, called him just to share something nice another person had done, even just at a fruit stand.
"The attention to his surroundings and drawing things and kind of trying to see the art in everyday life, he applied that same sort of attention to details and perception to the way he interacted with people as well," he said.
Following graduation, Polan worked on the traveling art museum Artrain and then moved to New York. He pursued art while working at Border's, family said. Then he worked as a full-time artist.
"His interest was really, very much making people feel good, making people happy, making people laugh," Jesse Polan said of his son. "It made him feel good that other people felt good as a result of seeing, thinking about and being involved with the kind of things that he was doing."
In sharing his work, Polan also became known for his Taco Bell Drawing Club.
No matter where he was in the country, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Wednesdays he would find a Taco Bell and draw. Anyone was invited to join him, and many did.
The final drawing posted to his "Every Person in New York" blog was of a man at a Taco Bell.
Of his legacy and lasting impact, his sister Jaime MacDonald thinks back to a recent poster he made. It read, "Work Harder at Being Better."
"He's from Michigan and gravitates toward Midwestern people and people that are nicer," she said. "I think that's a sentiment that a lot of people have needed recently."
Jason Polan is survived by his parents, a sister, a brother-in-law and a nephew. He was preceded in death by his sister Jennifer.
A funeral is scheduled for noon Thursday at Ira Kaufman Chapel at 18325 W. Nine Mile Road in Southfield. Burial will follow at Franklin Cemetery in Franklin.
In lieu of a donation, the family asks that everyone check with their doctors about the appropriate age for colon cancer screening.
"He's from Michigan and gravitates toward Midwestern people and people that are nicer. I think that's a sentiment that a lot of people have needed recently."

Leader, actress hit with big lawsuit over NXIVM cult

Texto completo: Dozens of people who say they were bilked out of thousands of dollars and left emotionally and physically abused filed a federal lawsuit this week against NXIVM, the cult-like group that drew international headlines when some of its members were branded with their leader's initials.
The lawsuit accuses Keith Raniere, actress Allison Mack and 13 other NXIVM leaders of playing various roles in a pyramid scheme that doubled as a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, one that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and illegal human experimentation.
The complaint was filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court by actress Sarah Edmondson; Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman who dated Raniere in the 1990s; filmmaker Mark Vicente; and more than 70 former NXIVM members kept anonymous.
They are seeking monetary damages, asking a federal judge to determine how much they are owed for their pain and suffering.
NXIVM, now defunct, was based in the Albany suburbs.
"Defendants exerted power over the Plaintiffs; took their money; made it financially, physically and psychologically difficult, and in some cases impossible, to leave the coercive community; and systematically abused Plaintiffs physically and emotionally," the plaintiffs attorneys, led by Neil Glazer, wrote in the 189-page complaint.
NXIVM leaders found guilty in 2019 The expansive lawsuit explores the various ways Raniere, a Rockland County native who billed himself as one of the smartest men in the world, and NXIVM are alleged to have systematically abused its members, coercing them into spending their money on purported self-help classes and making them psychologically dependent on his teachings.
Raniere, Mack and four other NXIVM leaders — including Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune — were convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes related to the group last year. They are awaiting sentencing.
Mack, one of Raniere's most-devoted followers, is best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville."
Attorneys for Mack and Raniere did not immediately respond to comment Thursday. But Raniere's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told The New York Times he thinks the civil suit will benefit his client's chances on appeal.
"As several of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit testified at trial that they were not planning on bringing a lawsuit, Keith's chances on appeal just increased," Mr. Agnifilo said in a statement, according to the newspaper.
Civil suit details alleged abuse The civil suit recounts much of what was revealed during Raniere's trial and more.
At the trial, Mack was accused of helping run a NXIVM subgroup known as DOS, a master-slave group that was ultimately led by Raniere himself, though some members other than Mack didn't know it.
The women were branded near their pubic area with a logo containing Raniere's initials, while some were groomed to become Raniere's sexual partners. They were forced to give up naked photographs and other damaging information that was held as collateral in case they ever revealed the existence of the group.
Edmondson, who was among those branded, ultimately blew the whistle on the group, setting in motion a criminal investigation that led to Raniere's conviction.
Along with the branding, the lawsuit also details Natalie's years of court battles with Raniere, which came after she ended an eight-year relationship with him.
Raniere and NXIVM officials, backed with Bronfman's fortune, bombarded Natalie with lawsuits and court filings that cost her thousands of dollars and kept her tied up in court for years, even intervening in her and her mother's personal bankruptcy proceedings.
The civil suit lays out 10 different claims, ranging from racketeering to battery to malicious abuse of the legal process.
Along with Raniere and Mack, the lawsuit also names Clare Bronfman, her sister Sara, Nicki Clyne, Nancy Salzman and Lauren Salzman as defendants, along with NXIVM and 11 other individuals or companies with ties to the group.
Clyne, like Mack, was an actress and Raniere follower. She played the role of Cally Henderson Tyrol in the Sci-Fi Channel reboot of "Battlestar Galactica."

Texto completo: We are living in the age of the Modern Farmhouse. This is why so many of our kitchens have apron sinks, Shaker cabinets and industrial lighting, whether the home is a prewar apartment in Manhattan or a split-level in Mamaroneck. A dining room wouldn't be complete without a table made of reclaimed wood, perhaps from a barn. Not our barn, of course, because who living in a city has a barn?
The design style, a modern twist on the classic American farmhouse, takes the clean lines of contemporary design and accents them with industrial finishes, all while giving a nod to what is considered homey or rustic. A variation on the shabby chic phenomenon of the 1990s, the look was prominently featured by Chip and Joanna Gaines on the HGTV show, "Fixer Upper." The couple who rebranded Waco, Texas, as a design destination have temporarily left the airwaves while they prepare to launch their own cable network, but their signature brand of shiplap walls and cozy white sofas doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Home decor stores sell decorative accessories that look like someone's fantasy of what farmers might actually hang on their walls: picture frames fashioned out of faux old wood windows; wood word art - so much word art - that makes stark proclamations in chunky text like "Be a Voice, Not an Echo" or, more to the point for a kitchen wall, "Eat"; and distressed coffee tables that look like they've been planted around the family hearth for decades, not just shipped from China.
Instagram accounts such as Our Faux Farmhouse, The Modest Farmhouse and Our Vintage Farmhouse have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers with endless photographs of white living rooms, barn doors hung from black hinges and wicker baskets full of fuzzy throw blankets. The Instagram hashtag Modern Farmhouse has almost 1.2 million posts. Scroll through it and you start to wonder if color exists beyond white, black and reclaimed wood.
"The modern barn or farmhouse is here to stay," said Sasha Bikoff, a New York City interior designer who is building herself a 4,000-square-foot, all-white modern barnhouse in East Hampton.
But I set out wondering if perhaps we'd reached Peak Farmhouse. There have been flickering signs that the relentless pursuit of faux farm may be waning. A year ago, Southern Living magazine called for the end of cookie-cutter farmhouse decor and word art. And recently, House Beautiful asked, "Is the Modern Farmhouse Trend Dead?"
If Pinterest is a window into the psyche of the American aesthetic, the view remains relentlessly agrarian, or at least faux agrarian. In November, searches on the site for "bohemian farmhouse decor" were up 335% from a year earlier, and up 302% for "farmhouse front porches."
The look is decidedly nostalgic, a reboot of "Little House on the Prairie," where we can have a kitchen that looks like it came with home-churned butter, except we don't actually have to churn any butter.
"There's a homeyness to it," said Vanessa Alexander, an interior designer in Los Angeles who recently built a 6,500-square-foot farmhouse for herself in Malibu. "It has a sense of memory with comfort and family and country and a connection to the land."
The rise of modern farmhouse - Laura Fenton, writing for Curbed, reported that the term joined the American lexicon in 2016 - coincides with a time of American instability and uncertainty. If the future is unclear, it's no wonder we might want to re-create an American pastoral where we can wrap ourselves in a flannel throw blanket and sit in a wicker chair on a front porch gazing into the distance like pioneers.
This version of the homestead is punctuated with edgy details such as Edison bulbs, brass faucets and stark black trim.
Modern farmhouse gives us license to do the work ourselves, to be homesteaders-lite. Those of us looking for a crafty outlet can express ourselves by refurbishing an old dresser, repurposing discarded window frames or wrapping Mason jars with burlap. Who needs an expensive interior designer when the aisles of home decor stores are packed with whisky-barrel tables and vintage kitchen canisters just begging to be purchased?
The Gaineses "are cool, they're attractive. They're raising goats and they're gardening, their kids all seem well-adjusted," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in New York. "The look that they've marketed, it's good-looking, it's easy on the eye, it's not risky, it feels homey, it touches on a lot of things that we want."
"Fixer Upper" may be over, but the Gaineses aren't. Their brand, Magnolia, is now a magazine, a market and a real estate agency. In October, Magnolia will launch a cable network, replacing the DIY Network. "They're just getting their stride," Mendelson said. "They're going gangbusters."
But no single look can last forever, even if its biggest champions are ascending and selling a line of housewares at Target. There must be a breaking point, right? "Eventually, everybody always tires of it, that is why a trend is fleeting," said Michael Amato, the creative director of the Urban Electric Co., a lighting designer. While modern farmhouse has a broad appeal, it can also veer into kitsch. "To me, the moment it goes overboard is the minute you walk into HomeGoods and there's an explosion of 'Eat, Live, Laugh, Love, Die,' " he said.
Designers are noticing subtle shifts. Edison bulbs are losing favor, as homeowners realize that while a raw bulb may look pretty, staring directly at one is not terribly appealing. And color seems to be making a comeback - green kitchens!
"The modern farmhouse is evolving into something a little bit more global," Bikoff said. "It could be Balinese, it could be Chinese. It could be a little bit Italian from the '70s."
So, if we tire of American farmhouses, we could always branch out and dabble with ones that look like they're in the south of France, or maybe the English countryside or Indonesia. Who knows? This fantasy farm life could be limitless.

Texto completo: A couple of CNN panelists recently bashed Donald Trump. No news there, of course.
What cracked up host Don Lemon and turned the segment into a Republican campaign ad was how they did it.
Rick Wilson, a Never Trump "GOP strategist," and Wajahat Ali, a New York Times columnist, kicked into Southern accents as they mimicked Trump supporters.
"Donald Trump's the smart one, and y'all elitists are dumb!" Wilson said, doing his best impression of Forrest Gump.
"You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling!" Ali chortled.
"Your math and your reading!" Wilson continued. "All those lines on the map!"
No doubt, they would have been fired if they'd done Asian or African American accents or tried to sound gay. That double standard is nothing new.
What struck me was how oblivious they were to trashing the principles they hold so dear.
CNN fancies itself a champion of tolerance, inclusivity and protecting the rights of marginalized groups. Yet here was a panel giddily mocking a culture based on gross generalizations and oversimplification. It had Lemon literally crying tears of laughter.
To quote Cletus Spuckler, the resident redneck on "The Simpsons" - "Are you some kind of moron?"
I'm not saying Southerners are above gigging. Cletus is hilarious, and Jeff Foxworthy has gotten rich with his "You Might Be a Redneck" schtick.
We should all be able to laugh at good-natured parody. CNN's Three Stooges routine was mean-spirited ignorance.
Yes, the South does have a lot of good ol' boys and girls. And racism has undeniably played a role in the region's history. It still does, but hardly to the extent the Lemons of the world like to think.
That's hard to scientifically prove, but raw data can be enlightening. A study in 2015 tracked how often people in different states Googled racist terms and jokes. The worst area began in Georgia and ran up the Appalachians to New York and southern Vermont.
On a purely anecdotal basis, I come from Alabama (though without a banjo on my knee). I departed at age 3, leaving my budding accent in Birmingham. But I have plenty of relatives still there.
I am pretty sure none of them operate meth labs, attend Klan rallies or have married me or any other cousin. They do, however, use phrases like ain't, cain't, dawg, doohickey and fixin' to. Despite that, many somehow managed to get college degrees and shop at stores besides Walmart.
They are also unfailingly polite. If they feel the need to criticize, they fall back on a sacred Southern prefix that softens the blow.
"Bless his heart, he's dumber than a box of rocks."
"Bless her heart, she's ugly as sin."
Basically, Southerners are like every other group. Mostly decent, some jerks.
The sounds of New Yawkers or kindly Minni-sodans also evoke stereotypes. But no accent catches as much socially acceptable ridicule. Why?
It's partially history. We will forever be paying for the sins of our great-great-great-grandfathers. And a lot of people are raised up when they have someone they can look down on.
When they hear "Billy Bob," they like to think "Box of Rocks."
Just ask Billy Bob Thornton, proudly raised in Malvern, Arkansas.
"I didn't really get any auditions when I was coming up in Hollywood," he told The New York Times. "They either wanted me to play a hillbilly or a killer. Sometimes at the same time."
Like CNN, Hollywood prides itself on being socially conscious. Remember Apu, the convenience store clerk on "The Simpsons"? After 30 years of faithfully serving Squishees, he might be gone. Hank Azaria, the voice of Apu, says he'll no longer do the character. The PC Police say Apu stereotypes Indians.
Azaria also does the voice of Cletus Spuckler. Funny, nobody's protesting that portrayal.
We've all just been conditioned to accept Southern accents as shorthand for uneducated, racist losers. Throw in Trump Derangement Syndrome, and that's how three chuckleheads ended up on CNN, smugly stereotyping and blaming all of America's woes on faceless masses.
As Lemon cried tears of laughter, Wilson and Ali tried their drawling best to sound like stupid buffoons.
Bless their hearts, they don't even realize how successful they were.

From Ocean Lakes to the Super Bowl High school coach can't wait to watch Chiefs' Nnadi take spotlight

Texto completo: As the final seconds of the AFC championship game were winding down and the Kansas City Chiefs celebrated, Chris Scott also rejoiced more than 1,000 miles away.
Scott, the head football coach at Oscar Smith, will get a chance to see one of his former athletes play in a Super Bowl. Kansas City defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi played for Scott when he coached at Ocean Lakes High in Virginia Beach.
"Right when the clock hit zero, the first text message came from Shamarko Thomas," said Scott, who coached both players at Ocean Lakes. "And he said, 'Derrick is the first one that we had make it.' He added that we all have to be Chiefs fans this weekend. He said he already bought his jersey."
Hampton Roads has had an athlete play or be a part of a team in the past seven Super Bowls, and many more have played in it since the inception of the Super Bowl.
Nnadi is ready for Sunday's game, which will be in the familiar surroundings of Hard Rock Stadium. While with Florida State, he played at the stadium twice, winning both games.
"Every time I played here, I won," Nnadi told the Palm Beach Post.
Scott can't wait.
"My anxiety and level of fan-ship will be on a fanatic level," Scott said. "I'm just going to be at the edge of my seat."
Nnadi was named All-Tidewater by The Virginian-Pilot as a junior and senior. He was a consensus four-star defensive tackle recruit in the 2014 class. He chose Florida State over Virginia Tech, Ohio State, Virginia and Penn State.
With Florida State, he won numerous honors, including third-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference recognition as a senior when he finished with 56 tackles, including 10 for loss, and 3½ sacks.
Kansas City selected Nnadi in the 2018 draft's third round with the 75th overall pick. The Chiefs traded their third and fourth picks to the Baltimore Ravens in exchange for the Ravens' third-round pick to draft Nnadi.
This season, Nnadi - who wears jersey No. 91 - has started every game at right defensive tackle. He has 48 tackles - including 18 solo - one sack and a forced fumble.
Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Xavier Williams told the Palm Beach Post that Nnadi is a "stud."
"Solid in the middle, probably the most consistent guy we had all year," Williams said.
Scott always knew Nnadi was talented. But to see him play on the NFL level has been special.
"To see him line up and throw All-Pro linemen around just like he did when he was playing as a sophomore or junior in high school is just unbelievable," Scott said. "In my mind, I didn't think he could get any stronger. Now he's throwing around grown men. It's just so impressive how much he's grown and how much he's matured."
Nnadi's impact has been felt off the field as well. Earlier this season, he was named a weekly NFL Players Association Community MVP for providing a shopping spree for a victim's family following the Virginia Beach mass shooting and hosted two back-to-school events for kids in Kansas City and southeastern Virginia. He's also held Thanksgiving turkey drives, participated in the Hampton Roads Youth Foundation and took part in the Chiefs' annual visit to a Ronald McDonald House.
"Even if you don't know him, you're a fan," Scott said. "He's playing ball and he's doing it the right way. It's just so hard to not be a fan of that."
Scott has exchanged text messages with Nnadi throughout the season, including after the AFC championship win over the Tennessee Titans.
Scott is so excited for the big game. Now he has to decide where he will watch it. He and his wife, Connie, have been invited to a couple of parties, but he's wondering if it would be best to watch it at home because he doesn't want to miss a single second of the game.
"You don't want somebody to turn the channel or put the game on mute so people can talk," he said, laughing. "It's a different deal when you have one of your own in there."

Clarity's cost: The $5 million comma

Texto completo: Clarity is in short supply across America, but no longer at dairy farms in Maine.
In 2014, you see, drivers for a dairy company in Portland, Maine, sued their employer for overtime pay because a state law pertaining to overtime-pay exemptions failed to include the Oxford comma.
What is the Oxford comma?
It's the final comma in a list of things, Grammarly explains. In Grammarly's example, the Oxford comma appears after the word "eraser": "Please bring me a pencil, eraser, and notebook."
Few use the Oxford comma anymore. Most newspapers, for instance, edit articles according to the Associated Press Stylebook, which does NOT use the Oxford comma.
What's the big deal? According to some pedantic humorists, proper Oxford-comma use is a huge issue, one that could even save lives.
"Let's shop, then eat, Grandma" suggests something much less harmful than "Let's shop, then eat Grandma!"
And "I love cooking my dogs and my family" is much more appalling than "I love cooking, my dogs, and my family."
Which brings us back to that overtime pay dispute.
According to The New York Times, "Maine law requires time-and-a-half pay for each hour worked after 40 hours, but it carved out exemptions for:
"The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of:
"(1) Agricultural produce;
"(2) Meat and fish products; and
(3) Perishable foods."
The dispute concerned the words "or distribution of." The Times reports that since there was no Oxford comma before "or" the "court ruled that it was not clear whether the law exempted the distribution of the three categories that followed, or if it exempted packing for the shipment or distribution of them. Had there been a comma after 'shipment,' the meaning would have been clear."
Had there been an Oxford comma, "distribution of the dairy goods" would have clearly been exempt from overtime pay, but it wasn't clear. Thus, the dairy company had to cough up $5 million in overtime pay that it wouldn't have had to pay had an Oxford comma been properly used.
In any event, this story illustrates the importance of clarity in our laws and government processes. If ambiguity in a state law can cost one company $5 million, what might Americans' increasingly unclear understanding of our government and political landscape be costing us?
Here are some disturbing findings from Annenberg Institute surveys:
"More than half of Americans (53%) incorrectly think it is accurate to say that immigrants who are here illegally do not have any rights under the U.S. Constitution;
"More than a third of those surveyed (37%) can't name any of the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment;
"Only 39% can name all three branches of government."
Ignorance is dangerous to a representative republic. Voters must be well-informed to prevent smooth-talking, self-serving charlatans from attaining and abusing political power.
The solution to our increasing lack of clarity? Here are two options, one with a comma, one without:
"Wake up, America!" – or "Wake up America!"

Texto completo: After the hectic years of child-rearing end and grown children move out, many empty nesters find themselves in a state of adjustment.
While some rejoice in their leaner schedules and newfound quiet, others deal with loneliness and depression, often referred to as empty-nest syndrome. In either case, most empty nesters eventually reach a point where they ask themselves: Is it time to downsize, upsize or just renovate and configure their current home?
A recent report from Freddie Mac found that baby boomers have stayed in their homes much longer than previous generations. A 2019 report from Houzz, a home-remodeling website, found that 60% of baby boomers - defined as people ages 55 to 74 - planned to stay in their homes for the next 11 or more years. Older Americans tend to move into residential care communities in their mid-80s, according to data available from the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For those who opt to stay in their empty nests, many decide it is a good time to finally do the renovations they might have put off in previous years. These home makeovers tend to fall into three broad categories: fixing a space to make room for a new lifestyle or hobby; sprucing up a now unused space so it can be rented out to create a new revenue stream; or renovating to make a home more comfortable for visits from adult children and their expanding families.
Taking the time to figure out how you want your empty nest to affect your lifestyle will help you figure out how to reconfigure a home, said Robin Baron, an interior designer with her own firm in Manhattan. Many of her empty-nest clients have approached her after deciding they want to "entertain more," but she's had to pick apart what that means.
Do you want to have more dinner or cocktail parties? Do you want to host fundraisers or just have several friends over for a movie night? Will you do the cooking or hire caterers? "The word 'entertain' is too broad, so you must narrow that down, then come up with the design," she said.
Mary Ann Gioeli, a publishing executive, said she knew immediately what she wanted to do when her son moved out. About two weeks after Ryan, now 30, left their Upper West Side apartment for the Air Force in 2014, she threw out the "gross" black leather couch that was in his room and repainted the formerly bright blue space a neutral white. To turn the room into a den, she bought new furniture, including a pullout couch, and moved the television from the living room.
For Gioeli, 67, this was the first step in transforming her three-bedroom apartment into a more adult space. Although she was thrilled her home had been the go-to hangout for her son and daughter, Francesca, now 32, and their friends during their adolescence, she longed to turn the large, bright apartment into a quieter space. "Somewhere you can have a conversation," she said.
When her daughter left to rent her own apartment in 2016, Gioeli turned her bedroom into a proper guest room. Out went the dated furniture, in came a queen-size bed. These renovations cost a few thousand dollars and were paid for from savings, said Gioeli, who is separated from her husband.
In late 2016, she finally tackled what the family had longed to do: a complete revamp of the dated bathrooms. A tub in the master bath was removed, and a walk-in shower was installed. Double sinks and new storage spaces were added, as well as a new marble floor. The guest bathroom was also thoroughly updated, with a glass-encased shower replacing a former closet space. A home-equity loan covered the $65,000 price tag to renovate both bathrooms.
"I told my kids they will always have a home to return to," said Gioeli, whose daughter boomeranged back home last year. "But it's been great to be able to open up my home and have friends stay over."
Some empty nesters decide to turn their now unused space into extra income. Hollis Giammatteo, a writer, used about $180,000 from savings to gut-renovate her daughter's old basement bedroom and turn it into an Airbnb rental. Inspired by a friend who had done something similar, Giammatteo, who lives in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, said she preferred to lease the space short term because the city is a high-demand tourist and business destination and she is able to keep the unit regularly booked. She said that using an online portal had made it easy to block out specific days when friends and family planned to stay with her. She estimated she had grossed around $125,000 since her first rental in 2015.
That said, she advises those interested in turning unused space into a short-term rental to investigate local laws. "You have to be willing to take on bureaucracy," Giammatteo, 71, said. Depending on the area, you may need insurance, a business license and to pay taxes on income, she said.
Updating a home's look, not preparing it for sale, was the goal of 71% of consumers age 50 and older who either had completed a home renovation in the past two years or were in the middle of or planning to begin a remodel in the next six months, according to a survey taken by the Schlesinger Group for Sweeten, an online renovation platform.
"We see renovations ranging from updating a bathroom to include a two-person soaking tub to gut remodels that convert bedrooms into hobby rooms - from art to yoga," said Jean Brownhill, Sweeten's founder.
That said, experts suggest that homeowners check with a local broker before starting a large-scale renovation to see if their design will have resale value.
"Even if you have no plans to sell the home for another 10 years, it's a wise thing to do," said Dave Goscinski, the owner of JJED Remodeling in Dumont, New Jersey. "You're doing the renovation for yourselves, but can you recoup the investment later?"

Texto completo: A nontraditional, unlicensed school in Lafayette is receiving national attention again, as the Tamron Hall Show featured two former students of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School.
Broadcast journalist Tamron Hall interviewed Doraian Givens, Nyjal Mitchell and his mother Mary Mitchell on her live daily talk show in an episode Tuesday focused on education.
The three were included in reporting by The New York Times in late 2018 that alleged leaders of the school abused students and falsified college applications.
Hall asked Nyjal about physical abuse allegations he made against Michael Landry, who founded the school with wife Tracey in 2005. He said there were three instances of abuse.
"The first time he slammed my neck against a table and the second time he shoved me in front of a door," Nyjal told Hall. "The third time was the worst one, where he came up to me, grabbed me and put me in a chokehold, slammed me on a concrete floor and then dragged me by my hoodie."
Greg Davis, chairman of the school's board of directors since December 2018, told The Daily Advertiser on Wednesday those incidents were reported to Breaux Bridge Police at the time.
The Breaux Bridge Police Department received about 10 complaints involving T.M. Landry in the month following The New York Times publishing its article.
Michael Landry was cited for simple battery, according to records provided by the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office to the Advertiser.
Nyjal and his mom said he is in a public school now and taking extra classes online to catch up as a senior. He said he was a year behind after his time at T.M. Landry.
Davis, in his interview with the Advertiser, said the talk show interview seemed to be "a rehashing of what was already alleged in the New York Times article."
"It doesn't seem like it was anything new," he said.
The 4-minute clip of the show about T.M. Landry was shared to the show's Facebook page, which has 155,000 followers. The video had 28,000 views in 20 hours.
Hall said on her show that she reached out to school officials who said they didn't feel they had enough time to respond. She read part of a statement from a T.M. Landry spokesperson.
"We only want the truth, the whole truth to be told," Hall read. "We make no claims of being a model of perfection, but you can see why we are reasonably reluctant and cautious about doing anything that would jeopardize opportunities for our students."
Another former student, Doraian Givens, told Hall that she doesn't have a diploma showing she graduated from high school after attending T.M. Landry her senior year.
"I don't have anything that says I graduated from high school," she said.
She was accepted into New York University and is currently a junior.
"At this point I have no choice but to graduate college, which was going to happen anyway — let's make that clear," Givens said on the show.
Davis said Wednesday in an interview that the school is transparent that it is nontraditional and not licensed by the state Department of Education. It provides nontraditional diplomas, he said, which are accepted at universities, like in Givens' case.
"The evidence of that is our kids successfully gain admission to schools like Harvard," Davis said.
The Advertiser contacted Givens for further comment Wednesday.
"The show was my last time speaking about the situation," she said in a Facebook message.
The school currently has 49 children enrolled in first through 12th grade. That total is down from 110 when The New York Times article published, Davis said.
"Our parents are solidly supportive of the school," he said.
Davis said the students at the school now are excelling, including the senior class of about eight students.
"Our students have great outcomes," Davis said in December. "They've already applied for admission into colleges."
The school was founded 15 years ago with five students at a kitchen table, according to the school's profile and mission statement.
It describes the school as "an independent co-educational year round college prep school" for "for intellectual, 'out of the box' thinkers who want to pursue a serious, purposeful education, with the ultimate goal of achieving success in college and beyond."
It is is not funded through or accredited by the Louisiana Department of Education.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A few years ago, I made the Russian baths a regular part of my New York life. The ritual of the shvitz - steaming, sweating and rinsing - is why I go (health!), but if I'm being honest, I also am very much there for the food (pleasure!).
I eat there not out of necessity, but because it's low-key and one of my favorite restaurants in town. My order changes every time - pickles, cabbage, soup, pickled cabbage soup - but I always get the pelmeni, tortellini-size dumplings filled with pork, served in a squat ramekin, coated in melted butter and a splash of the cooking liquid. Finished with caramelized onions, lots of dill and a generous portion of sour cream alongside, they are kind of the opposite of a healthy trip to the spa - unless you consider mental health a part of that journey. (I do.)
Every time I eat those little miracles, I can't stop thinking about how I could write a recipe that approximates them without asking someone to make dumplings. (I'd never do that to you.)
I thought about the chewiness of the dumpling wrapper, the delicately meaty taste of the filling and slight brothiness of the liquid they come in. I thought about how necessary the dill is, and about how I always wanted a squeeze of lemon but wouldn't dare ask.
And that's how I got here: creamy farro with crispy mushrooms, sour cream and lots of dill. Yes, there is also a side of lemon.
OK, so, no: A bowl of farro and mushrooms isn't exactly a plate of dumplings, but hear me out. The way the mushrooms are cooked and crisped alongside the thinly sliced, caramelizing leeks gives them such a delightfully meaty flavor that they're almost better than meat itself. The farro, toasted in the pot before it's cooked, reinforces that vague meatiness. (Chicken broth helps, but you can use vegetable broth or even water to keep it vegetarian.) In the end, the squeaky chew of each grain coupled with the porridge-y consistency reminds me of the dumplings swimming in that buttery broth.
Topped with sour cream and a sprinkle of a lemony dill mixture, made better with the addition of chives, it hits the spot, even without the shvitz.
Creamy farro with crispy mushrooms
and sour cream
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 1 hour
1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle,
torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley
4 cups vegetable broth, chicken broth or water
1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing
Sour cream, for serving
1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the leeks and half the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and crisped, 12 to 15 minutes. (They will start giving off moisture and steaming a little before this happens, so be patient.)
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a medium bowl leaving any olive oil behind. (They will have absorbed the oil as they cook, and released it back as they crisp.) Add a bit more olive oil so there's another 1/4 cup or so in the pot. Cook the remaining leeks and mushrooms, adding them to the bowl with the other mushrooms.
3. Without wiping the pot, add farro and season with salt and pepper. Cook over that same medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until farro is toasted on the outside (it will go from pale golden brown to a toastier golden brown), about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and 2 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring to a strong simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until farro is fully cooked and most (but not all) of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. It should still look a bit loose, like risotto or a porridge. Remove from heat and add half the chives.
5. Toss dill, remaining chives and lemon zest together in a small bowl. To serve, season farro with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls. Top with sour cream, mushrooms and leeks, and dill mixture. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing.

Biden criticizes rivals Sanders and Buttigieg

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized two of his top rivals in the Democratic presidential race Thursday as tensions in the race ratcheted up four days before the Iowa caucuses.
Biden spoke to a group of reporters Thursday afternoon at a Dairy Queen in Pella, where he was asked about U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The three candidates are among the polling leaders in Iowa, along with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found Sanders in the lead with 20% support among likely Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Warren (17%), Buttigieg (16%) and Biden (15%).
Biden first told reporters the contrasts between himself and his top rivals were "self-evident," according to the New York Times. Asked to explain, Biden criticized Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats in the U.S. Senate, for his party affiliation.
"I'm a Democrat," Biden said.
"Well, he says he's not. He says — you know, he's not registered as a Democrat, to the best of my knowledge," Biden said, according to the Times.
New York Times reporter Katie Glueck also asked Biden if he worries about Sanders' record on guns.
"I think Bernie has made his verbal amends for his record on guns," Biden responded, before bringing up Sanders' past votes against gun control measures, including a vote against a 1993 bill that would have established national background checks. Sanders was in the U.S. House at the time.
"I think he's regretted that, I think he's changed his mind. So I take him at his word," Biden said.
At an event in Ottumwa later on Thursday, CBS reporter Bo Erickson asked Biden about Sanders' criticism of his record on Social Security, which the two campaigns have sparred over in recent weeks.
Biden reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a card with his talking points on the issue, handed it to Erickson and said "for you."
"I knew you'd ask so I decided to write it up for you, so you knew," Biden said.
The card was labeled "Bernie false attack on Social Security." Sanders campaign officials have stood by their criticism of Biden.
Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir responded to Biden's criticism Thursday night. "Last-minute, cheap barbs borne of desperation aren't a good look for a candidate who proclaims his desire to unite the party," Shakir said.
Biden also responded to criticism from Buttigieg.
"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new," Buttigieg said in Decorah. "But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take, with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments, and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump."
Biden did not respond directly to Buttigieg Thursday while campaigning in Waukee and Newton, but the former vice president answered a question from reporters later that afternoon.
"I don't know what Pete's talking about. He's a good guy and I'm not going to get into it. He must be deciding things are getting a little tight," Biden said. "A Washington playbook — I'm not sure what he means. What I'm advocating is for the American people, the middle class and giving people a shot."
Register reporter Barbara Rodriguez contributed to this report.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- At the White House on Sunday evening, as the phones started ringing nonstop and emails flooded in, President Trump took aim at the cause of the alarm: John Bolton, his former national security adviser.
Mr. Bolton's recollection in his forthcoming book -- that Mr. Trump had put a hold on Ukraine aid to press Kyiv to open an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden -- had just leaked. The information ran counter to a key Trump defense that he had held up the aid because of broad corruption concerns, and it turned up the heat on some Republicans to extend the trial by calling witnesses.
As White House aides scrambled to figure out how to respond, Mr. Trump recalled that Mr. Bolton once told him he wanted to be national security adviser because he worried he couldn't win the Senate confirmation required for many other senior jobs.
"I should have seen that as a red flag," Mr. Trump said, according to an aide in the room. "But instead, I did the guy a favor, took him at his word that this was a good fit, and this is what he did to me?"
Mr. Bolton didn't respond to a request to comment.
For the first time, Republican plans for a quick Senate impeachment trial were under threat of derailment. The White House and GOP leadership in the Senate swung into a political good-cop, bad-cop routine to keep the trial on track for a fast acquittal.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R. Ky.), aided by White House liaisons, exercised a behind-the-scenes campaign in the chamber to keep his members from panicking and breaking en masse from Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump stayed largely on the sidelines, heeding advice he had received directly from Mr. McConnell to give fence-sitting Republican senators -- who were wary both of crossing the president and appearing browbeaten by him -- the space to make their own decisions. But he engaged in some political saber-rattling with tweets about the need for a speedy trial resolution and criticism of Mr. Bolton, which was amplified by conservative allies in the media.
The strategy didn't prove immediately effective. In a private meeting Monday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) made an impassioned speech to his colleagues about the need to hear from Mr. Bolton.
Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) floated the possibility of bringing in Mr. Bolton and a witness who would appeal to Mr. Trump.
Mr. McConnell's message to senators then was to stay calm and be patient. He had framed the handling of the trial as a bigger threat to the party's Senate majority than to the president, and stressed on Monday that there was plenty of time before senators would have to decide, people familiar with the matter said.
At the White House, Mr. Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In the Oval Office, when asked about Mr. Bolton's allegations, Mr. Trump said: "False." His lawyers, arguing his case in the Senate, made only brief mention of the issue.
That night, the consequences of crossing Mr. Trump started to come into focus for Republicans. On his primetime Fox News show, Tucker Carlson called Mr. Bolton a snake. Lou Dobbs, a host on Fox Business News, referred to Mr. Bolton as a "tool for the radical" Democrats.
By Tuesday, it was clear to Republicans in the White House and the Senate that Mr. Bolton's account in his draft manuscript, first reported two days earlier by the New York Times, had to be more forcefully addressed, officials said.
White House officials spoke out against Mr. Bolton, as did Trump allies in the Senate. Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.) patrolled the Senate hallways gripping a printout of talking points matching those pushed by the White House. Other Republican senators bristled, however, unwilling to make a call on who might not be telling the truth between the president and Mr. Bolton, a prominent and longtime conservative in Washington.
On Tuesday afternoon, all 53 Republican senators gathered in an ornate room near the Capitol Rotunda. Mr. McConnell was clutching a card -- apparently a tally of Republican votes on the witness question -- marked with "yeses," "noes" and "maybes."
He told them the vote count wasn't where it needed to be, according to people familiar with the meeting, and struck an ominous tone, saying the future of the country and the Constitution were at stake. People close to Mr. McConnell were struck by his intensity. They felt that he had moved the needle.
Reports that the GOP had yet to secure the needed votes to prevent witnesses increased the tension and suggested for the first time that Mr. Trump's trial could prove much longer -- and potentially more volatile -- than at any time since it began.
Mr. McConnell kept up his cajoling on Wednesday, repeating his argument that the trial wasn't just about the president, but about preserving the GOP Senate majority, and the sooner it ended the better. He also said that adding witnesses would bog down the Senate in battles over executive privilege -- the right of the president to prevent advisers from sharing some information -- when the outcome of the trial wasn't in doubt.
There were signs that the strategy was starting to tamp the momentum for witnesses. Mr. McConnell met that morning with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was one of the handful viewed as potentially in favor of calling witnesses.
Mr. Toomey, who had earlier floated the idea of calling witnesses for both sides, shifted position.
But the vote was "still uncertain" as of Wednesday evening, according to Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip.
By Thursday lunchtime, GOP support for witnesses was on a knife edge. With Mr. Romney in favor, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine a likely, two other GOP senators -- Ms. Murkowski and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee -- became pivotal. Republicans could afford three defections, down to a 50-50 Senate vote, figuring Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wouldn't use his power to intervene to break the tie.
Mr. McConnell met with Mr. Alexander in the leader's office at dinnertime on Thursday. He had one tactical advantage in keeping the Tennessee senator onside: a half-century of friendship.
On Friday around lunchtime, Ms. Murkowski said she saw no need for witnesses, effectively scotching the prospect. Senators on Friday afternoon narrowly voted 51-49 not to have witnesses, the first impeachment trial in U.S. history to exclude them.

Texto completo: In some circles, the notion that there's no free lunch isn't just a metaphor for our economic reality - it's taken as a directive. That's the idea behind the view that to qualify for government benefits, an able-bodied adult should either hold a job or be in school. West Virginia has been testing this theory by imposing such a requirement for eligibility in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - more commonly known as food stamps - in certain counties since 2016.
The state has hoped that introducing work requirements would increase employment among SNAP beneficiaries and reduce reliance on food stamps, which ballooned during the Great Recession.
The results aren't heartening: According to a report from the West Virginia Center for Budget and Policy, work requirements did reduce SNAP participation in the affected counties, which saw a 13.6% decline in enrollment - much higher than the 5.7% decline elsewhere in the state. But employment growth in those counties has, if anything, slowed compared with the rest of West Virginia. And reducing access to food stamps without growth in the job market has in turn put pressure on local food banks and food pantries.
The idea that work requirements should promote employment seems intuitive at first glance. So what's wrong with the theory?
First, it fails to account for the nature and insecurity of employment for low-income workers. These kinds of workers are much more likely than the rest of the population to work intermittently. They often hold part-time or seasonal jobs, with hours that can fluctuate. Plus, those at the bottom of the pay ladder are much more subject to unexpected shocks that might make it difficult or impossible to work: If your car breaks down, for example, you might not have the money to fix it - and as a result, you may not be able to get to your job.
Whatever the cause, if you're in and out of work, you'll have a harder time satisfying eligibility rules that require continuous employment - even if you're working as much as you can.
There's also a broader conceptual problem with work requirements for food assistance: Taking away access to food benefits actually makes it harder to work both by reducing nutrition and forcing people to spend more time trying to find food.
Much of the value of in-kind transfers comes from providing aid to people who lack other opportunities. In the case of food stamps, that means people who can't find steady employment or who can't work at all.
Of course, West Virginia's work requirements have exceptions for people who care for dependents, such as young children or the elderly, as well as for people who are physically unable to work.
But these carve-out exemptions mostly pertain to those whose circumstances are easily measurable and long-term. A temporary illness might be enough to knock you out of the labor pool for a month, but not enough to earn you an exemption - and then by the time you've recovered, you would have lost food-stamp eligibility.
Far from encouraging widespread fraud, as some claim, most people receiving SNAP assistance really need it. Recent estimates place food-stamp fraud at about 0.9% of the program.
That low rate, which is well below that of many other major government programs, can be explained in part because SNAP isn't a huge benefit: For a family of four in West Virginia, for example, SNAP eligibility guidelines limit net monthly income to no more than $2,146, with a maximum monthly benefit of $646 - or roughly $40 per family member per week.
That's not especially attractive if you have a better option. And as a recent paper of mine with Piotr Dworczak and Mohammad Akbarpour explains, this means the decision to enroll in SNAP is on its own indicative of real hardship.
Thus, in essence, the structure of SNAP already serves as its own means test. Overlaying work requirements as a secondary screen is unnecessary and counterproductive because food aid tends to be most needed by those who have the hardest time finding steady work.

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" — that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
"Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued at the Senate hearing on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued on Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump's behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.

Texto completo: Protesters have sought to remove Amar Ramasar from the musical over a photo-sharing scandal, but his girlfriend said she had forgiven him for sending explicit pictures of her.
In the weeks leading up to the opening of the Broadway revival of "West Side Story," a small contingent of protesters and an online petition have called for the removal of a prominent cast member, Amar Ramasar, who was at one point fired from New York City Ballet after he shared sexually explicit photos of another dancer.
On Friday, the woman depicted in those photos, who is Mr. Ramasar's girlfriend, spoke out. And she made clear that she thought Mr. Ramasar was being unfairly targeted.
"I am not a victim in this," the dancer, Alexa Maxwell, said in a news release. She explained that Mr. Ramasar had expressed his regret over the situation and that she had forgiven him.
Ms. Maxwell, 25, has previously tried to keep her name out of the public discussion, but said that the recent protests -- one of them held Friday night outside the theater where "West Side Story" is now in previews -- prompted her to release the statement.
The objections have put a cloud over the production, and over Mr. Ramasar, 38, who has regained his job at City Ballet and resumed his acting career. In "West Side Story" he plays Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, a neighborhood gang.
The allegations against him surfaced in 2018 when Alexandra Waterbury, a former student of the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with City Ballet, sued the ballet and several men, including Chase Finlay, a dancer who had been her boyfriend, as well as Mr. Ramasar.
In the lawsuit, Ms. Waterbury accused Mr. Finlay of sharing explicit photographs of her with Mr. Ramasar and others, without Ms. Waterbury's consent. Mr. Ramasar was accused of sending Mr. Finlay photos of a different dancer, who was not named in the lawsuit but who Ms. Maxwell now says was she. Mr. Finlay resigned from the ballet; Mr. Ramasar and another dancer were fired, but an arbitrator later ruled that their dismissals were too harsh a punishment.
In an interview on Friday, Ms. Maxwell said she was exasperated by comments online calling Mr. Ramasar a "rapist" and by private messages chiding her for staying in the relationship despite his behavior.
Ms. Maxwell said that while she considered Mr. Ramasar's decision to share her photos a "misstep in judgment," she had forgiven him. She said she had told the arbitrator the same.
The couple have been together for nearly five years, she said. "He apologized time and time again, and I think that it's my choice as a woman to forgive him," she said.
During an hourlong phone conversation with Ms. Waterbury after her lawsuit was filed in 2018, Ms. Maxwell said, Ms. Waterbury tried to persuade her to join the lawsuit by saying that City Ballet "is worth half a billion dollars," and that she would win "a lot" and could have "an entirely new life."
Ms. Waterbury's lawyer, Jordan K. Merson, said in a statement that Ms. Maxwell's description of her conversation with Ms. Waterbury was inaccurate, but he did not go into specifics. Mr. Merson said that the timing of Ms. Maxwell's statement, more than a year after the lawsuit was filed, was "suspect," but that it helped to demonstrate the "problematic culture" at City Ballet.
"It is unfortunate that Ms. Maxwell would try to taint Ms. Waterbury with all that she has done for the #MeToo movement," he said.
Ms. Maxwell's public statement came as Mr. Ramasar and City Ballet have been seeking to dismiss Ms. Waterbury's lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The lawsuit accuses the ballet of condoning the dancers' bad behavior; the ballet has denied that, and noted that it took steps to discipline the dancers as soon as it learned of the allegations and investigated them. Ms. Waterbury's suit also accused Mr. Ramasar of encouraging Mr. Finlay to send him the explicit photos of her; in court papers, Mr. Ramasar's attorney noted that Mr. Finlay had already shared explicit images of Ms. Waterbury with others several times before his text exchange with Mr. Ramasar.
Ms. Waterbury, 22, joined about two dozen protesters at the demonstration outside the Broadway Theater on Friday night. As ticketholders filed into the building, the demonstrators quietly held signs with statements including "boo Bernardo" and "sexual harassment shouldn't get a standing ovation."
In an interview outside the theater, Ms. Waterbury, now a student at Columbia University, said that despite Ms. Maxwell's statement that she was no victim, she still saw Mr. Ramasar's Broadway role as something to protest.
"He still asked for photos of me," she said. "He still wronged me."
Scott Rudin, who is the Broadway show's lead producer, said in a statement that Mr. Ramasar is an "exemplary company member," noting that the behavior in question did not involve the production.
"He has more than earned our trust," he said, "and the 'West Side Story' company stands with him."
Ms. Maxwell said that the decision to speak publicly about Mr. Ramasar was her own but that she made sure the musical production was aware before she did so.
Michael Cooper and Michael Paulson contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Several Senate Republicans said that even if President Trump did everything impeachment managers said, he should not be removed.
The Senate voted on Friday nearly along party lines to block additional witnesses and evidence in President Trump's impeachment trial, effectively accelerating the proceedings toward a final vote, which is expected to be held Wednesday.
But even before votes were cast Friday, a number of top Republicans came forward with statements rejecting the notion that the president should be convicted and removed, despite the evidence laid out in recent weeks by House impeachment managers.
While some lamented the partisan tenor of the proceeding, which they said threw the fairness of the trial into doubt, others said their decisions were based on a stronger conviction: Even if the president did everything the House managers described, his actions and alleged wrongdoing still did not justify his removal from office.
This is what they said:
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee: "The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday."
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska: "Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed."
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio: "I have said consistently for the past four months, since the Zelensky transcript was first released, that I believe that some of the president's actions in this case -- including asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine -- were wrong and inappropriate. But I do not believe that the president's actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the ballot in the middle of an election."
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida: "For me, the question would not just be whether the President's actions were wrong, but ultimately whether what he did was removable. The two are not the same. Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office."
Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska: "Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us."

Texto completo: A new Austin City Limits concert is on PBS. And a Rob Reiner classic comes to Hulu.
What's on TV
AUSTIN CITY LIMITS: BILLIE EILISH 11 p.m. on PBS. The 18-year-old pop singer Billie Eilish, who took home five trophies from last week's Grammy Awards, including for best new artist, is featured in this hourlong concert. Her set list is largely made up of songs from her debut album, "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" (which won album of the year), including the dark, assertive pop hits "Bad Guy" and "You Should See Me In a Crown." Popular singles like "Ocean Eyes" are featured as well. Though she is a young artist, Eilish has been redefining the pop music genre for years, Jon Pareles wrote for The New York Times, saying that "she's sullen, depressive, death-haunted, sly, analytical and confrontational, all without raising her voice."
2020: RACE TO SAVE THE PLANET 8 p.m. on The Weather Channel. Three months ago, eight presidential candidates sat down with Weather Channel meteorologists to discuss climate change, one of the biggest threats to America's economy, national security and the planet's longevity. The show is back for a second installment, but this time with a particular focus on environmental justice, and a modified cast. Democratic and Republican candidates who weren't interviewed in the first installment have a voice in this one, including Senator Amy Klobuchar; the former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg; Tom Steyer; and Andrew Yang.
What's Streaming
WHEN HARRY MET SALLY ... (1989) Stream on Hulu and Sling TV. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) have been best friends for 11 years, and they want to prove that a single man and a single woman can have a platonic relationship. The two are clearly perfect for each other, though, so it's easy to predict where the relationship ends up. The rest of the movie consists of romantic Manhattan scenes, scattered with hilarious conversations about love and sex between Harry, Sally, and their best friends, played by Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher. Directed by Rob Reiner with a screenplay by Nora Ephron, "When Harry Met Sally" redefined the romantic comedy for a new generation.
SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS (1954) Stream on BroadwayHD. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Shortly after Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel) brings his new wife, Milly (Jane Powell), to his home on the Oregon frontier, his six unruly brothers decide they'd also like to get married. They ask their newlywed brother for advice: He suggests they kidnap women from a nearby town and bring them home. Milly teaches the brothers manners and the rules of courtship. Though Stephanie Zacharek, writing in The Times, once called this "Stockholm Syndrome in Cinemascope," she also wrote that this musical includes "one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put onscreen."

Texto completo: The city could become one of the first in the United States to allow yellow cabs to raise prices when demand is high.
New York City should consider allowing yellow cabs to use some of the same strategies as the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, including so-called surge pricing when demand is high, a government panel is set to recommend.
If the idea is implemented, New York could become one of the first cities in the United States to allow cabs to raise prices at certain times. It would be a significant change in a city where regular riders can typically predict how much a taxi trip will cost.
The recommendation will be unveiled on Friday as part of a broader plan to rescue the city's taxi industry from financial crisis, according to a draft obtained by The New York Times.
The biggest element of the plan will be a proposal to create a public-private fund worth as much as $ 600 million to bail out thousands of drivers who became trapped in exploitative loans while buying medallions, the city-issued permits that let them own their cabs.
The panel was formed after The Times reported that a handful of taxi industry leaders artificially inflated medallion prices and then channeled immigrant buyers into one-sided loans. The business practices led to a speculative bubble that burst in late 2014, wiping out the life savings of thousands of drivers and creating a debt crisis that was intensified by new competition from ride-hailing companies.
The panel met for six months and came up with dozens of recommendations for helping the industry.
The proposal on surge pricing, also called dynamic pricing, is likely to be among the most controversial. Riders have long complained that Uber and Lyft make customers pay exorbitant rates in bad weather and on holidays. (A tweet showing a $ 126.84 price for an Uber to Kennedy International Airport recently went viral; a taxi from Manhattan to that airport costs $ 52.) Uber has said it needs to use surge pricing to keep wait times low.
It is unclear if cabdrivers would support the idea, and the panel's report will call only for a study of the possibility.
Some panel members voiced concern about surge pricing, saying it could reduce demand for yellow cabs. But the issue is worth studying, they said.
The panel will also recommend that the city consider buying back medallions from people who bought them at city auctions, according to the draft. It also wants the city to work with state lawmakers and the federal government to ban many of the lending practices that led to the medallion bubble.
In order for yellow cabs to compete with Uber and Lyft, the report will suggest improvements to the app that lets riders hail cabs by phone.
"Urgent action is needed," the panel wrote in the draft report. "It is imperative that regulators, governments, the medallion industry, and private actors work quickly to develop an option for medallion owner debt relief and take steps to stabilize and modernize medallion taxi service, if it is to remain a competitive and viable transportation option into the future."
All of the proposals in the plan are tentative, and many -- including the recommendation regarding surge pricing -- are couched in calls for further studies. But officials emphasized that the panel members had worked hard for months to develop the plan.
"They've done extraordinary work, and I think they're all good ideas," said Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, adding, "We have to figure out how to implement them."
Mr. Johnson said for the first time that he supported the idea of a driver bailout and urged the mayor to join him in working out the details.
"I am totally on board with that. I support it," he said. "Now that the report is done, we need the mayor's full engagement to figure out concretely how we're going to move forward."
A spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio referred to his comments earlier this month, when he said he thought the proposal for a bailout funded with little, if any, city money "might offer a positive way forward."
The panel was created by the City Council and was led by two influential council members, Stephen Levin of Brooklyn and Ydanis Rodriguez of Manhattan. Its 19 members were chosen mostly by Mr. Johnson with some additional appointees by Mr. de Blasio.
The price of a taxi medallion rose to more than $ 1 million by 2014, from about $ 200,000 in 2002, even though the revenue that cabs could generate barely changed. During the bubble, government officials worsened the problems by exempting the industry from regulations, and the city sold medallions and ran advertisements promoting the permits as "better than the stock market," The Times found.
In the years since the bubble burst, more than 950 cabdrivers have filed for bankruptcy, and thousands more have lost their savings. Several have died by suicide.
Industry leaders have denied wrongdoing, describing their tactics as normal business practices and noting that regulators approved their methods. They have blamed the industry crisis exclusively on Uber and Lyft.
The government panel largely confirmed all of The Times's findings, including by conducting its own data analysis. It found that on average, each medallion owner owes about $ 700,000 and must pay $ 2,900 a month in loan payments.
It also found new evidence that some medallion brokers, who were supposed to find the best deals for drivers, instead guided them toward certain banks in return for loan provisions that aided their own businesses, according to the draft.
Bhairavi Desai, the founder of the Taxi Workers Alliance and a panel member, said the proposal that has generated the most excitement has been the idea for a bailout.
The proposal calls for a public-private partnership to buy medallion loans at discounted prices and ease the burden on borrowers by forgiving much of the debt and lowering interest payments. Investors to the partnership could receive incentives for contributing to the fund and would earn a return on the loans.
Panel members will be meeting next week with the National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that now holds many of the loans, Ms. Desai said. They will try to convince the agency to hold off on selling any of its loans until the partnership is set up, she said.
The National Credit Union Administration, which oversees credit unions nationwide, has said it cannot discuss its medallion loan portfolio. The agency took on the loans after closing several credit unions involved in the taxi industry for unsafe lending practices.
Ms. Desai added that she had already heard from several potential investors, but she urged those interested to come forward quickly.
Other panel members highlighted other proposals, including the surge pricing recommendation and another to inform customers exactly how much their trip will cost as soon as they enter the cab.
"We must consider all options when determining ways to save the taxi medallion industry," said Mr. Rodriguez, the panel co-chairman. "If the report's recommendation is taken on dynamic pricing, we need to be sure that it is looked at closely during its implementation to ensure that drivers are not negatively impacted in the future."

Texto completo: President Trump issued an executive order on trafficking, but several advocacy groups did not attend the meeting, criticizing it as a "one way" conversation.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump held what he called a summit on human trafficking at the White House on Friday and pledged his administration's commitment to combating it.
"I have many issues," Mr. Trump said in announcing an executive order to combat human trafficking and online child exploitation. "I have never seen such enthusiasm for a single issue as I have for human trafficking."
To mark the occasion, several high-ranking administration officials, including Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter; Eugene Scalia, the labor secretary; and William P. Barr, the attorney general, gathered in the East Room to hear personal stories from victims.
The executive order, according to White House, will establish a new position on the Domestic Policy Council devoted to trafficking, create a new government website to provide resources on the issue and direct officials to establish better methods for quantifying the problem.
According to Polaris, a nonprofit organization that operates the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, 10,949 cases of human trafficking were reported in 2018, a 25 percent jump from the year before.
But the White House event, which lasted the better part of two hours, did nothing to ease the concerns of activists who have said the administration's previous efforts on the issue have harmed some of those seeking help.
"The administration has been especially dismissive of claims by women and children who have been trafficked over the U.S. southern border," Eric Schwartz, the president of Refugees International, said in an email. "This terrible approach also discourages victims from coming out of the shadows and applying for visas."
Mr. Schwartz said the event on Friday amounted to little more than a "photo op."
Representatives of other groups said that the Trump administration was prioritizing American trafficking victims over noncitizens seeking help. For example, some asylum-seeking migrants who have described themselves as trafficking victims have had to wait in the most dangerous parts of Mexico for their court hearings.
The White House, for its part, continues to focus on trafficking that occurs within the country's borders. At the White House on Friday, Ms. Trump placed special emphasis on "domestic" trafficking, and called up a victim from the Atlanta area to share her story.
"We cannot turn a blind eye to trafficking that happens at home," Ms. Trump said at the event. "We cannot tolerate the exploitation of our own citizens."
Jean Bruggeman, the executive director of Freedom Network USA, one of the largest networks of anti-trafficking activists, said she was invited to attend the event, but declined when she learned that it would be a "one way" discussion meant to praise top administration officials, rather than solicit feedback on the issue.
"Many of the policies promoted and adopted under this administration have not been beneficial and have been quite harmful to trafficking survivors," Ms. Bruggeman said, noting that a $ 13.5 million grant to provide housing to trafficking victims was held up without explanation after an initial funding announcement said the money could support noncitizens.
"Broadly," Ms. Bruggeman added, "this administration's attitude and actions toward immigrants have put them at higher risk of trafficking, and made it more difficult for victims who are coming to the country seeking safety."
Other groups also declined to attend, citing a heated political climate.

Texto completo: Readers react as the Republicans vote to block witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial.
To the Editor:
Re "Republicans Block Impeachment Witnesses, Clearing Path for Trump Acquittal," nytimes.com, Jan. 31):
The vote is in. No witnesses. No evidence. I am ashamed to call myself an American. I don't know what to do with my rage, my pain, my utter disgust with the partisan politics that led to this disgraceful end. This is a mockery of a trial. The consequences are going to taint the rule of law and the process of checks and balances for the rest of time.
But in this country, there is something I can do. I am going to work even harder to rid this country of Donald Trump.
I will turn my rage into a commitment to change the awful direction this country has taken. That I can do. As an American, I can say what I believe. I can vote. And so can the vast majority of Americans who wanted witnesses and evidence. We can all vote. We can all speak out against this terrible corruption. And I believe we will.
Jo Trafford
Portland, Me.
To the Editor:
The impeachment "trial" was a farce. By forgoing the call for witnesses, the Republican Party showed utter disdain for the American people. Our country needs an informed citizenry composed of people who possess confidence in their elected officials.
Shame on every senator who voted to withhold information from us and to allow this mockery of a "trial" to exist. The Republican Party sold its soul on Friday.
Maureen Kimball
Pennington, N.J.
To the Editor:
Watching the Republican senators at the impeachment trial, I can't help thinking of that line from W.S. Gilbert: "I always voted at my party's call, And I never thought of thinking for myself at all."
Bob Davidow
Ann Arbor, Mich.
To the Editor:
The parsing of words by Republicans has become so creative that it's stunning. Senator Lamar Alexander said in his statement on Thursday that President Trump's call to the president of Ukraine was "inappropriate."
Calling your girlfriend to tell her the sweater she wore today made her look fat -- that's "inappropriate." A call by the president to a foreign leader to say he would withhold appropriated funds until the leader investigated his opponent -- that's "extortion."

Texto completo: The number of attacks, detailed in a quarterly inspector general report, highlights once more the disparity between talking points and the reality on the ground.
WASHINGTON -- The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report released Friday. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Trump tweeted that the United States was "hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
The number of attacks, detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008, highlights once more the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and American and Afghan offensive ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.
"Both overall enemy-initiated attacks and effective enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded same-period levels in every year since recording began in 2010," the report said.
The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37 percent of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.
The tally is one of the few remaining public barometers for the United States' war effort in Afghanistan after the American military command there stopped releasing or classified others, such as the number of Afghan casualties and the percentage of districts controlled by the Afghan government versus Taliban forces.
"There's so little you can publicly talk about that garners importance," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said Thursday.
This type of information has been used in the past to extrapolate a trend toward victory or defeat over the course of the war, but ultimately it has foretold little in the United States' longest conflict.
The expansion of the American air campaign seemed to mirror the increase in Taliban attacks.
In 2019, American military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs and missiles -- a record number since the Air Force began recording the data in 2006, according to recently released Air Force documents. At the beginning of the year, American Special Operations missions had increased by 124 percent from 2018, according to military documents, a rate that most likely continued throughout 2019.
In September alone -- the same month as the Afghan presidential election and Mr. Trump's decision to abandon a peace deal with the Taliban -- the American military dropped 948 munitions, the most in any month since October 2010.
In 2019, the American military command in the country, led by Gen. Austin S. Miller, focused on inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban in an effort to keep its leadership involved in peace negotiations taking place in Doha, Qatar. The offensives also aimed to push back the insurgent group to both lower Afghan casualties and hold what territory remained under government control.
After a car bomb in Kabul, the country's capital, killed an American soldier and 11 others in September, Mr. Trump called off the peace negotiations that were on the verge of a deal that could lead to the start of talks between the Taliban and the government in Kabul. The insurgent group has so far refused to talk to the Afghan government.
American and Taliban negotiators restarted the talks in December and are once more close to agreeing on a deal, American officials say, although the negotiations have been bogged down as the two sides wrestle over how to reduce violence in order to move the peace process forward. The Afghan government wants a monthlong cease-fire, and the Taliban has scaled back some attacks -- but only on cities and main roads.
"It goes to show nothing much has changed," said Jason Dempsey, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. "But if anything, it shows that the war in Afghanistan might be winding down in the eyes of the American public, but it certainly is reaching a pitched level in the country itself."
A Defense Department official attributed the higher number of Taliban attacks in the inspector general's report to the fact that the insurgents were attacking more frequently, albeit in small numbers -- a byproduct of the American air campaign and joint United States-Afghanistan ground missions.
Similarly, September saw the "highest number of enemy-initiated attacks in any month since June 2012 and the highest number of effective enemy-initiated attacks since recording began in January 2010," according to the inspector general report. But the increase in military operations from the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban are not without cost. There were more than 8,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2019, according to United Nations data.
More than 50,000 Afghan security forces have been killed since 2014, often with several dying a day across the country. The Taliban control more territory than at any time since the beginning of the war.
Though the insurgent group has focused less on urban areas, it has ramped up attacks in the countryside. At least 87 Afghan security forces were killed in the past week, according to incomplete government records tallied by The New York Times. During the same week, Afghan officials said their operations, largely relying on airstrikes, killed as many as 30 Taliban militants daily.
In the latest episode of civilian casualties, an American drone strike was said to have killed five civilians in northern Kunduz province.
Ghulam Mohaiuddin Rabani, a government employee, said his family was traveling from a relative's funeral in Dasht-e Archi district late Thursday afternoon when the drone struck their vehicle. His father, 70, a former anti-Soviet commander, his mother, 65, his uncle, 60, his aunt, 50, and an 8-year-old cousin were killed.
"I just collected the pieces of my family members," Mr. Rabani said.
Ultimately, the Taliban want a complete withdrawal of American troops, while the Americans eventually want joint talks between the Taliban and other Afghans over power-sharing in the government.
There are roughly 12,000 American troops in Afghanistan, and the Pentagon is planning to reduce the number to 8,600 in the next few months, with or without a signed peace deal.
Twenty American troops died during combat operations in 2019, the most in any year since 2014. Two soldiers were killed earlier this month by a roadside bomb. And on Monday, Lt. Col. Paul K. Voss and Capt. Ryan S. Phaneuf died when their E-11 jet crashed in Ghazni Province, most likely because of mechanical issues.

Texto completo: The story of the race right now, in Iowa and nationally, is the rise of Bernie Sanders. In our polling average at the national and state levels, Mr. Sanders appears to have gained substantial ground in recent weeks, overtaking Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Iowa, nipping at his national lead and raising huge sums of money online to power his insurgent candidacy. Should Mr. Sanders win the Iowa caucuses on Monday, it could be a major turning point in the race and the most serious test yet of Mr. Biden's political tenacity.
A Sanders victory in Iowa is no foregone conclusion. Mr. Biden continues to hold a solid base of support, particularly among older voters; in some Iowa polls he still has an edge over Mr. Sanders. And beyond the earliest, whitest states on the primary calendar, Mr. Biden is still the clear favorite among minority voters, who are usually decisive in settling the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
But Mr. Biden's strength at the national level is also built on the perception -- among voters and political donors -- that he has the best chance against President Trump in the general election. Losing to Mr. Sanders in one or more of the early states could shake that perception and make it harder to replenish his campaign's bank account.
Most polls in Iowa show a close race, between not just Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders but also Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg have fallen in the Iowa polls since the fall, and Mr. Buttigieg has taken an abrupt dip over the last month. But the Iowa caucuses also tend to reward candidates with strong field organizations, and both Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg are seen as having some of the most sophisticated turnout machinery in the state. With both of them polling in the mid-teens, either could be in a position to outperform those numbers.
There are two other trends worth noting: First, Amy Klobuchar has finally shown real upward movement in Iowa. Her gains have been slow and perhaps too gradual to produce the upset she needs, but her movement is real enough to raise the hopes of her supporters.
And second, Michael R. Bloomberg has overtaken Mr. Buttigieg in national polls, if only by one percentage point. It is the first time Mr. Bloomberg has been the fourth-place candidate in our polling average, a notable marker as he awaits the chance to exploit any early stumbles by Mr. Biden. Alexander Burns
Iowa on the Ground: A Sprint to the Finish
Last weekend brought a whirlwind of campaign events from Dubuque to Sioux City as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota tried to cram a week's worth of campaigning into two days before all of them -- to paraphrase Ms. Klobuchar -- turned into impeachment pumpkins.
Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., moved from oblique to direct attacks, criticizing Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. by name and saying the two frontrunners' recent arguments -- over Social Security, for instance -- reflected an unwise focus on the past.
Mr. Biden, on the other hand, campaigned as if he were already the nominee, focusing squarely on President Trump. On Tuesday, he seized on comments by Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican facing a tough election of her own, to argue that he is the Democrat the president fears most.
Iowa in the Polls: The Rise of Sanders
A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released last weekend showed Mr. Sanders ahead with 25 percent support, up six points since the last Times/Siena survey in October. He was followed by Mr. Buttigieg (18 percent) and Mr. Biden (17 percent).
Ms. Warren dropped to 15 percent from 22 in October.
A Suffolk University/USA Today poll released around the same time showed Mr. Biden leading and Mr. Sanders six points behind him.
A Monmouth poll released Wednesday found Mr. Sanders just two points behind Mr. Biden, well within the margin of error.
The entrepreneur Andrew Yang got four relatively strong ones -- two national, two in New Hampshire -- last weekend, qualifying him for the next debate, on Feb. 7 in Manchester, N.H.
Iowa on Your Screens: A Spending Blitz
The 2020 Democrats have filled the airwaves with their closing arguments. Mr. Biden's message: "Vote Biden. Beat Trump." Mr. Buttigieg's: A "bold vision for the next generation."
On Facebook, Ms. Warren is emphasizing "combating corruption in Washington." Ms. Klobuchar has sought to appeal to voters who feel "stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics."
Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has spent millions of dollars attacking Mr. Trump and will air a 60-second, $ 11 million Super Bowl ad focused on gun control. Mr. Trump's re-election campaign has also bought a minute of advertising during the game on Sunday.
Mr. Sanders's campaign raised more than $ 1.3 million after an ad painted him as incapable of beating Mr. Trump.
The Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, endorsed Ms. Warren for the Democratic nomination last weekend, while Mr. Biden got an endorsement from The Sioux City Journal.
Delaney Is Out After Two Years
John Delaney, a former representative from Maryland who announced his candidacy for president in July 2017, said Friday that he would end his campaign. He ran as a moderate, especially against "Medicare for all."
Mr. Delaney said he had concluded that he would do just well enough in some places to keep other moderates below the 15 percent viability threshold. "When I knew that I didn't have enough support to reach viability in a meaningful way, but I had enough support to pull off from other candidates," he told us, "I said, well, that's not very productive."
Sanders Releases Disability Plan
For months, candidates have been trying to outdo one another on everything from taxes to gun policy, jostling to produce the boldest proposals. That dynamic has been especially visible in disability policy. And on Friday, Mr. Sanders released a sweeping plan that advocates said rivaled the one they had recently praised from Ms. Warren.
Mr. Sanders is proposing several of the same things, including ending sub-minimum wages for workers with disabilities, fully funding the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, eliminating Social Security rules that can prevent people from marrying, and protecting home- and community-based services.
In Other Policy News
Amid the growing coronavirus outbreak in China, Ms. Warren unveiled a plan to stop the spread of infectious diseases. She said she would increase funding for agencies that prevent and manage outbreaks, and establish a corps of doctors, scientists and aid workers who can enter conflict zones.
She also released a plan on disinformation, pledging that her campaign would not "knowingly use or spread false or manipulated information" or "tolerate the use of false information or false accounts to attack my opponents."
Mr. Bloomberg released an economic plan for Puerto Rico and endorsed statehood for the territory. He also outlined how he would support the L.G.B.T.Q. community; released a Latino agenda; and announced a housing affordability plan, promising to cut homelessness in half by 2025.

Texto completo: On a July 25 telephone call with the president of Ukraine, President Trump described Ambassador Yovanovitch as "bad news" and said, ominously, "She's going to go through some things."
WASHINGTON -- The American ambassador whose abrupt recall from Ukraine helped lead to President Trump's impeachment has retired from the State Department, a person familiar with her plans confirmed on Friday.
Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, had been expected to leave the Foreign Service after she was ordered back to Washington from Kyiv, Ukraine, ahead of schedule last spring, accused of being disloyal to Mr. Trump.
But documents and testimony later showed that she was the target of a smear campaign for, in part, refusing to grant visas to former Ukrainian officials who were investigating Mr. Trump's political rivals.
On a July 25 telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Trump described Ms. Yovanovitch as "bad news" and said, ominously, "She's going to go through some things."
She possibly already had: Text messages between Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and his associates that were released publicly earlier this month indicated that Ms. Yovanovitch was under surveillance while still in Kyiv -- a claim that the State Department and Ukraine security officials are investigating.
State Department officials have suggested that Ms. Yovanovitch was pulled from Kyiv because of concerns about her security. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has refused to publicly support her, or clarify why she was recalled to the United States, setting off an internal revolt of diplomats who have rallied to her defense.
Ms. Yovanovitch was a star witness for House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry. She described being "shocked, appalled, devastated" upon learning of what the president said about her to Mr. Zelensky.
The Senate is all but assured to acquit Mr. Trump in a vote scheduled for Wednesday that will end his impeachment trial.
At its heart was whether Mr. Trump could be held liable for appearing to withhold $ 391 million in security aid from Ukraine -- money that Congress had already approved -- until Mr. Zelensky announced an investigation into a company that had employed Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Mr. Trump.
Ms. Yovanovitch's retirement from the State Department, after 33 years of service, was first reported on Friday by NPR. She could not be immediately reached for comment, and the State Department did not return calls and messages seeking comment Friday night.
Since returning to Washington last spring, Ms. Yovanovitch has been assigned to a fellowship at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, and she is scheduled to receive an award in February from the university's School of Foreign Service for "Excellence in the Conduct of Diplomacy."

Texto completo: The former boss of the premium cable network is in talks with a former Vice Media executive about making documentaries.
Richard Plepler is closing in on a deal with a former Vice Media executive, Josh Tyrangiel, to join his new production company, Eden Studios, according to two people with knowledge of discussions.
Mr. Plepler, the former chief executive of HBO, signed a five-year deal late last year to make series, documentaries and feature films exclusively for Apple TV Plus, the streaming platform that started in November. Mr. Tyrangiel is likely to focus on documentaries and current-events programming if a deal is reached, the people said.
"I like to think that I'm a pretty good assembler of talent," Mr. Plepler told The New York Times in a recent interview, after he signed the Apple deal. "And nobody gets any project off the ground without an enormous variety of talented people working with them. I expect to do more of that in my little new venture."
The relationship between Mr. Tyrangiel and Mr. Plepler goes back several years. Mr. Tyrangiel was the executive in charge of "Vice News Tonight," the nightly newscast that joined HBO's programming slate in 2016.
The show was canceled last year, a few months after Mr. Plepler left the network. On the same day that HBO announced the cancellation, Mr. Tyrangiel said he was departing Vice Media.
Before joining Vice, Mr. Tyrangiel was the top editor of Bloomberg Businessweek. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the negotiations between Mr. Tyrangiel and Mr. Plepler.
Apple is well on its way to making documentaries for its new streaming service. At the Sundance Film Festival this week, the company bought the rights to "Boys State," a documentary by Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine from Concordia Studio, a new production company backed by Laurene Powell Jobs.
Apple plans to release another half-dozen documentaries this year, including "Beastie Boys Story," "Visible: Out on Television," a documentary about the singer Billie Eilish, and "Home," a series about lavish houses.
Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlich, the heads of Apple TV Plus, hired Molly Thompson, the former head of A&E Indie Films, to lead its documentary division last year.
Apple TV Plus has not disclosed viewership statistics for its programs but the company's chief executive, Tim Cook, told investors this week that the streaming service was off to a "rousing start."

Texto completo: We are living in the age of the Modern Farmhouse. This is why so many of our kitchens have apron sinks, Shaker cabinets and industrial lighting, whether the home is a prewar apartment in Manhattan or a split-level in Mamaroneck. A dining room wouldn't be complete without a table made of reclaimed wood, perhaps from a barn. Not our barn, of course, because who living in a city has a barn?
The design style, a modern twist on the classic American farmhouse, takes the clean lines of contemporary design and accents them with industrial finishes, all while giving a nod to what is considered homey or rustic. A variation on the shabby chic phenomenon of the 1990s, the look was prominently featured by Chip and Joanna Gaines on the HGTV show, "Fixer Upper." The couple who rebranded Waco, Texas, as a design destination have temporarily left the airwaves while they prepare to launch their own cable network, but their signature brand of shiplap walls and cozy white sofas doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Home decor stores sell decorative accessories that look like someone's fantasy of what farmers might actually hang on their walls: picture frames fashioned out of faux old wood windows; wood word art - so much word art - that makes stark proclamations in chunky text like "Be a Voice, Not an Echo" or, more to the point for a kitchen wall, "Eat"; and distressed coffee tables that look like they've been planted around the family hearth for decades, not just shipped from China.
Instagram accounts such as Our Faux Farmhouse, The Modest Farmhouse and Our Vintage Farmhouse have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers with endless photographs of white living rooms, barn doors hung from black hinges and wicker baskets full of fuzzy throw blankets. The Instagram hashtag Modern Farmhouse has almost 1.2 million posts. Scroll through it and you start to wonder if color exists beyond white, black and reclaimed wood.
"The modern barn or farmhouse is here to stay," said Sasha Bikoff, a New York City interior designer who is building herself a 4,000-square-foot, all-white modern barnhouse in East Hampton.
But I set out wondering if perhaps we'd reached Peak Farmhouse. There have been flickering signs that the relentless pursuit of faux farm may be waning. A year ago, Southern Living magazine called for the end of cookie-cutter farmhouse decor and word art. And recently, House Beautiful asked, "Is the Modern Farmhouse Trend Dead?"
If Pinterest is a window into the psyche of the American aesthetic, the view remains relentlessly agrarian, or at least faux agrarian. In November, searches on the site for "bohemian farmhouse decor" were up 335% from a year earlier, and up 302% for "farmhouse front porches."
The look is decidedly nostalgic, a reboot of "Little House on the Prairie," where we can have a kitchen that looks like it came with home-churned butter, except we don't actually have to churn any butter.
"There's a homeyness to it," said Vanessa Alexander, an interior designer in Los Angeles who recently built a 6,500-square-foot farmhouse for herself in Malibu. "It has a sense of memory with comfort and family and country and a connection to the land."
The rise of modern farmhouse - Laura Fenton, writing for Curbed, reported that the term joined the American lexicon in 2016 - coincides with a time of American instability and uncertainty. If the future is unclear, it's no wonder we might want to re-create an American pastoral where we can wrap ourselves in a flannel throw blanket and sit in a wicker chair on a front porch gazing into the distance like pioneers.
This version of the homestead is punctuated with edgy details such as Edison bulbs, brass faucets and stark black trim.
Modern farmhouse gives us license to do the work ourselves, to be homesteaders-lite. Those of us looking for a crafty outlet can express ourselves by refurbishing an old dresser, repurposing discarded window frames or wrapping Mason jars with burlap. Who needs an expensive interior designer when the aisles of home decor stores are packed with whisky-barrel tables and vintage kitchen canisters just begging to be purchased?
The Gaineses "are cool, they're attractive. They're raising goats and they're gardening, their kids all seem well-adjusted," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in New York. "The look that they've marketed, it's good-looking, it's easy on the eye, it's not risky, it feels homey, it touches on a lot of things that we want."
"Fixer Upper" may be over, but the Gaineses aren't. Their brand, Magnolia, is now a magazine, a market and a real estate agency. In October, Magnolia will launch a cable network, replacing the DIY Network. "They're just getting their stride," Mendelson said. "They're going gangbusters."
But no single look can last forever, even if its biggest champions are ascending and selling a line of housewares at Target. There must be a breaking point, right? "Eventually, everybody always tires of it, that is why a trend is fleeting," said Michael Amato, the creative director of the Urban Electric Co., a lighting designer. While modern farmhouse has a broad appeal, it can also veer into kitsch. "To me, the moment it goes overboard is the minute you walk into HomeGoods and there's an explosion of 'Eat, Live, Laugh, Love, Die,' " he said.
Designers are noticing subtle shifts. Edison bulbs are losing favor, as homeowners realize that while a raw bulb may look pretty, staring directly at one is not terribly appealing. And color seems to be making a comeback - green kitchens!
"The modern farmhouse is evolving into something a little bit more global," Bikoff said. "It could be Balinese, it could be Chinese. It could be a little bit Italian from the '70s."
So, if we tire of American farmhouses, we could always branch out and dabble with ones that look like they're in the south of France, or maybe the English countryside or Indonesia. Who knows? This fantasy farm life could be limitless.

Texto completo: REPUBLICAN SENATORS who voted Friday to suppress known but unexamined evidence of President Trump's wrongdoing at his Senate trial must have calculated that the wrath of a vindictive president is more dangerous than the sensible judgment of the American people, who, polls showed, overwhelmingly favored the summoning of witnesses. That's almost the only way to understand how the Republicans could have chosen to deny themselves and the public the firsthand account of former national security adviser John Bolton, and perhaps others, on how Mr. Trump sought to extort political favors from Ukraine.
The public explanations the senators offered were so weak and contradictory as to reveal themselves as pretexts. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she weighed supporting 'additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings' of the House's impeachment process, but decided against doing so. Apparently she preferred a bad trial to a better one " but she did assure us that she felt 'sad' that 'the Congress has failed.'
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said the case against Mr. Trump had already been proved, so no further testimony was needed. But he also said, without explanation, that Mr. Trump's 'inappropriate' conduct did not merit removal from office; voters, he said, should render a verdict in the coming presidential election. How could he measure the seriousness of Mr. Trump's wrongdoing without hearing Mr. Bolton's firsthand testimony of the president's motives and intentions, including about whether the president is likely to seek additional improper foreign intervention in that same election?
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) echoed Mr. Alexander's illogic, only he lacked the courage even to take a position on whether Mr. Trump had, as charged, tried to force Ukraine's new president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, or whether that was wrong. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) managed to be even more timorous, telling reporters that 'Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us' and refusing to elaborate.
So cowed are most of those 'lots and lots' of Republicans that few of them dared to go as far as Mr. Sasse. Some have echoed the president's indefensible claims that there was nothing wrong with the pressure campaign. Their votes against witnesses have rendered the trial a farce and made conviction the only choice for senators who honor the Constitution.
Americans who object to Mr. Trump's relentless stonewalling and Republicans' complicity can take some comfort in the prospect that most or all of the evidence the White House is hiding will eventually come out. A reminder of that came Friday in a New York Times report about Mr. Bolton's unpublished book, which describes how Mr. Trump ordered him last May to tell Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani said publicly at the time he wanted to induce Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr.-Biden because it would be 'helpful to my client,' Mr. Trump.
That report underlined the cringing shamefulness of the Republican decision to block Mr. Bolton's testimony " and there will surely be more reminders in the weeks and months ahead. We can hope only that voters who wanted that evidence to be heard in the trial will respond by showing incumbent senators they are a force to be reckoned with, as much as the bully in the White House.

Texto completo: John Bolton could face legal challenges as he pushes ahead with a book describing conversations he claims to have had with President Trump while serving as his national security adviser, experts said, setting the conservative icon on a potential collision course with the administration he once served.
Bolton's book, 'The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,' is still scheduled to be released in March, even after the National Security Council warned his attorney last week that it will have to be revised because it contained 'significant amounts' of classified material. Bolton's lawyer has disputed that.
Amid the standoff, details about the contents of his manuscript are continuing to leak out, with the New York Times reporting Friday that Trump directed Bolton in May to call the Ukrainian president and urge him to meet with Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Trump denied Bolton's account. 'I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelensky,' the president said in a statement.
As Trump and his GOP allies have lambasted Bolton, the former national security adviser has sounded a defiant note. During a private appearance in Austin on Thursday, he defended officials who testified during the impeachment proceedings.
'The idea that somehow testifying to what you think is true is destructive to the system of government we have " I think, is very nearly the reverse " the exact reverse of the truth,' Bolton said, according to Austin's KXAN television station.
White House officials declined to comment Friday on whether Bolton has been asked to delete certain portions of his manuscript or whether the administration has been in touch with Bolton's team in recent days. A spokeswoman for Bolton declined to comment.
A representative of Simon and Schuster, which is scheduled to publish the manuscript, declined to comment.
A person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the dispute, said Bolton's team expects a lengthy fight over the issue but appears determined to see it through.
Legal experts and former government officials said the White House has several tools available to try to halt or delay publication of Bolton's book, including the pre-publication review process.
'If the administration simply doesn't want the manuscript to see the light of day, they could just drag it out far beyond the March publication date,' said Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speechwriter to then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
A book by Snodgrass was held up for five or six months by the Defense Department last year for a security review " and released only once he filed a suit alleging the department was blocking its publication.
Legal experts said the White House might also challenge Bolton's account as a violation of executive privilege or national security, subjecting him to possible legal challenges or even criminal prosecution if he proceeds.
'The president has ultimate authority for deciding what is classified and what is not classified, and Mr. Bolton has an uphill battle to convince the president that there's no classified information in there,' said John Ficklin, former senior director for records and access management at the NSC from 2014 to 2016.
Bolton's attorney, Charles Cooper, has said his client is confident there is no classified material in his manuscript. Nonetheless, a Jan. 23 White House letter to Cooper warned the manuscript contained a significant amount of classified material, including some considered top secret.
The letter, written by Ellen J. Knight, the National Security Council's senior director for records, access and information security management, said Bolton would be breaking his nondisclosure agreement if he published the book without revisions.
'The manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information,' she wrote.
Cooper had submitted the manuscript to the National Security Council for vetting on Dec. 30.
'Ambassador Bolton has carefully sought to avoid any discussion in the manuscript of . . . classified information, and we accordingly do not believe that prepublication review is required,' Cooper wrote to Knight. 'We are nonetheless submitting this manuscript out of an abundance of caution.'
In the past, the U.S. government has had mixed success in its attempts to block the publication of books by former officials. Many experts say the system for reviewing manuscripts for potential classified material is dated, opaque and in need of reform.
'The whole prepublication review system is a mess,' said Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School who previously served in the Defense Department.
'Each agency has its own set of rules. . . . There's a rationale behind the system, but it's badly managed, it's not well organized, it's not centralized, there are no clear rules, and it is very much open to abuse,' Hathaway said.
Nonetheless, she said, the government has a 'Damocles sword' hanging over Bolton, noting that 'they could sue him if he doesn't get the government's permission, and they could make him give up everything he earns on the book.'
The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that employees who evade pre-publication review can suffer financial repercussions. The case involved former CIA agent Frank Snepp, who described the CIA's role in Vietnam but failed to submit the publication for review. The decision effectively permitted the government to seize the profits.
Most writings by former government officials make it through the National Security Council review relatively smoothly. Smaller issues are often resolved via email or in sit-down meetings with the author, according to people familiar with the process.
But people who violate the procedures can face severe consequences. Courts have allowed the government to seize multimillion-dollar advances and royalties from authors who violated their nondisclosure agreements. The government could also bring charges under the Espionage Act, though that's rare.
In 2016, the Navy SEAL who wrote a best-selling book about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden had to pay the federal government at least $6.8 million to avoid prosecution for not getting pre-publication approval.

Texto completo: In the historic black church where she worshiped, the late journalist Gwen Ifill was remembered with a new Black Heritage stamp in a ceremony this week featuring dignitaries of the church, politics and journalism.
Speakers at the event Thursday at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church took turns describing Ifill's courage in defying expectations and praised her faith-fueled ability to serve as a mentor to young journalists who followed in her footsteps.
'The founders of imperial America never intended for Gwen to be Gwen,' the Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of Metropolitan AME Church, told the hundreds gathered for the Forever stamp ceremony. 'But the founders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church did intend for Gwen to be Gwen and for a million Gwens to follow Gwen Ifill.'
Deputy Postmaster General Ronald A. Stroman said the U.S.-Postal Service considered many settings for the ceremony for the 43rd stamp in its Black Heritage series but determined the Washington church was the appropriate venue.
'Her faith grounded her,' he said just before unveiling a supersize version of the stamp before the large cross at the front of the sanctuary. 'It gave her strength and informed the values that guided her life.'
Ifill, the first African American and first woman to moderate a major television news-analysis show, died at 61 in 2016, after a cancer diagnosis. She was the moderator and managing editor of 'Washington Week' and senior political correspondent for 'The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer' before becoming co-anchor of the 'PBS NewsHour,' part of the first all-female team to anchor a national nightly news program. Earlier in her career, she worked for newspapers including The Washington Post and the New York Times.
The ceremony featured remembrances from friends and colleagues, including Post contributing columnist Michele Norris, who served as mistress of ceremonies, and Ifill's NewsHour co-host Judy Woodruff, who noted the stamp dedication occurred during the same week when the life of their mentor Jim Lehrer will be remembered after his death on Jan. 23.
Washington Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) issued a proclamation declaring Gwen Ifill Day in her city. Former president Bill Clinton sent a video with remarks welcoming the journalist's recognition, and former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. read a congratulatory statement from former president Barack Obama.
Ifill's brother, the Rev. Earle Ifill, said it was significant to have his sister's memory honored at an African Methodist Episcopal church affiliated with a denomination in which she was an active part and her relatives held prominent roles.

Ifill's parents were deeply involved in the AME Church. Her father, a minister, eventually became its general secretary, a post he still held when he died in 1991, and her mother was active in the denomination's Women's Missionary Society.
Ifill had sung in choirs from the time of her youth and found local AME churches to join as her career moved her to the Boston area, Baltimore and Washington, her brother said.
She joined Metropolitan in 1989 and, among other activities, narrated special programs such as a presentation of Handel's 'Messiah.'
Patricia Ann Morris DeVeaux, the wife of Bishop William DeVeaux, a former pastor at Metropolitan, wrote of recruiting Ifill for the congregation's 'Voices of Inspiration.'
'Gwen joined the choir and sang in the alto section (known as 'the toes'), wearing the royal blue and gold robe and marching down the aisle with us, illuminating the sanctuary with her smile,' she recalled in a statement printed in the Christian Recorder, the AME Church's newspaper, shortly after the journalist's death.
'The altos were our largest section of the choir and Gwen helped them rock the house.'
Ifill, who also is cited with a plaque on a pew at Metropolitan, connected her roles in the press and the pew on at least one occasion.
'I would actually get a pass from my own pastor not to go to church on Sundays if I was going to be on 'Meet the Press,' ' she said during a special tribute to her colleague Tim Russert on NBC days after his death in 2008.
Ifill is not the first member of her denomination to be pictured on a U.S. stamp. Among others are Richard Allen, the AME Church's first bishop, who was honored in the same sanctuary with a Black Heritage stamp in 2016 to mark the denomination's 200-year anniversary.
Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the addition of her cousin to the list of stamp honorees " who range from Harriet Tubman to Marvin Gaye " has elevated her from the days as a preacher's daughter when faith and excellence in school were the priorities and not parties or fashionable clothes.
'The expectation was clearly defined and being cool was not on the agenda,' Sherrilyn Ifill said. 'But today Gwen is the coolest.'

Why Hope Is Fading for Sprint and T-Mobile; A lousy strategy by the Trump administration is leading to a court loss and a loss for consumers.

Texto completo: In a 1931 essay, Winston Churchill marveled and fretted over the accelerating pace of industrial and technological change, predicting the cellphone and much else. He also acknowledged that the only solution for the problems of progress was more progress: "Mankind has gone too far to go back. . . . There are too many people maintained, not merely in comfort but in existence, by processes unknown a century ago."
Why does this apply to T-Mobile and its struggling partner Sprint? Because their proposed wireless-industry merger is in deep trouble thanks to a regulatory circus that does little either to temper bad progress or facilitate good progress.
Though the nation's two expert agencies, the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, approved the deal with tweaks, 13 states, led by the attorneys general of New York and California, are suing to block it. They would be the first to deny it, but theirs is a campy exercise in "resistance" politics. Sadly, the Justice Department's Makan Delrahim outwitted himself and may have given them the means to prevail.
His FCC colleagues supported the deal with modest adjustments, but he decided he needed a more convoluted fix to appease antitrust critics. Now this fix is the deal's main weakness before a judge. Not helping were text messages introduced at trial showing him urging various interested parties, including Charlie Ergen of Dish Network, to get behind his fiddling. The New York Times delighted in editorializing that Mr. Delrahim's "campaign to secure Dish's participation amounted to a concerted effort to satisfy his own objections to the proposed deal."
Well sort of. His fix consisted of goodies dangled in front of Mr. Ergen, to lure him into becoming the country's fourth "national, facilities-based wireless operator," the role Sprint would be vacating by merging with T-Mobile.
The quotes need to be there for a reason. A decade ago, Justice opined that four such carriers were necessary to maintain competition, but this dubious axiom, which has never been tested and belongs to a different era, Mr. Delrahim apparently felt powerless to junk.
Then, the industry was growing; now the big challenge is how to provide growing bandwidth to a nongrowing customer base, at a steadily declining cost per bit. Teens nowadays use their smartphones to keep live video chat sessions open all day long, even when they have nothing to talk about. Consolidation may be the only way operators can invest to serve such emerging, hard-to-predict "5G" uses without going broke. Remember, this is happening at a time when 5G means cable operators will also be coming after wireless customers.
And yet, to hear the deal's opponents tell it, nothing has changed since the iPhone appeared in 2007. Federal District Judge Victor Marrero was urged to ignore the cable giants Comcast and Charter, though their extensive wired and Wi-Fi networks give them a substantial leg-up in the coming 5G "small cell" era.
The judge was urged to ignore the possible entry into the wireless fray of the big cloud operators Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, never mind that just such a deal was the rumored subject of closed-door testimony by Mr. Ergen.
He was urged to ignore the existence of today's thriving reseller industry, though these resellers wouldn't exist if they didn't have a marketing edge over the big four incumbents when it comes to certain consumer demographics.
Most implausibly, he was urged to believe Sprint and T-Mobile want to merge so AT&T and Verizon can raise prices. That is, the partners would shoulder the costs and risks of a deal for benefits that mostly accrue to their bigger rivals.
Alas, based on a statement by Judge Marrero to expect a quick ruling, Sprint stock has tanked. Mr. Delrahim's acrobatics were likely well-meaning—to help the economy keep evolving despite hurdles created by his own agency's precedents. The job of every honest appointee, after all, is partly to protect America from the bureaucracy. But he outsmarted himself by conceding that the deal was anticompetitive, if only by the lights of an antiquated and untested Obama-era axiom, and then proposing a fix the judge would be hard-pressed to believe in.
A better approach would have been a confident and unequivocal unanimity by Justice and the FCC, saying the deal, with modest tweaks, advances the public interest in a dynamic, competitive broadband industry. Then the judge would have had something to work with against the arguments of the opponents. Churchill was prescient in anticipating cell service. He would have needed a darker crystal ball to anticipate a regulatory culture that steadily undermines the ability of technology to find answers to the challenges created by technology.

Texto completo: Prince Harry and his wife Meghan began a new life in Canada last week, having stepped down as senior royals and left the United Kingdom. The couple's departure has forced a heated debate on a problem that many say the country is failing to face up to: racism.
People from ethnic minority backgrounds make up 19.5% of the population of England and Wales. But some people who identify with this community say that when they call out their experiences of racism, they are shut down. By white British people.
"The white person in this debate always centers it on themselves," author and broadcaster Afua Hirsch told CNN. "It would make more sense if somebody said: I haven't got a lived experience of racism. I would like to understand your perspective."
From as early as November 2016, Kensington Palace issued statements about the "abuse and harassment" that British media directed at Meghan, noting both the "racial undertones" and the "outright sexism and racism" she experienced as a result. When the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their shock decision to scale back their royal duties barely three years later, it was little wonder why.
But many of those who have dared to point out that racism is a factor in the Sussexes' recent move have been publicly slammed for doing so. On the BBC political debate show Question Time, university lecturer Rachel Boyle, who identifies as Black, said the U.K. press "have torn [Meghan] to pieces" because of racism.
Her claims were deemed as "boring" by white panelist and actor Laurence Fox. He then said that Boyle was "being racist" after she described him as a "white privileged male." The audience applauded Fox, and the pair's altercation trended on Twitter.
Hirsch, a former barrister who is of African heritage, was abused online after writing an opinion piece for the New York Times on the racism directed towards Meghan. She was also berated on TV by Piers Morgan, host of the popular breakfast TV show "Good Morning Britain."
"I am often requested to go into spaces where I'm the only person of color on TV debates and primetime shows," Hirsch told CNN, describing the experience as "entertainment" for viewers.
" [They] expect me to single-handedly show them what is racist, prove that racism exists. That in itself is a manifestation of white privilege."
Appearing on the "This Morning" TV show, lawyer and activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu was asked to give examples of racism in the U.K.; she explained that it was "exhausting" having to keep proving that racism exists.
But Hirsch believes it is important to keep educating people.
"People think racism is when somebody has in their mind that they hate people of color. [They] will say, T don't have a racist bone in my body,' while perpetrating racist narratives. This is an opportunity to show people what racism can look like."
In December, successful British rapper Stormzy came under fire when, after an Italian newspaper asked him if the U.K. was still racist today, he replied "definitely, 100%."
The musician added that racism in the country had worsened under the leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously been criticized for making racist remarks.
Stormzy's comments were misinterpreted by a number of media outlets who suggested he had said that the U.K. was 100% racist.
Broadcaster ITV News later issued an apology for its characterization of the story, but the incident has added to a simmering debate on race that was already in full force.
While the musician got some support on Twitter, a derogatory hashtag soon took over.
In contrast, white English football coach and former player Gary Neville was showered with praise when he called out the problem with racism in football, around the same time as Stormzy expressed his views.
Some experts make the point that support from people in influential positions can encourage others to listen and to pay attention to an issue.
"What we really need is allyship," Frank Starling, global VP of WERKIN, a London-based tech company that advises organizations on inclusivity, told CNN. "People that understand that they may have a privilege or a voice over others and they're willing to share that platform... It's definitely not just the responsibility of the victims... to solve these challenges."
Harassment and victimization are a daily occurrence for many people from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds - and not just from ordinary people on the street.
In 1999, an inquiry into the murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence, and the botched investigation that followed, found that there was "institutional racism" in the police.
Two decades on, Black people in England and Wales are still 40 times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched under so-called "section 60" checks that allow police to search a person without suspicion, according to a 2019 report by civil rights charity Liberty.
Growing up in the 1980s, Starling said he would wear smart shirts instead of casual clothing on the weekend, after he was stopped by the police multiple times.
Even today, he says he is careful about what he wears on a wintry morning. "Because I've grown up in a society where the idea of wearing a hoodie as a Black man may make people feel fear, I'm concerned about that," he told CNN.
'Racism is not a matter of opinion'
The U.K. is often praised as a melting pot of cultures. But research shows that multiculturalism is now under attack.
Omar Khan, director of the race equality think tank Runnymede Trust, points to a report that found 71% of people from ethnic minorities who were surveyed in early 2019 reported having experienced racial discrimination, compared with 58% before Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union.
The number of people who have experienced online racism has more than doubled to 51% since two years before the Brexit vote, according to the survey by Opinium. The same survey found that the number of people from ethnic minority groups reporting rants and negative comments about immigration or racist comments made to sound like jokes rose by about 50%.
Even the United Nations has said more needs to be done about racism in the U.K., including Brexit-era hate crimes.
"I got more racism last year than in the previous 25 years, all of it online on Twitter," Sunder Katwala, director .of think tank British Future, told CNN. "We should protect free speech, but not racist abuse."
Social media squabbles also distract from the real problem.
"The racist stereotypes about different ethnic groups are always predictable," Omar Khan said, explaining that the roots of racism in the U.K. can be traced back to the days of the British Empire.
"They are part of our wider intellectual and cultural heritage," he said. "Frankly, it's embarrassing we still don't recognize this, and instead prefer social media or personality spats instead of actually tackling racism and its consequences."
Starling said that an overall lack of diverse representation in influential positions iS a major reason why certain perspectives are less accepted.
Recent research reveals that members of ethnic minority groups make up only 6% of top management positions in the U.K. while the U.K. journalism industry is 94% white and 55% male.
While diversity in parliament has improved in recent years, in September 2019, just over 8% of members of the House of Commons were from non-white ethnic backgrounds.
Representation is not always welcome, though. Amnesty International's analysis of tweets mentioning female MPs in the lead-up to the 2017 general election found that almost a third of abusive tweets reviewed were targeting one woman: Diane Abbott, the Black high-profile shadow home secretary.
British society is known for its traditional "stiff upper lip" and "reserved" attitude, but Starling says it must tackle this issue, regardless of how uncomfortable it might be to do so.
"Being called racist indicates that we might be a bad person," he says. "We might hold a bias and that's really scary and very uncomfortable."
But uncovering unconscious bias, innate stereotypes about certain groups of people that we are unaware of, is in dire need of discussion, he says.
Someone's lived experience of racism, though, should not be open to debate. "Racism is not a matter of opinion," says Khan, "but of evidence and reality."
In fact, like Meghan and Harry, Hirsch says some people subjected to racial discrimination are considering leaving the country too. "I'm not saying people should leave... [But] I don't feel this is a healthy place to be right now."

Texto completo: A Glorieta man has filed a lawsuit in state District Court accusing the city of Santa Fe of unlawfully seizing and attempting to forfeit his vehicle in 2018.Bernard Lucero's complaint - which he is seeking to have designated as a class-action suit on behalf of others whose vehicles were seized by the city after February 2018 - accuses the city of creating forfeiture policies designed to bring in money that could be spent on police department operations.
"The city erected a web of arbitrary fines and fees" to accomplish this, Lucero says in his complaint, filed Jan. 22.
"The program seized nearly 500 cars a year," says Lucero's complaint, which alleges an attorney had bragged at a civil forfeiture conference in 2014 that Santa Fe had "realized a million dollars in revenues from forfeitures, fines, penalties and other things imposed in connection with these cases."
The lawsuit was referring to a conference in Santa Fe in which former Las Cruces city attorney Harry S. Connelly Jr. was captured on video encouraging law enforcement officials and lawyers to think about how forfeiture laws can be exploited. A story about the incident appeared on the front page of the New York Times.
At the same conference, Lucero's complaint says, a Santa Fe police officer reported seizing "showpiece" cars for the department. "And other officials spoke of the potential under nuisance abatement laws to seize people's homes, bikes, and airplanes boasting: 'We can be czars. We can own the city.' "
City spokeswoman Lilia Chacon declined to comment on the case Thursday. "The City can not comment on pending litigation," she said in an email.
New Mexico sparked a nationwide trend in 2015 when it banned civil forfeiture - becoming the first state to end the practice of seizing and selling the property of people who had been accused, though not convicted, of a crime.
But for several years after that, Santa Fe continued to operate a program that allowed officials to keep or sell vehicles of people accused but not convicted in certain DWI cases.
The city seized 473 vehicles under its ordinance in 2017, according to data provided by a spokesman in 2018. Some 274 were returned to owners, in some cases with the condition that they install an ignition interlock. About 145 of the vehicles were sold at auction, netting the city about $496,755.
The city suspended the practice in December 2018 after the state Court of Appeals found a similar civil forfeiture ordinance in Albuquerque was not allowed under state law.
But Lucero's complaint says the city kept his 1995 Ford Econoline van, which he used to operate is plumbing business, for four months after the Court of Appeals ruling.
Lucero says he was not driving drunk when police impounded his vehicle, but had three prior DWI charges and was driving on a lapsed license due to problems obtaining a new license under the state's federally approved Real ID license guidelines.
Lucero is seeking unspecified damages for himself and an order from the court directing the "unconditional return" of any vehicles seized under the city's forfeiture program.

6 ways to get a truffle experience in Asheville

Texto completo: It's hard to describe the flavor of a truffle. In this case, we're talking about the delightfully pungent fungus that grows in the soil near the roots of trees, and bears the flavor of its surrounds. Truffles are at once sweet and savory, mushroomy and rich, and even those many adjectives fail at an accurate description. As hard as it is to talk about truffles, it's much harder to cultivate them, though that hasn't stopped some Western North Carolina growers from trying. Author and chef Susi Gott Séguret will offer a tour of one of those farms as the organizer behind the Asheville Truffle Experience, Feb. 7-9.
The farm tour and truffle hunt takes place at a truffle orchard at the Mountain Research Station in Waynesville. Visitors can watch Monza the truffle dog, accompanied by trainer Lois Martin of the Truffle Dog Co., hunt for Tuber melanosporum, or the black Perigord truffle.
That particular variety is a favorite of Séguret, who describes its flavor as "earthy, musky, floral, sensuous, pungent, sexy, sweet, dark, dusky, oaky, nutty, savory."
Ephemeral but distinctive flavor Séguret's enthusiasm for truffles grabbed her "out of the blue" when she lived in Europe, the traditional home of the truffle.
She was attending a Slow Food convivium in southern France, where she tasted and explored several types, including the Italian white truffle, which fetches more than $4,000 per pound.
In a flash of synchronicity, when Séguret returned to her home just south of Paris, she read a New York Times article about truffle cultivation in East Tennessee.
"And it was astonishing to me that, here I am in France investigating truffles, and they're growing right next to me where I grew up," said the Madison County native.
Truffles make basics 'extraordinary' Truffles' magic in part lives in its ephemeral flavor, only at its strongest for two weeks. After that, it loses some complexity.
But should you catch one at its peak, it has the power to elevate a dish to magical heights, Séguret said. Even better, it's at its best when paired with the cheapest, most basic ingredients, including eggs, rice, pasta and cream, she added. "You can bring ordinary ingredients to an extraordinary level with the use of truffle."
Séguret, whose book "Cooking With Truffles: A Chef's Guide" should be released in February, said her passion lies in educating chefs and consumers about how to properly use and store truffles.
Whole, raw eggs, for example, make a perfect perch for the truffles, which in turn infuse the egg with flavor through its permeable shell.
Complexity in cultivation To land truffles among the many specialty products cultivated in Western North Carolina would be a coup for local agriculture. But in their quest to test the potential of this new crop, farmers have found keeping host trees healthy a challenge.
"The Eastern Filbert Blight has made growing truffles on filberts a big challenge in this region," explained Jeanine Davis, an extension specialist and researcher in the Department of Horticultural Science at North Carolina State University.
Her department is exploring other blight-resistant host trees while working to find the best production method for local truffles.
Researchers have found some success at the Waynesville demonstration and research orchard, Davis said. "So the method we are using does work."
She expects truffles to grow in popularity with farmers. Even so, they're likely to remain a niche crop.
"Even if we figure it all out on how to grow them, it is expensive to start an orchard, you have to maintain it for many years before you get your first truffle, and you really need to have a trained dog."
Séguret hopes educating consumers and chefs about truffles will help create a larger consumer market. "So when truffle growers have spent 10 years of their lives bringing this ingredient to fruition, it won't be lost in consumers' perception of it," said
But perhaps it's the lack of perception of truffles that might be the biggest uphill battle.
Let's fix that:
Get a truffle experience in Asheville The Asheville Truffle Experience kick-off, Feb. 7-9, features multiple events centered around the Périgord, or black winter truffle.
The event begins at 5 p.m. Feb. 7, with a welcome tasting at the Benjamin Walls Gallery, 38 Broadway St., featuring truffled appetizers, truffle ice cream from Ultimate Ice Cream Company and Celtic music from Aoife Clancy and Bill Elliott. Ticketing information can be found at ashevilletruffle.com for this and events below.
Truffle education and market: On Feb. 8, the Asheville Truffle Experience continues with a Truffle 101 educational session featuring several truffle experts. 10 a.m.-noon, location to be determined.
The afternoon has a culinary demo and tasting, 2-3 p.m., location to be determined. A Truffle Market will take place in the Haywood Park Hotel atrium from 4-6 p.m., featuring truffle products, services and truffled popcorn.
Truffle Extravaganza dinner: On Feb. 8, chef Peter Crockett cooks a truffle-focused dinner at Isa's Bistro with four courses and an intermezzo: truffled bone marrow parfait; truffle honey-glazed pastry of mushroom duxelles and tomme cheese; truffle agnolotti with pork trotter consommé and shaved truffles; and a black truffle dessert trio. Dinner begins with a reception at 6:30.
Truffle farm visit: On Feb. 9, 10-noon, head out to the truffle orchard at the Mountain Research Station in Waynesville, overseen by Dr. Jeanine Davis, to learn about truffle cultivation and to watch a truffle dog hunt for truffles.
Go to Vivian: Not going to the Asheville Truffle Experience? This River Arts District restaurant consistently has truffles on the menu, said co-owner and general manager Shannon McGaughey. "They are always shaved on top of our bacon-wrapped filet mignon, which is served with seared foie gras, sherry demi glace and toast."
Truffles appear on Vivian's oft-changing menu frequently, recently found in a dish of beets confited in beef tallow and served with beet-greens pesto. Don't see anything truffle-infused on the menu that suits? McGaughey said the kitchen will shave truffles over just about anything for an upcharge. Vivian is at 348 Depot St.

Texto completo: The St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge has plenty to celebrate this month.
Local New York Times best-selling author Jeff VanderMeer presented a $5,000 check on Jan. 21 to Friends of the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge president Susan Cason. The gift from VanderMeer Creative represented the fulfillment of a pledge to donate book royalties from the critically acclaimed Southern Reach Trilogy.
The trilogy takes place in Area X, a mysterious wilderness inspired by the St. Marks Refuge. The first book, "Annihilation, was made into a movie starring Natalie Portman in 2018.
On Saturday, the refuge is having its Wildlife, Heritage and Outdoors festival with exhibits, demonstrations and tours of the renovated Historic St. Marks Lighthouse keeper's quarters. The festival runs from 11 a.m.-4 p.m.
"Given 'Annihilation' is based on the 13-mile hike I do out at St. Marks wildlife refuge, it seems only fair to give something back," VanderMeer said. "The refuge is so unique — one of the most biodiverse places in the country. Refuge manager Terry Peacock and refuge biologist Joe Reinman are just the best — so dedicated and forward thinking. Also, the Friends of the refuge work so hard to help out — from volunteering in the visitors center to being instrumental in the St. Marks lighthouse finally having a new Fresnel lens. Tallahasseeans should be so proud."
The money from VanderMeer Creative will sponsor an intern and supplies to help keep the refuge's frosted flatwood salamander program going after a federal grant expires later this year. This threatened amphibian has a much better chance of survival with management of the species by refuge staff.
"Jeff is the best friend we could have," Melissa Jacoby, former Friend board member said. "Through his novels, thousands of people worldwide know about and appreciate St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge."
In addition to visitors brought to the refuge by the books, VanderMeer has given his blessing to the visitors center selling an Area X T-shirt, the proceeds from which go directly to the refuge's programs. A percentage of royalties from his latest novel, "Dead Astronauts," has also been pledged to the refuge.
VanderMeer Creative, set up to support Jeff and his wife Ann's creative projects, is also a sponsor of the Word of South literary festival, the Tallahassee Film Festival, and the St. Francis Wildlife Association, as well as a donor to the Florida Wildlife Federation and Apalachicola Riverkeepers.
"We love this community and it's very important to us to support the amazing wilderness and culture in the area," VanderMeer said. "We're so lucky to live in North Florida."
If you go
What: St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge WHO Festival - Wildlife, Heritage and Outdoors. Featuring exhibits, wildlife tours, demonstrations, food, music. Historic St. Marks Lighthouse – keeper's quarters will be open all day for free tours – children's crafts and more.
When: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday
Where: St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge; $5 entry fee
St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge is holding the WHO Festival to celebrate wildlife, heritage and the outdoors on Saturday.

Texto completo: AMES, Iowa – In "The Music Man" which, happily, returns to Broadway this fall, there's a tune called "Iowa Stubborn," written in 1957 by Mason City native Meredith Willson. It muses that folks in the Hawkeye state "could stand touchin' noses for a week at a time and never see eye to eye."
There's a "chip on the shoulder attitude," the song says, perfectly describing how Iowans feel about their Feb. 3 presidential caucus. It also explains why the outcome among Democrats is difficult to predict.
"I'm trying to decide between (Elizabeth) Warren and Bernie (Sanders)," said Ria Keinert, a physical therapist, waiting for a Sanders rally to begin. "I've seen most of the candidates; Bernie three times."
According to a recent Des Moines Register/CNN Iowa poll, 45% of Democrats said they could still be persuaded in the closing weeks to pick a different candidate. The latest New York Times poll similarly showed 40% willing to shift their support.
The last four Register surveys confirmed the volatility. Last summer, former Vice President Joe Biden held a commanding lead. In September, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren climbed to the top. Two months later, now-former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg was number one, but this month Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vaulted to the lead.
In Iowa's land of retail presidential politics, most voters take their responsibility seriously. It's difficult for other Americans – especially those outside of early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – to fully comprehend what Iowans mean when they tell you they won't caucus for a candidate they haven't spoken with personally. To a resident of midtown Manhattan, that's surreal.
During my visit to Iowa last summer, I wrote that the state's mostly white and largely rural population might not make it the best place to conduct what is unquestionably the nation's most lengthy presidential screening test. That remains true. But there's more to it, and it becomes clear in speaking with Iowans as their big day draws near.
Colin Burczek, a clerk at the Des Moines Hilton, said he has narrowed his choice to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer. Burczek has met most of the Democrats, and the metrics he and many Iowans use to pick a candidate differs from what most Americans are able to glean from cable-TV and social media.
"You get a vibe," Burczek said. "You get to see who they are as an actual person."
Iowans put stock in the broadness of a smile and a the firmness of a handshake, but there's another factor complicating things in the caucuses. A candidate must reach a 15% threshold in a precinct in order to be awarded any delegates to the national nominating convention. Supporters of candidates who fall short will shift to someone else on subsequent ballots, creating a form of ranked voting in which second choices are important.
What's decided in Iowa is nationally significant, but it's conducted with a local approach – what Meredith Willson called being stubborn.
I asked Kurt Paeper, a volunteer at a Buttigieg town hall in Fort Dodge, about that.
"I don't think we're all stubborn," he said, sounding rather stubborn about it. "I just know we're fortunate to be able to look these candidates in the eye."

For Bolton, it's now payback time

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – You can call John Bolton a lot of things — bully, brawler, neocon — but not many would call him a dummy.
This is especially true at this precise moment, when he may be the only person to emerge a winner from Donald Trump's impeachment trial.
To many Americans, the name John Bolton likely conjures up little more than a walrus-ian mustache to which the man's loyalty never wavers. Perhaps he keeps the little shrub to remind his upper lip not to curl with contempt toward those whose opinions differ from his own. As his friends and former colleagues will tell you, Bolton tends to be an absolutist with an affinity for black and white and no love for elitists or fools.
They will also tell you that he is above all a man of principle who would never sacrifice himself for the most-unprincipled president in modern history. Whether he is subpoenaed to testify before the Senate is virtually irrelevant considering that we already know what he knows.
For one thing, excerpts of his forthcoming book's manuscript were recently leaked to The New York Times. Among revelations therein: Then-national security adviser Bolton and Attorney General Bill Barr discussed "concerns that President Trump was effectively granting personal favors to the autocratic leaders of Turkey and China."
Also, Bolton writes that Trump explicitly made military aid to Ukraine contingent upon investigations into political foe Joe Biden and his son Hunter. But, then, we already knew that, too.
The rest is theater, which, frankly, has become a bit dull. Witnesses-to-the-rescue is a tempting notion, but it seems unlikely that Bolton's contribution would sway the Republican-majority Senate to convict the president.
So, why the backlash against Bolton from the White House, other than his apparent disloyalty? What else does he have? The White House knows exactly what he has since Bolton sent a copy of his manuscript for its review a month ago.
The more apt observation may be that he's got nothing to lose and, based on his long history of government service, everything to maintain. That is, his reputation for principle over loyalty. Bolton's repertoire in government service, which began soon after his graduation from Yale Law School (on scholarship), is that of a bulldog — stubborn, fearless, prone to infighting and concerned foremost with the sovereignty of the United States. He was an America First gladiator long before Trump thought of it as a foreign policy imperative.
Among other things, Bolton has nothing but contempt for the United Nations, which made his turn as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush a bit unusual. Before that, while serving in the State Department, he helped Bush un-sign the U.N. "Rome Statute," which created the International Criminal Court for war crimes, lest other countries use the treaty as a cudgel against America and our troops. In a 2018 speech to the Federalist Society, Bolton referred to this as "one of my proudest achievements."
In some conservative circles, bets are that Bolton wouldn't just be willing to testify, as he has said he would if subpoenaed by the Senate. He'd love to. One way or the other, his story, supported by the paper trail he created as national security adviser, will come out. It won't be good for Trump, but it won't necessarily hurt him in the immediate future. Everybody knows what Trump is. The only issue is whether enough senators care enough to convict him.
Trump and his loyalists have accused Bolton of trying to sell a book and make money. Note to the unpublished: Well-known writers such as Bolton typically are paid upfront by their publisher in the form of an advance. Whether the book makes money, thereafter, is primarily the concern of the publisher. Bolton's book's value has been reported in the neighborhood of $2 million.
Thus, money isn't likely Bolton's chief motivation. Far more compelling to someone like Bolton is what one might call principled justice. Trump embarrassed Bolton by ignoring his advice and then firing him by tweet (Bolton maintains he quit) for an offense that ought really to make Bolton's point-of-pride list: He objected to Trump's genius idea to host the Taliban at Camp David near the anniversary of 9/11.
So, no, Bolton isn't only selling books. He's saving his legacy — and giving back to Trump as good as he got. Testifying before the Senate might just make his day — in a Dirty Harry kind of way. But the book otherwise will stand when history passes judgment on a man who picked the right side.

Texto completo: The first and most visible test of candidate support in the 2020 presidential election is the Iowa presidential caucus, which takes place on Monday.
In addition to the Hawkeye State, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina will also hold primaries in February. Arkansas' March 3 primary will be part of "Super Tuesday," a supersized day where 15 states and American Samoa will all hold their primary elections.
While Iowa does not control who becomes the candidate of each party, Iowans' choices almost always end up matching the rest of the nation.
One of the architects of the modern Iowa caucuses, which began in 1972, wrote that the significance of the caucus was unanticipated.
"Never in our dreams did we realize we would be 'first in the nation,' nor did we ever expect anyone outside Iowa would pay much attention," retired Iowa State University engineering professor Richard Seagrave wrote.
Seagrave said that it wasn't political calculation that led to the choice to run the caucus early in the election year. It was the "immense amount of paperwork" needed to document caucus proceedings with only a slow mimeograph machine that led to the choice of such an early caucus date.
"Remember that we had no 'user-friendly' computers or high-speed copy machines in 1972," wrote Seagrave.
The significance of first-in-the-nation placement did not become clear until a barely known governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter, came to Iowa in 1976 to test the waters for a presidential run.
That year "Uncommitted" got 14,508 votes (37 percent). Carter came in with 10,764 votes (27 percent), but was declared the winner. He went on to get the nomination and win the presidency. The fact that a relative unknown — spending little money but lots of time and face-to-face campaigning — could win was surprising.
Why a caucus? Before the modern system for choosing presidential candidates was invented, the mechanism since 1832 for nomination of presidential candidates has been a national political convention of each party. Voters in each state convention elect delegates to the national convention. A caucus is one way state party leaders pick whom to send, and whom those delegates should support.
Powerful political bosses, such as Huey Long from Louisiana, William "Boss" Tweed of New York, James Michael Curley of Boston and Tom Pendergast from Kansas City, had the real power in the 19th and early 20th centuries through their political organizations. Bosses offered services — housing, medical care, food, clothing — to people before government services became common.
Pendergast once told The New York Times, "When a poor man comes to old Tom's boys for help we don't make one of those damn fool investigations like these city charities. No, by God, we fill his belly and warm his back and vote him our way."
A vestige of that political era lasted into the second half of the 20th century, when the actions of Chicago's longtime political boss, Democratic Mayor Richard Daley, led to a profound change in the presidential candidate selection process.
The 1968 Democratic convention took place in Chicago, a city tightly controlled by Daley. His operatives had long seen to it that people voted for Daley and his chosen candidates.
But 1968 was a year of violence related to race and the Vietnam War. Riots disrupted the convention. Mayor Daley used his police force to crush the protests.
Daley then bullied delegates to vote to nominate his favorite candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, even though Humphrey didn't win a single primary election.
All of this was covered live on television. The violence and bias threatened to taint the Democratic Party.
1968 provokes reforms The Democratic Party created the McGovern-Fraser Commission in 1968 in response to the events in Chicago. The new rules changed the party's presidential nominating process in an attempt to make them more systematic and transparent, as well as to encourage more participation by minority groups, young people and women roughly proportional to their numbers in states.
It was these reforms that launched Iowa's caucuses in 1972.
In 1976, the Iowa Republican Party followed the Democrats, and they began holding caucuses on the same early date.
That increased the visibility of the Iowa caucuses out of proportion to their actual numeric influence in the nominating convention, where in 2020 Iowa will send only 49 delegates out of the estimated total of 4,594 Democratic delegates.
In fact, the caucuses are in large part a media event or a beauty contest, as scholars Hugh Winebrenner and Dennis J. Goldford have suggested.
A legendary event occurred in 2004, when Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who came in third, was cheering on his supporters as he contemplated a national campaign. But a microphone malfunction amplified his enthusiasm. What become known as the "Dean Scream" tanked his candidacy.
In 2008 a first-term senator, Barack Obama, won the Iowa caucuses, propelling him to a hard-fought nomination and two terms in the White House.
And in 2016, Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders almost beat Hillary Clinton in Iowa.
How they do it On caucus night, registered Democrats and Republican voters gather at roughly 1,700 precinct meeting places. These have been schools, libraries, churches, fire stations and people's homes. In 2020, Democrats will also have satellite caucuses, some even held overseas.
There are speeches by supporters for each candidate who gather into groups for each candidate. The numbers in each group are counted.
For the Democrats, a candidate must have at least 15 percent of the all the participants in that precinct to be viable. Otherwise that candidate is declared "non-viable" and the supporters are asked to join another group or remain undecided.
Once the viable groups have been declared, a complex mathematical calculation determines how many delegates are allocated to each surviving candidate.
In Republican caucuses, attendees vote and the delegates are apportioned according to the statewide results.
Political tradition The Iowa caucuses have become a well-watched political tradition because the media devotes so much attention to the candidates' activities in Iowa and then how they perform on caucus night.
Criticisms have emerged. Iowa's small and mostly white population has subjected the caucus to the charge that it is not representative of the nation as a whole.
A recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll attests to that concern:
• A 57 percent majority agreed that holding the opening contests in Iowa and New Hampshire was a good system "because it forces candidates to talk directly to voters."
• A 52% majority also agreed that holding the opening contests in Iowa and New Hampshire wasn't a good system "because the two states don't reflect the nation's diversity."
"There is also a concern that caucuses are difficult events to participate in because voters must attend personally and at night. The turnout rate of eligible voters is low, hovering around 10 percent, while primaries normally have turnout of 35 percent or more.
In 2020, there is renewed debate about how Americans should select their candidates for president. Caucuses are now generally in disfavor, with many states moving to primaries.
One thing is clear: As American candidate selection evolved from the days of political bosses to today's caucuses and primaries, that process will continue to evolve.

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" – that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
"Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued at the Senate hearing on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued on Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump's behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.
With Trump preventing his closest advisers from testifying during the impeachment proceedings late last year, senators have an obligation at the trial to summon people like Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others.
But McConnell and the vast majority of his caucus seemed ready to forgo witnesses, arguing that they were under no duty to go on a "fishing expedition." Now there's a preview of what Bolton would say, and it goes to the heart of the allegations against Trump.
Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-vote majority in the 100-member Senate, are considering their next move, and this is where the Democrats could grease the skids by laying out a deal with Republicans to allow prosecutors and defense lawyers to call relevant witnesses of their choice.
True, that might result in a subpoena for Hunter Biden, who worked for a scandal-marred Ukrainian energy company. (Did he show poor judgment? Sure. Should Trump be trying to outsource his opposition research to a foreign government? Absolutely not.) But if a compromise would allow Bolton and others to testify, it would serve the public's interest.
This impeachment trial – only the third in U.S. history – is much more than just a proceeding before the Senate. It's a vehicle for the American people to judge their president's character and conduct. For that, witnesses are imperative.
Bolton's book is slated for publication in March. To pass on the chance to thoroughly question and cross-examine him, under oath, would be a loss to history and expose these historic proceedings as a farce.

Texto completo: WUHAN, China — Americans were advised not to travel to China as the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency Thursday and anger roiled through the hospitals at the center of the coronavirus outbreak.
The WHO's move reversed its decision just a week ago to hold off on such a declaration. Since then, there have been thousands of new cases in China and clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in several other countries, including the United States.
Late Thursday, the State Department issued its Level 4 advisory, which represents the highest safety risk. The advisory urged Americans currently in China to consider departing using commercial means and requested that all non-essential US government personnel defer travel "in light of the novel coronavirus."
“Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China," it said.
China counted 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213, including 43 new fatalities. The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan. No deaths have been reported outside China.
The declaration by the World Health Organization “is not a vote of no-confidence in China," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general. “On the contrary, the WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak."
The declaration comes now, he said, because of fears that the coronavirus may reach countries with weak health care systems, where it could run amok, potentially infecting millions of people.
In response to the WHO declaration, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said that the country “is fully confident and capable of winning the battle against this epidemic."
The WHO's declaration — officially called a “public health emergency of international concern" — does not have the force of law. The agency is governed by an annual convocation of the health ministers of all UN countries, and its role is only to offer advice. Governments then make their own decisions about how they protect themselves.
In Hubei province, fury and frustrations deepened amid shortages of hospital beds, medical supplies, and doctors.
In a sign of growing anger, a relative of a patient infected with the virus beat up a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, the state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday, citing the police. The man was accused of pulling and damaging the doctor's mask and protective clothing — potentially exposing him to the virus — after his father-in-law died in the hospital. The man was later detained.
At the same time, hospitals in the region renewed pleas to the public for help to replenish their supplies, which were fast disappearing. The shortages have become especially severe in Huanggang, a city of 7 million near Wuhan, where some medical staff members were wearing raincoats and garbage bags as shoe covers to protect against infection, according to Yicai, a financial news site.
Also on Thursday, Chinese government agencies announced plans to issue subsidies of up to $43 per day to front-line medical workers and to reopen factories to boost production of medical supplies and protective gear.
“We absolutely cannot let Huanggang become a second Wuhan," Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei province, said at a news briefing.
On Thursday evening, provincial leaders said at a news briefing that the director of Huanggang's health committee had been fired.
For many Chinese, such decisive government announcements are too little, too late. Stoking their anger was the publication this week of a paper about the coronavirus in The New England Journal of Medicine by a team of researchers affiliated with, among other places, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hubei Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Drawing on data from the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the paper states “there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019."
Chinese people online were incensed, asking why the government had waited until Jan. 20 to inform the public that the virus was capable of being transmitted from human to human. By Thursday evening, many had seized on the paper as evidence that the authors had purposely withheld valuable information out of academic self-interest.
“I'm about to explode, I need an explanation from the authors!!!!" Wang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, wrote in a widely shared social media post that was quickly deleted. “As a researcher with firsthand information, you knew that the virus could be transmitted between humans three weeks before the public did. Did you do what you were supposed to do?"

Texto completo: Wesley United Methodist Church, 14 N. May St. in Aurora, is hosting a Wednesday adult discussion series on "The 1619 Project," an August 2019 New York Times Magazine chronicling slavery in the U.S. and the contributions of black Americans.
The Rev. John Bell, Wesley UMC pastor, said the public is invited to the study in the church parlor. Included are a light dinner at 5:30 p.m. and discussion of articles from 6 to 7 p.m. Admission and parking are free.
The series opened Jan. 22 with discussion of an article by Nikole Hannah-Jones. No closing date has been set for the series.
"It’s important that our celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. and our commitment to end systemic racism not stop on Dr. King’s birthday, but continue throughout the year," Bell said.
"We will be studying ‘The 1619 Project’ published this past year by The New York Times. We will gather on Wednesday nights to discuss several of the articles in the project."
The project’s namesake is August 1619, when a ship appeared off Point Comfort, a coastal port in the English colony of Virginia, carrying more than 20 enslaved people from the African nations of Ndongo and Kongo.
The slaves were sold to the colonists, marking the beginning of the system of chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. America was not yet America, but this was the moment it began.
"The 1619 Project" was introduced in the Aug. 18, 2019, The New York Times Magazine, a collection of journalism and historical inquiry that examines the many aspects of contemporary American life that can be traced back to slavery.
For information, call (630) 896-1033.

Senate rejects Trump impeachment trial witnesses that Susan Collins backed

Texto completo: The U.S. Senate on Friday voted to reject calling witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial despite yes votes from both of Maine's senators including Republican Susan Collins, formally paving the way for the president's near-certain acquittal.
The result is likely to thrust the issue further into Collins' 2020 re-election campaign amid an aggressive Democratic effort to flip her seat in a blue-leaning state. Early this month, she was working with a small group of Republican senators and leaders in a bid to at least ensure a vote on whether witnesses would be called.
While signaling her Friday vote for weeks, Collins also voted with Republicans to quash the efforts of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, to ensure witnesses from the beginning of the trial, citing a desire to stick to the order of operations in Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial.
Collins formally announced that she would vote in favor of witnesses on Thursday night, saying that additional testimony would "give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity." Her office didn't immediately answer a question about any particular witnesses she would have voted to allow.
Democrats are now likely to point to Collins' earlier witness votes, though they would have fallen short with her support. In a statement, Marie Follatyar, a leader of Mainers for Accountable Leadership, a liberal group that has organized against Collins, said the senator "has failed to be who she says she is and we will vote her out."
"If she votes to acquit the president after this sham process, any credibility she had left as an independent voice for Maine will be gone," said Kathleen Marra, the chair of the Maine Democratic Party.
Only one other Republican -- Mitt Romney of Utah -- joined Collins in Friday's vote. It put them and minority Democrats two votes shy of the 51 required to call witnesses, which could have stretched the trial for days or weeks and put former White House national security adviser John Bolton before senators.
Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who voted with Democrats, called the vote "nothing less than an abdication of our responsibilities, an asterisk on these proceedings, and a stain on our institution" in a statement.
An unpublished manuscript from Bolton twice roiled the trial, though Republicans have been able to brush past it so far. On Sunday, The New York Times reported that it revealed Trump had told Bolton in August 2019 that a hold on military aid to Ukraine was tied to the country launching investigations into Democrats.
The newspaper also reported Friday that Bolton writes Trump asked him to call new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to persuade him to meet with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was planning to go to Ukraine to coax the Ukrainians to investigate the president's political rivals. Trump largely denied both of Bolton's claims.
They relate to the articles of impeachment against Trump by House Democrats, which allege that the president abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in 2020, and that the president obstructed the House's investigation.
Under an agreement voted on Friday night, the trial will resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting would be Wednesday, the day after Trump's State of the Union speech. Collins hasn't said how she will vote then, while King said on Friday that he is likely to vote to remove the president from office.
Only one of the four Democrats running for the nomination to face Collins in a June primary -- lobbyist Betsy Sweet of Hallowell -- committed to supporting Trump's removal when the Bangor Daily News surveyed candidates in December.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Friday night's results "a tragedy on a very large scale." Protesters' chants reverberated against the walls of the Capitol.
But Republicans said Trump's acquittal is justified and inevitable.
"The sooner the better for the country," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant. "Let's turn the page."
The next steps come in the heart of presidential campaign season before a divided nation. Democratic caucus voting begins Monday in Iowa, and Trump gives his State of the Union address the next night. Four Democratic candidates have been chafing in the Senate chamber rather than campaigning.
Key Republican senators said even if Trump committed the offenses as charged by the House, they are not impeachable and the partisan proceedings must end.
"I didn't need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing," retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a late holdout, told reporters Friday at the Capitol. "But that didn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense."
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she, too, would oppose more testimony in the charged partisan atmosphere, having "come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.'' She said, "The Congress has failed."
Eager for a conclusion, Trump's allies nevertheless suggested the shift in timing to extend the proceedings into next week, acknowledging the significance of the moment for senators who want to give final speeches.

Texto completo: Weinstein says he hired private eyes 'for days like this'
NEW YORK - Harvey Weinstein is defending his use of a private spy agency that allegedly dug up dirt on his accusers, saying Thursday he did it "for days like this."
The unscripted remark came as the former Hollywood producer left his New York City trial, where the woman he's charged with raping is set to testify today.
Weinstein, who's been more apt to engage with reporters in recent days, was responding to a question asking why his private lawyers hired Black Cube, a firm founded by former analysts from Israeli intelligence agencies.
Thursday's court session ended with brief testimony about Weinstein's contract with Black Cube. His relationship with the firm was explored in Ronan Farrow's book about the Weinstein saga, "Catch and Kill."
Prosecutors say Black Cube investigators working on Weinstein's behalf used fake identities to gather information on his accusers, with the ultimate goal of thwarting the publication of stories about the film producer's alleged sex offenses.
Weinstein, 67, turned to Black Cube in 2017 as The New York Times and The New Yorker were pursuing stories about his behavior with women. Those stories, published in October 2017, spawned the #MeToo movement.
Jurors on Thursday also saw an email from Weinstein to someone at Black Cube reading: "Red flags are the ones of interest" - what prosecutors say was a reference to list of names marked in red to identify accusers.
They included "Sopranos" actress
Annabella Sciorra, who testified last week that Weinstein overpowered and raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s.
As prosecutors start to wind up their case, they are turning today to the woman whose rape allegation is at the heart of some of the more serious charges against Weinstein, who insists any sexual encounters were consensual.
At the same time, Weinstein's lawyers are preparing to grill her with warm emails she sent him after the alleged assaults that they say belie any victimization.
The woman, whom The Associated Press is not naming, alleges Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in March 2013, when she was a 27-year-old aspiring actress.

Suburban legislator shakes up DFL senators with leadership bid

Texto completo: Susan Kent was a young marketing manager in 1994 when she helped land RC Cola a deal to sponsor "MTV Beach House," a monthslong programming push that blended live tapings with experiential advertising. The theme of the campaign? "Shake things up."
"Go for the alternative, make a new choice," she told the New York Times of the marketing message.
Now, 25 years later, the Woodbury resident is making a similar pitch to her colleagues in the Senate DFL Caucus.
Kent, a two-term DFL senator from Woodbury, is challenging Senate Minority Leader Tom Bakk for his caucus leadership post. The move, which caught some political insiders off guard, is seen by many as an audacious one. Bakk, a longtime fixture in Minnesota Democratic politics who has led the caucus for nearly a decade, is considered one of the Capitol's most skilled power brokers. And the challenge comes at a fraught time, as Senate Democrats gear up efforts to try to flip Republicans' 35-32 majority in November.
The outcome of the vote, possibly Saturday, is uncertain. Kent's challenge highlights long-simmering geographic and ideological tensions inside the caucus and Democratic Party more broadly. Bakk is seen a bastion of the DFL's receding political power in the Iron Range, while Kent, an assistant minority leader, represents the caucus' growing suburban delegation. While support of mining and opposition to tougher gun laws have increasingly put Bakk at odds with some more liberal factions of his party, further losses in his region could hurt Democrats' prospects both in the Legislature and statewide.
The leadership battle, expected to culminate in a vote at a closed caucus meeting, has largely played out in private. Bakk has repeatedly declined to comment on the situation, and DFL senators have been reluctant to speak openly about the internal deliberations. Word of Kent's challenge, and updates about the vote and timing, surfaced publicly only after internal caucus e-mails were obtained by the Star Tribune.
Kent, in a recent interview at Woodbury's Tamarack Tap Room, said her leadership bid is fueled by a belief that it "matters that all voices feel respected and heard." She declined to address specific differences or issues with Bakk, saying she did not want to speak publicly about internal caucus discussions.
"I'm just saying in terms of my vision and in my experience with different organizations, I think I have a vision of how things can work as a team," she said. "I'm excited about the conversations we're having, however things turn out."
Privately, some leading Democrats and operatives have raised concerns that an election year leadership shift is counterproductive to Democrats' goal of retaking the majority. Kent acknowledged that she's heard those concerns but declined to address them publicly ahead of a vote.
"In this moment, I feel really protective about the conversations I've been having with my caucus," she said. "My aim is always to be constructive."
Unlike Bakk, a native Iron Ranger who was first elected to the Legislature in 1994, Kent is a relative newcomer to the Minnesota political scene. She grew up in New Orleans and studied at the University of Texas at Austin. She met her future husband, a Maplewood native and second-generation 3M employee, while working in marketing in Austin. In the early 2000s, the couple moved to Woodbury with their then-toddler to be closer to family.
Kent always harbored an interest in politics -- she attended her first fundraiser for the Democratic political committee EMILY's List at the late columnist Molly Ivins' home in the early 1990s -- but she said she never thought she would run herself.
A chance meeting
After moving to Minnesota, Kent got involved in her son's school and the PTA, eventually attending lobby days for education funding at the State Capitol. In March 2011, Kent went to meet U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, whose district had recently been redrawn to include Woodbury. It was that night, she said, that she was first encouraged to run for state Senate. She defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Lillie with 52% of the vote.
Women Winning Executive Director Meggie Wittorf, whose organization endorsed Kent in her first bid for elected office, said the Woodbury Democrat "wanted to be a voice for people who didn't have a voice." Her path to political office and focus on issues like increasing school funding and paid family leave have made her "a strong messenger" in recruiting and training more women to run, said Wittorf, whose organization supports more women in leadership but is not actively involved in the caucus fight.
A win by Kent could further shift Democrats' political power away from the Iron Range, which has tilted Republican in recent elections. Her Woodbury district is in some ways emblematic of the suburban swing seats both parties will be fighting to win up and down the ballot in 2020. Kent, who won re-election by just 400 votes in 2016, has attracted a formidable challenger: Mary Giuliani Stephens, a former Woodbury mayor and gubernatorial candidate, announced her plans to run on Thursday.
Some analysts also caution that demoting Bakk could further dim DFL prospects in northern Minnesota, where Democrats lost a congressional seat in 2018.
"If Bakk loses, we're looking at a very challenging environment for Democrats on the Range and throughout the Eighth District," said Aaron Brown, a college instructor who writes extensively on politics in the region. "You've got that increasing sense of more metropolitan-based issues [dominating] -- on some level it's 'how dare they govern with their priorities when we're up here and they don't pay attention to us.' "
Given the stakes and secrecy, the latest bid by Kent has fueled weeks of speculation and hand-wringing in Capitol circles. Bakk postponed a December caucus meeting shortly after Kent gave notice of her plans, citing scheduling conflicts for some members. Rumors of a deal to avoid a vote swirled mid-January, as Bakk and Kent met privately. But last week, Kent notified colleagues that she still planned to seek a vote during this weekend's long-planned meeting.
"From past experience, I have great faith in us and our ability to work through challenging questions and emerge unified," she wrote. "And I assure you I'm committed to that outcome.

Texto completo: DES MOINES - With the Iowa presidential caucus just a few days off, Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg were in full campaign mode Thursday at a time when Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were trapped in Washington embroiled in the impeachment drama surrounding President Donald Trump.
As Iowans prepare to caucus Monday night, the nation's political spotlight has swept into the Hawkeye State. Trump held a rally in Des Moines on Thursday night, and Biden and Buttigieg were popping up everywhere.
"He's more bully than president," Biden said of Trump on Thursday morning in a speech to a crowded gymnasium in Waukee. "And he's having an incredibly divisive effect on our country."
Buttigieg, vying with Klobuchar and Biden for the support of moderate Democrats, positioned himself as a Washington outsider at a town hall meeting in Ames on Wednesday afternoon.
"Watching what's happening with the impeachment, watching what's happening in the Senate -- it gets you down," said Buttigieg, who like Klobuchar has been trying to sell his Midwestern background to Iowans. "It makes you want to watch cartoons instead."
For Klobuchar, the break in the action couldn't come at a more inconvenient time. As more Iowa Democrats make up their minds, she's shown signs of fresh momentum: A statewide poll released Sunday night showed Klobuchar in third place -- her best showing to date.
"My mom has a commitment right now," the Minnesota senator's daughter, Abigail Bessler, told a small group at a "Hot Dish House Party" on Wednesday night in Council Bluffs. By Thursday, Klobuchar's campaign had trimmed the number of planned stops in her final Iowa bus tour from 18 to seven.
Klobuchar has had to find ways to connect with Iowans from half a country away. She's conducted dozens of local and national TV and radio interviews and held three "tele-town halls" that her campaign said have had thousands of people call in.
Sanders and Warren have made similar moves to keep building support in their absence.
They also had family surrogates step in: Sanders' wife campaigned for him in Des Moines on Thursday, while Warren's husband -- and their dog -- made a couple of Iowa stops for her on Wednesday.
But Klobuchar may have the most at stake in Minnesota's Midwestern neighbor, where a strong showing would be her best shot at launching into the top tier of the race. Iowa has been Klobuchar's central focus, having campaigned in all 99 counties and racking up a lengthy list of state legislative endorsements.
Some Biden aides have privately considered pursuing a caucus-night alliance with Klobuchar in which the two campaigns would pledge to help each other in precincts where one falls short of the threshold needed to win delegates, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. But Klobuchar's campaign rejected that idea, and Klobuchar told reporters on Capitol Hill that she is not interested.
After months of languishing among the also-rans, the closing stretch before Iowa has seen Klobuchar move closer to competitiveness. The poll released Sunday by Emerson College/7 News Iowa had her ahead of both Warren and Buttigieg for the first time in any poll of the state (though her lead was well inside the poll's margin of error).
"There's a debate whether it's 'Klo-mentum' or 'Klob-mentum,' " Bessler joked in Council Bluffs, along Iowa's border with Nebraska, where a half-dozen Klobuchar backers gathered to eat a Taconite Tater-Tot Hot Dish that a campaign staffer ferried over from Des Moines.
"We need someone who can beat Trump, and she can do that," said Sheryl McConkey, who hosted the hot dish party. "And she's not all the way to the left."
A night earlier, Klobuchar had been able to jet to Council Bluffs for an impromptu campaign stop on Tuesday night, since the Senate trial adjourned early that day. She asked about 100 supporters to mobilize in her absence. It appears she won't be able to campaign again in the state until Saturday.
"It's not what I planned, but it's what I'm asking you to do," Klobuchar said, likening their roles to the duties that have kept her in D.C. "You are the jurors that are going to decide the candidate to represent us," she said.
For some Iowa Democrats, the jury is still out.
"I'm just not sure if [Klobuchar] will catch on enough to be a viable choice on Monday night. And you want to maximize your vote," said Ron Markway, a retired insurance company manager from Urbandale who came to see Biden speak in Waukee.
His top three choices are Biden, Buttigieg and Warren, Markway said.
Sue Seidenfeld, a retired physician assistant from Waukee, was sitting nearby. She jumped in to mention that she's leaning toward Klobuchar. (Seidenfeld then apologized for being so forward with a reporter -- she'd already done five media interviews this caucus cycle, she said.)
"For me right now it's Klobuchar, then Buttigieg. We're more moderate," Seidenfeld said. Then why did she come to see Biden?
"I've been asked whether or not I'm voting for someone because I like their policies or because I think they can beat Trump," Seidenfeld said. "I really kind of believe Biden could beat Trump. I don't know if Amy can. So that's part of the reason I'm still kind of waffling. It's tough."

Texto completo: Few Minnesotans were shocked at last week's news that metal detectors will go up at entrances to the State Fair.
If anything there was surprise that the fair board hadn't acted sooner. But then it's understandable that officials would cling as long as possible to the gauzy myth of the fair as a joyous gathering of neighbors who share the unifying specialness of living in a state where everyone is above average.
The cold reality is different, of course. Last year's fair ended with a shooting near the main gate that wounded three people followed by a fight that injured a woman and caused a stampede inside the grounds. Police blamed rival gangs.
That incident wasn't the impetus for adding security. Sadly, metal detectors are now standard issue for all major events, and the State Fair, with 2 million visitors a year, is as major as it gets in these parts.
"It's just another layer of security," State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said in announcing the change. "When you have 2 million of your friends and neighbors in one place, you want to make sure that everything is safe and secure and that people feel that way."
That's a major challenge, especially because the wider motivation for tighter security is the broad societal sense of eroding trust.
In recent decades, social scientists have measured the incremental decline in confidence that Americans have in one another and in their institutions. The decline has been steepest since 2017 when trust in government plunged by 14 percentage points, according to a Pew Center survey. Only a third of Americans now trust their government to do "what is right." Faith in media, business, religion, charitable organizations and fellow citizens is falling as well.
Although there's no single root cause, an article in this month's Stanford Social Innovation Review offered a list of prime suspects: public and private corruption, poisonous public rhetoric, rising economic inequality, breakdowns in the rule of law, a perception that individual voices and votes don't matter, a sense that elites have rigged all systems to benefit themselves, and media/social media outlets that spread disinformation to exacerbate division and social grievance.
This "truth decay" lies at the heart of our distrust. Without fact-based consensus, it's difficult for society to hold together. The resulting social dissonance leads to anxiety, fear and insecurity. There's an irony here. Although we live in perhaps the safest era of human history, it doesn't feel that way. The potential for danger is heightened in a country bristling with firearms -- one gun for every man, woman and child, with 67 million left over.
That's 393 million guns altogether. Most are owned and used responsibly, but those that are not too often take lives.
It's popular to believe that our "collapse of confidence," as the conservative scholar Yuval Levin called it in last Sunday's New York Times, can be repaired by figuratively linking arms, building bridges and tearing down walls. Perhaps. But, in the meantime, it makes sense to put in metal detectors.

Oscar's short films are long on quality

Texto completo: I've probably typed some version of "the fictional short films nominated for Oscars this year are a mixed bag" a dozen times, but that phrase doesn't apply in 2020. All 10 are good and several are great.
The five nominees for the animated short prize are especially strong, and with three directed by women, they're a hopeful sign of increased opportunities behind the camera. My favorite is "Dcera (Daughter)," a wordless gem from the Czech Republic that gains in power because it was so evidently handmade. Featuring papier-mch puppets on whose faces you can see the lovingly created creases and paint spatters, it contrasts the artificial look of the stop-motion characters, a woman and her dying father, with realistic backdrops as she reflects on a childhood that she spent trying to connect to him.
Two other nominees also are mostly dialogue-free. From Pixar's program to fund experimental
work by its employees, "Kitbull" is the sweetly familiar tale of two strays, a tiny cat and a timid pit bull, who become buds. "Hair Love" is another upbeat one, although a heart-tugging moment at the end feels unearned. It's about a black girl, being raised by her dad, who tries using online tutorials from a maternal vlogger to help her tame her bountiful (although, frankly, gorgeous as is) hair.
My second-favorite in the category -- and, if I had to guess, the winner -- is "Memorable," an impressive display of animation techniques. Its shifting form is dictated by its story: An elderly artist, who has a memory disorder, is losing his grip on reality. Only marred by his wife's bizarre failure to comprehend what's happening when he can't remember how to eat a banana or doesn't know what a pepper grinder is, "Memorable" finds surprising, poignant ways to illustrate how frightening it would be to gradually disconnect from your own life.
Disconnection also is the theme of "Sister." It may pack in one social issue too many but its tender story has the intimate ring of autobiography as a Chinese man reminisces about the adjustments his family made when his parents brought home his baby sibling.
Coincidentally, "A Sister" is the title of one of the stronger live-action shorts. It opens with a seemingly benign scene of a woman in a car, supposedly calling her sister to chat about child care. Everything we believe about that opening scene changes when "A Sister" shifts to the actual recipient of that call, a baffled French 911 operator who is about to hang up until she realizes the caller is in distress and speaking in code. Not unlike the recent Danish film "The Guilty," which also featured an operator trying to solve a case, "A Sister" is a gripping, real-time fight for survival and understanding.
All five live-action shorts concern protagonists whose lives are changed by a stranger and none is better than the beautifully acted "The Neighbors' Window," written and directed by Marshall Curry, whose Cory Booker documentary, "Street Fight," was a previous Oscar nominee. Maria Dizzia ("Orange Is the New Black") plays a New Yorker who spots her curtain-less neighbors having sex. That leads to the window becoming the equivalent of a reality show that's constantly playing across the street. What she sees causes her to question her own life and gives her new perspective on it.
Frequently, short films are directors' attempts to raise enough money to extend them to feature length. I'd guess that's the case with both "Saria" and "Brotherhood." The former is based on the true story of girls who hatch an elaborate plan to escape an abusive orphanage, a tale that is never less than absorbing but that omits important events and fails to give its supporting characters nuance. "Brotherhood" shares those failings, although it's beautifully made and its spring-loaded plot keeps us engaged as a soldier returns to Tunisia from Syria with a mysterious wife in tow.
The movie that seems likeliest to launch a career is Yves Piat's good-natured "Nefta Football Club, also set in Tunisia. Its two stars are a pair of endearing soccer fans who stumble upon a donkey loaded down with drugs. Mistaking the drugs for laundry detergent, the boys try to peddle it on the way to the story's enormously satisfying conclusion.
A bleak lineup of docs
The documentaries are at times almost intractably grim. The best of the lot is Yi Seung-Jun's "In the Absence," a terse, harrowing, infuriating account of the sinking of the South Korean ferry Sewol that killed more than 300 in 2014. "Life Overtakes Me," directed by John Haptas and Kristine Samuelson, examines resignation syndrome among children of refugee immigrants in Sweden. The story of children who fall into almost coma-like states in reaction to deportation is fascinating, but its telling is affected. The self-explanatory "Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl)" is set in Afghanistan. The approach of the director, Carol Dysinger, aims for dollops of lightheartedness. The activist portrait "St. Louis Superman," directed by Smriti Mundhra and Sami Khan, is inspiring and troubling.

Texto completo: A podcast, you say? You're looking for a podcast? A literary and yet controversial and undoubtedly highly entertaining podcast? Fear not. Here comes Marlon James. The author of "Black Leopard, Red Wolf" (a finalist for a National Book Award) and "A Brief History of Seven Killings" (winner of the Man Booker Prize) has begun a two-month-long podcast with his editor at Riverhead Books, Jake Morrissey. "Marlon and Jake Read Dead People" began Monday and it's not quite as creepy as it sounds. It's a literary conversation about authors who are no longer with us. As the news release puts it, "Authors they like. Authors they hate. … In every episode they'll tell you what they think -- uncensored and with no holds barred. (That's why the authors have to be dead.)" There will be a new podcast each week for the following six weeks. James, a professor at Macalester College, currently divides his time between Minnesota and New York City. He told the New York Times: "I'm not denying there is some fun in talking trash about dead people. They can't attack me on Twitter." LAURIE HERTZEL
Shake it off
Veteran Twin Cities classical-music producer Steve Barnett let us know that we overlooked his connection to a Grammy awarded on Sunday. Mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato won for best classical solo vocal performance for "Songplay." Barnett was the producer; Preston Smith, also of the Twin Cities, was the engineer. Neither receives a Grammy for this project, but Barnett, who earned two Grammys in 2002, was listed on grammy.com as an accompanist on "Songplay." What did he play? "I play shakers on the opening track," he e-mailed.

A capitol prize
HGA, the Minneapolis-based architectural firm, won big in the American Institute of Architects' 2020 AIA Awards with its restoration of the Minnesota State Capitol. The $310 million project, completed in 2017, is one of eight winners in the prestigious international competition, aimed at celebrating the best in contemporary architecture. "A masterful preservation project following all the textbook preservation design steps -- historical research, programming, design, systems integration, and highest levels of workmanship," wrote one juror. "This project transformed the 1905 Minnesota State Capitol, an architectural masterpiece designed by Cass Gilbert, back to 'The People's House' that it was originally designed to be."

That's what friends are for
In town last week to lead his live score for the Mark Morris Dance Group's "Pepperland," Wisconsin-rooted, New York-based jazz pianist Ethan Iverson went out of his way for a longtime pal. Chef Jack Riebel, co-owner of the Lexington in St. Paul, has been diagnosed with cancer. He loves composer Burt Bacharach, so Iverson enlisted Broadway singer Marcy Harriell for a special hour of songs by Bacharach and lyricist Hal David in the Lex's Williamsburg Room last Friday night. Evoking Dionne Warwick, Harriell and friends were deliciously romantic on "The Look of Love," "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" and other classics while Riebel and his wife, Kathryne Cramer, held hands and cuddled. For an encore, Iverson answered a Chef's Special request: a jazzy solo piano rendition of "This Guy's in Love With You."j.B.

Texto completo: Expand gambling, fund roads
On the issue of $30 car tabs and the loss of tax money: What if the legislators drafted a bill to legalize poker machines and expand keno in the bars and restaurants in Washington and use that money after administrative costs to do the roads and highway maintenance? Oregon Lottery makes a ton of money on this. This would be a voluntary tax. You don't have to gamble, but a heck of a lot of people do. The bar owners would make a percentage of money put in. The state would make a lot of money to use on road maintenance. And if you don't like to gamble, don't.
Years ago, a measure was on the ballot for this statewide. The people around Puget Sound turned it down. They said there would be too much gambling around the area. Well, we aren't in Puget Sound. We're in Clark County and we need the funding for our roads. And don't think those bleeding heart liberals will say that if you gamble you will go to hell. You might actually have a good time — and get the roads fixed at same time.

Don't look at my recycling
While I applaud efforts to properly recycle (“Bin there, don't do that,” The Columbian, Jan. 24), the newly launched Waste Connections inspections may be illegal. They would be in Oregon.
In Portland, if you leave your garbage and recycling on the curb, in a container you can't see through, and the lid is down, you're the only one who can sift through it. The Oregon Supreme Court made that decision. In the decision, the court cited two cases, one involving newspaper reporters rooting through a city official's trash, another with police asking a garbage company to bring them some trash that might have evidence in it.
The “don't do that” part might begin with Waste Connections.

Why no bounty on Soleimani?
If Iranian general Qassem Soleimani was such a monster, why didn't President Trump snuff him out sooner? It's not as if that guy had been hiding for years at a compound in Peshawar and just got discovered. Somebody already tried that. Did our government even put a price on his head for bounty hunters? To the best of my knowledge, it did not. Even a $5,000 reward would have been better than nothing. Bear in mind that today's elite-level monsters have multimillion dollar bounties on them. Unless Soleimani was just an imposter, he should have gotten the same treatment.

Trump's many mistakes
To give the current president a pass on his endless deranged, profane, illegal, immoral and irresponsible behaviors on the basis of a strong economy deserves some scrutiny.
President Obama inherited an economy that had gone from a surplus to the brink of failure under George W. Bush. The Obama administration built that economy to a robust standing over the next eight years in spite of an obstructionist opposing party.
Trump inherited that healthy economy from the Obama administration and proceeded to run up the national debt to an unprecedented level, cut or eliminate taxation of the wealthy and has now begun a war with unlimited future costs; not only financial but to life, the environment and property.
There is a price to be paid in ignoring the ravages of climate change. How is it possible to turn a blind eye to the reality of replacing liveable habitats for those displaced here and abroad by fires, flood, drought and tornadoes? And anyone trying to survive without clean air, water or arable land will not lose much sleep over the challenges of Christmas shopping. We must continue to hope that our better angels will prevail in November 2020. There is so much at stake, now and forever.

Trials need witnesses
Picture, if you will: You are a defendant accused of a crime, and you can prove your innocence. You have at least five witnesses that can prove you were nowhere near the scene of the crime. Your attorney asks the judge to call the witnesses that can prove your innocence. The judge says, “Not going to happen.” The judge says your witnesses testimony is all circumstantial evidence even though they were with you at the time the crime was committed. In this case the judge(s) are the Republican senators. They took an oath at the beginning of the impeachment trial to be fair and impartial. Which one of these senators, if they were on trial, would like the same rules followed as they want in this trial? I doubt you will find one. It doesn't matter what “tribe” to which you belong — not allowing witnesses is wrong. Every fair-minded person knows that.
I hope the voters remember this when they vote in November.

More than headaches
Just when you think that Trump could not be more callous, more self-absorbed or more unconcerned about the repercussions of his random decisions, he manages to push the bar to a new low (or high, depending on your scale).
The Iranians responded to the killing of their general by lobbing several missiles at our base in northern Iraq. At first, the report was “no injuries.” Now, however, it has been revealed that 34 service personnel have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Damage to the brain from a concussion can be serious and life-changing. What was Trump's response when that report came out? “I heard they had headaches,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference in Davos, Switzerland. “I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries I have seen.” (“Trump Dismisses Troops' Possible Brain Injuries as ‘Headaches',” The New York Times, Jan. 24).
Good grief. How low can this man go? He obviously does not have a compassionate bone in his body nor does he really care about our military personnel who are fighting on the front lines. All of you Trumpers out there: How proud of him

Texto completo: The U.S. Senate on Friday voted to reject calling witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial despite yes votes from both of Maine's senators including Republican Susan Collins, formally paving the way for the president's near-certain acquittal. But senators moved to push off final voting on his fate to next Wednesday.
The result is likely to thrust the issue further into Collins' 2020 re-election campaign amid an aggressive Democratic effort to flip her seat in a blue-leaning state. Early this month, she was working with a small group of Republican senators and leaders in a bid to at least ensure a vote on whether witnesses would be called.
While signaling her Friday vote for weeks, Collins also voted with Republicans to quash the efforts of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, to ensure witnesses from the beginning of the trial, citing a desire to stick to the order of operations in Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial.
Collins formally announced that she would vote in favor of witnesses on Thursday night, saying that additional testimony would "give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity." Her office didn't immediately answer a question about any particular witnesses she would have voted to allow.
Democrats are now likely to point to Collins' earlier witness votes, though they would have fallen short with her support. In a statement, Marie Follatyar, a leader of Mainers for Accountable Leadership, a liberal group that has organized against Collins, said the senator "has failed to be who she says she is and we will vote her out."
"If she votes to acquit the president after this sham process, any credibility she had left as an independent voice for Maine will be gone," said Kathleen Marra, the chair of the Maine Democratic Party.
Only one other Republican -- Mitt Romney of Utah -- joined Collins in Friday's vote. It put them and minority Democrats two votes shy of the 51 required to call witnesses, which could have stretched the trial for days or weeks and put former White House national security adviser John Bolton before senators.
Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who voted with Democrats, called the vote "nothing less than an abdication of our responsibilities, an asterisk on these proceedings, and a stain on our institution" in a statement.
An unpublished manuscript from Bolton twice roiled the trial, though Republicans have been able to brush past it so far. On Sunday, The New York Times reported that it revealed Trump had told Bolton in August 2019 that a hold on military aid to Ukraine was tied to the country launching investigations into Democrats.
The newspaper also reported Friday that Bolton writes Trump asked him to call new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to persuade him to meet with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was planning to go to Ukraine to coax the Ukrainians to investigate the president's political rivals. Trump largely denied both of Bolton's claims.
They relate to the articles of impeachment against Trump by House Democrats, which allege that the president abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in 2020, and that the president obstructed the House's investigation.
Schumer forced more votes on witnesses in the Senate on Friday evening that were defeated by Republicans, while the vote on removing Trump is set for Wednesday. Collins hasn't said how she will vote then, while King said on Friday that he is likely to vote to remove the president from office.
Only one of the four Democrats running for the nomination to face Collins in a June primary -- lobbyist Betsy Sweet of Hallowell -- committed to supporting Trump's removal when the Bangor Daily News surveyed candidates in December.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

D.C. Memo: Deal or no deal

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week from Washington: The big event in Iowa, a quick impeachment update, and some cannabidiol policy. Let’s get on with this.
The president next door
As she said she would, Sen. Amy Klobuchar is doing two things at once: shifting from long days presiding over an impeachment trial in Washington, D.C., to campaign events in Iowa. She has made more of an effort, and spent more time in Iowa, than any other candidate in the race (save for John Delaney, who just dropped out).
We’re three days from the Iowa Caucus.
The New York Times reports that Former Vice President Joe Biden was weighing an alliance with Klobuchar for the caucus. Candidates have to reach a 15 percent threshold of support or else they are disqualified from caucus sites. Biden was asking Klobuchar to tell her supporters to pick him, should she not qualify for a site.
Vice News Reporter Cameron Joseph caught up with Klobuchar to get her take on the pitch:
“I’m not making any deals,” she said.
One final Iowa poll in this newsletter. This one from from Monmouth, of 544 likely voters, taken Jan 23 to 27. The margin of error is +/- 4.2. The New York Times editorial board endorsement doesn’t appear to have made any dent.
* Joe Biden: 23
* Sen. Bernie Sanders: 21
* Pete Buttigieg: 16
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren: 15
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 10
* Tom Steyer: 4
* Andrew Yang: 3
* Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: 1
What about after Iowa? Klobuchar is counting on a strong showing in the mostly white state, but her polling when it comes to black voters is next to none. In at least one national poll conducted by the Washington Post and Ipsos, she’s polling at 0. Read more at MinnPost.
At the same time, in light of a recent AP investigation into the prosecution of Myon Burrell, who was alleged to have killed thirteen year old Tyesha Edwards, has spurred advocates for Burrel’s innocence to call for Klobuchar to drop out of the race.
“If that man hasn’t done nothing, then he doesn’t need to be in there at all,” Leonard Winborn, Edwards’ stepfather, told the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder , adding that he’s worried Tyesha’s death may have been used by Klobuchar for political capital.
When discussing her history as a prosecutor, Klobuchar has used the case as a positive talking point on her campaign.
From a press release sent by Nekima Levy Armstron g, representing the Racial Justice Network , Minneapolis NAACP , Black Lives Matter Twin Cities , Twin Cities Coalition for Justice for Jamar , and Communities United Against Police Brutality :
“To date, Amy Klobuchar has taken no steps to remedy the wrongful conviction of Myon Burrell. To the contrary, she has used this case while on the Presidential campaign trail to build more political capital. Advocates are calling for Amy Klobuchar to immediately suspend her campaign for President, given her role in sending an innocent Black teenager to prison for life.”
Impeachment update
A brief impeachment update: Senators have now shifted into the question phase, where they are allowed to submit questions to be read by Chief Justice John Roberts, addressed to both the House’s impeachment managers and President Trump’s legal defense team.
Several Republican Senators are pushing for a rapid end to the trial in the coming days, meaning no additional witnesses would be heard.
By the numbers
* $2,000 : The amount former Rep. Rick Nolan’s mostly inactive campaign fund gave Quinn Nystrom , who is running for his old seat against Rep. Pete Stauber in Minnesota’s Eighth. Nolan endorsed Nystrom late last year.
* 1: The amount of days presidential campaigns have left to file their quarterly financial’s with the Federal Election Commission.
* 30% : The number Sen. Bernie Sanders is polling at in California, according to Change Research. The Golden state moved up its primary to Super Tuesday this year, and with 415 delegates up for grabs, it could be consequential in solidifying the race. Delegates will be split candidates those that get at least 15 percent each statewide and candidates that get at least 15 percent in each congressional district.
Easy as CBD
Rep. Collin Peterson wants to make it easier to sell CBD products. Peterson recently authored a new bill that would allow the FDA to regulate CBD products as dietary supplements, opening up the market for the makers of CBD products, and by extension, hemp farmers. Read more at MinnPost.
“One thing that’s kind of holding it back is still a sense that we don’t know where these regulations are going,” said Joe Radinovich, who previously ran to represent the Eighth District in Congress in 2018 and now leads the Minnesota Hemp Association.
“And I think that Chairman Peterson’s bill is a good step.”
In other news
* In 1998, Joe Biden called 100,000 juveniles “predators,” saying they warrant “exceptionally, exceptionally tough treatment.”
* From MinnPost’s Walker Orenstein: What we learned after five days of testimony in the PolyMet hearing.
* The Washington Post suspended a reporter for her tweets about Kobe Bryant, saying “You’re hurting this institution by doing this.” Over 200 Post reporters told leadership they were wrong.
Quote of the week
“We live in a world of vexatious verticals, of crass clickbait, of polarized perspectives and fallacious, fact-free feeds – Knewz is knowing and needed. Knewz nous is in the house,” said a News Corp executive pitching their new aggregate news site: Knewz.
What I’m reading
Astead Wesley at the New York Times: The One About Iowa, Black Voters and Barack Obama
A good piece with bad news for candidates banking on an Iowa slingshot to propel them into other states like South Carolina: “In applying lessons from Mr. Obama’s Iowa victory to the current Democratic primary, Mr. Belcher and other political operatives have grim news for candidates hoping that a win in Iowa can reverse their luck with black and Latino voters across the country: don’t count on it.”
Concepción de León and Alexandra Alter: ‘American Dirt’ Publisher Cancels Book Tour
If you’ve been paying attention to the “American Dirt” saga (look here if not), here’s an update: The book publisher is canceling the tour. Not because people have found the book to be offensive or poorly written, but because “based on specific threats to booksellers and the author, we believe there exists real peril to their safety.”

Senate Rejects Calling Witnesses In Trump Impeachment Trial

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Senate rejected the idea of witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial late Friday, all but ensuring his eventual acquittal. But senators considered pushing off final voting on his fate to next week.
The vote on allowing new witnesses was defeated 51-49 on a near party-line vote.
Despite the Democrats singular focus on hearing new testimony, the Republican majority brushed past those demands to make this the first Senate impeachment trial without witnesses. Even new revelations Friday from former national security adviser John Bolton did not sway GOP senators, who said they’d heard enough.
That means the eventual outcome for Trump would be an acquittal “in name only,” said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a House prosecutor, during final debate. Some called it a cover-up.
The impeachment of the president now lands squarely in an election year before a divided nation. Caucus voting begins Monday in Iowa, and Trump gives his State of the Union address the next night.
Trump was impeached by the House last month on charges the he abused power and obstructed Congress like no other president has done as he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and then blocked the congressional probe of his actions.
The Democrats had badly wanted testimony from John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser whose forthcoming book links Trump directly to the charges. But Bolton won’t be summoned, and none of this appeared to affect the trial’s expected outcome.
In an unpublished manuscript, Bolton writes that the president asked him during an Oval Office meeting in early May to bolster his effort to get Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to a person who read the passage and told The Associated Press. The person, who was not authorized to disclose contents of the book, spoke only on condition of anonymity.
In the meeting, Bolton said the president asked him to call new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and persuade him to meet with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was planning to go to Ukraine to coax the Ukrainians to investigate the president’s political rivals. Bolton writes that he never made the call to Zelenskiy after the meeting, which included acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
The revelation adds more detail to allegations of when and how Trump first sought to influence Ukraine to aid investigations of his rivals that are central to the abuse of power charge in the first article of impeachment.
The story was first reported Friday by The New York Times.
Trump issued a quick denial.
“I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelenskiy,” Trump said. “That meeting never happened.”
Key Republican senators said even if Trump committed the offenses as charged by the House, they are not impeachable and the partisan proceedings must end.
“I didn’t need any more evidence because I thought it was proved that the president did what he was charged with doing,” retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a key hold out, told reporters Friday at the Capitol. “But that didn’t rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she, too, would oppose more testimony in the charged partisan atmosphere, having “come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.’’ She said, “The Congress has failed.”
Eager for a conclusion, Trump’s allies nevertheless suggesting the shift in timing to extend the proceedings into next week and it shows the significance of the moment for senators in casting votes in only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.
The situation remained fluid, but senators have indicated they want more time to publicly debate the charges and air their positions on the coming vote, according to a Republican familiar with the proposal but unauthorized to discuss it. The person was granted anonymity.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made the offer to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the person said. Senators were considering it while the proceedings were underway on the Senate floor. Schumer had not yet agreed to it.
Under the proposal, the Senate would resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final voting would be Wednesday.
To bring the trial toward a conclusion, Trump’s attorneys argued the House had already heard from 17 witnesses and presented its 28,578-page report to the Senate. They warned against prolonging it even further after House impeached Trump largely along party lines after less than thee months of formal proceedings making it the quickest, most partisan presidential impeachment in U.S. history.
Some senators pointed to the importance of the moment.
“What do you want your place in history to be?” asked one of the House managers, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger.
Trump is almost assured of eventual acquittal with the Senate nowhere near the 67 votes needed for conviction and removal.
To hear more witnesses, it would take four Republicans to break with the 53-seat majority and join with all Democrats in demanding more testimony.
But that effort tell short. Just two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine are expected to join most Democrats in voting to seek more witnesses and documents.
Chief Justice John Roberts, in the rare role presiding over the impeachment trial, could break a tie, but that seems unlikely.
Murkowski noted in announcing her decision that she did not want to drag the chief justice into the partisan fray.
Protesters stood outside the Capitol as senators arrived on Friday, but few visitors have been watching from the Senate galleries.
Bolton’s forthcoming book contends he personally heard Trump say he wanted military aid withheld from Ukraine until it agreed to investigate the Bidens. Trump denies saying such a thing.
The White House has blocked its officials from testifying in the proceedings and objected that there are “significant amounts of classified information” in Bolton’s manuscript. Bolton resigned last September - Trump says he was fired - and he and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.

Texto completo: Americans are watching with alarm as a new coronavirus spreads in China and cases pop up in the United States. They are barraged with information about what kinds of masks are best to prevent viral spread. Students are handing out masks in Seattle. Masks have run out in Brazos County, Texas. Hang on.
I've worked as an emergency room physician. And as a New York Times correspondent in China, I covered the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 during which a novel coronavirus first detected in Guangdong sickened more than 8,000 people and killed more than 800. My two children attended elementary school in Beijing throughout the outbreak.
Here are my main takeaways from that experience for ordinary people on the ground:
Wash your hands frequently.

Coronavirus outbreak: What travelers need to know
*
US advises no travel to China, where virus deaths top 200
Don't go to the office when you are sick.
Don't send your kids to school or day care when they are ill, either.
Notice I didn't say anything about masks. Having a mask with you as a precaution makes sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak, as I was when out reporting in the field during those months. But wearing it constantly is another matter. I donned a mask when visiting hospitals where SARS patients had been housed.
I wore it in the markets where wild animals that were the suspected source of the outbreak were being butchered, blood droplets flying. I wore it in crowded enclosed spaces that I couldn't avoid, like airplanes and trains, as I traveled to cities involved in the outbreak, like Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
You never know if the guy coughing and sneezing two rows ahead of you is ill or just has an allergy. But outdoors, infections don't spread well through the air.
Those photos of people walking down streets in China wearing masks are dramatic but the subjects appear uninformed. And remember if a mask has, perchance, intercepted viruses that would have otherwise ended up in your body, then the mask is contaminated. So, in theory, to be protected maybe you should use a new one for each outing.
The simple masks are better than nothing but not all that effective because they don't seal well. For anyone tempted to go out and buy the gold standard, N95 respirators, note that they are uncomfortable. Breathing is more work.
It's hard to talk to people. On one long flight at the height of the outbreak, on which my few fellow passengers were mostly epidemiologists trying to solve the SARS puzzle, many of us (including me) wore our masks for the first couple of hours on the flight. Then the food and beverage carts came.
Though viruses spread through droplets in the air, a bigger worry to me was always transmission via what doctors call "fomites," infected items. A virus gets on a surface _ a shoe or a doorknob or a tissue, for example. You touch the surface and then next touch your face or rub your nose. It's a great way to acquire illness. So after walking in the animal markets, I removed my shoes carefully and did not take them into the hotel room. And, of course, I washed my hands immediately.
Remember, by all indications SARS, which killed about 10% of those infected, was a deadlier virus than the new coronavirus circulating now. So keep things in perspective.
Faced with SARS, many foreigners chose to leave Beijing or at least to send their children back to the United States. Our family stayed, kids included. We wanted them with us and didn't want them to miss school, especially during what would be their final year in China. But equally important in making the decision was that the risk of getting SARS on an airplane or in the airport seemed greater than being smart and careful while staying put in Beijing.
And we were: I stopped taking my kids to indoor playgrounds or crowded malls or delicious but densely packed neighborhood Beijing restaurants. Out of an abundance of caution, we canceled a family vacation to Cambodia — though my fear was less about catching SARS on the flight than that one of the kids would have a fever from an ear infection upon our return at a border screening and would be stuck in a prolonged quarantine in China. We instead took a vacation within China, where we carried masks with us but didn't use them except on a short domestic flight.
In time, during the SARS outbreak, the government shut down theaters and schools in Beijing, as it is doing now in many Chinese cities because these viruses are more easily transmitted in such crowded places.
But there was also a lot of irrational behavior: Entering a village on the way to a hike near the Great Wall, our car was stopped by locals who had set up a roadblock to check the temperature of all passengers. They used an oral thermometer that was only minimally cleaned after each use. What a great way to spread a virus.
The International School of Beijing, where my children were students, was one of the few in the capital _ perhaps the only one — that stayed open throughout the SARS outbreak, though the classes were emptier, since so many kids had departed to their home countries.
It was a studied but brave move because a parent at the school had gotten SARS at the very beginning of the outbreak on a flight back from Hong Kong. She recovered fine, but it was close to home and families were scared.
The school instituted a bunch of simple precautionary policies: a stern note to parents reminding them not to send a child to school who was sick and warning them that students would be screened for fevers with ear thermometers at the school door. There was no sharing of food at lunch. The teacher led the kids in frequent hand washing throughout the day at classroom sinks, while singing a prolonged "hand washing song" to ensure they did more than a cursory pass under the faucet with water only.
If a family left Beijing and came back, the child would have to stay at home for an extended period before returning to class to make sure they hadn't caught SARS elsewhere.
With those precautions in place, I observed something of a public health miracle: Not only did no child get SARS, but it seemed no student was sick with anything at all for months on end. No stomach bugs. No common colds. Attendance was more or less perfect.
The World Health Organization declared the SARS outbreak contained in July 2003. But, oh, that those habits persisted. The best first-line defenses against SARS or the new coronavirus or most any virus at all are the ones that Grandma and common sense taught us, after all.

Dr. Jessica Johnson: Kobe Bryant didn’t waste a moment

Texto completo: When I saw updates on my phone about the tragic helicopter crash that killed NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna Bryant, and seven other passengers last Sunday, like many, I did not believe the news at first. I waited until the major media outlets began breaking the story and then came to grips with what seemed so unbelievable.
I happened to be watching a modern basketball classic, “Coach Carter,” in between church services. “Coach Carter” came out in 2005, and I later thought how Kobe had begun to cement his basketball legacy by this time, having already won three NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers in just six years in the league. As I was reading tributes and condolences pour out on social media later that evening, I noticed a Scripture reference that several of my friends posted on Facebook. It was James 4:14, which says: “Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.”
At just 41, Kobe had only lived “for a little time.” The lives of those traveling with him to attend a game for his Mamba Sports Academy girls’ basketball team were also painfully cut short. Gianna and her Mamba teammates Alyssa Altobelli and Payton Chester were looking forward to playing in the game and having fun with their friends. Altobelli’s parents, John and Keri Altobelli; Chester’s mother, Sarah Chester; Christina Mauser, an assistant girl’s basketball coach; and pilot Ara Zobayan had probably organized their work and family schedules for this week. I’m sure Kobe, being a cultural icon and thriving businessman navigating his way through his post-NBA life, had thoroughly outlined his 2020 plans for most of his upcoming ventures.
Time ran out for him much sooner than any of us would have anticipated.
When the world pauses to pay homage to a deceased celebrity whom pretty much everyone refers to on a first-name basis, it’s obvious that such distinction indicates a wise and efficient use of time in reaching a sterling level of success. Thinking about life being transient like a “vapour” or a mist calls for a deep reflection on what you have done thus far with the years God has blessed you to see. How are you using your time?
In his 41 years, Kobe achieved more than what most will in an entire lifetime. His NBA accolades - five championship rings, a 12-time All-Defensive Team selection and a two-time Finals MVP, to name a few - easily place him as the best player of his generation. But his charity work during and after his basketball career was equally impressive. Kobe was generous with his money and resources through global philanthropy to help disadvantaged youth, and he established a family foundation with his wife, Vanessa Bryant, to assist the homeless in Los Angeles. He had a passion for investing in young people, and he was pouring what he called a “tactical” strategy of successful precepts into them through his Mamba Academy and undertaking of juvenile literature.
Kobe often spoke about instilling confidence in Gianna and her teammates through the toughness of sports competition, hence providing them with a “mamba mentality.” One of his 2019 children’s books, “The Wizenard Series: Training Camp,” a fictional story about the struggle of five poor basketball players to rise above low expectations, was a New York Times No. 1 bestseller.
One of the most notable qualities about Kobe was his keen awareness of just how important time is. I believe he came to know this more deeply after rededicating his life to God during one of his lowest moments, after he was accused of rape in 2003. Although the case was settled out of court, Kobe’s reputation was severely damaged. Twelve years later, Kobe would say in an ESPN interview that he wanted to be remembered as “a player that didn’t waste a moment.”
There were definitely few wasted moments in Kobe’s life, and this brings to mind another well-known Scripture, Ecclesiastes 3:2, which says that there is “a time to be born and a time to die.” We don’t know how much time we will be allotted during our lives, but Kobe’s untimely death is a stark reminder that we need to make the most of it.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — You can call John Bolton a lot of things — bully, brawler, neocon — but not many would call him a dummy.
This is especially true at this precise moment, when he may be the only person to emerge a winner from Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.
To many Americans, the name John Bolton likely conjures up little more than a walrus-ian mustache to which the man’s loyalty never wavers. Perhaps he keeps the little shrub to remind his upper lip not to curl with contempt toward those whose opinions differ from his own. As his friends and former colleagues will tell you, Bolton tends to be an absolutist with an affinity for black and white and no love for elitists or fools.
They will also tell you that he is above all a man of principle who would never sacrifice himself for the most-unprincipled president in modern history. Whether he is subpoenaed to testify before the Senate is virtually irrelevant considering that we already know what he knows.
For one thing, excerpts of his forthcoming book’s manuscript were recently leaked to The New York Times. Among revelations therein: Then-national security adviser Bolton and Attorney General Bill Barr discussed “concerns that President Trump was effectively granting personal favors to the autocratic leaders of Turkey and China.”
Also, Bolton writes that Trump explicitly made military aid to Ukraine contingent upon investigations into political foe Joe Biden and his son Hunter. But, then, we already knew that, too.
The rest is theater, which, frankly, has become a bit dull. Witnesses-to-the-rescue is a tempting notion, but it seems unlikely that Bolton’s contribution would sway the Republican-majority Senate to convict the president.
So, why the backlash against Bolton from the White House, other than his apparent disloyalty? What else does he have? The White House knows exactly what he has since Bolton sent a copy of his manuscript for its review a month ago.
The more apt observation may be that he’s got nothing to lose and, based on his long history of government service, everything to maintain. That is, his reputation for principle over loyalty. Bolton’s repertoire in government service, which began soon after his graduation from Yale Law School (on scholarship), is that of a bulldog — stubborn, fearless, prone to infighting and concerned foremost with the sovereignty of the United States. He was an America First gladiator long before Trump thought of it as a foreign policy imperative.
Among other things, Bolton has nothing but contempt for the United Nations, which made his turn as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush a bit unusual. Before that, while serving in the State Department, he helped Bush un-sign the U.N. “Rome Statute,” which created the International Criminal Court for war crimes, lest other countries use the treaty as a cudgel against America and our troops. In a 2018 speech to the Federalist Society, Bolton referred to this as “one of my proudest achievements.”
In some conservative circles, bets are that Bolton wouldn’t just be willing to testify, as he has said he would if subpoenaed by the Senate. He’d love to. One way or the other, his story, supported by the paper trail he created as national security adviser, will come out. It won’t be good for Trump, but it won’t necessarily hurt him in the immediate future. Everybody knows what Trump is. The only issue is whether enough senators care enough to convict him.
Trump and his loyalists have accused Bolton of trying to sell a book and make money. Note to the unpublished: Well-known writers such as Bolton typically are paid upfront by their publisher in the form of an advance. Whether the book makes money, thereafter, is primarily the concern of the publisher. Bolton’s book’s value has been reported in the neighborhood of $2 million.
Thus, money isn’t likely Bolton’s chief motivation. Far more compelling to someone like Bolton is what one might call principled justice. Trump embarrassed Bolton by ignoring his advice and then firing him by tweet (Bolton maintains he quit) for an offense that ought really to make Bolton’s point-of-pride list: He objected to Trump’s genius idea to host the Taliban at Camp David near the anniversary of 9/​11.
So, no, Bolton isn’t only selling books. He’s saving his legacy — and giving back to Trump as good as he got. Testifying before the Senate might just make his day — in a Dirty Harry kind of way. But the book otherwise will stand when history passes judgment on a man who picked the right side.

Texto completo: Left-wing billionaire George Soros argued that control of Facebook should be wrested from Mark Zuckerberg because he believes the CEO wants President Trump reelected.
The 89-year-old made the argument in a Friday column in the New York Times titled "Mark Zuckerberg Should Not Be in Control of Facebook."
"Facebook should be judged by what it does, not what it says," he said. "I repeat and reaffirm my accusation against Facebook under the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. They follow only one guiding principle: maximize profits irrespective of the consequences."
The billionaire also pointed to Zuckerberg's meetings with Trump as raising "serious questions."
Soros concluded his article by stating that Zuckerberg "should not be left in control of Facebook." He did not specify how control should be taken away from the company's founder.
Earlier this month, Soros made a similar argument in the Wall Street Journal, where he said Facebook was helping Trump because the president "will work to protect" them.

Texto completo: The United States carried out an airstrike against one of al Qaeda’s most powerful terrorists, and officials expressed confidence that he is dead.
Officials said that a January airstrike might have killed 41-year-old Qassim al Rimi, the leader of al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen, according to the New York Times. The terrorist leader was reportedly tracked for months using intelligence and aerial surveillance.
Authorities are wary to announce that Rimi was killed, as other al Qaeda and Islamic State leaders have been targeted with airstrikes in the past and survived. The State Department have a $10 million bounty on Rimi’s head.
Rimi was involved in a number of terrorist plots throughout the years, including a 2008 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. He was also connected to the 2009 plot by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to bring down a U.S. airliner using explosive-lined underwear.
Qasim al-RimiAccording to an official with knowledge of the operation, the CIA learned of Rimi’s location in November from an informant in Yemen, which allowed him to be tracked using drones.
The CIA declined to comment on the situation when contacted by the Washington Examiner.
The apparent airstrike comes the same month as a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. The 62-year-old general was the leader of the Quds Force, an elite special operations unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops during the Iraq War.
In October, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was killed during a top-secret operation in Idlib province of northwest Syria, where he detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and his three children.

Leak throws Bolton deeper into Ukraine scandal hours before impeachment witness vote

Texto completo: A fresh leak from John Bolton's book came just hours before the Senate is expected to vote against calling witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial.
Drafts of Bolton's book say Trump instructed his then-national security adviser to get involved in pressuring Ukraine to obtain damaging information about the president's political rivals, as reported by the New York Times on Friday.
The directive was made during an Oval Office meeting in May, attended by White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House counsel Pat Cipollone (who is now leading Trump's impeachment defense), and Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, two months before Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call to help collect information that would be politically advantageous to him. A whistleblower complaint about this phone call gave rise to impeachment proceedings.
Bolton wrote that Trump ordered him to call Zelensky and urge the Ukrainian leader to meet with Giuliani, who was working to collect damaging information on Democrats such as former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who was employed by a Ukrainian gas company, in the name of fighting corruption. Bolton claimed he never made the call.
Giuliani denied the Oval Office conversation as described in Bolton's manuscript ever took place. “It is absolutely, categorically untrue,” he told the New York Times.
The disclosure is certain to influence senators' thinking as they prepare to vote on whether to call for witnesses and documents on Friday. Democrats who levied two Ukraine-related articles of impeachment against Trump have used the leaks from Bolton's book draft to push centrist Republican senators to vote in favor of summoning Bolton and other Trump administration officials to testify during the Senate trial.
Democrats have wanted Bolton to testify ever since his former aide, Fiona Hill, testified to House impeachment investigators that Bolton opposed the Ukraine pressure campaign. She said Bolton wanted no part of what he described as a "drug deal" that fellow Trump administration officials were "cooking up."
Further raising the stakes was House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat, revealing on Wednesday that Bolton contacted him in September "unprompted" urging him to look into the recall of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Giuliani and a Ukrainian prosecutor accused of being a political enemy of the White House. Engel and other Democratic leaders began the impeachment investigation one day after that discussion.
Last night, a key Republican senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, announced he would not vote in favor of calling additional witnesses to testify, making it more likely the trial could be over by this weekend. With a handful of centrist Republicans expressing interest in calling witnesses, GOP leaders are trying to avoid a tie vote. While a motion to call witnesses would fail in a tie, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could intercede to break the tie, although most senators believe that is unlikely.
The leaks from Bolton's manuscript have prompted speculation about who is behind them. Trump's allies pointed to the National Security Council, where Bolton's book draft had been submitted for a standard review in December. Bolton, who left the White House in September, has said he would testify if subpoenaed, but Trump has threatened to block his testimony.

Brexit: Splendid and tragic, brave and cowardly

Texto completo: Britain's secession from the European Union is such a huge event in history that it’s impossible to say any one true thing about it.
Of course, pundits pretend to sum up Brexit. It’s mere populism. "Messy and self-destructive,” said the New York Times. “We love Europe; we just hate the European Union. It’s as simple as that,” said Nigel Farage, who ran the anti-EU project for 30 years and is finally triumphant (and typically mean-spirited).
No reader of the Washington Examiner will be guilty of the crudity of mind of mere pundits. Brexit's final implementation is tragic, splendid, perverse, brave, spiteful, glorious: It transcends simple accounts. In Wallace Stevens's poem Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird, he writes:
I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after
Politically, Britons faced a binary decision: remain or leave. Historically, we can all have broader sympathies. I do not know which to prefer.
The following 13 things, which seem to contradict one other, are simultaneously true.
I
Brexit risks economic self-harm.
II
Brexit is extraordinarily bold. Academe, the press, and almost the entire political class all backed "remain" at the 2016 referendum. Their warnings were extreme. The electorate chose to be audacious and has not repented.
III
Brexit is the partial defeat of a heroic experiment.
In 1494, Europe entered a period of general warfare. Systems of alliance dragged the whole continent into more and more enormous wars, eventually enveloping the planet. After 1945, there was an attempt to transform warlike Europe into a zone of peace and economic fusion. This imaginative, daring endeavor succeeded, astonishingly. Today sees its great reverse. Russian President Vladimir Putin waits to conduct us back to before 1945.
IV
Brexit is less sharp a change than it looks. The final settlement will probably be “soft," with Britain closely aligned with EU law.
V
Brexit’s old hat, the culmination of a 70-year debate.
As post-war Western Europe coalesced into what was then disarmingly called the Common Market, the British establishment thought, in a troubled, discontented way, that it would be better, or less bad, to be in the EU than out. Many in Labour were against joining such a capitalist club. Most Conservatives were glumly in favor, and the oily Edward Heath signed the accession treaty in 1972. Three years later, with the entire national press (but one communist rag) campaigning "yes," along with the leadership of both main parties, a referendum approved continued membership.
Yet, the minority did not accept defeat, and, within a few years, it became clear the debate hadn’t been laid to rest even among the elite. Britain had not signed up to any one thing. The whole point of the “European project” is that it’s not a thing: It’s “progress towards an ever-closer union among the peoples.” Every judder along the track toward a federal Europe disconcerted the English. Membership of the Union could never be settled. Rancor tended to grow. Government after government was ruined by a stale, intractable debate voters were keen to put behind them.
VI
Brexit is the correction of a historic mistake.
When Britain first applied for membership, it was twice vetoed by Charles de Gaulle. Brentry would threaten the “break-up of the community,” he said, claiming the Anglo-Saxon realm “does not at present belong to Europe as we have started to build it.” Under de Gaulle’s weaker successor, the British were allowed in, but de Gaulle was right: They’ve always been troublesome, bad tenants who never felt at home and might now make good neighbors.
VII
Brexit is an example of anti-immigration populism, like the election of Trump.
VIII
Brexit is nothing of the sort. In many circles, it’s still not respectable to be "leave" — all "leavers" (including, let us recall, a third of Britain’s racial minorities) must be xenophobic half-wits, they say. That’s a snobbish delusion.
Equally deluded is the idea that all "remainers" are unpatriotic decadents for whom England is just one region in post-national social democracy.
The millions have more complex convictions.
IX
Brexit undoes a fraud. The ruling class was disingenuous about selling accession to the people. The diplomat who negotiated British entry, the wonderfully named Sir Crispin Tickell, admits, “From the beginning, we were joining more than just a free trade area. Heath knew the EU would evolve towards a political union. We didn’t have great arguments about the ultimate destination.” The politicians assumed the people could be brought around to the thrill of integration. The people resented being hoodwinked.
X
Brexit is an existential expression of national destiny. Since the 16th century, when England lost its last continental possessions and evolved a religion separating it from both Catholic and Protestant Europe, there’s been a sense of the uniqueness of the English nation. Scotland and Wales, inasmuch as Wales is a nation, don’t share this. In William Shakespeare’s Brexit-y play Cymbeline, the islanders decide that they won’t pay tribute to the continent. “Statist though I am none, you shall hear the legions sooner landed in our not-fearing Britain than any penny paid.” The British win, then, in an Olympian gesture, accede to Europe anyway:
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar, And to the Roman empire; promising To pay our wonted tribute.
Sovereignty, the ultimate freedom of England to choose its fate, matters more than legal and financial arrangements.
XI
In the course of the 20th century, every nation in Europe fell to the Wehrmacht or the Red Army, or both, was itself involved in atrocious aggressions, or survived through ignoble neutrality. After 1945, the harrowed, ruined states of Europe clung together. The kind thing to say is that they wanted to surmount history, especially the Nazi concept of inevitable war, an endless “class struggle between nations.” The unkind thing to say is that they’d lost their right to nationhood and knew it. A few days ago, the European Commission’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, asserted, “The European dimension gives more strength to our own national patriotism.” That’s an axiom or truism in Brussels, not in England, which generally looks back on 20th-century history without shame.
XII
Brexit represents a failure of the party system. The Conservatives were not held to account by Labour under the unspeakable Jeremy Corbyn, a Marxist republican pacifist sullenly hostile to the EU (as to NATO). He wouldn’t let Labour take a position. Johnson’s Brexit won by default.
XIII
Brexit’s an opportunity for the European Union. The federalist project has just lost its main obstacle. We may live to witness the emergence of the world’s richest megastate, the revival of the Roman Empire.

Texto completo: Republican Sen. Mitt Romney is not keen on President Trump’s attacks on impeachment witnesses but conceded that the insults are working.
“He has made a career of trashing people by tweet,” Romney, 72, told the New York Times.
“It is part of his shtick and it’s working for him,” the Utah senator said of Trump’s attacks on his former national security adviser, John Bolton. “I think it’s unfortunate.”
In recent days, Trump, 73, has trashed Bolton, who has undermined the president's and his legal team’s claim that the freeze of security aid to Ukraine was not connected to a pressure campaign to get the country to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Trump also lashed out at witnesses in the House impeachment investigation.
Bolton, 71, made the allegations in his forthcoming book, bolstering calls for him to testify in the Senate trial. The Senate is expected to vote Friday on whether to call witnesses in the trial. Most Republicans are not in favor of having witness testimony ahead of a vote on whether to acquit or convict Trump on obstruction and abuse of power charges.
Trump has argued that Bolton’s allegations contain nothing of substance but has also asserted that any possible testimony from him would threaten national security.

Texto completo: The chairman of CPAC announced that Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is "formally not invited" to the conservative group's annual conference this year.
Matt Schlapp, the head of the American Conservative Union, said Romney is not allowed at the event after the Utah Republican voted in favor of summoning witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. Romney was one of two Republicans who joined 47 Democrats in supporting the motion, which failed to pass on Friday.
"BREAKING: The 'extreme conservative' and Junior Senator from the great state of Utah, @SenatorRomney is formally NOT invited to #CPAC2020," Schlapp wrote in a tweet, which featured a photo of a troubled-looking Romney.
Tweet
It is unclear whether Romney was expecting to attend this year's CPAC next month.
Romney recently slammed Trump's critical statements about former national security adviser John Bolton, whom Democratic House impeachment managers have fought to have as a witness. Bolton announced earlier this month he would testify if subpoenaed, and excerpts of his unpublished book have leaked to the press in recent days containing allegations of Trump pressuring Ukraine to help collect information on his political rivals.
“He has made a career of trashing people by tweet,” Romney told the New York Times. “It is part of his shtick, and it’s working for him."
This CPAC news comes after Utah state Republican Rep. Tim Quinn introduced a bill that would allow voters to recall a sitting U.S. senator. Quinn, 56, claimed the bill was unrelated to Romney but said it was a “good mechanism in place to make any senator, current or future, a little more accountable to those who elected him or her.”

Texto completo: The mayor of the city where the coronavirus outbreak began offered to resign and said his handling of the epidemic was “not good enough.”
Mayor Zhou Xianwang, mayor of the Chinese city of Wuhan, said that he and the local Communist Party chief Ma Guoqiang would be willing to step aside over their response to the now-global outbreak of coronavirus.
“If people want to pursue accountability [about the lockdown] and the public has a strong opinion, we are willing to step down,” Zhou said.
Zhou locked down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, after the infection began to gain steam. He defended his decision to do so as a way of stopping the spread of the illness to other provinces and countries, although it has still spread to every single region of China and to over a dozen countries.
More than 9,700 people have been infected and 213 have died from the respiratory illness as of Friday, with 5,806 of the cases occurring in Hubei province where Wuhan is located.
Zhou said his administration has done an “unsatisfactory” job of disclosing information about the outbreak.
“Our names will live in infamy, but as long as it is conducive to the control of the disease and to the people’s lives and safety, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will bear any responsibility,” Zhou said, according to the New York Times.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that there has been a case of the virus spreading from one person to another in the United States. Also Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the burgeoning outbreak a global public health emergency.

2020 Democrats are kidding themselves: Trump is a phenomenal campaigner

Texto completo: Andrew Yang was asked in a recent interview about what his “strategy” would be should he find himself in a general election debate with President Trump. His answer revealed the type of thinking among Democrats that's going to lose them the election.
“I think I can eviscerate Trump in a debate stage in part because I would make him seem ridiculous,” said Yang. “I can poke fun at him in a way that other candidates can’t.”
This not unlike Joe Biden’s trite promise to beat Trump “like a drum.”
What Democrats don’t seem to understand, or perhaps do understand but won’t admit out loud, is that Trump is a great campaigner. And as absurd a figure as he might be, he’s not a joke.
Let’s not forget what happened in 2016. Trump, against all odds, tore through a field of highly accomplished Republicans, nearly all of whom were at one point believed to have been mint options for the nomination. One by one, senators, governors, and even a Bush were shredded to pieces on the campaign trail and on the debate stages.
Then there was Hillary Clinton, and for all her problems, she was still an exceptionally qualified candidate for president. She had all of the national media, all of Hollywood, and all of the Democratic Party at her side. Whom did Trump have? No one. Well, no one except the voters.
And remember the debates? Here’s a headline the New York Times ran on Oct. 9, 2015: “In Debate, Hillary Clinton will display skills honed over a lifetime.”
Here’s one from Vox on Sep. 27, 2016: “5 reasons debates showcase Hillary Clinton at her best.”
That turned out swimmingly for Clinton.
The truth is that Trump was successful because he’s quick, he's forceful, and he has a message that appeals to a lot of people. Yang saying he’d deflate him because he knows how to “poke fun” is laughably naive. Trump is going to be incredibly difficult to defeat in the general election.
By the way, on Election Day in 2016, his favorability rating was 38%, according to the RealClearPolitics average. He still won, and that was before he even had a political record to show off. He has one now, and his job approval rating sits at 45%.
Good luck poking fun.

John Bolton's impeachment role shouldn't whitewash his awful legacy

Texto completo: Amid all the impeachment drama, the New York Times just dropped another bombshell. According to newly released accounts of former national security adviser John Bolton’s memoir, Trump asked Bolton as early as May, two months before the infamous call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, to help Rudy Giuliani score a meeting with the Ukrainian president.
The latest leak from Bolton’s book comes a day after House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel revealed that he received a call from the career foreign-policy hawk expressing concern about the dismissal of U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
Regardless of how the impeachment drama shakes out, there's an alarming subtext to this narrative: In the span of just weeks, Bolton has turned from everybody’s favorite villain to a paragon of integrity — just because he can help the case against Trump. It’s almost as if the last 25 years of bad foreign policy judgment never happened.
We must not forget that Bolton is an uber-hawk who has been wrong on nearly every foreign policy question for decades. His aggression makes former Vice President Dick Cheney look like a wuss.
You may remember Bolton as the man who has made it his personal mission in life to destroy almost every arms control agreement the United States has signed over the last 30 years. Bolton has argued against half a dozen accords and opposes pretty much any agreement that doesn’t result in unilateral disarmament on the other side, dismissing it as weak appeasement. In Bolton’s frame of mind, the equation is a simple one: Why negotiate when you could punch the other side in the face?
You may also remember Bolton for his ingenious ideas for how to deal with other countries.
He's the genius who in 2011 openly flaunted the idea of assassinating Muammar Gaddafi — as if a missile to the head would solve Libya’s problems. In 2012, Bolton recommended finding secular-minded rebels in Syria that Washington could support militarily, politically, and economically in order to kick Bashar Assad out of the presidential palace in Damascus, Syria. The fact that nobody could tell you with any degree of certainty at the time that Syria would turn into a thriving, peace-loving democracy after Assad fled into exile was apparently a trivial matter.
Or perhaps you remember Bolton as the author of ludicrous op-eds such as “To stop Iran’s bomb, bomb Iran,” a catchy bumper-sticker title meant to attract eyes on his central argument: Let's stop wasting our time doing that whole "diplomacy" thing and just drop a few bunker-buster bombs on the country's nuclear facilities. And don't forget Bolton's brilliant take in the Wall Street Journal advocating for a preemptive attack on North Korea.
None of this even touches on Bolton’s personal traits, which can't exactly be described as endearing.
Accounts suggest that Bolton was prone to hissy fits and righteous indignation when somebody dared to provide an assessment that deviated from his own. At one point in 2002, Bolton tried to get an intelligence analyst removed for pointing out that his position on Cuba’s biological weapons program did not square with the evidence.
The fact that Bolton is now being treated by the liberal media and many Democrats as honesty and virtue personified should not erase his horrible record. The longtime bureaucrat is free to sell his memoir, but we would be doing the public a grave disservice by allowing impeachment to polish his legacy.

Bloomberg filing offers glimpse into finances and over $200 million spent on campaign in five weeks

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's first campaign finance filing of his high-cost Democratic presidential bid shows a glimpse into how he has spent great gobs of his vast $60 billion personal fortune while seeking the White House.
From his November campaign launch through the end of December, Bloomberg, 77, gave more than $200 million and raised no money from individual campaign contributions, according to a Federal Election Commission filing on Friday. His campaign spent more than $188 million in that time and had $12 million in cash on hand at the end of December.
The Bloomberg campaign said it has an additional $33 million worth of invoices from last year that will be paid in the next filing period, bringing the total spending during that time to about $221 million.
The campaign reported spending more than $600,000 on private jet travel and a payment of $14 million Bloomberg LP, the financial services company that Bloomberg founded, which the New York Times said "was intended to cover expenses the company was likely to incur as a result of Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign, including compensation for Bloomberg LP employees who have recently joined his political operation."
Some of Bloomberg's staff include individuals who left news and editorial positions at Bloomberg News, which is owned by Bloomberg LP. The publication has said it will not investigate Bloomberg or any other Democratic presidential candidates but will report on normal daily campaign activities and policy positions.
“We are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together," Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement Friday. “Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.”
Data on ad spending suggests that Bloomberg has given his campaign millions more in the month of January. According to ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics, his campaign has placed nearly $300 million in television and digital ads, including an $11 million ad set to air during the Super Bowl on Sunday.
Due in part to his late entry into the race, Bloomberg skipped competing in the first four early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, instead concentrating on a high-cost campaign that focuses on winning delegates who vote in March 3 Super Tuesday states and beyond.
Bloomberg has also increased his campaign staff to more than 1,000 people and is paying top dollar for low-level field organizers: $6,000 per month, compared to the $3,500 per month that former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pay campaign staff members at the same level.
The campaign also sold $245,569 of campaign merchandise at cost, which does not count as a campaign contribution.
Because he is self-funding his campaign, Bloomberg has not qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debates, which required a minimum threshold of individual donors. But the DNC lifted its donor requirement for the Feb. 17 debate in Nevada, making way for Bloomberg to qualify if he secures the required numbers in polls.

Texto completo: Kobe Bryant's pilot was employed by a company that is legally not allowed to have its pilots fly in bad weather conditions, according to multiple sources.
Ara Zobayan, 50, was licensed to fly in low visibility, but the charter company he worked for was not certified, sources told the New York Times on Thursday. The revelation calls into question whether Zobayan was flying legally when the helicopter went down Sunday, killing him and eight other people, including Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna.
Claudia Lowry, an owner of a charter service based in the same airport as the charter company Kobe's pilot used, said that Zobayan's company was not certified to fly in bad conditions. "It’s not worth it, we don’t fly in that kind of weather anyway," Lowry said. "And most of the time, the weather is good."
A second source confirmed Kobe's pilot could not fly legally in bad weather conditions. The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the company's certification in the wake of the crash.
"We take a broad look at everything in an investigation — man, machine, and the environment," a representative for the NTSB said earlier this week. "And weather is just a small portion of that."
Zobayan said he was trying to get above the clouds moments before the helicopter slammed into the side of a mountain at 185 mph. There was fog that day that had grounded the Los Angeles Police Department and the local sheriff's department.

Timothy Egan: Bernie Sanders can’t win

Texto completo: Watching “Succession,” the HBO show about the most despicable plutocrats to seize the public imagination since the Trumps were forced on us, made me want to tax the ultrarich into a homeless shelter. And it almost made a Bernie Bro of me.
That’s the thing about class loathing: It feels good, a moral high with its own endorphins, but is ultimately self-defeating. A Bernie Sanders rally is a hit from the same pipe: Screw those greedy billionaire bastards!
Sanders has passion going for him. He has authenticity. He certainly has consistency: His bumper-sticker sloganeering hasn’t changed for half a century. He was, “even as a young man, an old man,” as Time magazine said.
But he cannot beat Donald Trump, for the same reason people do not translate their hatred of the odious rich into pitchfork brigades against walled estates.
The United States has never been a socialist country, even when it most likely should have been one, during the robber baron tyranny of the Gilded Age or the desperation of the Great Depression, and it never will be. Which isn’t to say that American capitalism is working; it needs Teddy Roosevelt-style trustbusting and restructuring. We’re coming for you , Facebook.
The next month presents the last chance for serious scrutiny of Sanders, who is leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire. After that, Republicans will rip the bark off him. When they’re done, you will not recognize the aging, mouth-frothing, business-destroying commie from Ben and Jerry’s dystopian dairy. Demagogy is what Republicans do best. And Sanders is ripe for caricature.
I’m not worried about the Russian stuff — Bernie’s self-described “very strange honeymoon” to the totalitarian hell of the Soviet Union in 1988 and his kind words for similar regimes. Compared to a president who is a willing stooge for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, a little vodka-induced dancing with the red bear is peanuts.
Nor am I worried about the legitimate questions concerning the candidate’s wife, Jane Sanders, who ran a Vermont college into the ground. Again, Trump’s family of grifters — from Ivanka securing her patents from China while Daddy made other promises to Beijing to Don Jr.’s using the White House to leverage the family brand — give Democrats more than enough ammunition to return the fire.
The elder Trump bragged about sexual assault, paid off a porn star and ran a fraudulent university. He sucks up to dictators and tells a half-dozen lies before he puts his socks on in the morning. A weird column about a rape fantasy from 1972 is not going to sink Bernie when Trump has debased all public discourse.
No, what will get the Trump demagogue factory working at full throttle is the central message of the Sanders campaign: that the United States needs a political revolution. It may very well need one. But most people don’t think so, as Barack Obama has argued. And getting 2 million new progressive votes in the usual area codes is not going to change that.
Give Sanders credit for moving public opinion along on a living wage, higher taxes on the rich and the need for immediate action to stem the immolation of the planet. Most great ideas start on the fringe and move to the middle.
But some of his other ideas are stillborn or never get beyond the fringe. Socialism, despite its flavor-of-the-month appeal to young people, is not popular with the general public. Just 39% of Americans view socialism positively, a bare uptick from 2010, compared to 87% who have a positive view of free enterprise, Gallup found last fall.
What’s more, American confidence in the economy is now at the highest level in nearly two decades. That’s hardly the best condition for overthrowing the system.
“Medicare for All,” once people understand that it involves eliminating all private insurance, polls at barely above 40% in some surveys, versus the 70% who favor the option of Medicare for all who want it. Other polls show majority support. But cost is a huge concern. And even Sanders cannot give a price tag for nationalizing more than one-sixth of the economy.
A ban on fracking is a poison pill in a must-win state like Pennsylvania, which Democrats lost by just over 44,000 votes in 2016. Eliminating Immigration and Customs Enforcement, another Sanders plan, is hugely unpopular with the general public.
Sanders is a rigid man, and he projects grumpy old man rigidity, with his policy prescriptions frozen in failed Marxist pipe dreams. He’s unlikely to change. I sort of like that about his character, in the same way I like that he didn’t cave to the politically correct bullies who went after him for accepting the support of influential podcaster Joe Rogan.
Democrats win with broad-vision optimists who still shake up the system — Franklin Roosevelt, of course, but also Obama. The Ds flipped 40 House seats in 2018 without using any of Sanders stringent medicine. If they stick to that elixir they’ll oust Trump, the goal of a majority of Americans.
Democrats lose with fire-and-brimstone fundamentalists. Three times, the party nominated William Jennings Bryan, the quirky progressive with great oratorical pipes, and three times they were trounced. Look him up, kids. Your grandchildren will do a similar search for Bernie Sanders when they wonder how Donald Trump won a second term.

Paul Krugman: Trump’s team flunks microbe economics

Texto completo: How frightened should you be about the coronavirus? I’m no epidemiologist, but what I’ve seen looks pretty scary. It doesn’t help that the Trump administration, as part of its general war against science and expertise, has seriously reduced America’s capacity to respond if we do face a dangerous pandemic.
It also looks quite possible that the virus will inflict a lot of economic damage — even if it doesn’t kill you, it might kill your job. And one special source of concern is that top officials in the Trump administration are talking nonsense about the economic threat.
So, about that economic threat: Many people are drawing parallels between the coronavirus and the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also originated in China. Like the current outbreak, SARS led to the imposition of economically disruptive quarantines, which appear to have had a significant if temporary adverse effect on China’s economy, and a modest negative impact on the world economy as a whole.
We still don’t know whether the coronavirus is more or less dangerous than SARS. What we do know is that the global economic implications of a pandemic in China are likely to be much more severe now than they were then, for the simple reason that China is a vastly bigger player than it used to be.
In 2002, China was still in the early stages of its great economic surge; it accounted for only around 8% of global manufacturing value added, far less than the shares of the U.S., Japan and Europe. Today, however, China is the workshop of the world, accounting for more than a quarter of global manufacturing.
Now, you might think that this implies an upside to China’s troubles, that disrupting China’s vast manufacturing sector would offer opportunities to producers in other countries, including the U.S. That is, you might think this if you knew nothing about 21st-century economics.
Sure enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on Fox Business on Thursday morning to declare that he “didn’t want to talk about a victory lap,” but that the coronavirus “will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.” By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail Collins’ readers voted him Donald Trump’s worst Cabinet member, and (2) why Trump’s trade war has been such a failure.
What Ross and his colleagues apparently still don’t understand — although some of them may be getting an inkling — is that modern manufacturing isn’t like manufacturing a couple of generations ago, when different countries’ industrial sectors were engaged in fairly straightforward head-to-head competition. These days we live in a world of global value chains, in which much of what any given nation imports consists not of consumer goods but of “intermediate” goods that it uses as part of its own production process.
In such a world, anything that disrupts imports — whether it’s tariffs or a virus — raises production costs, and as a result if anything hurts manufacturing. Indeed, a recent study by the Federal Reserve found that Trump’s tariffs, which were concentrated on intermediate goods, have reduced, not increased, manufacturing output and employment. Sure enough, while overall economic growth in 2019 was decent (not great), manufacturing is in a recession. (And the uncertainty created by the trade war may explain why business investment is down despite a huge cut in corporate taxes.)
As I said, some of Trump’s people seem to have gotten an inkling here. Last week the White House basically admitted that tariffs on steel and aluminum have done more harm than good, hurting industries that use these materials. But the administration’s answer isn’t a reconsideration of its policies — it is to impose more tariffs, on a wider range of products.
Which brings me back to the coronavirus. Let’s leave aside the public health issues — although the Trump administration has clearly left us much less prepared than we had been to deal with these issues if they become serious — and focus on the economics.
What we can say is that if the virus seriously disrupts Chinese production, its impact on the U.S. economy will be like an extreme version of Trump’s trade war, except without any compensation in the form of tariff revenue. And the two things we know about the trade war are that it has been an economic bust and that Trump’s officials still appear clueless about why it has been a bust.
Bear in mind that so far Trump has been remarkably lucky. Aside from Hurricane Maria — which he mishandled, and in which thousands of Americans died — he has faced essentially no crises, domestic or foreign, that weren’t of his own making. And he has surrounded himself with the gang that couldn’t think straight, which raises severe doubts about how well he would handle a crisis that he didn’t create himself.
If Wilbur Ross’ boneheaded remarks Thursday are any indication — and I fear they are — the Trump administration is even less prepared to deal with the economic fallout from a possible pandemic than it is to deal with the public health crisis. Be afraid.

Texto completo: China’s leaders sometimes seem 10 feet tall, presiding over a political and economic juggernaut that has founded universities at a rate of one a week and that recently used more cement in three years than the United States did in the entire 20th century.
President Donald Trump has hailed China’s president, Xi Jinping, as a “brilliant leader,” and Michael Bloomberg says Xi is “not a dictator.” But we’re now seeing the dangers of Xi’s authoritarian model, for China and the world.
The first known coronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. 1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhan’s medical circles. That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.
And act decisively they did — not against the virus, but against whistleblowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. The police reported giving “education” and “criticism” to eight front-line doctors for “rumormongering” about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.
China informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a “patriotic” virus that only struck foreigners.
Wuhan’s mayor said he wasn’t authorized to discuss the virus until late this month. In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and didn’t take precautions.
The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.
Partly because the government covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able to gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and protective gear. Some doctors were reduced to making goggles out of plastic folders.
One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi’s China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental organizations, the legal profession and others that might provide accountability. These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and off they were tolerated until Xi came along.
I conducted a series of experiments on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised by what I could get away with — but no longer. Xi has dragged China backward in terms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight.
For the same reason that Xi’s increasingly authoritarian China bungled the coronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine flu virus that since 2018 has devastated China’s hog industry and killed almost one-quarter of the world’s pigs.
Dictators often make poor decisions because they don’t get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you. Senior Chinese officials have told me that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must dispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real mood.
For this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes. He mishandled and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the reelection of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over worsening relations with the United States and many other countries.
The coronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, and one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is confining about one million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health care.
Viruses are challenges for any country, and it’s only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does. It’s a credit to China’s system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United States, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than Cambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health.
But, with a dose of humility, let’s get over any misplaced admiration some Americans have for Xi’s authoritarian model.
The Chinese social contract has been that citizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet China’s economy is now as weak as it has been in three decades — and the coronavirus will sap growth further. Xi is not living up to his end of the bargain, and this is seen in the anger emerging on Chinese social media despite the best efforts of censors.
I don’t know if Xi is in political trouble for his misrule, but he should be. He’s a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are paying a price.

Texto completo: Men and women are primarily motivated by self-interest. No other partial truth has done as much damage as this one.
If you base your political and social systems on the idea that the autonomous self-interested individual is the basic unit of society, then you will wind up with an individualistic culture that widens the maneuvering room between people but shreds the relationships and community between people.
You will wind up with a capitalism in which superstar performers get concentrated in superstar cities and everybody else gets left behind. In a system based purely on competitive individual self-interest, those who are advantaged get to race out further ahead year by year. The sense of common community and equal dignity is annihilated.
This is the flaw of unrestrained liberalism, what the radicals call “neoliberalism” or “late capitalism.” And they are not entirely wrong.
Populists on the right and the left look at this current reality and they come to a swift conclusion: The game is rigged! Liberalism is a con! Then they come to a different conclusion. The essential logic of society is not actually individuals seeking their self-interest. It’s groups struggling for power. Society is an arena where certain groups crush other groups.
On the Trumpian right it’s the coastal cultural elite trying to crush and delegitimize the white Christian patriots of the heartland. On the cultural left it’s the whole Michel Foucault legacy. Language is a tool the oppressor class uses to permanently marginalize the oppressed. On the economic left it’s the Bernie Sanders class war. The greedy capitalist class rigs the system and immiserates the working class.
The populist narratives differ but all have the same underlying structure. We’re locked in a life-or-death struggle of oppressor vs. oppressed groups. It’s Us versus Them — the good people here and the bad people there. The problems in society didn’t just happen; they were consciously engineered by The Evil Other, who must be broken. Our very existence is at stake!
If the anthropology of unrestrained liberalism is the autonomous individual making his own way, the anthropology of populism is warrior ants in a ruthless tribal war. These are very different views of human nature, but they have something in common: Both narratives make us miserable!
In one, life is isolation, inequality and the feeling of being invisible. In the other, it’s malice, fear and constant war. And that’s because both of these political tendencies are wrong about human nature. They create societies that pulverize who we are and are made to be.
Human beings didn’t evolve into the world’s dominant species because we are more autonomous. We didn’t do it because we’re more vicious in tooth and claw. We thrived as a species because we are better at cooperation.
We evolved complex social networks in our brains to make us better at bonding, teaching and collaborating. We don’t cooperate only to get things we want individually. Often, we collaborate to build shared environments we can enjoy together. Often, we pick a challenge just so we can have the joy of collaborating. Relationships are ends to themselves.
Thus, the best future for American politics is not based on individual competition or group war. It’s based on this narrative: We are an incredibly diverse society that got good at collaboration because we had to. The best future politics puts collaborative pluralism, weaving, at the center.
That means, first, electing leaders who are masters at cooperation. No offense, but if you’re supporting Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders this year, collaboration skills are not high on your list of priorities.
Second, it means infusing cooperative weaver values into all of our organizations. There’s a fantastic community organization in Baltimore called Thread that has a few core competencies that shape its culture. We’d be in much better shape if every organization in America lived out these values:
Show all the way up. Be fully present, honest and vulnerable in all interactions. Recognize your own value. Push through discomfort to connect deeply with others.
Learn from all voices. Most of our challenges are complex. It takes every perspective to see an issue whole. Assume people have the best of intentions, and actively focus on the value they bring. Be intentional about being with those different from you.
Treat relationships as wealth. Human bonds are the chief resource of your organization. Recognize the inherent value of each person and meet each person where she or he is.
Fail forward. Life is iterative. Your vision is not always the answer, but rather a step in a creative learning process. Set up feedback mechanisms that support change and personal growth. Dogma won’t get you to the solution. Openness and adjustment will.
The third task of weaver politics is reforming institutions so they encourage collaboration. Some of our institutions, like Congress, have been completely subsumed by tribal warfare. Other institutions, as Yuval Levin writes in his book “A Time to Build,” are no longer formative places where we learn and serve; they have become platforms individuals use to broadcast their supreme selves.
Still other institutions have become dehumanized. Our schools, hospitals, prisons and welfare systems don’t embed people in thick relationships. They treat them as units to be processed and shoved out the door. Still other institutions cease to exist. Why do we still not have a national service program?
America has an enormous task of institutional reform ahead of it, just as it did in the Progressive era.
The fourth and final task of this kind of politics is transformative policies that directly address our most serious divides. For example, reparations are a way to acknowledge the wrongs inflicted on African-Americans and to begin to heal that breach. Congressman Ro Khanna has a proposal that would show rural America that everyone has a place in the new economy. He would fund research and technology hubs throughout the country — a land grant college system for the 21st century.
The politics of weaving grows out of the acknowledgment that there is no dominant majority in America. There is no moderate center. Your group will never pulverize and eliminate your opposing group. There’s no choice but to set up better collaborative systems across difference. This is not a problem, it’s an adventure.
Yes, human beings are partly selfish and self-interested. But we are also supremely social and collaborative. This is the part we have to work on now.

Texto completo: A half-hour before a Bernie Sanders rally Saturday night in Iowa, a line snaked around the nearly 900-seat Ames City Auditorium, but no one else was being let in: The theater was full.
Inside, the Grammy-winning indie rock band Portugal. The Man was playing. Rows of people were assembled on risers behind the musicians, waving Bernie signs. Sanders fans, most of them young, crowded the aisles; The Iowa State Daily reported that 1,400 people had crammed into the auditorium, with another 400 in an overflow room. The air buzzed with the intoxicating collective energy unique to social movements on the rise.
Mr. Sanders isn't just running the most economically left campaign; he's running the most unapologetically left campaign, period. And it's surging, with Mr. Sanders leading in recent polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
It's no longer far-fetched to think that he could be the Democratic nominee.
There are no moral or intellectual comparisons between Mr. Sanders and Donald Trump, but there are structural similarities between the Sanders campaign and the one Mr. Trump ran in 2016. Mr. Trump thrilled conservatives with his unembarrassed embrace of far-right figures disdained by mainstream Republicans. He inspired alienated men on the internet to mobilize behind him. Party elites wanted to stop him, but his solid core of support allowed him to romp through a fractured field.
The parallels with Mr. Sanders are obvious. He's running a campaign steeped in the ethos of an anti-establishment left and benefiting from elite Democrats' failure to coalesce around someone else. An outsider who long refused to join the party whose nomination he's seeking, he appeals to people who distrust most political institutions, the mainstream media very much included.
Obviously, Mr. Trump won, so there's something to be said for aping some of his strategies. But the Sanders juggernaut still scares me. As Ezra Klein recently pointed out in The New York Times, the brute demographics of American politics make Democrats more electorally dependent on centrists than Republicans are.
Right now, several polls show Mr. Sanders beating Mr. Trump, and a few show him beating Mr. Trump in some swing states by more than anyone else. Still, I'm terrified that those numbers won't survive endless attack ads about Mr. Sanders' radical past.
The economic inequities that Mr. Sanders rails against are very real, but most Americans - including most Democrats - say the economy is good, and a fortune would be spent to convince them that Mr. Sanders would crash it. Socialism may be newly current among the young, but polls suggest that it's still anathema to the old.
But Sanders supporters have plenty of reasons to discount these anxieties. Polls are on their side. Their movement feels exhilarating, the fulfillment of their most fervent political hopes in view. Centrist predictions about which candidates are viable have failed over and over again.
"We keep hearing this argument about electability, or nominating safe candidates, and we keep losing," said Derek Eadon, a 36-year-old former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party who endorsed Mr. Sanders this month.
Mr. Eadon, who was previously with Julian Castro's campaign, didn't take Mr. Sanders seriously in 2016. Two things changed since then. A painful nerve disease forced Mr. Eadon to become intimate with the absurdist horror of America's health care system. And he said he saw Mr. Sanders expanding the electorate. "His ability to keep bringing in new people, and people that have not been involved before, is just such a strength electorally," said Mr. Eadon.
This is the paradox helping to fuel Mr. Sanders' rise: The more he attracts people who are heedless of traditional electability concerns, the more electable he looks.
Last week, Dalhi Myers, a conservative-leaning African American elected official in South Carolina, switched her support from Joe Biden to Mr. Sanders. Despite her affection for Mr. Biden, Ms. Myers, a member of the Richland County Council, had grown concerned by what she saw as an absence of grassroots enthusiasm for him. "I look at the Sanders campaign and what they're doing to motivate people on the ground, and it's working," she told me.
No one knows if all this excitement will translate into the votes Democrats need. And no one knows if Democrats can win without it.

Texto completo: Rometty to step down as IBM chief executive
Ginni Rometty is stepping down as chief executive of IBM. Ms. Rometty, who became CEO in 2012, struggled to achieve growth at the technology giant as it made the transition to new fields like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. She will be replaced in April by Arvind Krishna, who now runs the company's cloud computing business.
Juul faces reckoning after marked down investment
For Juul Labs, the troubled king of vaping, the blows keep coming. Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group, which poured nearly $13 billion into the vaping startup in late 2018, valuing it at $38 billion, said it had marked down its investment for a second time by $4.1 billion. That leaves the value of its 35% stake at just $4.2 billion - or about a third of its initial worth.
Unilever reviews future of Lipton tea, ponders sale
Lipton owner Unilever is weighing a sale of one of its best-known brands. The Anglo-Dutch giant initiated a review of its global tea business, which includes the more than century-old label and generates sales of almost 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion). The move comes after the company's slowest quarterly growth in a decade. Unilever is following a consumer shift to coffee.
Nordstrom latest big retailer to sell second-hand items
Nordstrom will begin selling second-hand apparel online and in its New York flagship store this week, the latest attempt by the 119-year-old company to appeal to changing consumer tastes. It joins Macy's, J.C. Penney and Madewell, among others, in carving out a place for used clothing, shoes and handbags alongside new ones.

Austin Bay: Virus demon bedevils Xi’s dictatorship

Texto completo: While meeting with a World Health Organization official in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping conceded that the coronavirus epidemic presented “the Chinese people” with a struggle. “The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,” Xi said. Xi added that the Beijing communist government would “release information on the virus in a ‘timely’ manner.”
Read “timely” as “judged politically convenient by a Communist Party dictatorship confronting economic contraction and political resistance from Hong Kong and Taiwan that Beijing fears could spread to mainland China.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656846" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Austin-Bay-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
Yes, “demon” is a metaphor for a pathogen capable of killing millions. However, it is a demon the dictatorship’s repressive policies animate and tolerate in lieu of free communication.
The coronavirus (medical shorthand: 2019-nCoV) began infecting human beings in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province) sometime in December 2019.
Time marches on. As I write this column, medical investigators find evidence that mid-November may be a more accurate date for the devil’s eruption.
The WHO has (so far) refrained from calling the epidemic a global emergency. The senior WHO official who met Xi praised the dictatorship’s response to the epidemic. But here’s the frame for understanding the WHO: The WHO walks a diplomatic precipice when it engages authoritarian regimes. Democracies like the U.S.? No.
Does China respect the UN, which oversees the WHO? Only when it benefits. Proof: The Chinese dictatorship ignored the UN Hague court ruling on the Philippines’ claim against Chinese territorial and resource theft. China signed the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty — but completely ignored the court’s decision.
Beijing does disdain international norms it cannot bend to its own benefit.
2019-nCoV, however, is beyond Xi’s dictatorial control. China’s dictatorship may awe Free World idiots, but it cannot intimidate a pathogen.
The coronavirus and its potential consequences of mass death expose the dictatorship’s brittleness. If you prefer, substitute “incompetence masked by police intimidation and lack of free expression” for “brittleness.”
Brutal authoritarian political control exacts overt and covert systemic costs. Western commentators — The New York Times’ Tom Friedman is a particularly smarmy example — admire authoritarian China’s alleged skill at solving major problems that dithering Western democracies cannot. What really dazzles Friedman and his ilk is the regime’s one-command-solves-it pose. Information control, especially control of dissent, bolsters this fraud.
Since 1980, China has made extraordinary economic progress, but its government’s destructive decisions are telling. The notorious one-child policy produced a demographic devil. What Western admirers touted as a farsighted plan to promote zero population growth killed millions of baby girls, skewed female-male sex ratios and, as of 2010, began creating a worker shortage.
Doctors in China and several Asian countries — the virus is on the verge of savaging Thailand — advocate isolating infected patients. The Great Firewall of China isolates the Chinese people from global information access and sharing. Beijing demands its citizens use state-sponsored social media in lieu of global alternatives. Isolation from information sharing hinders angry citizens from criticizing the communist leaders.
But this system isolates Chinese leaders from bad news — like mass illness — that caring human beings must share.
China’s government penalizes free information access and transmission. The regime’s despicable Social Credit Rating system collects data on individuals using cellphones, public video cameras, internet and travel activity, and neighborhood gossip. Security operatives analyze the gobbledygook, looking for — get ready — signs of anti-government behavior.
In communist China, an individual or even a respected doctor in a research bureau reporting on contaminated food, much less a possible epidemic outbreak, is conceivably guilty of anti-government behavior. Said brave soul is subject to fines, travel restrictions, public shaming and perhaps prison.
Why? Because the Chinese Communist Party can dismiss the initial warning as illegal criticism of the party.
As the party bigwigs dither, a deadly pathogen kills.

Texto completo: In what turned out to be his last sit-down interview, Kobe Bryant shares frustrations about exciting projects that moved. so. slow. Amid coronavirus fears, major airlines suspend travel to mainland China. And a popular oceanfront tree in the Central Coast learns a painful lesson in overexposure.
It's Arlene Martínez, with news to wrap up your week.
But first, your dry January is just about up. What will you do with all that money you saved?
In California is a daily roundup of news from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms and beyond. Click here to get this straight to your inbox Monday through Friday.
Coronavirus: A quarantine, travel bans and more
Delta, American and United suspended flights to mainland China amid pressure from employee unions and as the U. S. State Department warned Americans not to travel to the country because of the coronavirus outbreak.
People who have visited mainland China in the last two weeks won't be allowed onto roughly 270 cruise ships, those represented by the industry's largest trade organization said.
195 U. S. passengers who arrived from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began are under quarantine in California while they're screened for coronavirus. The group, none of whom have symptoms of the virus, is being held at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County.
Amid the coronavirus scare, colleges and universities work to ensure students remain healthy and no one gets stigmatized. At one campus with ties to a case of the virus, class is in session.
Two people in Ventura County are being tested for coronavirus, health officials confirmed Friday.
#SaveTheLoneOak in the Pismo Preserve
Lone Oak, as the coast live oak is called, has called the bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean home for hundreds of years. But the tree is learning the term "overexposure. "
The eagerly anticipated Pismo Preserve, a 900-acre area of trails for babies, bikes, horses and dogs, recently opened to an as-expected phenomenal reception. Lone Oak has paid the price.
Five days in, managers of the preserve went public in asking people to step back. "Trampling her roots, leaning on her trunk, and sitting in her branches for the perfect 'gram' will guarantee a much shorter life for this amazing tree," the Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo wrote in an Instagram post. "Instead of turning the Lone Oak into our Giving Tree, let’s give her the life she deserves. "
The post asked people to keep a safe distance when photographing the legend. There is no gentle way to sit on Lone Oak, it notes.
And since they brought up The Giving Tree, is it a tale of unconditional love or unhealthy self-sacrifice?
Families call for gender-neutral bathrooms
At Santa Paula High School in Ventura County, the male and female bathrooms are always kept unlocked. But if students want to use a single-person bathroom, they have to ask someone for a key.
That isn't sitting right with some parents and LGBTQ advocates who say the single-person stalls should be kept unlocked for the safety of everyone. Students fear harassment in gender-specific restrooms, to the point they limit their liquid and food intake so they don't have to use them, several said during a recent school board meeting.
"We can't continue to wait," parent Patty Zavala told Santa Paula's elected officials. "These students can't continue to not use the restrooms. "
Zavala said she cautions her 8-year-old son, who is gender non-conforming, to sometimes avoid wearing dresses for fear of his safety or being mocked in the restroom.
Kobe was 'just getting started'
In Kobe Bryant's final sit-down interview, USA Today reporter Mark Medina asked a routine question: What's your next 5, 10 years look like? Kobe's answer had a lot of parts. Medina said: "He felt like he was just getting started. "
More on Sunday's crash: How this helicopter safety device might have saved Kobe Bryant and eight others.
What else we're talking about
The Virginia attorney representing Tulare County Congressman Devin Nunes in several suits against the media and Twitter has a history of using questionable tactics in litigation. He also refused to leave his residence when served with notice to vacate.
Here's an update on where the six lawsuits Nunes filed in '19 stand.
Coachella Valley's casino market is growing. Here's how it compares to Reno.
Is less traveling a better thing? It is if emissions and climate change are high on your list of concerns.
And while we're on the subject of travel, I'll leave you with a suggestion good this weekend and the rest of February:
San Diego: Twice the fun, half the price
Over 40 museums in San Diego are offering 50% off admission the entire month. Art, history, science, nature lovers and people of all ages have options here.
And since dry January will be over, end your outing in America's Finest City with a cocktail. Suggestions include Raised by Wolves' Quickly Escalating Shark Situation, which features bitter Amaros, passionfruit and pineapple. Snap.

Texto completo: Donald Trump is a lawless president and revolting person who richly deserved his impeachment and, in a better world, would be convicted in the Senate and removed from the White House. That’s my view, as it is the view of a plurality — albeit a narrow plurality — of the American people.
Ergo, every American who feels this way has a moral obligation to vote for whoever winds up being the Democratic nominee, even if the nominee turns out to be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Right?
Well, hang on.
I’ve been thinking about this question for a while now, thanks mainly to some good-natured prodding from my colleague Gail Collins in our published conversations at nytimes.com. The strongest version of the argument is this: Say what you will about Warren’s or Sanders’ policies; neither candidate poses any serious threat to our constitutional order, just as neither possesses Trump’s crippling character flaws or has such contempt for the institutions, traditions and habits of a free and civilized society.
In short, while a Warren or Sanders presidency might drastically rearrange the furniture in our common democratic home, it will not — as Trump’s has — seek to blast away at the foundations. What’s more, a decisive loss by Trump might have the added benefit of chastening conservatives who abandoned their former “free people, free markets” convictions in favor of Trump’s nativist demagogy.
It’s a serious argument that deserves respect. But it falls short in three big ways.
First, the argument overstates the extent to which this presidency has eroded the foundations of liberal democracy at home and abroad. Has Trump abandoned NATO? No. Has he lifted sanctions on Russia? No. Has he closed the borders to all immigrants? No. Did the president steal the midterms or stop Congress from impeaching him? No. Has he significantly suppressed the press? Again, no.
None of this should diminish the extent to which Trump has repeatedly sought to do the wrong thing or — nearly as bad — the ways in which he has normalized the seeking. Nor does it lessen my apprehensions about what Trump, after an acquittal in the Senate, may seek to do with a second term.
Yet for the overwhelming majority of Americans, life is pretty much the same under Trump as it was under Barack Obama.
The truth of Trumpism is that it’s a morally corrosive and corrupting force, not a politically or economically catastrophic one. It’s a reality Trump’s critics need to internalize lest their criticism become a self-defeating caricature.
Second, the argument understates the radicalism of what Sanders and Warren propose. Theirs is not a painless policy massage in the direction of a kinder, gentler economy. It’s a frontal and high-handed assault on U.S. capitalism. If it succeeded, it would entail devastating dislocations to millions of workers lasting for years. If it failed, it would have devastating effects on the country lasting for decades.
How devastating? In October, Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute tallied the costs of Sanders’ policy goals. By his calculations, the federal government would double in size. Half the U.S. workforce would be employed by the government, Riedl wrote. Government spending as a percent of GDP would rise to 70% (in Sweden, it’s less than 50%). The 15.3% payroll tax would hit 27.2% to help pay for “Medicare for All.” Total additional outlays would reach $97.5 trillion on top of the nearly $90 trillion the federal, state and local government is projected to spend.
At least Sanders is honest enough to call this what it is: socialism. Warren’s terminology is less forthright. Her ambition is no less breathtaking.
Fracking and health insurance — two industries that collectively employ hundreds of thousands of people — wouldn’t be better regulated or reformed in her administration. They’d be abolished. Much of Silicon Valley, America’s premier growth engine for 40 years, would be turned into a quasi-public utility. She doesn’t have one climate plan. She has at least five, costing in the trillions, which she plans to finance partly with a wealth tax that, as a law professor, she surely knows is unconstitutional. It’s of a piece with the other dishonesties that are such a part of her political persona.
Third, the argument ignores the likely effect that a Sanders or Warren presidency would have on the right.
Chastening? Probably not. Neither candidate is any bit more interested in finding common ground with Republican-leaning voters than Trump was interested in finding it with Democratic-leaning ones. And an assertively left-wing presidency would spark a right-wing backlash that would have all of the fear and rage of the left’s Resistance — but none of its restraint.
Democrats can, and hopefully will, nominate a candidate capable of attracting middle-of-the-road support. They can eschew polarization for persuasion and ideology for pragmatism. They can offer themselves as a sober alternative to a reckless president.
What they can’t do is nominate a reckless candidate of their own and insist it’s the only moral choice. For some of us, “none of the above” is a viable option. For far too many others, it’ll be the devil they know.

Texto completo: Mayor Quentin Hart, an African American whose Iowa metro area was ranked No. 1 in America for racial disparity by one source in 2018, recently endorsed Pete Buttigieg as the presidential candidate best suited to help communities like his.
“Pete has probably one of the most aggressive plans for black America,” says Mayor Hart of Waterloo, Iowa. Plus, he adds, he’d like to see someone in the White House who has the accountability of a local leader who runs into his or her constituents in the grocery store or local Walmart. “I believe we need a mayor’s approach.”
The Jan. 14 endorsement may have surprised national pundits, who routinely describe Mr. Buttigieg as unable to win over black voters. It also runs counter to criticism from the African American community in South Bend, Indiana, where Mr. Buttigieg just concluded two terms as mayor.
If Mayor Hart’s backing is a boon for Mr. Buttigieg, however, it is by no means a guarantee that the rest of Waterloo’s black community will follow.
Amid increased engagement from African Americans, who make up 17% of the population here, Sen. Elizabeth Warren drew 300 people to a house party; former Vice President Joe Biden won the vote of an influential pastor; and Sen. Cory Booker, who became the first presidential candidate to open a campaign office in Waterloo's black community, gained traction before dropping out.
Though Mr. Buttigieg has gained high-profile supporters and drew 600 to an outdoor rally in September - on a rainy day, no less - some here don’t like what they’ve heard about his track record on racial issues back home.
Mayor Hart, whose long-time friends and associates describe him as a very deliberate decision-maker, acknowledges the criticism from South Bend – but has a different perspective as a fellow mayor. In an Op-Ed announcing his endorsement, he pointed to statistics like black unemployment dropping by 70% during Mr. Buttigieg’s tenure.
“My role is not to debunk anything Pete’s city feels about him or his leadership,” he says in a phone interview. “My role is to tell what I know about Pete from my relationship with him.”
The mayor They met at an Accelerator for America event in 2018 – two mayors of midsize Midwestern cities that had struggled with industrial decline and racial tension.
Last summer, after then-Mayor Buttigieg launched his presidential campaign, Mayor Hart welcomed him to Waterloo and brought his visitor to the Fourth Street bridge over the Cedar River.
To the west was Waterloo’s largely white community, with its cluster of hotels and fast-food chains. On the other bank stood the struggling East Side, where African Americans were sequestered when they came to break a railroad strike in the early 1900s. Parts of the East Side burned in a riot in 1968, in which long-simmering tensions around racial inequality broke out after police tried to arrest a man at a high school football game.
Quentin Hart was standing here when he got the phone call in 2015 confirming that he would become the city’s first African American mayor. He vowed to work to bridge the divides in his community.
Within three years, Waterloo was named Iowa’s small business community of the year and one of the top 10 job markets in the country. Crime had dropped to the lowest level in decades, though residents still express concern about nighttime gun shots ringing out across their neighborhoods.
There was also bad news in 2018, however: The online website 24/7 Wall Street, using U.S. census data, concluded that Waterloo, when paired with neighboring Cedar Falls, had the largest “social and economic disparities along racial lines” of any U.S. metro area.
It found that African Americans were five times more likely to be unemployed than their white neighbors, and those employed earned only about half the median income of their white counterparts. And the rate of homeownership was just 32%, compared with 73% among white residents. Though Waterloo fared slightly better in the index’s 2019 rankings, coming in at No. 3, the racial disparities are still stark.
Which is where Mr. Buttigieg’s plan comes in, promising to address systemic racism and “unlock the collective potential of black America.”
The Douglass Plan, named after abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, is similar in scope to the Marshall Plan that funded European reconstruction after World War II. It includes everything from reforming the criminal justice system to improving access to mortgages.
“What got my attention was he was addressing it not with a Band-Aid approach of, ‘Let’s just throw a program out there,’” says former state Rep. Deborah Berry, who was invited to a Buttigieg roundtable with local black leadership in December.
The political newcomer Bridget Saffold may not be recognized as a leader per se, but if black turnout is up on caucus night, she will have had a lot to do with it.
A nurse and mother of four who is finishing up her bachelor’s degree in nursing, she’s never been very involved in politics. But that changed with President Donald Trump’s election. In the past year, she has found time to host events – including the first-ever house party in her community, with Elizabeth Warren. Some 300 people filled her backyard.
She has been intentional about inviting people who might not otherwise get involved.
“I want to say ‘little people,’” she says over a 99-cent breaded tenderloin sandwich special at the local Steamboat Gardens restaurant. “Just regular working people who don’t get heard.”
When they came out, “It was the first time they were hearing, ‘Hey, it’s important for you to be part of the process. You matter,’” says Ms. Saffold.
One of the concerns about Mr. Buttigieg is that even if he manages to win the Democratic nomination, he won’t be able to get out the black vote in the general election next fall, and Democrats will lose.
“The narrative in the media is that if he fails, it’s because he didn’t connect with black voters,” says Ryan Stevenson, an organizer for the Booker campaign who grew up in Waterloo. “Don’t just put the blame on us.”
There are other groups Buttigieg doesn’t connect well with either, such as younger white voters, he says. Plus, he adds, the lack of connection is a two-way street.
That said, Mr. Stevenson takes issue with some of the criticism Mr. Buttigieg has faced, including a New York Times article this week about tensions within his campaign over the treatment of minority staffers.
“It’s an issue that all campaigns are facing, so for [the Times] to frame it just as a Buttigieg issue is not right,” says Mr. Stevenson.
Plus, such criticisms may be overblown. An online survey this fall found Mr. Buttigieg polling the highest of any candidate among non-white voters. Also, 46% of his senior advisors are people of color. Angela Weekley, manager of community inclusion at Veridian Credit Union in Waterloo, says of the people he’s surrounded himself with: “That’s the type of America I’d like to see.”
The pastor Iowa itself has been hammered for being “too white” to host the first-in-the-nation caucus.
“It hurts to hear that,” says the Rev. Frantz Whitfield, pastor of the Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church in Waterloo. “I love my state, I love Iowa, even as an African American man. ... There’s so much diversity here, which I don’t think the media picks up on.”
But the Democratic candidates have picked up on those growing pockets of minorities, at least more than in prior years.
“A lot of them are in Waterloo quite often,” Mr. Whitfield says – 80 times, to be precise. “It makes people feel good.” The front-runners have each visited Waterloo four times with the exception of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has made seven trips. Most of them are returning this weekend for a final swing.
The pastor, who endorsed Mr. Biden in July, estimates that 95% of the people he speaks with, from the gas station to those in his own pews, have said they’re also going with Biden.
One of them might be Anna Weems, a 92-year-old civil rights activist who brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. here in 1959. But when asked who she thinks would best be able to advocate for Waterloo from the White House, she guffaws.
“It’s not the White House, it’s what we can do,” she says, recalling King’s preaching of unity. “It’s brothers and sisters that touch each other every day.”

George Soros: Facebook, Zuckerberg in cahoots with Trump to win 2020 election

Texto completo: George Soros blasted Facebook at Davos, accusing the company of conspiring to help President Donald Trump win reelection.
“I think there is a kind of informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebook,” Soros said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. “Facebook will work together to reelect Trump, and Trump will work to protect Facebook so that this situation cannot be changed, and it makes me very concerned for 2020. ”
The liberal billionaire did not offer any proof, and Facebook denied it, but Soros doubled down on his anti-Facebook talk Friday in an opinion piece published in The New York Times.
Mark Zuckerberg has a message for you: He doesn't care if you like him
Open season on Facebook: Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats declare war on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg
"I believe that Mr. Trump and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realize that their interests are aligned – the president’s in winning elections, Mr. Zuckerberg’s in making money," Soros wrote.
Soros also said neither Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, should be left in charge of Facebook. “They follow only one guiding principle: maximize profits irrespective of the consequences,” Soros wrote.
Facebook pushed back in a statement.
"While we respect Mr. Soros’ right to voice his opinion, he’s wrong. The notion that we are aligned with any one political figure or party runs counter to our values and the facts. "
Last week in Davos, Trump was asked about Zuckerberg. "I heard he's gonna run for president," Trump told CNBC's Squawk Box. "That wouldn't be too frightening, I don't think. "
There's no evidence Zuckerberg and Trump have any kind of pact. But it's true that Facebook gave Trump a big boost in 2016. Just ask Facebook.
In January, a leaked internal post from longtime Facebook executive Andrew “Boz” Bosworth credited Trump's 2016 win to the president's digital advertising campaign. In 2020, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is focused again on Facebook.
"Was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected?” Bosworth wrote in the Dec. 30 post. “I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn’t get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen from any advertiser. ”
Earlier this month Trump told Rush Limbaugh’s radio show that during a dinner in October, Zuckerberg told him he was “No. 1” on the social media platform.
Facebook and Soros: How a lie about George Soros and the migrant caravan multiplied online
Facebook Russian ads: We read every one of the 3,517 Facebook ads bought by Russians. Here's what we found
Tensions have been running high between Soros and Facebook for some time. Soros, a bogeyman in right-wing conspiracy theories shared on social media platforms like Facebook, has used his annual Davos speech as a platform to criticize Zuckerberg's company before.

Texto completo: Alberto Salazar, a legendary marathon runner who was head coach of the Nike Oregon Project until it was disbanded last fall after he was suspended for four years for anti-doping violations, was given a temporary suspension by the U. S. Center for SafeSport Friday evening.
Salazar’s suspension comes nearly three months after former high school track phenom Mary Cain went public with the chilling accusation that she was “emotionally and physically abused” while training under Salazar at Nike.
Cain told The New York Times that she was shamed into losing weight, causing her menstrual cycle to stop for three years and leading to five broken bones. She also said she developed suicidal thoughts and started to cut herself.
SafeSport’s mandate gives it exclusive authority over sexual abuse within the U. S. Olympic community, but it also can rule on cases of emotional and physical abuse on a discretionary basis. It is not clear what kind of alleged abuse led SafeSport to issue its ban.
“SafeSport does not comment on specific matters to protect the integrity of the process and the parties involved, especially any potential victims,” spokesman Dan Hill told USA TODAY sports.

Trump doesn't like Fox News' Chris Wallace. But he's not the liberal hero you might think

Resumen: After a Twitter attack on Chris Wallace of "Fox News Sunday" by Donald Trump, some hailed the reporter like a liberal hero. Here's why he's not one.

Texto completo: Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor and host of “Fox News Sunday,” is known as a straight shooter.
As well he should be. But it’s become a rare enough commodity in an age of polarized politics — and media that are polarized right along with them — that it’s notable. So notable, in fact, that when he told conservative commentator Katie Pavlich to “get your facts straight” during coverage of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump on Monday, it spawned an explosion of tweets and stories making Wallace sound like a liberal hero.
Spoiler alert: He’s not. Nor does he want to be.
“It’s silly,” Wallace, who came to Fox News from ABC in 2003, said of the reaction. “I’m not advocating a point of view. I’m simply trying to act as an umpire and call balls and strikes and, particularly if it’s a factual matter, to say, well that’s just not true. I don’t see that, frankly, as expressing an opinion or commenting. ”

'I’m just giving you my best read'
Maybe not. But Wallace has shown a willingness to challenge his colleagues. This being Fox News, he’s often lumped in during impeachment breaks with a panel — all the networks favor them these days, though it’s not clear to anyone who actually watches why they do — that's often uniformly conservative. If it sounds like he’s sometimes taking them to task, that’s not really the point.
“It really isn’t an opinion,” he said of his contributions. “I’m just telling you my analysis after 50 years in the business and somebody who has studied impeachment — both the history of impeachment and this particular impeachment case — more than most of the viewers at home, here’s my best analysis, my best take on what’s going on. After one break I may well say boy, I thought the prosecution, the House Democratic managers, had a good hour there. And the next segment it might be, I thought the White House lawyers had a very good segment.
“That isn’t really that I’m expressing opinion or changing my mind. I’m just giving you my best read on what I’ve just seen, which is I think kind of the value I can add in that kind of commentary situation. ”
Why he didn't want Sunday's Trump interview
Wallace was about to board a plane for Miami; he’ll host “Fox News Sunday” there, kicking off Super Bowl coverage. But is he disappointed that Sean Hannity, who often serves as a Trump apologist on his primetime show on Fox News, scored the big pre-game interview with the president?
“No, interestingly enough,” Wallace said. “The reason is because I think it’s a tough interview to do, in the sense that when you get your chance — and the last one I had was in November of 2018 — to sit down with the president, you really want to probe. You maybe get a chance once a year, once every couple of years, and you want to really probe. ”
The format Sunday won’t offer that chance, he said.
“I think the audience at 3:30 on Super Bowl Sunday doesn’t really want that. They kind of want something lighter. So if I’m going to get a chance, and I hope I’ll get another chance to interview the president, I’d rather have it be purely on my terms, on news terms, and not when you’re fitting into a pre-game show. ”
Too bad, though. With Wallace the chances of a tough interview, as opposed to a warm embrace, would be much higher. That whole fairness thing again.
Fairness used to be a 'basic job requirement'
“A lot of people come up to me these days, and in the old days it used to be, ‘Oh, I saw you on TV’ or, ‘I liked that piece,’” Wallace said. “Now people come up to me and say, ‘Thank you for being so fair. Thank you for being equally tough on both sides. ’ And on the one hand, I like praise as much as the next guy. But on the other hand I find it kind of sad, because it used to be that being fair was what kept you from being fired. It was the basic job requirement. ”
Wallace refers to himself as a reporter, and that’s key — he is not a host of a primetime opinion show. And yes, Hannity and Tucker Carlson bend over backwards to appeal to conservatives, but to a certain extent they’re giving their audience what they want. The same with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, for that matter.
Wallace advises against putting all your eggs in one ideological basket.
“I think this idea that if you have one kind of world view you watch Fox, if you have another world view you watch CNN or read the New York Times, I think is a huge mistake,” he said. “So I always say, read or watch something every day that you disagree with, that challenges you, so that you can kind of triangulate as a news consumer what the truth is. Nobody ever learns by just having their own views parroted back at them. ”
This is why Wallace doesn’t run a network. He’s correct, of course. But there’s big money to be made in preaching to the choir.
'I get attacked by both sides'
Wallace is 72 years old. Nonstop news means nonstop coverage, and it can be a grind. But he’s not really thinking about slowing down or retiring anytime soon.
“You’re asking this of a man whose father (the late Mike Wallace of '60 Minutes') was still working at 88,” he said, laughing. “I’m having a whale of a good time. People sometimes say what’s it like covering this president and covering politics today? And I say it’s easier as a reporter and the host of a Sunday show than it is as a citizen. Where somebody else would be like, oh my gosh, this is so terrible, my reaction is, what a great story this is. I intend to keep doing that for a while. ”
He certainly sounds enthusiastic, and he’s still both reporting news and making it. Trump criticized him recently on Twitter. And Wallace knows if he praises a Republican, liberals will turn on him, too.
“I get attacked by both sides,” he said. “I must be doing something right. ”

Resumen: The nation’s partisan divisions appear as entrenched as ever. Over the long term, the power of the presidency may have gained a significant boost.

Texto completo: During the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware would sometimes look up to the visitors gallery from his desk in the last row of the chamber. He had offered tickets to constituents who wanted them, and hoped to see people from his nearby state in the evenings, when they could get there after work to witness this historic event in person.
But the auditorium seats in the gallery remained largely empty.
Senator Coons attributed the disinterest in the proceedings – a ratings disaster for the networks that carried them live – to two things. One was the lack of suspense. Everyone, on both sides, assumed the trial would end in acquittal.
At the same time, to many Americans “this all seems obscure, and partisan, and not relevant to their lives,” the senator said in a lengthy interview midway through the marathon days. This second factor, he added, is “more concerning” to him, because it suggests “a lack of belief in the relevance of what we’re doing.”
That assessment aptly sums up the broader impact of the impeachment of the president by the House in December, followed by the January Senate trial, which as of this writing appeared to be moving inexorably toward acquittal. On Friday night, a motion to call witnesses failed in a 51 to 49 vote, with a final vote on acquittal or conviction set for Wednesday.
In the short term, observers say it will do little to change minds or politics in a divided nation. The latest RealClearPolitics polling average on the question of impeachment and removal from office shows an exact stalemate, with 47.8% of Americans in favor and 47.8% opposed.
Over the long term, the new precedent set by this trial and its likely acquittal will almost certainly increase the power of the presidency, while weakening congressional oversight – changes not always perceptible to the public but consequential nonetheless.
Yet the entire impeachment episode, the most partisan so far, is “small potatoes” compared with the tectonic plates of political tribalism that put it all in motion – and are threatening American democracy, says Patrick Griffin, former legislative director to President Bill Clinton, who was impeached and acquitted 20 years ago. 
“In democracy, you have to have some respect for the other side. You have to have some forbearance and some respect for other points of view, and I think we’ve lost both,” he says.
Democrats should never have gone down this road, he says. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cautioned her caucus, but “the groundswell was overwhelming.” At best, Democrats may have convinced a “small segment” of the population to abandon support for the president, but it’s too early to know that yet. “The politics of it are hit or miss.”
Led by Rep. Adam Schiff of California, Democrats have argued that President Trump tried to shake down a foreign leader for his personal benefit – asking the president of Ukraine in a July 25 phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, even as he withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to the country and put off the Ukrainian president’s request for a White House visit.
The call occurred after Mr. Biden announced his candidacy for president. House Democrats began investigations last year after a whistleblower raised concerns about the phone call. But the White House refused to provide documents and barred administration officials from testifying (though some officials testified anyway).
After the House impeached the president for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, additional information has continued to emerge. The independent Government Accountability Office said it was illegal to withhold the congressionally approved aid. Leaks to The New York Times from a forthcoming book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton describe the president directly telling Mr. Bolton that the military aid to Ukraine was contingent on that government assisting with investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. The president denied he said that.
The president’s attorneys maintained there was never a “quid pro quo” between the withheld aid and White House meeting and the request to investigate the Bidens. The president was only concerned about corruption and military burden-sharing, they maintained. They described the House impeachment process as rushed, flawed, and highly partisan. Indeed, no Republicans voted for impeachment.
The White House defense team also held that the standard for impeachment should be a crime, and argued no crime had been committed. By that logic, even if Mr. Bolton’s allegation is true – and Democrats were pressing their colleagues to call him as a witness – it would not matter because it is not an impeachable offense. (The U.S Constitution is less clear-cut than the president’s lawyers, referring to “treason, bribery, high crimes, and misdemeanors” as potential misconduct that could cause the removal of a president.)
During the Clinton trial, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – then one of the Republican House managers leading the charge against the president – pointed out that “reasonable people can disagree” about whether the president’s actions were impeachable or not. It was interpreted as an “out” for members of his own party and indeed, five Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate joined Democrats to acquit the president on both charges, while five more voted to acquit on the perjury charge. 
Acquittal is expected to fall much more closely along party lines this time, with a key senator such as Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, who has a long history of working across the aisle, calling the president’s actions “inappropriate” but not impeachable.
Considered a possible swing vote on the issue of witnesses, Senator Alexander announced late Thursday night he would not call for witnesses because there is no need for evidence “to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense.” With the Iowa caucus coming on Monday, it’s time to “let the people decide,” he said.
Democrats vigorously disagreed, saying the president was attempting to manipulate the 2020 elections by seeking help from a foreign leader and would likely continue to do so. Failing to remove him leaves him free to act more as a monarch than a president, subject to checks and balances.
“We are witnessing the coronation of Trump, with Mitch McConnell holding the crown, and the Republicans holding his train,” said Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii to reporters on Thursday.
Politically, acquittal will change very little, says George Edwards, a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. The public will see the whole process as “politics as usual.” Gridlock in a divided Washington will continue. Democrats will continue to pass legislation in the House that goes nowhere in the Senate, while Senate Republicans focus mainly on confirming judges.
In a broader sense, the arguments made by the president’s team “provide a basis for much less restriction on presidential power,” he says, adding that the administration’s refusal to cooperate with documents and witnesses “really has weakened congressional oversight.”
Mr. Griffin, however, says it’s not a given that this will translate into future abuses. That will depend on the people elected and the circumstances of the moment.
“The balance of power has shifted dramatically to the president for the moment,” he says. “But this is a dynamic that goes back and forth, and whether it’s irreversible, I’m not sure. That depends on the next president, and the next president after that.”

6 ways to get a truffle experience in Asheville

Texto completo: It's hard to describe the flavor of a truffle. In this case, we're talking about the delightfully pungent fungus that grows in the soil near the roots of trees, and bears the flavor of its surrounds. Truffles are at once sweet and savory, mushroomy and rich, and even those many adjectives fail at an accurate description. As hard as it is to talk about truffles, it's much harder to cultivate them, though that hasn't stopped some Western North Carolina growers from trying. Author and chef Susi Gott Séguret will offer a tour of one of those farms as the organizer behind the Asheville Truffle Experience, Feb. 7-9.
The farm tour and truffle hunt takes place at a truffle orchard at the Mountain Research Station in Waynesville. Visitors can watch Monza the truffle dog, accompanied by trainer Lois Martin of the Truffle Dog Co., hunt for Tuber melanosporum, or the black Perigord truffle.
That particular variety is a favorite of Séguret, who describes its flavor as "earthy, musky, floral, sensuous, pungent, sexy, sweet, dark, dusky, oaky, nutty, savory."
Ephemeral but distinctive flavor Séguret's enthusiasm for truffles grabbed her "out of the blue" when she lived in Europe, the traditional home of the truffle.
She was attending a Slow Food convivium in southern France, where she tasted and explored several types, including the Italian white truffle, which fetches more than $4,000 per pound.
In a flash of synchronicity, when Séguret returned to her home just south of Paris, she read a New York Times article about truffle cultivation in East Tennessee.
"And it was astonishing to me that, here I am in France investigating truffles, and they're growing right next to me where I grew up," said the Madison County native.
Truffles make basics 'extraordinary' Truffles' magic in part lives in its ephemeral flavor, only at its strongest for two weeks. After that, it loses some complexity.
But should you catch one at its peak, it has the power to elevate a dish to magical heights, Séguret said. Even better, it's at its best when paired with the cheapest, most basic ingredients, including eggs, rice, pasta and cream, she added. "You can bring ordinary ingredients to an extraordinary level with the use of truffle."
Séguret, whose book "Cooking With Truffles: A Chef's Guide" should be released in February, said her passion lies in educating chefs and consumers about how to properly use and store truffles.
Whole, raw eggs, for example, make a perfect perch for the truffles, which in turn infuse the egg with flavor through its permeable shell.
Complexity in cultivation To land truffles among the many specialty products cultivated in Western North Carolina would be a coup for local agriculture. But in their quest to test the potential of this new crop, farmers have found keeping host trees healthy a challenge.
"The Eastern Filbert Blight has made growing truffles on filberts a big challenge in this region," explained Jeanine Davis, an extension specialist and researcher in the Department of Horticultural Science at North Carolina State University.
Her department is exploring other blight-resistant host trees while working to find the best production method for local truffles.
Researchers have found some success at the Waynesville demonstration and research orchard, Davis said. "So the method we are using does work."
She expects truffles to grow in popularity with farmers. Even so, they're likely to remain a niche crop.
"Even if we figure it all out on how to grow them, it is expensive to start an orchard, you have to maintain it for many years before you get your first truffle, and you really need to have a trained dog."
Séguret hopes educating consumers and chefs about truffles will help create a larger consumer market. "So when truffle growers have spent 10 years of their lives bringing this ingredient to fruition, it won't be lost in consumers' perception of it," said
But perhaps it's the lack of perception of truffles that might be the biggest uphill battle.
Let's fix that:
Get a truffle experience in Asheville The Asheville Truffle Experience kick-off, Feb. 7-9, features multiple events centered around the Périgord, or black winter truffle.
The event begins at 5 p.m. Feb. 7, with a welcome tasting at the Benjamin Walls Gallery, 38 Broadway St., featuring truffled appetizers, truffle ice cream from Ultimate Ice Cream Company and Celtic music from Aoife Clancy and Bill Elliott. Ticketing information can be found at ashevilletruffle.com for this and events below.
Truffle education and market: On Feb. 8, the Asheville Truffle Experience continues with a Truffle 101 educational session featuring several truffle experts. 10 a.m.-noon, location to be determined.
The afternoon has a culinary demo and tasting, 2-3 p.m., location to be determined. A Truffle Market will take place in the Haywood Park Hotel atrium from 4-6 p.m., featuring truffle products, services and truffled popcorn.
Truffle Extravaganza dinner: On Feb. 8, chef Peter Crockett cooks a truffle-focused dinner at Isa's Bistro with four courses and an intermezzo: truffled bone marrow parfait; truffle honey-glazed pastry of mushroom duxelles and tomme cheese; truffle agnolotti with pork trotter consommé and shaved truffles; and a black truffle dessert trio. Dinner begins with a reception at 6:30.
Truffle farm visit: On Feb. 9, 10-noon, head out to the truffle orchard at the Mountain Research Station in Waynesville, overseen by Dr. Jeanine Davis, to learn about truffle cultivation and to watch a truffle dog hunt for truffles.
Go to Vivian: Not going to the Asheville Truffle Experience? This River Arts District restaurant consistently has truffles on the menu, said co-owner and general manager Shannon McGaughey. "They are always shaved on top of our bacon-wrapped filet mignon, which is served with seared foie gras, sherry demi glace and toast."
Truffles appear on Vivian's oft-changing menu frequently, recently found in a dish of beets confited in beef tallow and served with beet-greens pesto. Don't see anything truffle-infused on the menu that suits? McGaughey said the kitchen will shave truffles over just about anything for an upcharge. Vivian is at 348 Depot St.

Texto completo: The St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge has plenty to celebrate this month.
Local New York Times best-selling author Jeff VanderMeer presented a $5,000 check on Jan. 21 to Friends of the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge president Susan Cason. The gift from VanderMeer Creative represented the fulfillment of a pledge to donate book royalties from the critically acclaimed Southern Reach Trilogy.
The trilogy takes place in Area X, a mysterious wilderness inspired by the St. Marks Refuge. The first book, "Annihilation, was made into a movie starring Natalie Portman in 2018.
On Saturday, the refuge is having its Wildlife, Heritage and Outdoors festival with exhibits, demonstrations and tours of the renovated Historic St. Marks Lighthouse keeper's quarters. The festival runs from 11 a.m.-4 p.m.
"Given 'Annihilation' is based on the 13-mile hike I do out at St. Marks wildlife refuge, it seems only fair to give something back," VanderMeer said. "The refuge is so unique — one of the most biodiverse places in the country. Refuge manager Terry Peacock and refuge biologist Joe Reinman are just the best — so dedicated and forward thinking. Also, the Friends of the refuge work so hard to help out — from volunteering in the visitors center to being instrumental in the St. Marks lighthouse finally having a new Fresnel lens. Tallahasseeans should be so proud."
The money from VanderMeer Creative will sponsor an intern and supplies to help keep the refuge's frosted flatwood salamander program going after a federal grant expires later this year. This threatened amphibian has a much better chance of survival with management of the species by refuge staff.
"Jeff is the best friend we could have," Melissa Jacoby, former Friend board member said. "Through his novels, thousands of people worldwide know about and appreciate St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge."
In addition to visitors brought to the refuge by the books, VanderMeer has given his blessing to the visitors center selling an Area X T-shirt, the proceeds from which go directly to the refuge's programs. A percentage of royalties from his latest novel, "Dead Astronauts," has also been pledged to the refuge.
VanderMeer Creative, set up to support Jeff and his wife Ann's creative projects, is also a sponsor of the Word of South literary festival, the Tallahassee Film Festival, and the St. Francis Wildlife Association, as well as a donor to the Florida Wildlife Federation and Apalachicola Riverkeepers.
"We love this community and it's very important to us to support the amazing wilderness and culture in the area," VanderMeer said. "We're so lucky to live in North Florida."
If you go
What: St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge WHO Festival - Wildlife, Heritage and Outdoors. Featuring exhibits, wildlife tours, demonstrations, food, music. Historic St. Marks Lighthouse – keeper's quarters will be open all day for free tours – children's crafts and more.
When: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday
Where: St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge; $5 entry fee
St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge is holding the WHO Festival to celebrate wildlife, heritage and the outdoors on Saturday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announced Friday she will not vote to call witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, virtually assuring that Democrats won’t have the 51 votes needed to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton or others.
Murkowski criticized the House's investigation as "rushed and flawed" and said the proceedings were not fixable.
“Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,” Murkowski said in a statement. “I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything. ”
Murkowski was the last of a handful of Republicans who had expressed a potential openness to witnesses.
That likely sets up a 51-49 split in the closely divided chamber against considering additional evidence. Democrats need four Republicans to side with them to continue the trial.
More: GOP Senator 'disturbed' with McConnell 'total coordination' with the White House for impeachment trial
If Murkowski had gone the other way, that could have resulted in a 50-50 tie that would’ve raised the difficult question of whether Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could or would break the tie.
The Alaska senator indicated she had Roberts on her mind, saying in her statement that she would “not stand for or support” efforts to “drag the Supreme Court into the fray. ”
That comment may have been a reaction to a question posed Thursday by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who asked whether the fact that Roberts is presiding over a trial in which Republicans are blocking witnesses "contribute to the loss of legitimacy” of Roberts and the court.
As the Senate reconvened Friday for what could be the final day of the trial, all eyes were on Murkowski. Other pivotal senators – Maine’s Susan Collins and Utah’s Mitt Romney – had indicated they wanted witnesses. Swing voter Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said late Thursday he did not.
Leaving the Senate chamber around 11 p. m. Thursday, Murkowski told reporters she was still weighing her options.
Pointing to her two volumes packed with notes, she said: “I’m going to go back to my office and put eye drops in so I can keep reading. ”
During Thursday’s session, Murkowski asked Trump’s defense team why senators should not call Bolton to testify. In an upcoming book, Bolton reportedly contradicts a key defense of Trump’s team: that there are no eyewitnesses to the allegation that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to get the country to investigate Democrats.
Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, warned that agreeing to call additional witnesses would establish new standards for impeachment, if the House can send "half-baked" cases and leave the Senate to complete the investigation. Philbin also said Bolton hadn't confirmed the newspaper report about what’s in his manuscript.
Shortly before Murkowski announced her decision Friday, The New York Times reported additional details about Bolton's manuscript. Bolton wrote that Trump asked him in May to make sure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would meet with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to talk about the investigations Trump wanted, the Times reported.
That request was made during an Oval Office meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel leading Trump’s defense team in the Senate impeachment trial.
Trump, in a statement, denied Bolton's claim. He has also denied telling Bolton that the Ukraine aid was tied to investigations. But the White House ordered Bolton and others not to testify during the House investigation.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , warned Republicans Friday morning that "the truth will eventually come out. "
“We could vote to see the truth in this trial, or it could come out in a few weeks or a few months," Schumer said. "And on that day, every Republican who voted to hide the truth in an impeachment trial of the president, will have to answer for it. "
Murkowski, one of the Senate's few moderates, has been in the hot seat before.
In 2018, she was the only Republican senator to oppose the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. (Murkowski ended up voting "present' on Kavanaugh's confirmation, to offset the absence of Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican who was attending his daughter's wedding. )
In 2017, Murkowski joined Collins and Arizona's John McCain in killing the GOP effort to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
Murkowski entered the Senate in 2002 after being appointed to the seat by her father, Frank Murkowski, when he resigned his Senate seat to become Alaska's governor.
During her second re-election bid in 2010, Murkowski lost the GOP nomination to a Tea Party challenger but went on to win the general election as a write-in candidate.
Murkowski was re-elected in 2016 with 44% of the vote in a multi-candidate race.

Resumen: More than 80 former members of NXIVM, the cult-like group based in the Albany suburbs, are seeking monetary damages.

Texto completo: Dozens of people who say they were bilked out of thousands of dollars and left emotionally and physically abused filed a federal lawsuit this week against NXIVM, the cult-like group that drew international headlines when some of its members were branded with their leader's initials.
The lawsuit accuses Keith Raniere, actress Allison Mack and 13 other NXIVM leaders of playing various roles in a pyramid scheme that doubled as a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, one that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and illegal human experimentation.
The complaint was filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court by actress Sarah Edmondson; Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman who dated Raniere in the 1990s; filmmaker Mark Vicente and more than 70 former NXIVM members kept anonymous.
More: Rochester woman tells all about life with NXIVM's Keith Raniere, her ex
They are seeking monetary damages, asking a federal judge to determine how much they are owed for their pain and suffering.
NXIVM, now defunct, was based in the Albany suburbs.
"Defendants exerted power over the Plaintiffs; took their money; made it financially, physically and psychologically difficult, and in some cases impossible, to leave the coercive community; and systematically abused Plaintiffs physically and emotionally," the plaintiffs attorneys, led by Neil Glazer, wrote in the 189-page complaint.
More: The charges against NXIVM's Keith Raniere, Allison Mack and Clare Bronfman, explained
NXIVM leaders found guilty last year
The expansive lawsuit explores the various ways Raniere, a Rockland County native who billed himself as one of the smartest men in the world, and NXIVM are alleged to have systematically abused its members, coercing them into spending their money on purported self-help classes and making them psychologically dependent on his teachings.
Raniere, Mack and four other NXIVM leaders — including Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune — were convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes related to the group last year. They are awaiting sentencing.
More: NXIVM leader Keith Raniere guilty of all counts in sex-cult case
Mack, one of Raniere's most-devoted followers, is best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville. "
Raniere's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, called the lawsuit an "unprincipled money grab by adults who made grown-up decisions that they now apparently regret. "
"While making regret a cause of action is good for plaintiff’s lawyers, it's bad for anyone who values genuine personal responsibility," he said in an email.
More: Keith Raniere's ex-girlfriend, a Rochester woman, pens tale of NXIVM's rise and fall
Civil suit details alleged NXIVM abuse
The civil suit recounts much of what was revealed during Raniere's trial and more.
At the trial, Mack was accused of helping run a NXIVM subgroup known as DOS, a master-slave group that was ultimately led by Raniere himself, though some members other than Mack didn't know it.
The women were branded near their pubic area with a logo containing Raniere's initials, while some were groomed to become Raniere's sexual partners. They were forced to give up naked photographs and other damaging information that was held as collateral in case they ever revealed the existence of the group.
Edmondson, who was among those branded, ultimately blew the whistle on the group, setting in motion a criminal investigation that led to Raniere's conviction.
Along with the branding, the lawsuit also details Natalie's years of court battles with Raniere, which came after she ended an eight-year relationship with him.
More: NXIVM co-founder Nancy Salzman pleads guilty in sex-cult case
Raniere and NXIVM officials, backed with Bronfman's fortune, bombarded Natalie with lawsuits and court filings that cost her thousands of dollars and kept her tied up in court for years, even intervening in her and her mother's personal bankruptcy proceedings.
The civil suit lays out 10 different claims, ranging from racketeering to battery to malicious abuse of the legal process.
Along with Raniere and Mack, the lawsuit also names Clare Bronfman, her sister Sara, Nicki Clyne, Nancy Salzman and Lauren Salzman as defendants, along with NXIVM and 11 other individuals or companies with ties to the group.
Clyne, like Mack, was an actress and Raniere follower. She played the role of Cally Henderson Tyrol in the Sci-Fi Channel reboot of Battlestar Galactica.

Texto completo: How to watch
AMC River Park Square, 808 W. Main Ave., will screen the Oscar-nominated animated and live action shorts. Check for times and tickets at amctheatres.com.
The Panida Theater in Sandpoint will screen the live-action shorts at 7:30 p.m. Friday and 4:30 p.m. Saturday; the animated shorts at 5:30 p.m. Friday and 7:30 p.m. Saturday; and the documentary shorts at 1:30 p.m. Sunday.
The Panida is at 300 N. First Ave. in Sandpoint. Tickets are $10.61 for a single show, $22.97 for an all-access pass (student discount available). Visit panida.org for details or to buy tickets.
I've probably typed some version of "the fictional short films nominated for Oscars this year are a mixed bag" a dozen times, but that phrase doesn't apply in 2020. All 10 are good, and several are great.
The five nominees for the animated short prize are especially strong, and with three directed by women, they're a hopeful sign of increased opportunities behind the camera. My favorite is "Dcera (Daughter)," a wordless gem from the Czech Republic that gains in power because it was so evidently handmade.
Featuring papier-mâché puppets on whose faces you can see the lovingly created creases and paint spatters, it contrasts the artificial look of the stop-motion characters, a woman and her dying father, with realistic backdrops as she reflects on a childhood that she spent trying to connect to him.
Two other nominees also are mostly dialogue-free. From Pixar's program to fund experimental work by its employees, "Kitbull" is the sweetly familiar tale of two strays, a tiny cat and a timid pit bull, who become buds.
"Hair Love" is another upbeat one, although a heart-tugging moment at the end feels unearned. It's about a black girl, being raised by her dad, who tries using online tutorials from a maternal vlogger to help her tame her bountiful (although, frankly, gorgeous as is) hair.
My second-favorite in the category - and, if I had to guess, the winner - is "Memorable," an impressive display of animation techniques. Its shifting form is dictated by its story: An elderly artist, who has a memory disorder, is losing his grip on reality.
Only marred by his wife's bizarre failure to comprehend what's happening when he can't remember how to eat a banana or doesn't know what a pepper grinder is, "Memorable" finds surprising, poignant ways to illustrate how frightening it would be to gradually disconnect from your own life.
Disconnection also is the theme of "Sister." It might pack in one social issue too many, but its tender story has the intimate ring of autobiography as a Chinese man reminisces about the adjustments his family made when his parents brought home his baby sibling.
Coincidentally, "A Sister" is the title of one of the stronger live-action shorts. It opens with a seemingly benign scene of a woman in a car supposedly calling her sister to chat about child care.
Everything we believe about that opening scene changes when "A Sister" shifts to the actual recipient of that call, a baffled French 911 operator who is about to hang up until she realizes the caller is in distress and speaking in code.
Not unlike the recent Danish film "The Guilty," which also featured an operator trying to solve a case, "A Sister" is a gripping, real-time fight for survival and understanding.
All five live-action shorts concern protagonists whose lives are changed by a stranger, and none is better than the beautifully acted "The Neighbors' Window," written and directed by Marshall Curry, whose Cory Booker documentary, "Street Fight," was a previous Oscar nominee.
Maria Dizzia ("Orange Is the New Black") plays a New Yorker who spots her curtain-less neighbors having sex. That leads to the window becoming the equivalent of a reality-TV show that's constantly playing across the street. What she sees causes her to question her life and gives her a new perspective.
Frequently, short films are directors' attempts to raise enough money to extend them to feature length. I'd guess that's the case with "Saria" and "Brotherhood."
The former is based on the true story of girls who hatch an elaborate plan to escape an abusive orphanage, a tale that is never less than absorbing but that omits important events and fails to give its supporting characters nuance.
"Brotherhood" shares those failings, although it's beautifully made, and its spring-loaded plot keeps us engaged as a soldier returns to Tunisia from Syria with a mysterious wife in tow.
The movie that seems likeliest to launch a career is Yves Piat's good-natured "Nefta Football Club," also set in Tunisia. Its two stars are a pair of endearing soccer fans who stumble upon a donkey loaded down with drugs.
Mistaking the drugs for laundry detergent, the boys try to peddle it on the way to the story's enormously satisfying conclusion.
A bleak lineup of docs
The documentaries are at times almost intractably grim. The best of the lot is Yi Seung-Jun's "In the Absence," a terse, harrowing, infuriating account of the sinking of the South Korean ferry Sewol that killed more than 300 in 2014.
"Life Overtakes Me," directed by John Haptas and Kristine Samuelson, examines resignation syndrome among children of refugee immigrants in Sweden. The story of children who fall into almost coma-like states in reaction to deportation is fascinating, but its telling is affected.
The self-explanatory "Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl)" is set in Afghanistan. The approach of the director, Carol Dysinger, aims for dollops of lightheartedness. The activist portrait "St. Louis Superman," directed by Smriti Mundhra and Sami Khan, is inspiring and troubling.

The Pulitzer Prize-nominated novel follows 12 Native Americans connected to one another in ways they might not realize as they travel to the Big Oakland Powwow.
"There There" won the PEN/Hemingway Award and an American Book Award and was selected as one of the best books of 2018 by the New York Times, the Washington Post and NPR.
Orange, an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, received the 2019 American Book Award. He earned his MFA from the Institute of American Indian Arts.

Lenney has written "The Object Parade" and "Bigger Than Life: A Murder, A Memoir" and co-edited "Brief Encounters: A Collection of Contemporary Nonfiction" with the late Judith Kitchen. She will release "Coffee" in April.
Lenney's work has appeared in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, AGNI, Creative Nonfiction, the Paris Review Daily and Los Angeles Review of Books, where she is an editor-at-large. Lenney is a member of the core faculty of the Bennington Writing Seminars.
If you go: 7:30 p.m. Friday; Spark Central, 1214 W. Summit Parkway; free.
'Dancing at Lughnasa'
In "Dancing at Lughnasa," audiences follow Michael as he reminisces about the year 1936 in County Donegal, when his mother, Christina, and her four sisters, Kate, Maggie, Agnes and Rosie, struggled to balance heartache and loss with joy and hope.
Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa," directed by Jack Delehanty, opens at the Myrtle Woldson Performing Arts Center on Friday and continues through Feb. 9.
The play premiered in Dublin in 1990 and transferred to London's National Theatre in 1991. That production won the Olivier Award for best play. The Broadway production went on to win the Tony for best play and was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for outstanding play.
In 1998, a film adaptation starring Meryl Streep, Catherine McCormack, Kathy Burke, Sophie Thompson and Bríd Brennan was released. "Dancing at Lughnasa" has since been revived numerous times in Ireland, the U.K., Italy and Off-Broadway.
If you go: Friday through Feb. 9. 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; 2 p.m. Sundays; Gonzaga University's Myrtle Woldson Performing Arts Center, 211 E. Desmet Ave.; $10-$20, available through gonzaga.edu/ticketcenter.
'Mystery Science
Theater 3000' Live
"Mystery Science Theater 3000," which was created in 1988 and ran through 1999, revived in 2017 and currently airs on Netflix, is making the leap from the small screen to the First Interstate Center for the Arts stage on Thursday as part of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" Live tour.
This event was rescheduled from Jan. 16. Tickets for the original performance will be honored at this show.
Each "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episode featured show creator and original host Joel Hodgson, playing the role of Joel Robinson, watching and commenting on a B movie with his crew of movie-riffing robots.
The Spokane tour stop features a screening of "No Retreat, No Surrender," a 1986 film starring Kurt McKinney and Jean-Claude van Damme.
In the film, a self-conscious teen (McKinney) becomes a martial arts master due to help from the ghost of Bruce Lee (Tai Chung Kim). Van Damme plays Ivan Kraschinsky, a Soviet martial artist who is part of an organized crime syndicate.
Though the film, save for van Damme's fight scenes, wasn't well-received by critics, director/writer Corey Yuen went on to direct "No Retreat, No Surrender 2: Raging Thunder" and "No Retreat, No Surrender 3: Blood Brothers."
Despite the same titles, neither film is connected to the original film's storyline. The live tour features jokes on the "so-bad-it's-good" film, plus sketches and songs.
The tour, Hodgson's last, stars Hodgson, Nate Begle (Crow), Conor McGiffin (Tom Servo), Emily Marsh (Crenshaw/Cambot) and Yvonne Freese (Gypsy/Mega-Synthia).
If you go: 7:30 p.m. Thursday; First Interstate Center for the Arts, 334 W. Spokane Falls Blvd.; $39.50-$59.50, available through TicketsWest.
Bill Engvall's show
rescheduled for March 28
After mechanical issues with the plane he was traveling on caused comedian Bill Engvall to miss his show at Coeur d'Alene Casino on Saturday, the performance has been rescheduled for March 28.

HIS 'RED FLAGS'; Weinstein said to hire agency to quiet accusers

Texto completo: Manhattan prosecutors shed some light Thursday on the shady tactics accused sexual predator Harvey Weinstein used to silence his alleged victims.
Dev Sen, a partner at the Boies Schiller Flexner law firm, testified at the disgraced Hollywood producer's trial about a contract the New York-based firm drew up in 2017 at Weinstein's behest with Black Cube, a private intelligence agency run by former Israeli spies.
"There was a contract and the administration was ensuring that monies that were due on the contract got paid upon the instruction of Mr. Weinstein or his colleagues," Dev said.
According to Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi, Weinstein enlisted the spy service when he caught wind his accusers were speaking to reporters - offering a six-figure prize if the agency stopped any negative coverage.
Weinstein promised, "that if Black Cube provided intelligence to completely stop the article from being published in any way, shape or form, Black Cube would be paid a success fee of $300,000," Illuzzi said on Thursday.
Out of the jury's earshot, Illuzzi said Weinstein in 2017 sent Black Cube a list of people to investigate a few months before the New Yorker and the New York Times published bombshell stories detailing how dozens of women accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting them.
Highlighted names on the list were classified by the producer as "red flags," Illuzzi said.
Among the names, the prosecutor said, was "The Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra, who has accused Weinstein of raping her in the winter of 1993-94.
Last week, Sciorra testified about a suspicious phone call she received from a purported journalist in August 2017.
"He said he was a journalist working on a piece about how the film industry had changed since the '90s," Sciorra said. "It was obvious to me that he was working for the defendant."
Burke held off on ruling how much of the Black Cube contract jurors will be privy to.
Asked outside of court Thursday why he hired the agency, Weinstein said, "For days like this."
Earlier Thursday, prosecutors questioned Monika Mikkelsen, a casting director from Los Angeles who worked on the 2006 film "Pulse."
Prosecutors have laid out the theory Weinstein dangled a part in the movie to lure accuser Tarale Wulff to his Soho loft, where she alleged he raped her.
Mikkelsen testified on direct examination that Weinstein was not involved with the film - his brother Bob Weinstein produced it - nor had she ever heard of Wulff.
Weinstein, 67, faces two counts of predatory sexual assault, two counts of rape and one count of criminal sexual assault in his New York case. He faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted on the top charge.

Texto completo: Five decades, a legal pad, yada yada yada - Jerry Seinfeld's written a new book.
The as-yet-untitled collection of Seinfeld's comedy bits dating back to the 1970s is the long-awaited followup to the funnyman's 1993 "Seinlanguage," which was a No. 1 New York Times best-seller.
"When I first came up with a funny bit, whether it happened on a stage, in a conversation or working it out on my preferred canvas, the big yellow legal pad, I kept it in one of those old-school accordion folders," said Seinfeld in a statement Thursday. "So I have every piece of standup comedy I thought was worth saving from 45 years of hacking away at this for all I was worth."
The book, still without a name, is due in bookstores on Oct. 6. Publisher Simon & Schuster said the work is organized by decades, beginning in the 1970s when Seinfeld was a college student.
"Seinlanguage" sold more than 1 million copies, and Simon & Schuster President and Publisher Jonathan Karp is assuring potential buyers that this one is every bit as good.
"Not only is the book brilliantly crafted and laugh-out-loud funny on every page, but readers will be able to see Jerry and his comedy evolve through the years," said Karp.

Kenya's new IDs may exclude millions

Texto completo: For all his 73 years, Ahmed Khalil Kafe lived as a citizen of Kenya.
Born in the capital, Nairobi, Kafe worked as a police officer and even served with the presidential guard, court documents show. But last April, when he tried to register for a national ID in the giant biometric database that President Uhuru Kenyatta has said will be the "single source of truth" on Kenya's population, he was turned away.
Now, Kafe said, "My life is in limbo."
In an ambitious new initiative, the Kenyan government is planning to assign each citizen a unique identification number that will be required to go to school, get health care and housing, register to vote, get married and obtain a driver's license, bank account and even a mobile phone number. In preparation, nearly 40 million Kenyans have already had their fingerprints and faces scanned by a new biometric system that ramped up last spring.
But millions of ethnic, racial and religious minorities -- like Kafe, who is a Kenyan of Nubian descent -- are running into obstacles and facing additional scrutiny when they apply for the documents required to get a biometric ID. Many have faced outright rejection.
Now the biometric ID plan is being challenged in court by civil rights organizations, which say it is disenfranchising members of minority groups. The high court is expected to rule this week on whether the project is constitutional.
"The government is digitizing discrimination," said Shafi Ali, chairman of the Nubian Rights Forum, one of three civil rights groups that brought the court challenge. Without an ID card and identification number, he said, "you are totally a living dead."
The Kenyan Interior Ministry, which is leading the biometric project -- known as the National Integrated Identity Management System -- declined to comment on anything about it, citing the pending court case.
Such identity projects are increasingly common and sometimes even lauded by global institutions like the World Bank for their potential to increase access to financial services and ensure transparent elections.
But as in India, where the government has come under withering criticism for forcing nearly 2 million people to prove their citizenship or risk being declared stateless, Kenya's program has been denounced for further marginalizing already vulnerable populations.
"There is the real risk," said Keren Weitzberg, a researcher at University College London who is studying the biometric program in Kenya, that the IDs "will only reproduce existing inequalities and exacerbate debates over who is 'really' a Kenyan."
Kenya is a diverse country with a history of tensions between ethnic groups. Indians and Nubians, whose ancestors were brought to Kenya as workers by British colonial authorities, have struggled for generations to be accepted as full citizens. Kenyans of Somali descent have faced particular suspicion and discrimination -- even being rounded up and held for days in a stadium -- in the wake of terrorist attacks by militant group al-Shabab.
In Kenya, to secure a biometric identification number -- known as a Huduma Namba, or "service number" in Swahili -- adults must provide a national identity card, while birth certificates are required for those under 18.
The Kenyan government has long made it harder -- or even impossible -- for members of some ethnic groups, among them Nubians, Somalis, Maasais, Boranas, Indians and Arabs, to apply for the documents required for national ID cards.
They may be asked to present land titles or the papers of their grandparents, or be questioned by security agents. And often, they can apply only on specific days of the week or in certain seasons, especially in small towns and rural areas.
Members of some of these communities live along Kenya's borders, and government officials say they have introduced some measures to keep out those who pose a security risk, or people fleeing war in neighboring Somalia. But the measures also affect pastoralists who cross back-and-forth along the country's borders, such as the Maasai and Samburu.
The added hurdles have affected at least 5 million of Kenya's 47.5 million people, leading to delays in processing their ID cards and outright denials, said Laura Goodwin, citizenship program director for Namati, an international legal justice group.
Human rights advocates say that many people were turned away during the biometric registration drive last April and May. If the biometric ID system goes ahead, Goodwin said, millions could end up without identification numbers.
Many Kenyans in towns and villages outside Nairobi and other major cities lack papers because their local registration centers are far away. Or they have to wait longer for papers because those centers are overwhelmed.
The government has also drawn criticism over the mechanism it used to institute the Huduma project, whose initial cost was projected at over $74 million.
It was introduced in Parliament using a procedure usually reserved for minor changes to existing laws, and its first iteration sought to collect DNA and GPS data, both of which were barred by a court in April. The legislation detailing how the system would work was not published until July, after the registration drive had ended.
The law also imposes fines and criminal penalties, including prison time, for failing to register -- which critics have called disproportionate.
"You shouldn't have to blackmail people into doing things that are for their own good," said Nanjala Nyabola, author of "Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics: How the internet Era is Transforming Politics in Kenya."
For Kafe, at least, there may be a glimmer of hope.
After he agreed to testify in court in the challenge to the Huduma program, he said, registration officials visited his home and said they would process his documents.
In September, he was given a "waiting card," which the government supplies while a national ID is being processed. But it could be months or even years before his identity card is delivered, if he receives one at all.
"When does a Kenyan become Kenyan?" Kafe asked. "We need a system that's good for all. We need equality."

Texto completo: Japanese prosecutors Thursday issued arrest warrants for three Americans suspected of helping former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country, where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial wrongdoing.
Ghosn surprised the world, and embarrassed Japanese authorities, when he slipped out of his home in Tokyo in late December and turned up a day later in Lebanon.
Prosecutors want to arrest Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old former Green Beret; his son, Peter Maxwell Taylor, 26; and George Antoine Zayek, 60. The warrant said they helped Ghosn avoid immigration checks and board a private jet in Osaka that took him to Turkey on the first leg of his escape.
They also issued a new warrant for the arrest of Ghosn, who "illegally left the country" without notifying immigration authorities.
The document was the first official confirmation by Japanese authorities of some of the details of Ghosn's flight.
According to the warrant, Michael Taylor and Zayek accompanied Ghosn from Tokyo to Osaka, where they hid him in "portable luggage" and helped smuggle him through a private jet terminal and onto a waiting plane where they accompanied him to Istanbul. Ghosn is believed to have hidden in a large black box typically used for transporting audio equipment.
Michael Taylor is a private-security contractor with extensive contacts in Lebanon dating to the 1980s, when he was deployed to Beirut as part of a team of U.S. Special Forces.
Zayek was born in Lebanon and previously worked with Taylor's Boston-based security company. The arrest warrant was the first public mention of Peter Taylor's involvement. All three are believed to be American citizens, prosecutors said. Michael and Peter Taylor and Zayek have been in the Middle East since Ghosn's escape, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The warrants were announced a day after prosecutors raided the Tokyo office of Ghosn's former lawyer, looking for evidence related to the escape.

Texto completo: Sonny Grosso, the true-blue New York City police detective who with his gung-ho partner made the record heroin bust that inspired the Oscar-winning film "The French Connection," died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by his longtime companion, Christina Kraus.
A product of East Harlem and the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Grosso rose to the rank of detective first grade in the New York Police Department faster than any predecessor. He followed his 22 years on the force with a second career as a television producer and consultant for television shows about law enforcement, including "Kojak," "Baretta" and "Night Heat," and for the movie "The Godfather," in which he played a detective named Phil.
Until he died, Grosso carried his off-duty .38-caliber Colt revolver, the very same gun that was taped to the tank of a toilet and fired (using blanks) by Al Pacino in a mob hit in "The Godfather."
But Grosso was best known as the model for Buddy Russo, played by Roy Scheider in William Friedkin's 1971 action thriller, "The French Connection," which won five Academy Awards, including best picture. Gene Hackman portrayed Popeye Doyle, a doppelgänger for Grosso's real-life partner, Edward R. Egan, who was revered for his bravery and nicknamed Bullets because he enjoyed firing his revolver for flamboyant effect. (Egan died in 1995.)
The film, a fictionalized account based on Robin Moore's book of the same name, recounts how the case unfolded after the two detectives, out for drinks at the Copacabana nightclub, spotted known drug dealers adulating an unidentified man, whom they later discovered owned a greasy spoon luncheonette in Brooklyn.
They followed him on a hunch, and the trail led to a French smuggler who was shipping 100 pounds of heroin -- some of it stolen from a police vault -- to the United States. Grosso determined the magnitude of the cache by weighing the Frenchman's 1960 Buick Invicta when it arrived by ship and again when it was about to be transported back to France. (Grosso appears uncredited in the movie as a mob courier.)
Police said the seizure was a record amount at the time.
"He made that case," Randy Jurgenson, another former partner on the police force, said of Grosso in a phone interview.
The "French Connection" movie might have made it seem as if Egan was more menacing than Grosso. But Grosso was no pushover.
"I played Sonny's character as more of a calming influence," Friedkin, the director, said in a published interview. "Thing is about Sonny, if he's your friend, he'd stop a bullet for you. Eddie had that Irish bluster, but Sonny had that Italian iron fist. You did not mess with Sonny Grosso."
Edward Conlon, a former detective who became a bestselling author, compared Egan and Grosso this way: "One was the gas pedal; the other was the brake."
As a police officer from 1954 to 1976, Grosso handled cases that involved the Black Liberation Army and the 1980 murder of a young violinist backstage at the Metropolitan Opera.
His television and film career was equally gritty. Grosso played a counterfeiter in a 1973 film he wrote about his own career, "The Seven-Ups," which also starred Scheider. He portrayed the sidekick of a detective played by Frank Sinatra in the 1977 TV movie "Contract on Cherry Street."
Grosso produced, acted in or consulted on so many police dramas that critic James Monaco jocularly predicted that someday scholars would be dissecting "Grossovian subtexts" behind his oeuvre.
Salvatore Anthony Grosso was born on July 21, 1930. His father, Benedetto, was a truck driver who died when Sonny was still a teenager. His mother was Lillian (Vetrano) Grosso.
In addition to Kraus, his companion of 43 years, Grosso is survived by a son, Salvatore; three daughters, Donna and Gloria Grosso and Tina Salino; two sisters, Antoinette Treanor and Celeste Grosso; and five grandchildren.
In 1997, Grosso received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for being "an Italian American first, a cop second, a producer third and a trusted and valued friend always."
Another example of the longevity of his friendships was his relationship with Larry Jacobson, a television veteran with whom he had formed a production company not long after retiring from the police force.
"We've been together so long," Grosso told The New York Times in 2005, "that if I had killed him 25 years ago, I'd be out on good behavior by now."

Texto completo: After the hectic years of child-rearing end and grown children move out, many empty nesters find themselves in a state of adjustment.
While some rejoice in their leaner schedules and newfound quiet, others deal with loneliness and depression, often referred to as empty-nest syndrome. In either case, most empty nesters eventually reach a point where they ask themselves: Is it time to downsize, upsize or just renovate and configure their current home?
A recent report from Freddie Mac found that baby boomers have stayed in their homes much longer than previous generations. A 2019 report from Houzz, a home-remodeling website, found that 60% of baby boomers - defined as people ages 55 to 74 - planned to stay in their homes for the next 11 or more years. Older Americans tend to move into residential care communities in their mid-80s, according to data available from the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For those who opt to stay in their empty nests, many decide it is a good time to finally do the renovations they might have put off in previous years. These home makeovers tend to fall into three broad categories: fixing a space to make room for a new lifestyle or hobby; sprucing up a now unused space so it can be rented out to create a new revenue stream; or renovating to make a home more comfortable for visits from adult children and their expanding families.
Taking the time to figure out how you want your empty nest to affect your lifestyle will help you figure out how to reconfigure a home, said Robin Baron, an interior designer with her own firm in Manhattan. Many of her empty-nest clients have approached her after deciding they want to "entertain more," but she's had to pick apart what that means.
Do you want to have more dinner or cocktail parties? Do you want to host fundraisers or just have several friends over for a movie night? Will you do the cooking or hire caterers? "The word 'entertain' is too broad, so you must narrow that down, then come up with the design," she said.
Mary Ann Gioeli, a publishing executive, said she knew immediately what she wanted to do when her son moved out. About two weeks after Ryan, now 30, left their Upper West Side apartment for the Air Force in 2014, she threw out the "gross" black leather couch that was in his room and repainted the formerly bright blue space a neutral white. To turn the room into a den, she bought new furniture, including a pullout couch, and moved the television from the living room.
For Gioeli, 67, this was the first step in transforming her three-bedroom apartment into a more adult space. Although she was thrilled her home had been the go-to hangout for her son and daughter, Francesca, now 32, and their friends during their adolescence, she longed to turn the large, bright apartment into a quieter space. "Somewhere you can have a conversation," she said.
When her daughter left to rent her own apartment in 2016, Gioeli turned her bedroom into a proper guest room. Out went the dated furniture, in came a queen-size bed. These renovations cost a few thousand dollars and were paid for from savings, said Gioeli, who is separated from her husband.
In late 2016, she finally tackled what the family had longed to do: a complete revamp of the dated bathrooms. A tub in the master bath was removed, and a walk-in shower was installed. Double sinks and new storage spaces were added, as well as a new marble floor. The guest bathroom was also thoroughly updated, with a glass-encased shower replacing a former closet space. A home-equity loan covered the $65,000 price tag to renovate both bathrooms.
"I told my kids they will always have a home to return to," said Gioeli, whose daughter boomeranged back home last year. "But it's been great to be able to open up my home and have friends stay over."
Some empty nesters decide to turn their now unused space into extra income. Hollis Giammatteo, a writer, used about $180,000 from savings to gut-renovate her daughter's old basement bedroom and turn it into an Airbnb rental. Inspired by a friend who had done something similar, Giammatteo, who lives in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, said she preferred to lease the space short term because the city is a high-demand tourist and business destination and she is able to keep the unit regularly booked. She said that using an online portal had made it easy to block out specific days when friends and family planned to stay with her. She estimated she had grossed around $125,000 since her first rental in 2015.
That said, she advises those interested in turning unused space into a short-term rental to investigate local laws. "You have to be willing to take on bureaucracy," Giammatteo, 71, said. Depending on the area, you may need insurance, a business license and to pay taxes on income, she said.
Updating a home's look, not preparing it for sale, was the goal of 71% of consumers age 50 and older who either had completed a home renovation in the past two years or were in the middle of or planning to begin a remodel in the next six months, according to a survey taken by the Schlesinger Group for Sweeten, an online renovation platform.
"We see renovations ranging from updating a bathroom to include a two-person soaking tub to gut remodels that convert bedrooms into hobby rooms - from art to yoga," said Jean Brownhill, Sweeten's founder.
That said, experts suggest that homeowners check with a local broker before starting a large-scale renovation to see if their design will have resale value.
"Even if you have no plans to sell the home for another 10 years, it's a wise thing to do," said Dave Goscinski, the owner of JJED Remodeling in Dumont, New Jersey. "You're doing the renovation for yourselves, but can you recoup the investment later?"

Texto completo: For over a year, we’ve perused the robust field of Democratic presidential candidates, squeezing them like melons in the produce aisle. We’ve wondered whether some are too old or too young. We’ve speculated about whether the nation is ready for a female president or, perhaps, a gay one. We’ve analyzed who would fare best in a debate against Typhoon Trump.
None of this will really matter until Democrats resolve the overarching issue dividing the party. With the Iowa caucuses kicking off the primary season Monday, Democrats must settle on a winning approach to governing.
The issue was drawn into sharp focus recently when the editorial board at The New York Times, despite “more than a dozen hours” questioning the leading Democrats, became paralyzed — not over candidates but over the direction the party should take. The paper broke with its 160-year tradition and gave dual endorsements. to Sens Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Fierce struggle between party's 2 wings
What stumped the Times was what it identified as a choice as between “the radical and the realist models. ” You might think of these positions as “ultra-progressive and center-left,” and you might view them as “lanes” rather than “models. ” Semantics aside, the two wings of the party — which have always been part of modern Democratic posturing — are in a fierce struggle.
Do Democrats want to fix the mess created in President Donald Trump’s first term, or blow it up? That’s what this primary is really about.
Polling leaders among fixers are former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who just Wednesday broke into double digits in Iowa. The duo most in favor of blowing things up are Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren.
The time for picking a lane is at hand. Much as I admire the ultra-progressive agenda, I favor staying closer to the center in this election.
Consensus or lock on truth: The real Democratic divide is between Bernie Sanders voters and everyone else
As I see it, the far left represents 90% of what I favor, has a 50% chance of beating Trump and, if elected, can get 40% of what I support through Congress. The center-left represents only 75% of what I favor but has a 60% chance of beating Trump, and it, too has the very same 40% chance in Congress. Bottom line: We wind up in the same place legislatively, but the centrist Democrats have a better chance of winning in November.
Move to center lane sooner, not later
In presidential elections, candidates in both parties tend to sketch out somewhat extreme positions during the primaries, and then, out of necessity, move closer to the center for the general election. The problem facing the Warren/Sanders wing this year is that rigidity is part of the appeal — and that approach is reflected among many supporters.
That makes it harder and more time-consuming to temper positions that could be damaging in the general election. And the longer the party takes to establish its governing strategy, the greater the risk that Democrats will not rally enthusiastically around the eventual nominee. We saw that in 2016 when some Sanders supporters remained cool to Hillary Clinton.
It’s said that government is so broken that blowing things up is the only option. But if victory in November requires appealing to moderates, some of whom might have voted Republican in 2016, then the sledgehammer approach could be too much. Also, the ultra-progressives make an easy target for Trump. All he has to do is say “socialist” a dozen times at each campaign rally and he triggers fear — even if unreasonably — among voters who might otherwise abandon him.
The possibility of collaboration: If Democrats beat Trump in 2020, will they build a bipartisan truce and heal America?
Klobuchar and Buttigieg are making the most compelling cases for a center-left approach. Warren, who has an early polling advantage against both of them, who has already softened her approach to dismantling the health care system, could be the Democrats’ top choice if she continues to moderate her positions. She must assure primary voters that her long-term goals do not warrant short-term fears.
The Democrats’ best bet will be the candidate who favors progressive policies while acknowledging that in this election the HOV (High Occupancy Voter) lane runs down the center, not the far left.

Texto completo: The first and most visible test of candidate support in the 2020 presidential election is the Iowa presidential caucus, which takes place on Monday.
In addition to the Hawkeye State, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina will also hold primaries in February. Arkansas' March 3 primary will be part of "Super Tuesday," a supersized day where 15 states and American Samoa will all hold their primary elections.
While Iowa does not control who becomes the candidate of each party, Iowans' choices almost always end up matching the rest of the nation.
One of the architects of the modern Iowa caucuses, which began in 1972, wrote that the significance of the caucus was unanticipated.
"Never in our dreams did we realize we would be 'first in the nation,' nor did we ever expect anyone outside Iowa would pay much attention," retired Iowa State University engineering professor Richard Seagrave wrote.
Seagrave said that it wasn't political calculation that led to the choice to run the caucus early in the election year. It was the "immense amount of paperwork" needed to document caucus proceedings with only a slow mimeograph machine that led to the choice of such an early caucus date.
"Remember that we had no 'user-friendly' computers or high-speed copy machines in 1972," wrote Seagrave.
The significance of first-in-the-nation placement did not become clear until a barely known governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter, came to Iowa in 1976 to test the waters for a presidential run.
That year "Uncommitted" got 14,508 votes (37 percent). Carter came in with 10,764 votes (27 percent), but was declared the winner. He went on to get the nomination and win the presidency. The fact that a relative unknown — spending little money but lots of time and face-to-face campaigning — could win was surprising.
Why a caucus? Before the modern system for choosing presidential candidates was invented, the mechanism since 1832 for nomination of presidential candidates has been a national political convention of each party. Voters in each state convention elect delegates to the national convention. A caucus is one way state party leaders pick whom to send, and whom those delegates should support.
Powerful political bosses, such as Huey Long from Louisiana, William "Boss" Tweed of New York, James Michael Curley of Boston and Tom Pendergast from Kansas City, had the real power in the 19th and early 20th centuries through their political organizations. Bosses offered services — housing, medical care, food, clothing — to people before government services became common.
Pendergast once told The New York Times, "When a poor man comes to old Tom's boys for help we don't make one of those damn fool investigations like these city charities. No, by God, we fill his belly and warm his back and vote him our way."
A vestige of that political era lasted into the second half of the 20th century, when the actions of Chicago's longtime political boss, Democratic Mayor Richard Daley, led to a profound change in the presidential candidate selection process.
The 1968 Democratic convention took place in Chicago, a city tightly controlled by Daley. His operatives had long seen to it that people voted for Daley and his chosen candidates.
But 1968 was a year of violence related to race and the Vietnam War. Riots disrupted the convention. Mayor Daley used his police force to crush the protests.
Daley then bullied delegates to vote to nominate his favorite candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, even though Humphrey didn't win a single primary election.
All of this was covered live on television. The violence and bias threatened to taint the Democratic Party.
1968 provokes reforms The Democratic Party created the McGovern-Fraser Commission in 1968 in response to the events in Chicago. The new rules changed the party's presidential nominating process in an attempt to make them more systematic and transparent, as well as to encourage more participation by minority groups, young people and women roughly proportional to their numbers in states.
It was these reforms that launched Iowa's caucuses in 1972.
In 1976, the Iowa Republican Party followed the Democrats, and they began holding caucuses on the same early date.
That increased the visibility of the Iowa caucuses out of proportion to their actual numeric influence in the nominating convention, where in 2020 Iowa will send only 49 delegates out of the estimated total of 4,594 Democratic delegates.
In fact, the caucuses are in large part a media event or a beauty contest, as scholars Hugh Winebrenner and Dennis J. Goldford have suggested.
A legendary event occurred in 2004, when Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who came in third, was cheering on his supporters as he contemplated a national campaign. But a microphone malfunction amplified his enthusiasm. What become known as the "Dean Scream" tanked his candidacy.
In 2008 a first-term senator, Barack Obama, won the Iowa caucuses, propelling him to a hard-fought nomination and two terms in the White House.
And in 2016, Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders almost beat Hillary Clinton in Iowa.
How they do it On caucus night, registered Democrats and Republican voters gather at roughly 1,700 precinct meeting places. These have been schools, libraries, churches, fire stations and people's homes. In 2020, Democrats will also have satellite caucuses, some even held overseas.
There are speeches by supporters for each candidate who gather into groups for each candidate. The numbers in each group are counted.
For the Democrats, a candidate must have at least 15 percent of the all the participants in that precinct to be viable. Otherwise that candidate is declared "non-viable" and the supporters are asked to join another group or remain undecided.
Once the viable groups have been declared, a complex mathematical calculation determines how many delegates are allocated to each surviving candidate.
In Republican caucuses, attendees vote and the delegates are apportioned according to the statewide results.
Political tradition The Iowa caucuses have become a well-watched political tradition because the media devotes so much attention to the candidates' activities in Iowa and then how they perform on caucus night.
Criticisms have emerged. Iowa's small and mostly white population has subjected the caucus to the charge that it is not representative of the nation as a whole.
A recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll attests to that concern:
• A 57 percent majority agreed that holding the opening contests in Iowa and New Hampshire was a good system "because it forces candidates to talk directly to voters."
• A 52% majority also agreed that holding the opening contests in Iowa and New Hampshire wasn't a good system "because the two states don't reflect the nation's diversity."
"There is also a concern that caucuses are difficult events to participate in because voters must attend personally and at night. The turnout rate of eligible voters is low, hovering around 10 percent, while primaries normally have turnout of 35 percent or more.
In 2020, there is renewed debate about how Americans should select their candidates for president. Caucuses are now generally in disfavor, with many states moving to primaries.
One thing is clear: As American candidate selection evolved from the days of political bosses to today's caucuses and primaries, that process will continue to evolve.

Texto completo: AMES, Iowa – In "The Music Man" which, happily, returns to Broadway this fall, there's a tune called "Iowa Stubborn," written in 1957 by Mason City native Meredith Willson. It muses that folks in the Hawkeye state "could stand touchin' noses for a week at a time and never see eye to eye."
There's a "chip on the shoulder attitude," the song says, perfectly describing how Iowans feel about their Feb. 3 presidential caucus. It also explains why the outcome among Democrats is difficult to predict.
"I'm trying to decide between (Elizabeth) Warren and Bernie (Sanders)," said Ria Keinert, a physical therapist, waiting for a Sanders rally to begin. "I've seen most of the candidates; Bernie three times."
According to a recent Des Moines Register/CNN Iowa poll, 45% of Democrats said they could still be persuaded in the closing weeks to pick a different candidate. The latest New York Times poll similarly showed 40% willing to shift their support.
The last four Register surveys confirmed the volatility. Last summer, former Vice President Joe Biden held a commanding lead. In September, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren climbed to the top. Two months later, now-former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg was number one, but this month Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vaulted to the lead.
In Iowa's land of retail presidential politics, most voters take their responsibility seriously. It's difficult for other Americans – especially those outside of early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – to fully comprehend what Iowans mean when they tell you they won't caucus for a candidate they haven't spoken with personally. To a resident of midtown Manhattan, that's surreal.
During my visit to Iowa last summer, I wrote that the state's mostly white and largely rural population might not make it the best place to conduct what is unquestionably the nation's most lengthy presidential screening test. That remains true. But there's more to it, and it becomes clear in speaking with Iowans as their big day draws near.
Colin Burczek, a clerk at the Des Moines Hilton, said he has narrowed his choice to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer. Burczek has met most of the Democrats, and the metrics he and many Iowans use to pick a candidate differs from what most Americans are able to glean from cable-TV and social media.
"You get a vibe," Burczek said. "You get to see who they are as an actual person."
Iowans put stock in the broadness of a smile and a the firmness of a handshake, but there's another factor complicating things in the caucuses. A candidate must reach a 15% threshold in a precinct in order to be awarded any delegates to the national nominating convention. Supporters of candidates who fall short will shift to someone else on subsequent ballots, creating a form of ranked voting in which second choices are important.
What's decided in Iowa is nationally significant, but it's conducted with a local approach – what Meredith Willson called being stubborn.
I asked Kurt Paeper, a volunteer at a Buttigieg town hall in Fort Dodge, about that.
"I don't think we're all stubborn," he said, sounding rather stubborn about it. "I just know we're fortunate to be able to look these candidates in the eye."

Empty nests branch out Baby boomers are staying in their homes longer - and taking on makeovers and renovations to suit their new lifestyle

Texto completo: After the hectic years of child-rearing end and grown children move out, many empty nesters find themselves in a state of adjustment.
While some rejoice in their leaner schedules and newfound quiet, others deal with loneliness and depression, often referred to as empty-nest syndrome. In either case, most empty nesters eventually reach a point where they ask themselves: Is it time to downsize, upsize or just renovate and configure their current home?
A recent report from Freddie Mac found that baby boomers have stayed in their homes much longer than previous generations. A 2019 report from Houzz, a home-remodeling website, found that 60% of baby boomers - defined as people ages 55 to 74 - planned to stay in their homes for the next 11 or more years. Older Americans tend to move into residential care communities in their mid-80s, according to data available from the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For those who opt to stay in their empty nests, many decide it is a good time to finally do the renovations they might have put off in previous years. These home makeovers tend to fall into three broad categories: fixing a space to make room for a new lifestyle or hobby; sprucing up a now unused space so it can be rented out to create a new revenue stream; or renovating to make a home more comfortable for visits from adult children and their expanding families.
Taking the time to figure out how you want your empty nest to affect your lifestyle will help you figure out how to reconfigure a home, said Robin Baron, an interior designer with her own firm in Manhattan. Many of her empty-nest clients have approached her after deciding they want to "entertain more," but she's had to pick apart what that means.
Do you want to have more dinner or cocktail parties? Do you want to host fundraisers or just have several friends over for a movie night? Will you do the cooking or hire caterers? "The word 'entertain' is too broad, so you must narrow that down, then come up with the design," she said.
Mary Ann Gioeli, a publishing executive, said she knew immediately what she wanted to do when her son moved out. About two weeks after Ryan, now 30, left their Upper West Side apartment for the Air Force in 2014, she threw out the "gross" black leather couch that was in his room and repainted the formerly bright blue space a neutral white. To turn the room into a den, she bought new furniture, including a pullout couch, and moved the television from the living room.
For Gioeli, 67, this was the first step in transforming her three-bedroom apartment into a more adult space. Although she was thrilled her home had been the go-to hangout for her son and daughter, Francesca, now 32, and their friends during their adolescence, she longed to turn the large, bright apartment into a quieter space. "Somewhere you can have a conversation," she said.
When her daughter left to rent her own apartment in 2016, Gioeli turned her bedroom into a proper guest room. Out went the dated furniture, in came a queen-size bed. These renovations cost a few thousand dollars and were paid for from savings, said Gioeli, who is separated from her husband.
In late 2016, she finally tackled what the family had longed to do: a complete revamp of the dated bathrooms. A tub in the master bath was removed, and a walk-in shower was installed. Double sinks and new storage spaces were added, as well as a new marble floor. The guest bathroom was also thoroughly updated, with a glass-encased shower replacing a former closet space. A home-equity loan covered the $65,000 price tag to renovate both bathrooms.
"I told my kids they will always have a home to return to," said Gioeli, whose daughter boomeranged back home last year. "But it's been great to be able to open up my home and have friends stay over."
Some empty nesters decide to turn their now unused space into extra income. Hollis Giammatteo, a writer, used about $180,000 from savings to gut-renovate her daughter's old basement bedroom and turn it into an Airbnb rental. Inspired by a friend who had done something similar, Giammatteo, who lives in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, said she preferred to lease the space short term because the city is a high-demand tourist and business destination and she is able to keep the unit regularly booked. She said that using an online portal had made it easy to block out specific days when friends and family planned to stay with her. She estimated she had grossed around $125,000 since her first rental in 2015.
That said, she advises those interested in turning unused space into a short-term rental to investigate local laws. "You have to be willing to take on bureaucracy," Giammatteo, 71, said. Depending on the area, you may need insurance, a business license and to pay taxes on income, she said.
Updating a home's look, not preparing it for sale, was the goal of 71% of consumers age 50 and older who either had completed a home renovation in the past two years or were in the middle of or planning to begin a remodel in the next six months, according to a survey taken by the Schlesinger Group for Sweeten, an online renovation platform.
"We see renovations ranging from updating a bathroom to include a two-person soaking tub to gut remodels that convert bedrooms into hobby rooms - from art to yoga," said Jean Brownhill, Sweeten's founder.
That said, experts suggest that homeowners check with a local broker before starting a large-scale renovation to see if their design will have resale value.
"Even if you have no plans to sell the home for another 10 years, it's a wise thing to do," said Dave Goscinski, the owner of JJED Remodeling in Dumont, New Jersey. "You're doing the renovation for yourselves, but can you recoup the investment later?"

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" – that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
"Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued at the Senate hearing on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued on Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump's behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.
With Trump preventing his closest advisers from testifying during the impeachment proceedings late last year, senators have an obligation at the trial to summon people like Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others.
But McConnell and the vast majority of his caucus seemed ready to forgo witnesses, arguing that they were under no duty to go on a "fishing expedition." Now there's a preview of what Bolton would say, and it goes to the heart of the allegations against Trump.
Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-vote majority in the 100-member Senate, are considering their next move, and this is where the Democrats could grease the skids by laying out a deal with Republicans to allow prosecutors and defense lawyers to call relevant witnesses of their choice.
True, that might result in a subpoena for Hunter Biden, who worked for a scandal-marred Ukrainian energy company. (Did he show poor judgment? Sure. Should Trump be trying to outsource his opposition research to a foreign government? Absolutely not.) But if a compromise would allow Bolton and others to testify, it would serve the public's interest.
This impeachment trial – only the third in U.S. history – is much more than just a proceeding before the Senate. It's a vehicle for the American people to judge their president's character and conduct. For that, witnesses are imperative.
Bolton's book is slated for publication in March. To pass on the chance to thoroughly question and cross-examine him, under oath, would be a loss to history and expose these historic proceedings as a farce.

For Bolton, it's now payback time

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – You can call John Bolton a lot of things — bully, brawler, neocon — but not many would call him a dummy.
This is especially true at this precise moment, when he may be the only person to emerge a winner from Donald Trump's impeachment trial.
To many Americans, the name John Bolton likely conjures up little more than a walrus-ian mustache to which the man's loyalty never wavers. Perhaps he keeps the little shrub to remind his upper lip not to curl with contempt toward those whose opinions differ from his own. As his friends and former colleagues will tell you, Bolton tends to be an absolutist with an affinity for black and white and no love for elitists or fools.
They will also tell you that he is above all a man of principle who would never sacrifice himself for the most-unprincipled president in modern history. Whether he is subpoenaed to testify before the Senate is virtually irrelevant considering that we already know what he knows.
For one thing, excerpts of his forthcoming book's manuscript were recently leaked to The New York Times. Among revelations therein: Then-national security adviser Bolton and Attorney General Bill Barr discussed "concerns that President Trump was effectively granting personal favors to the autocratic leaders of Turkey and China."
Also, Bolton writes that Trump explicitly made military aid to Ukraine contingent upon investigations into political foe Joe Biden and his son Hunter. But, then, we already knew that, too.
The rest is theater, which, frankly, has become a bit dull. Witnesses-to-the-rescue is a tempting notion, but it seems unlikely that Bolton's contribution would sway the Republican-majority Senate to convict the president.
So, why the backlash against Bolton from the White House, other than his apparent disloyalty? What else does he have? The White House knows exactly what he has since Bolton sent a copy of his manuscript for its review a month ago.
The more apt observation may be that he's got nothing to lose and, based on his long history of government service, everything to maintain. That is, his reputation for principle over loyalty. Bolton's repertoire in government service, which began soon after his graduation from Yale Law School (on scholarship), is that of a bulldog — stubborn, fearless, prone to infighting and concerned foremost with the sovereignty of the United States. He was an America First gladiator long before Trump thought of it as a foreign policy imperative.
Among other things, Bolton has nothing but contempt for the United Nations, which made his turn as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush a bit unusual. Before that, while serving in the State Department, he helped Bush un-sign the U.N. "Rome Statute," which created the International Criminal Court for war crimes, lest other countries use the treaty as a cudgel against America and our troops. In a 2018 speech to the Federalist Society, Bolton referred to this as "one of my proudest achievements."
In some conservative circles, bets are that Bolton wouldn't just be willing to testify, as he has said he would if subpoenaed by the Senate. He'd love to. One way or the other, his story, supported by the paper trail he created as national security adviser, will come out. It won't be good for Trump, but it won't necessarily hurt him in the immediate future. Everybody knows what Trump is. The only issue is whether enough senators care enough to convict him.
Trump and his loyalists have accused Bolton of trying to sell a book and make money. Note to the unpublished: Well-known writers such as Bolton typically are paid upfront by their publisher in the form of an advance. Whether the book makes money, thereafter, is primarily the concern of the publisher. Bolton's book's value has been reported in the neighborhood of $2 million.
Thus, money isn't likely Bolton's chief motivation. Far more compelling to someone like Bolton is what one might call principled justice. Trump embarrassed Bolton by ignoring his advice and then firing him by tweet (Bolton maintains he quit) for an offense that ought really to make Bolton's point-of-pride list: He objected to Trump's genius idea to host the Taliban at Camp David near the anniversary of 9/11.
So, no, Bolton isn't only selling books. He's saving his legacy — and giving back to Trump as good as he got. Testifying before the Senate might just make his day — in a Dirty Harry kind of way. But the book otherwise will stand when history passes judgment on a man who picked the right side.

Texto completo: Even as the impeachment drama intensifies in Washington, D.C., with bombshells from John Bolton, political passions are swirling around another story: pundits on CNN mocking supporters of Donald Trump as illiterate rubes.
It's the old familiar comedy-drama: liberal elites versus the people. The conservative press and social media have erupted in outrage and glee, with many predictions that insults and condescension from the left will push many voters into the Trump camp (just like, in 2016, Hillary Clinton's reference to hard-core Trump supporters as "deplorables" likely helped Trump). But do they have a legitimate grievance - especially when rallying behind a leader who has made insults his trademark?
The CNN segment focused on the kerfuffle over Secretary of State Mike Pompeo challenging NPR host Mary Louise Kelly to find Ukraine on a map. "Never Trump" Republican Rick Wilson joked about Trump's ignorance and suggested that Pompeo was playing to "the credulous boomer rube demo ... that wants to think that Donald Trump's the smart one, and ... y'all elitists are dumb." Then, he and New York Times contributing opinion writer Wajahat Ali mimicked Trump supporters with rural Southern accents scoffing at "you elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling" while CNN's Don Lemon laughed along. (He claims he was still reacting to Wilson's initial Trump joke.)
Much of the conservative reaction to this viral clip is politically calculated faux outrage (the Republican National Committee already has a new "They think you're a joke" ad). However, I agree the impromptu comedy showed bad taste and poor judgment. Making fun of accents is playing to nasty stereotypes; it's wrong whether directed at, say, Mexican-Americans or at white "rubes."
That said, Wilson had a point about a significant part of the Trump base: people who see Trump's crassness, boorishness and contempt for expert knowledge as reasons to like him, as evidence that he stands with the people against the arrogant, politically correct elites.
Elite contempt for ordinary Americans is to the right what racism and misogyny are to the left: a form of prejudice that is real, but also vastly amplified by a toxic culture of grievance, hypervigilance and victimhood.
This form of grievance politics became a major force on the conservative scene with the rise of Sarah Palin, who sneered, "I'm sorry that I'm not so hoity-toity" when Republican pundits voiced concern about her conspicuous ignorance and disinterest in ideas. Trump and his fans have raised it to stratospheric levels.
Meanwhile, aggrieved conservatives are ignoring rhetoric on their own side that is at least as hostile to their fellow Americans - going back to when Palin referred to small-town and rural areas as "pro-American parts of the country." (What does that make the rest of us?) Pro-Trump pundits such as Rush Limbaugh, Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter have made a career out of deriding liberals and Democrats as stupid, "unhinged," "godless" America-haters or lazy parasites. (Remember the "47%" of "takers" during the 2012 elections? And the videos of mostly black Barack Obama voters clamoring for free "Obama money" and "Obama phones"?)
People professing to be offended by the CNN segment include Fox News regulars Jesse Kelly, who penned an essay in 2018 fantasizing about civil war against the liberals, and Mark Steyn, who once described the "blue" voting base as consisting of sexual perverts, "abortion fetishists," and immigrants who weren't properly vetted.
Of course, Trump routinely whips up hate against his version of "deplorables": Democrats, immigrants - including legal immigrants and refugees who he believes shouldn't be in this country - and the media.
Dear conservatives: respect for fellow Americans begins at home.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - When Louis C.K. returned to the Comedy Cellar nine months after confessing to sexual misconduct, many criticized the club in tweets and articles, and a few protested and walked out of shows. But the only star comic to stop performing there was Leslie Jones.
She started spending more time at the Comic Strip on the Upper East Side near her home. "They took his picture down," Jones said of that club, adding, "Mine's up."
Jones, who has talked to the Comedy Cellar's management about her disappointment but has returned to the club after a long stint away, said it was a personal decision.
"I knew girls," she said, pausing and holding a stare, "and they got to walk into the club and see him talking to the owner. That ain't cool."
Using a metaphor she returned to a couple of times in our interview, Jones said she no longer cared about rocking the boat: "I am at the age when I will get off the boat and get on another damn boat."
Last year, she exited the biggest yacht in comedy, "Saturday Night Live," and when asked why, Jones paused, uncharacteristically cautious: "I'm 52 and tired. 'SNL' is a hard job. It's 100 hours a week," she said. "Also, it's an institution. I get bored. And I want to do different things."
So she is, with movie and television projects in the works this year (the "Coming to America" sequel and a reboot of "Supermarket Sweep," which she will host), along with a just-released Netflix special, "Time Machine," directed by the showrunners of "Game of Thrones," David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.
Onstage and off, Jones is not short on swagger.
"I want to be the next Johnny Carson," she said. "I want 'The Tonight Show' really bad."
But what about Jimmy Fallon?
"I love Jimmy, but Jimmy is going to leave in a minute," she said. "And who are they going to possibly fill that spot with?"
After clarifying "except Seth Meyers," she answered her question with a roar: "ME!" She then flashed a stern face that pushed defiance into a deliriously funny kind of self-parody.
Jones thinks a lot about funny faces. She has studied the greats - Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball, whom she said had "the best faces in the game" - and developed her own go-to expressions from hours of testing in front of a mirror. There's the withering glare that writers on "SNL" would write into scripts as "the Leslie Look." It was inspired by the exasperation of her late brother, while a photo of her father in Vietnam is the model for her most unhinged expression, eyes popped out, one more than the other, a glance she uses to intimidate audiences and tame hecklers.
When Jones kills at clubs - and she can lay waste to an audience in a way that few others today can match - it can seem like a force of nature, the work of raw charisma and a tornado of energy. But make no mistake: She's a veteran student of her craft, honing her act since 1987 when she started telling jokes onstage as a Colorado college student in a contest before moving back to Los Angeles. However, she describes her new hour as a reintroduction. Since rocketing to fame on network television, she has an entirely new audience, one that's far whiter than the crowds she played to early in her career.
When asked about the difference, Jones said white audiences are "so much easier," before cackling and assuring me she loves the high standards of her black fans.
"You know how they say if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere?" she said. "If you can make it with a black audience, you can make it with anyone."
In the last few years, Jones' comedy has also evolved, thanks to a collaboration with comic Lenny Marcus, a bespectacled Jewish tactician of stand-up who opens for her and gives notes on jokes.
Jones, 6 feet tall with a booming voice, has always been a ferocious and freewheeling performer, but Marcus persuaded her to make a set list for the first time, to stick to the same jokes at every show as opposed to improvising new lines, and also to be more strategic with crowd work.
"She is also so quick and even when just talking, she's captivating," Marcus said by phone.
The funniest moments in a Jones performance are not really the move from setup to punchline but the radically extreme pivots between emotions. No comic alive travels a greater distance between confidence and vulnerability. In her most ambitious bit in the new special, she dramatizes texting a boyfriend, veering from angry dismissals to heartbreak and desperation in mere moments. "It's not easy to date Leslie Jones," she said, a line written by Marcus.
Being lonely in love has been a common theme of her comedy since the start of her career. Her first reliable joke involved telling women who can't find a man to visit the produce section of the supermarket, before whipping out a cucumber and later taking a bite out of it. "Do you know how many rotten cucumbers were in my car?" she said, laughing at that early prop work.
As a famous black woman in comedy, Jones has taken more abuse than most. After the sexist controversy over an all-female "Ghostbusters," which she starred in, Jones became the target of trolls. Her phone was hacked, and nude photos were spread across the internet.
Jones quickly turned this incident into comedy on "SNL," but she said that the intensity of the backlash got to her, briefly. It didn't make her stop sending nude photos. "I remember the person I sent it to was like, 'You ain't learned yet? You learned nothing,' " she said, letting out a booming guffaw.
And when the trailer for another "Ghostbusters" was recently released, she saw it as vindication for the worst critics. "It pissed me off," she said. "It feels like, 'They did it wrong, and we know you guys were upset about that little girls' "Ghostbusters," so we're going to do it right now.' "
She added that her movie was hurt by studio interference and an edit that took out 20 minutes of strong material, and she wished she had spoken up in protest.
"If I was the Leslie I am now, I think it would have went different," she said, shifting her face into not exactly the Leslie Look but something adjacent. "Big franchise, don't rock the boat," she said. "I wish I would have rocked the boat."
Caption: To perfect her funny faces, comedian Leslie Jones studied the work of Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball.
Comedian Leslie Jones in New York on Jan. 10, 2020. The star of a dynamite new special talks about why she left "SNL," why she quit performing at the same club as Louis C.K., and how the next "Ghostbusters" is a win for the trolls. "I am at the age when I will get off the boat and get on another damn boat," Jones said.

Texto completo: The Senate will acquit President Trump on both House articles of impeachment. That much even Adam Schiff knows. The Senate trial is now all about the election and impeachment precedents, which are two of many good reasons for cleaning up the trial distortions and wrapping up the show this week.
Start with the media claim that defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz said a President can do anything to further his re-election as long he thinks it is in the national interest. This isn't what he said. The Harvard professor said explicitly that a President can be impeached for criminal acts. He could be impeached for soliciting a financial bribe, for example, or seeking a campaign contribution from a foreign source. He could also be impeached for exceeding his constitutional authority.
Mr. Dershowitz differs from the press in believing that a President cannot be impeached for acts of foreign policy that may be in his personal political interest but aren't themselves impeachable acts. Presidents conduct foreign policy in what they think is the national interest, but they also hope it will be in their political interest. Presidents typically act from "mixed motives," as Mr. Dershowitz put it, that are difficult to discern or to separate the high-minded from the self-interested.
It is thus too low a constitutional bar for the House to claim, as it does, that Mr. Trump can be impeached because Democrats think his motives were corrupt. The acts themselves must qualify as "high crimes and misdemeanors." Mr. Trump's acts don't qualify -- because asking aid recipients to investigate corruption isn't illegal, and in any case the aid to Ukraine was delivered on time and no investigation of Joe Biden was started. This does not condone Mr. Trump's request, which was reckless and dumb, but it isn't an impeachable offense.
GOP Senator Susan Collins exposed another distortion when she asked House managers if Mr. Trump broke any law, and if so why they didn't include specific bribery and honest-services fraud statutes in the impeachment articles. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries dodged the statute issue by suggesting that the "abuse of power" article somehow encompassed these crimes. Mr. Schiff added that "we outlined the facts that constitute bribery in the article, but 'abuse of power' is the highest crime."
But acts are either crimes or not. The House can't have implied articles of impeachment, or sleeper articles that you see if you read between the lines. The President can't be expected to defend himself against charges the House didn't include.
The real reason House managers didn't include bribery or honest-services fraud is because they know Mr. Trump's acts would not qualify under the Supreme Court's definition of those crimes. The Court requires a specific kind of quid pro quo that didn't take place. So the managers settled for the vague and subjective "abuse of power," which turns out to be whatever the House managers say it is.
Another abuse is Mr. Schiff's offer to abide by any ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts on evidence and witnesses if the President's lawyers do the same. Mr. Schiff wants the President's lawyers to cede claims of executive privilege when he knows the Chief Justice has no judicial authority in the trial.
The Chief is in the Senate as the presiding officer, not as an Article III judge. The Senate can delegate certain trial powers to him if it wants, but it can't give him more power than the Senate has. And the Senate does not have the power to deny a President's claims of executive privilege.
Which brings us to the issue of witnesses -- especially whether to subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton. Democrats claim to want witnesses, but they don't if it means calling Hunter or Joe Biden. They want Republicans to vote to end the trial without witnesses so they and the impeachment press can cry "coverup" from here to the election.
Our view is that whatever Mr. Bolton has to say won't change the outcome of the trial. The New York Times report of what is in the draft of Mr. Bolton's book doesn't include impeachable offenses. Mr. Bolton's account of Mr. Trump's behavior may be highly critical, but that is something for voters to assess and render a verdict on in November.
The country will be best served now if the Senate ends the trial promptly without witnesses and with a vote to acquit. The verdict would repudiate a House impeachment that has violated constitutional norms and distorted the separation of powers.

No One Is Safe From Biased Reporting

Texto completo: A free and independent press is, and should always be, an impenetrable bulwark of our democracy. "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter," wrote Thomas Jefferson in a 1789 letter. The media's hallowed role, embodied in the First Amendment, assures near-total freedom to report (and even misreport) the news.
Press freedom, however, implies a responsibility to place truth above narrow partisan campaigns. That's why editorial and commentary pages must be kept separate from news reporting. That separation has often been breached, but certain prominent news organizations have branded themselves clarions of truth. The New York Times long nurtured such a reputation. So it is profoundly disappointing to see the Times's news pages increasingly corrupted by the political views of its reporters and editorialists.
Candor requires that I note my own lack of objectivity. For complex reasons, I have been the object of unfounded and vicious attacks by the Times for more than three decades. An article in October falsely suggested that I had intervened to obtain opportunity-zone status for the 107,000-acre Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, or TRIC, to benefit what the Times said was my minority investment in a partnership holding 688 acres of raw land in TRIC. (It's my longstanding practice not to divulge what's in my portfolio.) The singular focus on this tiny sliver of the 107,000 acres makes no sense. TRIC's 99.4% owners include Tesla, Google, Panasonic, Walmart, Blockchains, Berkshire Hathaway, Switch and other giant companies that have spent billions of dollars at TRIC and have lobbied on its behalf.
I had no knowledge about the extensive activities of the major corporate owners, their lobbyists or advisers. I am not a manager, director or officer of the partnership that owns 688 acres. Yet the Times ignored the major corporate owners to focus on me, a clear indication of their intent to deceive their readers. I can take care of myself, but I'm concerned about all those other victims caught in the middle of partisan mudslinging by the institutions that claim dedication to the truth.
As Fred Smith, founder and CEO of FedEx, wrote in these pages in November, the Times attacked his company by "printing selected facts, connecting unrelated events, and implying nefarious activities when there were none whatever." That's exactly what the Times did to me last fall in a long article about Nevada real estate investments. Mr. Smith's complaint centered on provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its benefits to FedEx that the Times asserted were unfair.
A different provision of the act established opportunity zones, which provide incentives for private capital to create jobs and assist families in economically depressed areas. It appears the Times doesn't like the opportunity-zone concept. They and others might prefer direct government assistance rather than incentives to private capital. While reasonable people have taken principled positions on both sides of this debate, it's a problem when a newspaper violates its mission by carrying editorial views over to the news pages.
This is part of the Times's multiyear campaign opposing virtually every initiative of the Trump administration. The paper attacked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whose department oversees opportunity zones. Then it determined it could conjure a news story virtually out of thin air if it could link Mr. Mnuchin in some way to a private citizen who might benefit from provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Apparently I fit the bill, and the paper deployed six reporters and researchers for several months looking for dirt. They didn't find any -- I did none of the things they hinted at. But the editors weren't about to let an absence of facts kill a breathless front-page expose about how I and other investors stood to "Profit From Trump Tax Break for Poor Areas." The Times claimed, wrongly, that the Treasury secretary directed regulatory changes for my benefit. Not only did he not makes the changes for my benefit, the changes didn't benefit me. The article reached false conclusions by claiming that mere coincidences proved intent, or by conflating events that occurred months apart in a dizzying feat of obfuscation. This ignored the public record of what really happened.
This is irresponsible journalism. The Times, which sometimes seems to exist in an alternate universe, knew before publication that important conclusions and implications in the article about me were wrong because we and the U.S. Treasury gave them every relevant fact. I've never spoken to Mr. Mnuchin, any other government official or anyone else about putting TRIC in an opportunity zone; I have never authorized anyone to act for me on that matter and no one has ever asked me to take any action related to it; I had no knowledge of any lobbying to put TRIC in an opportunity zone.
We gave the Times these and many other facts. They, and anyone with an internet connection, could have easily found the truth. I asked my lawyers to do just that by retaining someone to go online and figure out the real story from the public record. In three days this person found a deep trove of facts that the Times's six reporters had apparently chosen to ignore. Anyone who wants to know the truth can find an article telling the real story plus a fact sheet and timeline at

The stealth Trump rally organized by Trump loyalist Pastor Darrell Scott, CEO of the Urban Revitalization Coalition, was not taking place in a strip club, where "rainmaking" by throwing cash in the air is a more common occurrence, but it might as well have been.
The gathering attracted hundreds of people and had the veneer of black respectability politics. The theme was "Celebrating and Honoring Urban Impact Leaders." Cleveland native Ja'Ron Smith, a deputy assistant to the president, and Fox News' Geraldo Rivera were on hand to impart a little celebrity to what would soon devolve into a debasing spectacle.
It took place in the ballroom of the Galleria Building, but there was nothing elegant about the social media campaign leading up to the event: "Limited seating available; Must be present to redeem giveaway," the Facebook ad said. This was followed by a hook at the center of the flyer: "$25,000 cash giveaway." That's how you get a full house in Cleveland during the hustle and bustle of the Christmas shopping season.
Instead of relying on black voter suppression techniques of previous election cycles, the Trump campaign has embarked on a new tactic - flooding targeted urban zones with just enough loose dollars to peel off some black votes that would've ordinarily gone to Democrats in crucial battleground states.
According to a story this week in Politico and a video posted by cleveland.com, after selecting ticket stubs at random from a container, event handlers called a stream of delighted people to the stage to receive envelopes containing anywhere from $300 to $500 tax free.
All they had to do to qualify for the Republican version of reparations was sit through a program highlighting all the great things Donald Trump was doing for the African American community.
Though it must've been as aggravating as sitting through a mandatory timeshare presentation, the pain was likely mitigated by the possibility of taking home an envelope full of cash.
"Was it condescending or insulting for us to give you this money?" the master of ceremony asked the woman who bounded on stage to become the first to claim her $300. The pastor made her count the money so that she could confirm that it was all there.
The pastor then asked a second woman dressed as a Christmas elf what she was going to do with the $300 he handed her. "I'm going to spend it," she said as the audience laughed. "Four more years of President Trump" she shouted with raised fist clutching her loot.
The video cleveland.com posted of the event was 35 minutes long and captured a steady stream of elated black folks running to the stage to get their money. The music the DJ played during the happy procession alternated between Atlanta-style Trap music and the theme song for "The Price is Right." There was no traditional holiday music despite the proximity to Christmas. It didn't take long to go through $25,000.
The preachers who operate as Mr. Trump's ward bosses and representatives in the black community worked hard to stay within the boundaries of their organization's tax-exempt status. Still, it's hard to explain to the IRS how giving envelopes full of money to people chosen at random without demonstrating a charitable or educational element fulfills the expectations of its 501(c)3 status.
In terms of pure optics, there's something manifestly offensive about making black people who are probably registered Democrats, if they're registered to vote at all, sit through an entire awards ceremony sprinkled with pro-Trump propaganda and speakers.
Those folks couldn't care less about Donald Trump. They were hoping against the odds that their raffle number got called before the evening was over. Chances are, they'll take the money given the opportunity and vote their conscience and their interests on Election Day, anyway.
When WAMs (walking around money/get out the vote money) were seen as an exclusively Democratic tactic employed in places like inner-city Philly, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J., conservatives would complain bitterly about the corrupting effect of paying ward leaders and community influencers to "get out the vote" by enticing poor and economically challenged people to the polls with the promise of "a couple of dollars" after casting their ballots.
Barack Obama made a point of ordering his 2008 presidential campaign to avoid handing out "street money" during the 2008 general election because he had seen its worst practices while running for office in Illinois. Maybe the fact that Mr. Obama rejected it made it an irresistible shiny object for Mr. Trump's urban minions.
For its part, the Trump campaign appreciates the work of the Urban Revitalization Coalition and the equally sketchy National Diversity Coalition for Trump, but the campaign denies any role in flooding the streets with WAM or condoning money giveaways of any kind in the 'hood. That's not exactly their brand or what they're known for.
A $30,000 cash giveaway was scheduled to be held at Virginia Union University, a historically black college on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but the school had second thoughts once it realized that having a stealth rally for Mr. Trump and "making it rain" for black people desperate for tax-free loot was not a good look for the institution.
Oddly enough, the Virginia Union University cash giveaway was also going to double as a salute to "civil rights stalwarts" Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, ostensibly for their work on criminal justice reform.
There is no doubt that the system that condoned WAMs when it was mostly a tool of the Democrats corrupted democracy by paying people to do what should've been a sacred, civic duty. Thousands of blacks lost their lives and freedom to secure the right to vote over generations.
Mr. Trump's allies have repackaged the old game by freely admitting that it is a "cash giveaway" without acknowledging its problematic roots. Regardless of what they call it, it has nothing to do with the growth and cultivation of civic responsibility and duty. It is bribery, cynicism and contempt, pure and simple.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For the past two weeks, senators have spent long hours listening to arguments and questioning both sides in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, which is heading methodically for an all-but-certain acquittal of the president by the Republican-controlled chamber.
Yet senators must face one last, politically perilous question Friday: whether to end the trial without calling any witnesses or obtaining any documents. Two Republican senators late Thursday announced their decisions on witnesses - one yes and one no.
The debate over witnesses boils down to what constitutes a fair trial in the grave court of impeachment.
And, for moderate senators, the disagreement over witnesses distills all the complications of an unprecedented impeachment case against a president, one that involves a tangled web of alleged motivations, fact disputes, accusations of corruption and election interference - all while debating the original intent of the 232-year-old U.S. Constitution.
Both the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the White House defense lawyers have warned senators their vote on witnesses will establish a dangerous new precedent for future impeachment trials.
Defense lawyers for Mr. Trump have argued repeatedly that the House Democrats have a weak case that was rushed through without the proper investigatory work required by a fair impeachment proceeding.
The Democrats' case significantly lowers the burden of proof and will further "our era of impeachment," in the words of Kenneth Starr, an attorney for Mr. Trump whose own investigation prompted the 1999 impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton.
By asking for witnesses, the House is telling the Senate: "Please do the work we didn't do," White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone said Thursday. "We want you to call witnesses we never called."
The House Democrats claim the evidence they collected over a 12-week impeachment inquiry last fall clearly proves Mr. Trump's wrongdoing.
The Democrats also compared the Senate impeachment trial to any other criminal courtroom in which witness testimony is the norm - especially if the judge or jury needs more information.
They pointed to past impeachment trials of both presidents and judges. The most recent Senate impeachment trial - which resulted in the conviction of Thomas Porteous, a Louisiana judge - heard from 26 witnesses, 17 of whom did not testify in the House.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has led Mr. Trump's prosecution and who was involved in Mr. Porteous' impeachment trial, called for the Senate to "give the country a trial they can be proud of."
"The case for witnesses in a presidential impeachment where, on the one side, you remove a president or, on the other side, you leave in place a president who may pose a continuing risk to the country," Mr. Schiff said, "is far more compelling to take the time to hear from witnesses than a corrupt Louisiana judge."
In Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial, the Senate voted to call three witnesses, taking private depositions over a period of six days. Those witnesses were called even after a yearslong investigation by Mr. Starr, which was handed to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives in 1998.
A key difference in Mr. Trump's trial: There was no yearslong investigation by an independent counsel. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, launched the inquiry in September and gathered evidence over constant objections from the Republican minority.
The White House stonewalled subpoenas for documents and blocked witnesses from testifying. The Democrats pushed forward on the case, believing the 2020 presidential election was under threat by Mr. Trump's actions.
Public support for witnesses has been high.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll published last week showed about 72% of Americans believe the Senate should vote to call witnesses. That survey, conducted Jan. 17-22, showed 84% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans supported witnesses.
This week, an appetite for witnesses grew among some Republican senators after leaked details of an upcoming book from John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Mr. Bolton's book, entitled "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," reportedly stated the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.
Pennsylvania's senators were split - as they have been throughout the impeachment process - on whether to call witnesses.
During a break in the questioning on Friday, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey told Fox News he was "absolutely certain" the impeachment trial does not require witnesses.
The House Democrats "have alleged actions that you cannot impeach a president for," Mr. Toomey said. "Even if someone believes that everything John Bolton says is going to confirm what's charged in these articles, it's still not impeachable."
Mr. Toomey was never likely to vote for witnesses. He set a high bar for himself, he told reporters earlier in the week. He would vote for a witness only if "there is a fact in dispute that a witness can shed enough light on that it could resolve the dispute - and do so in a way that could change my mind about how I'm going to vote on the final question" of acquittal or removal.
Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, has called for witnesses weeks before the trial began.
"I think the American people expect us to be rigorous and thorough," Mr. Casey told reporters Thursday. "I hope Republicans would make this determination about relevant witnesses and relevant documents based upon their oath, which is to do impartial justice."
Even a deal that would allow each party to call an equal number of witnesses, it could fall apart if Democrats resist calling Hunter Biden, who Republicans want to testify, in exchange for Mr. Bolton.
Hunter Biden is "not a relevant witness," Mr. Casey said. The White House's arguments that Hunter Biden's position on a Ukrainian energy firm could have been subject to a legitimate investigation have been "debunked," he said.
Friday's session could decide whether the trial lasts one more day or some more weeks.
On Thursday, questioning wrapped up with no sign that any of the key Republicans who could sway a vote on witnesses were persuaded by House Democrats' arguments.
In fact, four closely watched moderate Republicans - Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee - posed questions seemed to be aimed at gathering arguments against calling witnesses. Ms. Collins later tweeted a statement that she would vote to call witnesses. Mr. Alexander said he will vote no on calling witnesses.
In the final hour, Ms. Murkowski and Mr. Alexander joined a pointed question: Even if Mr. Bolton were to testify, "isn't it true that the allegations [against Mr. Trump] would not rise to an impeachable offense" and that Mr. Bolton's "testimony would add nothing?"
The question, also joined by Mr. Toomey, prompted the White House lawyers to reiterate their view that Mr. Bolton would not be a relevant witness. Mr Schiff responded: "the truth is staring us in the eyes," Mr. Schiff said. "We know why they don't want John Bolton to testify. They don't want the American people to hear it in all its ugly and graphic detail."
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Romney asked about "any evidence that anyone was directed by the president to tell the Ukrainians" the military aid was conditioned on an investigation into the Bidens.
Mr. Schiff responded that Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had both admitted to the president's motivations. White House lawyers argued there was no evidence.
The starkly different arguments will be on senators' mind when they convene Friday.

Texto completo: Rometty to step down as IBM chief executive
Ginni Rometty is stepping down as chief executive of IBM. Ms. Rometty, who became CEO in 2012, struggled to achieve growth at the technology giant as it made the transition to new fields like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. She will be replaced in April by Arvind Krishna, who now runs the company's cloud computing business.
Juul faces reckoning after marked down investment
For Juul Labs, the troubled king of vaping, the blows keep coming. Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group, which poured nearly $13 billion into the vaping startup in late 2018, valuing it at $38 billion, said it had marked down its investment for a second time by $4.1 billion. That leaves the value of its 35% stake at just $4.2 billion - or about a third of its initial worth.
Unilever reviews future of Lipton tea, ponders sale
Lipton owner Unilever is weighing a sale of one of its best-known brands. The Anglo-Dutch giant initiated a review of its global tea business, which includes the more than century-old label and generates sales of almost 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion). The move comes after the company's slowest quarterly growth in a decade. Unilever is following a consumer shift to coffee.
Nordstrom latest big retailer to sell second-hand items
Nordstrom will begin selling second-hand apparel online and in its New York flagship store this week, the latest attempt by the 119-year-old company to appeal to changing consumer tastes. It joins Macy's, J.C. Penney and Madewell, among others, in carving out a place for used clothing, shoes and handbags alongside new ones.

Bloomberg Super Bowl ad tackles guns

Texto completo: DES MOINES — After the dazzle and pop of Jennifer Lopez and Shakira's Super Bowl halftime show this Sunday, Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is hoping to “stop people in their tracks" with an emotional ad featuring a mother who lost her son to gun violence.
In the minute-long ad, released by the campaign Thursday, Calandrian Kemp tells the story of her son, George Kemp Jr., as the camera pans across childhood pictures of George in football gear. He was shot and killed in 2013 during an altercation while he was at mechanic school; he was 20.
“I just kept saying, you cannot tell me that the child I gave birth to is no longer here," Kemp says, her voice breaking. The screen then shows white text on a black background: “2,900 children die from gun violence every year."
That figure has been cited by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group primarily financed by Bloomberg.
Kemp then praises Bloomberg's record on gun control. “I know Mike is not afraid of the gun lobby — they're scared of him," she says. “And they should be."
The ad cost the campaign $11 million for 60 seconds in front of what is regularly the largest television audience of the year; predictions for this year's Super Bowl, which will be broadcast on Fox, hover around 100 million viewers. The ad is scheduled to air between the end of the halftime show and the beginning of the third quarter, the campaign said.
President Trump's reelection campaign has also purchased 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game, but it has not released a preview of its spot.

Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who is running for president in the Democratic primaries, is considering dozens of executive orders he could unilaterally enact on a wide range of domestic policy issues if elected, including immigration, the environment and prescription drugs, according to two people familiar with the campaign's planning.
Sanders has risen in national and early-state polling in the final days before Monday's Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the Democratic presidential primary, which has fueled concerns among some party insiders that he could win the nomination.
Aides have presented Sanders with a list of possible executive actions, including more than a dozen options for reversing President Trump's immigration policy, such as lifting the cap on the number of refugees accepted into the United States and immediately halting border wall construction. Another option is the reinstatement of an Obama-era program that granted legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to America as children.
The document reviewed by the Post shows how the Sanders campaign has already begun extensive planning for how the senator would lead the country in his first days as president if he won the Democratic nomination and defeated Trump in November. Many of the proposals Sanders has floated on the campaign trail do not have support from congressional Republicans and are opposed by some Democrats, so a willingness to move forward without congressional approval could determine whether many of his policies are enacted.
The list of potential executive orders includes unilaterally allowing the United States to import prescription drugs from Canada; directing the Justice Department to legalize marijuana; and declaring climate change a national emergency while banning the exportation of crude oil. Other options cited in the document include canceling federal contracts for firms paying less than $15 an hour and reversing federal rules blocking US funding to organizations that provide abortion counseling.

Biden campaign readies massive ad buy in Iowa
Joe Biden's campaign has quietly rolled back hundreds of thousands of dollars of television ad reservations in New Hampshire and South Carolina in recent weeks and redirected the funds to buy more ads in Iowa instead.
Biden's campaign and a super political action committee supporting him are on pace to churn through nearly $9 million on television ads in Iowa before the caucuses Monday, while spending virtually nothing so far in the other three states that vote in February. Biden has also planted himself in the state this week.
In Iowa, Biden is not just chasing votes and delegates. He's chasing cash. A disappointing finish in the state, where there are four candidates bunched in the top tier in polls, could dampen his online fundraising at a crucial juncture. Candidates need resources to build up their operations in delegate-rich Super Tuesday states like California, where campaigning and ad rates can be prohibitively expensive.
Allies said the chief danger is that a fourth-place finish — or even a third, depending on who is ahead of him and by how much — could jeopardize Biden's financial prospects, especially in a Democratic Party with a notoriously skittish political establishment.
Such a result could also deliver the money advantage to rivals with more reliable and passionate digital followings — none more so than Senator Bernie Sanders.
“We all know that momentum coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, it's not just political momentum, it's financial momentum," said Rufus Gifford, a former member of President Barack Obama's reelection campaign who recently signed on with Biden.

TSCHABALALA SELF: OUT OF BODY
Through July 5, Institute of Contemporary Art, 25 Harbor Shore Drive. 617-478-3100, www.icaboston.org
“Out of Body" would be a modest survey of the very young artist Tschabalala Self if it weren't for the work itself. But with its dozen-and-a-half pieces splayed across three rooms at the Institute of Contemporary Art, size is the only modest thing about the exhibition. “Out of Body" exults in sensuality of every kind, in the life-affirming pleasure of the tactile and of the flesh. It's a raucous, immoderate riot of image and material, of color and form. It's gleefully carnal, bodily bawdy. Its labor-by-hand is explicit in every stitch and snip. If this is Self's idea of being “Out of Body," I blush at the thought of her take on being within it.
Also immodest, though entirely out of her hands, is the reputation that unavoidably precedes her. Self, just 29, grew up in Harlem. Many of the figures and scenes here are her recollections and imaginings — incantations, even — of the people she saw on the streets of her childhood neighborhood. She graduated with her master's from Yale's School of Arts in 2015 (and still works in a New Haven studio). Yale's program is renowned for a couple of things: its intellectual and formal rigor, and its reliability in turning out bankable art stars.
Like it or not — and by every indication, she does not — Self graduated into both worlds. A recent story on the website Artsy charted Self's “meteoric rise" in the art-as-commodity pecking order (insightful, analytical, and sharp, Artsy itself is an unapologetic hybrid of art and commerce in the sales-obsessed contemporary art world). An example: “Out of Body," the ICA show's titular piece, which hangs in the exhibition's entryway. Notably soft and oblique — a pair of figures face each other, shadowed by wraithlike forms; one appears to be assembling the other, or taking her apart — “Out of Body" sold to a private collector for $473,000 at a London auction in June, more than six times the pre-sale estimate.
Self would see not a penny of it. She sold the piece years before for a fraction of that amount to a collector who held it like a speculative land buy, waiting for a market condition to maximize profit (there is no profit-sharing or royalty structure in the art world). In her interview with Artsy, Self gloomily described the auction circuit frenzy as “a tasteless spectacle." Seeing her work, most of it featuring Black bodies emanating liberation and self-possession, “sold and traded in a similar context" to the slave auctions her ancestors endured filled her with disgust. A few months after the “Out of Body" sale, another of her works, “Sapphire," sold for $487,000.
To be clear: I typically give wide berth to the manipulations of the market when looking at — and certainly when writing about — art. But the market is grimly reductive, burying the labor (and soul, and guts, and fire) artists pour into their work under gawkerish price tags. It's also grossly impersonal for the same reasons — unconscionable for an artist like Self, whose work is so diaristic she often incorporates her own clothing, literally putting parts of herself on display.
So why am I talking about the market now? Well, in our currently woke moment, its price-for-everything ethos has the power to cheapen what feels like real progress. Self is caught in the middle. In June, the headline for a New York Times story covering the auction in which “Out of Body" was sold read “Female Artists With African Backgrounds Are Winners at Phillips Auction in London." Reading it tightened my stomach. The only “winners" were a handful of moneyed collectors making high-priced bets. To me, the story vulgarized the insoluble dilemma around race and gender equity in the art world, suggesting that, in art, value and money are the same thing.
They are not. “Out of Body" might be Self's largest solo show to date, but amid the market frenzy, it feels like an intentional cooling of the engine. The show is deliberate and thoughtful, a showcase with clarity at heart. The ICA is creating space and time for Self's work, and other institutions are joining in. Later this year, the Baltimore Art Museum will host Self, solo.
The artist is also doing her part to throw water on the flame. Most of the works at the ICA are here courtesy of her studio, meaning she still owns them herself. She might have a state lottery's worth of works on the walls, but she's holding them from the market, steering as many as possible from the auction block. One piece here, the brooding, carnal “Pant," is roped off at knee height. Look closely at the label and you'll see why: It was acquired very recently by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, after the ICA show was planned.
As a teller of Black stories, Self belongs to a lineage of artists who spent decades on the sidelines of American art history. Jacob Lawrence was a towering presence among Black artists for decades. Only now is the case being made for his place in the broader canon (at the Peabody Essex Museum, by the way). Kerry James Marshall, a virtuosic painter of Black American life, labored through the '80s and '90s in near obscurity before being widely recognized as an American master less than a decade ago. Henry Taylor, whose bright, loose scenes of Black life are among Self's greatest influences, is now a budding art star in his mid 60s.
Self and painters like Amy Sherald and Titus Kaphar are their natural heirs. But this is a very different time. Markets and museums are hungry for their work to fill long-standing gaps; the narratives they embrace are no longer tucked in the margins of the American conversation, but at its heart. It means heightened attention, and all the good and bad that comes with it.
And the work itself? Ah. Right. Self's pieces are provocative. There are male members and vulvic anatomy, plainly rendered in fine and loving detail. Then again, all of her work is lovingly detailed — scraps of fabric sliced and contoured into body parts, eyes, lips, clothing, with delicate stitchwork carving expression into faces and hands.
Self's work is unabashed and unapologetic, but it's also empowering and tender. “Ol' Bay," from her 2019 “Bodega" series, embraces a strereotype of Black women with glee. A woman, back turned, puts her monumental round buttocks on view as she reaches for a can of peas. A breast peeks from behind her arm as she glances back to the viewer, euphoric. Somehow the image is far from lurid; instead, it's giddy with self-possessed freedom.
The show, broadly, has that feeling of unfettered elation. “Bellyphat," a 6-foot-high panel with loose threads dangling from its paint-and-fabric patchwork, bleeds pure joy: A female figure, hip thrust forward, tosses her head over her shoulder to nuzzle the shadowy figure embracing her from behind. Its material presence — snips and swatches of printed fabric, fragments of painted canvas collaged together, loose and tactile — creates a little distance, but only a little, from the sensual scene. It's both exuberant and frank, bursting with the pleasure of the moment, and the moments to come.
You can't look at Self's pieces and not be aware of them as composites — bits and pieces knitted together, the psychological labor of cobbling together memories and experiences from her own life, fussed and fretted over as she built them by hand. It makes her, above all, a storyteller, of her own life and of her generation more broadly.
Looking at her work, I can't help but think of Marshall, the great Chicago artist whose lifelong pursuit has been to paint Black life with all the care and passion the Old Masters lavished on their grand history paintings. Through his craft, Marshall committed himself to declaring the significance of lives ignored or maligned, pushed far from the center of American life.
Marshall labored in obscurity for years — a narrative painter in an era of conceptual work, a Black artist telling Black stories until the world — and the market — rediscovered him more a decade or so ago. Across eras and generations, I thought the comparison between Marshall and Self, in this moment, made some sense. Marshall had his own uncomfortable New York Times headline in 2018 when his work “Past Times" sold at Sotheby's for $21.1 million. “As a Black Artist Soars at Auction, Rethinking 'Blue Chip."' Go ahead, cringe. These are the times we're in. But Self, like Marshall, has the chance to transcend them — insisting, through dedication and mastery, that her stories endure.

Texto completo: Michael Taylor, the former Green Beret and suburban Massachusetts football coach who became a global sensation after reportedly orchestrating the brazen escape of former Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn from Japan last month, is now facing criminal charges.
On Thursday, Japanese officials issued an arrest warrant for Taylor, 59; his son, Peter Taylor, 26; and a longtime acquaintance, George Antoine Zayek, 60. The three are accused of helping Ghosn bypass immigration checkpoints during the escape.
In court documents, Japanese prosecutors allege Michael Taylor and Zayek were with Ghosn when he traveled nearly 300 miles from Tokyo — where he was under house arrest while facing charges of financial crimes — to Osaka. After hiding Ghosn in a large luggage container, the three allegedly boarded a private plane to Istanbul.
From there, media reports indicate, Ghosn was whisked overnight onto another plane, which took him to Lebanon, a country where the former businessman maintains citizenship and which does not extradite its citizens to ­Japan.
Taylor did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Thursday.
Reached by phone Thursday, Steven J. Brooks, a Boston-area attorney who has represented Taylor in the past, said he was unaware of Taylor's whereabouts and, at this point, is not involved in the current case. “I can offer nothing to the process at this point in time," he said. “I haven't spoken to Michael in quite a while."
The elder Taylor's connection to the Hollywood-esque plot was first reported earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal, which described in detail the efforts of Taylor and Zayek.
Among the new details laid out by Japanese officials, however, is the alleged involvement of Taylor's son, Peter, a former football player at Lawrence Academy who helped his father start a low-calorie sports drink company.
The Journal and The New York Times reported that prosecutors allege Peter Taylor had a significant role in the plot, having met with Ghosn on at least seven occasions in the preceding months, including on the day of the Dec. 29 escape.
Prosecutors believe the younger Taylor met Ghosn on the day before the escape and handed him a key to a hotel room.
On Thursday, the whereabouts of both Taylors remained unknown.
But with a now-real chance that Japan will seek extradition of the two, a return to the United States carries some risks for both Taylors. If Japan does seek extradition, the request could become an interesting test of the relationship between the two countries, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has more than most other world leaders cultivated ties with President Trump.
“Japan is a close ally, and this is a huge national embarrassment for them," said Joshua Levy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at the Boston law firm Ropes & Gray. “So my guess is this is going to get more attention at the [Department of Justice] if there's an extradition request than an average case."
According to Boston-area defense attorney Martin Weinberg, who has handled a dozen or so extradition cases, Taylor's fate could hinge on the particulars of the US-Japan extradition treaty.
To warrant extradition, Weinberg said, the alleged crimes in Japan must be the same as, or very similar to, crimes in the United States. Additionally, they must meet the requirements of the extradition treaty, as well as probable cause standards.
“I do think Taylor's got a position, if Japan seeks his extradition and if the US arrests him on a warrant, to defend himself," Weinberg said.
The Department of Justice, which handles international law enforcement matters for the federal government, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The Ghosn case is but the latest addition to Taylor's incredible resume and string of adventures.
In the early 1980s, Taylor, an Ayer native, spent time in Lebanon as a member of the US Special Forces, before leaving the Army with an honorable discharge in 1983 and going to work as a private securities contractor, the Globe recently reported, citing sources including court papers in an unrelated case. On various occasions, he was hired to help extract individuals from high-risk situations, including a young girl whose father had abducted her to Lebanon.
His undercover work with federal authorities was credited with once aiding in the seizure of $100 million worth of hashish from an international drug ring based in Lebanon.
But trouble also seemed to follow him.
During his work as an undercover informant in the hashish case, Taylor caught the attention of a Massachusetts state trooper who believed Taylor was engaged in illegal activity outside the realm of the undercover case.
Taylor, who also worked as a private investigator, was eventually charged with several felony wiretapping and related charges stemming from the trooper's investigation. He pleaded guilty in 1999 to planting marijuana in the car of a client's estranged wife and persuading an officer to arrest her, according to a 2001 Boston Herald story.
In 2011, Taylor was investigated for allegedly paying kickbacks to obtain Department of Defense contracts in Afghanistan worth roughly $54 million, according to court documents. After spending 14 months in a Utah jail, Taylor pleaded guilty to one count of violating the federal Procurement Integrity Act and one count of wire fraud.
Outside the shadowy world of his professional work, Taylor appeared to live a typical suburban existence. He played in a softball league and helped clear neighbors' driveways. For three years, he was head football coach at the posh Lawrence Academy in Groton — though that, too, would eventually result in controversy.
Shortly after his resignation in 2011, the Independent School League handed down various sanctions against the school, stripping it of two league titles won under Taylor. The academy's then-headmaster later acknowledged that several of its student athletes had been funded “beyond their demonstrated need."
In e-mails to the Globe earlier this month, Taylor declined to discuss any ongoing legal matters. At the time, Taylor said that he was traveling abroad but declined to say where. He did suggest, however, that his return to New England could be imminent.
In an e-mail to the Globe Jan. 9, he wrote: “I'll be glad to sit with you over a coffee and chat in the very near future."

Texto completo: Reagan Arthur just landed what might be the most coveted job in book publishing.
As the newly announced publisher and executive vice president of Alfred A. Knopf, Arthur will become only the fourth head of an imprint that has introduced the world to writers such as John Cheever, Toni Morrison and Kazuo Ishiguro.
She succeeds three great men: Knopf himself, Robert Gottlieb and, most recently, Sonny Mehta, who died in December at age 77. For more than a century, Knopf has been both a literary starmaker -- a frequent winner of Nobels and Pulitzers -- and a commercial powerhouse publishing Stieg Larsson, E.L. James, Carl Hiaasen, a president (Bill Clinton) and a pope (John Paul II). Under Mehta, Knopf maintained its own identity and only increased its power within what became Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publishing conglomerate.

Arthur has worked for nearly 20 years at Little, Brown, a division of Hachette, where she became publisher in 2013. Her list of authors ran the gamut from literary to commercial -- Kate Atkinson, Donna Tartt, James Patterson.
We talked to Arthur about the new line of women taking over publishing, the reckoning over "American Dirt" and her vision for the future of Knopf.
--
You're going to report to a woman, incoming Knopf Doubleday group publisher Maya Mavjee, who will also report to a woman, Penguin Random House chief executive Madeline McIntosh. How does this feel?
I'm excited about many things, and you've just put your finger on one of the most exciting aspects for me. I've respected Maya and Madeleine from afar for a long time -- I think they're so smart and creative and inspiring -- so that plus the whole Knopf team that's already in place is really a dream date.
--
Would you say that the old boys' club is breaking up?
I'd say there have already been a lot of strong women in place over there, and I wouldn't want to discount the impressive and important work of a lot of the men there too. I don't want to play too hard into that angle. It's an incredible history and exciting future.
--
What will be some of your biggest challenges?
Some of these are the same challenges of any new job: getting to know the people, figuring out where the coffee maker is. But on a larger scale I think they're the challenges that every publisher is facing, which is the conflicting demands on readers' attention. In my early days on the subway, I first learned as a Californian what a subway fold was for the New York Times, which felt very exotic to me. When I first had an e-reader to read manuscripts, people would ask me what that was. So now, people are watching movies on their phones, they're playing games, they're perhaps listening to books. There are just a lot of claims on their attention. Finding new ways to navigate that -- that's the biggest overall challenge but also opportunity. There's never going to be a lack of interest in stories or storytelling, fiction or nonfiction. The growth of things like streaming services and all of these great shows -- that's another way of storytelling. There's always that hunger, and we have to find new ways to tap into it and direct it.
--
Many of the books you've worked on have morphed into different forms. I'm thinking of the podcast based on Ronan Farrow's "Catch and Kill." Should we consider books IP that then leads to other forms of art? Is this a trend?
Yeah, I do think that will increase. "Catch and Kill" lends itself to that in a very particular way, but it's not the only book that will. Another success was Malcolm Gladwell's [audiobook version of] "Talking to Strangers," because he really produced it like a podcast. It has pleasures on its own merit as a book, but it's also an audio experience. So that was an interesting merge of those two worlds. I haven't listened to it yet, but I'm excited for Marlon James and Jake Morrissey's new podcast -- it sounds so fun. Again, that's another opportunity to find readers.
--
Is Knopf's outsize reputation and legacy a weight on your shoulders?
I think everything that's given Knopf its identity comes down to people: the authors, first of all, and then the teams behind the scenes, from production to publicity and everyone in between. Even as we all adjust to different ways of doing business, that experience and shared dedication to quality will always be at the heart of Knopf's identity and purpose.
--
I promise I wasn't going to ask you about this, but then I saw the opinion piece in the New York Times, in which David Bowles cites the controversy over "American Dirt" to argue that "the publishing industry is broken."
I don't know what you're talking about! [Laughs.]
--
Do you agree?
No. I think that he raised a lot of interesting points. I have a lot of different feelings about the situation. I think taking this particular book and publication out of the equation for a minute, it highlights a situation we're all aware of. This isn't news to anyone in publishing, that we're very white and very privileged in some aspects -- not all of us. It's a myth that everyone came here with a trust fund -- I didn't! But there is a cultural dissonance between the way a publishing company looks and the American readership we're trying to serve. It's a necessary conversation and one that's been ongoing, but this is amplifying it in ways that I think are important.
--
Do you plan to bring any of your authors over from Little, Brown to Knopf?
They're all really well tended to here and happily under contract and well loved.
--
Any authors that you're excited to inherit at Knopf?
[Deputy Publisher] Paul Bogaards sent me this big box of galleys and books, and it was like Christmas. I've been looking into the books that are just about to publish, like Emily St. John Mandel, J. Courtney Sullivan, Stephanie Danler's followup to "Sweetbitter." Jim Carrey has an autobiographical novel. There are all kinds of delights. Lawrence Wright has a novel coming out, and Nicholas Kristof's book just came out so I've been reading that. It's been hard to stick with just one thing. I keep jumping around.
--
What's the last book you've read for pleasure?
Most recently I read and thoroughly enjoyed "Girl, Woman, Other" by Bernardine Evaristo. I read Lily King's upcoming novel, "Writers and Lovers." And over the break I reread "Mrs. Bridge," which is such a joy. And [essayist] Jo Ann Beard -- "The Boys of My Youth," that's such a great book.

You're from California. What do you think of the literary scene there?
My dad was an English professor at Cal State Northridge, so I grew up in a very reading-centric house and I used to read the New Yorker cover-to-cover, starting with all of the tiny event listings in the front. I could imagine myself attending them, like the little nerd that I was. I went to UCLA and I'm so impressed when I go back, which I do a couple of times a year, by the really vibrant bookselling community there. There are so many great independent bookstores. When I've been at author events at those stores, the attendance is so strong. The L.A. Times Festival of Books is truly my favorite book event of the year. The first time I went it was so heartening to see how many people come out for an event about books.
I always bristle at the knee-jerk assumption about L.A. that nobody reads. I've seen the statistics at some point that per capita it's the biggest book-buying city in the country. I don't know if that's true, but I like to trot it out all the same. It's a very culturally engaged community with a lot of different voices. There's a local identity that makes L.A. stand out.

Where do you see Knopf in 10 years?
I see it continuing a tradition that's -- I can't say "really unique," my writing teacher and [Random House copy chief] Ben Dreyer would kill me -- but the same unique position as the publisher of voices that are important, exciting, accessible, fun. From mystery to nonfiction to poetry, they've done it all, so I see that still being their primary identity -- brilliant and exciting publishing -- and continuing to find new ways to do it.

CONGRATULATIONS TO THOSE MEN at Nitehawk Cinema Williamsburg (Feb. 1-9). When Issa Rae and John Cho announced the Oscar nominees on Jan. 13, Rae seemed to take a sly dig at the omission of women in the directing category, congratulating "those men" who were nominated. The Nitehawk offers a corrective with this showcase of acclaimed movies from 2019 that were directed by women and maybe even Oscar-worthy. The screening of Céline Sciamma's exquisitely composed "Portrait of a Lady on Fire" (on Tuesday) is already sold out (the film will go into wide release on Feb. 14). Lulu Wang's unsentimental, autobiographically inspired "The Farewell" (on Wednesday) has been showing in theaters since the summer.

THE DEVIL PROBABLY: A CENTURY OF SATANIC PANIC at Anthology Film Archives (Jan. 31-Feb. 20). The year is still new, but it seems safe to say that this will be the only film retrospective in 2020 to open with a black mass ceremony led by Lucien Greaves, a founder of the Satanic Temple, at a screening of a 1968 revamp of "Haxan," a Scandinavian silent about witchcraft with added narration from William S. Burroughs. Greaves also appears in the documentary "Hail Satan?" (showing on Saturday and Feb. 17). However, this series -- previewed in October -- goes beyond Greaves and his merry satanic pranksters to show that onscreen depictions of the devil have been around since nearly the inception of the medium with films such as "L'Inferno" (on Sunday and Feb. 6), which was adapted from Dante and dates to 1911.

'NEW YORK, NEW YORK' at the Metrograph (Jan. 31-Feb. 6). Martin Scorsese's 1977 musical rarely turns up in rankings of his greatest films, but watching this stunning new 35-millimeter print, it is impossible to wonder why not. The film, which begins on V-J Day, charts the years-spanning relationship between a pushy saxophonist (Robert De Niro) and a singer (Liza Minnelli) whose love lives and careers never quite seem to connect. The title can be taken literally: Stylistically, the film marries the hard-edged New York of Scorsese's early pictures to the idealized New York of Hollywood backlots. And the big screen is the ideal place to appreciate the scale and imagination Scorsese brings to bear on the Kander and Ebb numbers, which include "But the World Goes 'Round" and "Happy Endings."

QUEER LIBERATION TO ACTIVISM at the Museum of Modern Art (through Feb. 5). The full title of this retrospective runs afoul of The New York Times's guidelines on profanity; suffice it to say that it's taken from a quotation in the filmmaker Marlon Riggs's "Tongues Untied" (showing on Saturday and Tuesday), a movie that Wesley Morris described last year as an "unclassifiable scrapbook of black gay male sensibility." The series, which emphasizes experimental and landmark works, is drawn from gay- and lesbian-themed films in MoMA's collection. The titles showing include "Portrait of Jason" (on Sunday), Shirley Clarke's feature-length interview with an African-American hustler who may or may not be performing for the camera, and Fred Halsted's "L.A. Plays Itself" (on Thursday and Saturday), a rare outright pornographic film that has won admiration from theorists and academics.

Texto completo: The internet giant posted increases in revenue and profit after shoppers flocked to it during the holiday season.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Amazon sold a lot of things to a lot of people in the last three months of 2019, as speedy shipping shortened the time between "I want it" and "It's here."
That was expected. What no one anticipated was that profits would also shoot up.
On Thursday, Amazon said it had earned $ 6.47 a share in the quarter, up from $ 6.04 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $ 4.04 a share, and some would not have been surprised if it had been less. Amazon went wide last year with one-day shipping for members of its Prime service, and "fast" is usually synonymous with "expensive."
Not this time. Amazon said more customers joined Prime in the fourth quarter than ever before, pushing worldwide membership to 150 million households. That total was also more than analysts expected. It was 100 million less than two years ago.
Sales came in at $ 87.4 billion, up 21 percent from a year earlier and above what Wall Street predicted.
The possibility that "fast" is so valued by convenience-loving shoppers that they will bind themselves even more tightly to Amazon made investors giddy.
Amazon shares soared more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. That added $ 100 billion to the company's valuation, at least for the night, pushing it above $ 1 trillion again.
"The surprise on the bottom line comes down to two things," said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst with eMarketer. "First, it looks like the fixed costs in building out their last-mile infrastructure are beginning to normalize earlier than expected."
Second, "with Amazon broadening their offerings, there is more pressure on sellers to buy ads in order to gain exposure," Mr. Lipsman said. "That is driving ad business momentum, which is increasingly dropping to the bottom line."
Amazon ads for Amazon products delivered in Amazon trucks to Amazon households, where Amazon cameras alert residents that their new toys have already arrived. This is the Amazon flywheel, and the earnings report said it was working well.
"What we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance, from the middle of November on," Brian Olsavsky, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call on Thursday. The more Amazon sells, the more efficiencies of scale it can find.
So, he promised, Amazon will get bigger. "We will have to scale our fulfillment center network further," Mr. Olsavsky said. Amazon has about 500 shipping facilities in the United States and 600 elsewhere in the world, according to MWPVL International.
If the last decade was all about Amazon's ascendancy in retail, the next several years will bring more of a pitched battle.
"This will be the decade of the algorithmic retailer," said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at the consulting firm Publicis Sapient. "Companies like Walmart and Target will use all the data they have acquired to compete more effectively with Amazon."
AWS, the high-margin cloud computing division that has been a big source of Amazon's profits in recent years, also increased its revenue in the quarter, by 34 percent to $ 9.95 billion.
Amazon has a wide lead in renting computer space to other companies, although Microsoft, which reported this week that its cloud revenues had risen 62 percent in the quarter, is striving to catch up.
The fourth quarter of 2019 was the first big test of Amazon's one-day shipping, which began last spring.
In early 2019, sales at the Amazon store were drifting down, growing at a modest rate (for Amazon) of about 12 percent annually. Always fearful of settling into complacency, the company announced that it was making one-day shipping standard for Prime households. Two-day shipping had been the rule since Prime's introduction in 2005.
The Seattle company said it would spend an initial $ 800 million to carry out the program. It was classic Amazon: trading profit for revenue. As usual, the revenue flowed in. But the expenses continued. Additional costs related to one-day shipping were initially expected to be about $ 1.5 billion in the fourth quarter but came in a little less, Mr. Olsavsky said.
Amazon also continued its hiring spree during the quarter, signing up 48,000 new employees for a total of 798,000.
One of the factors that inspired people to join the company during the last decade was the soaring value of the stock, which is an important part of compensation for managers and engineers. With investors uncertain about profits, shares in regular trading Thursday were about 8 percent lower than the all-time high reached in September 2018. If that stall continued, Amazon would have had to increase compensation or suffer a brain drain.
For the moment, at least, that worry has abated.

Fred Silverman, a Force On TV When 3 Networks Reigned, Is Dead at 82

Texto completo: A top executive at CBS, ABC and then NBC, he shepherded series like "All in the Family," "Laverne & Shirley" and "Hill Street Blues."
Fred Silverman, who as a top executive at CBS, ABC and finally NBC was one of the most powerful people in the three-network era -- a force behind the success of beloved series like "All in the Family," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "M*A*S*H," "Laverne & Shirley" and "Hill Street Blues" -- died on Thursday at his home in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles. He was 82.
Julia Rossen, of the public relations concern 42West, announced his death in a news release. She said the cause was cancer.
At 25, Mr. Silverman was made head of daytime programming for CBS, and in 1970, in his early 30s, he landed the network's top programming job, putting him in charge of the prime-time schedule.
CBS, known in the 1960s for relatively conventional comedies like "The Andy Griffith Show" and "The Beverly Hillbillies," was looking to freshen its image, and Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin's groundbreaking "All in the Family," which tackled contemporary issues like bigotry with scalding humor, became a key component of that strategy.
The show was originally made for ABC, but when that network rejected it, Mr. Lear took it to CBS, where Mr. Silverman and other executives watched a pilot.
"I couldn't believe I was seeing what I was seeing," Mr. Silverman recalled in an oral history recorded in 2001 for the Television Academy Foundation. "Compared to the crap that we were canceling, this was really setting new boundaries."
He credited Robert Wood, president of CBS at the time, with putting the show on the air in January 1971. But it was Mr. Silverman who rescued it from its original, deadly Tuesday night time slot, stacking it on Saturday nights with another savvy series, "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."
"These were the first building blocks," Mr. Silverman said, leading to other successes like the spinoffs "Maude," from "All in the Family," and "Rhoda," from "Mary Tyler Moore."
In a message on Twitter on Thursday, Norman Lear wrote, "There would be no ALL IN THE FAMILY or MAUDE without Fred Silverman."
Mr. Silverman was lured to ABC, which had long trailed the other two networks in the ratings race, in mid-1975. He was named president of ABC Entertainment, the division that developed programming and talent. By the time he left in 1978 to become NBC's president and chief executive, ABC was No. 1 in the Nielsen rankings, on the strength of shows like "Laverne & Shirley" (a spinoff of "Happy Days"), not to mention the landmark mini-series "Roots" (1977).
Mr. Silverman failed to work his magic at NBC, which had fallen to third place in the ratings, despite some successes, like the police drama "Hill Street Blues," which premiered in January 1981. He resigned in mid-1981 and turned to producing his own shows.
His hits as a producer included "Matlock," which made its debut in 1986 and ran for 181 episodes; "Jake and the Fatman," which ran from 1987 to 1992; "In the Heat of the Night" (1988-95); "Diagnosis Murder" (1993-2001); and a series of made-for-TV Perry Mason movies.
Mr. Silverman was famed for his programming instincts, but he admitted that he had backed some clunkers. There was, for instance, a short-lived 1972 comedy called "Me and the Chimp," about a family that has a chimpanzee. The show, he acknowledged in a 1976 interview with The New York Times, "represented a new depth in television programming."
Fred Silverman was born on Sept. 13, 1937, in New York City to William and Mildred Silverman and grew up in Rego Park, Queens. His father was a television and radio service man, his mother a homemaker. Fred graduated from Forest Hills High School in Queens.
As a child he was drawn to the radio, especially dramas, and he collected radio scripts.
"When I was 10, 11, 12 years old, I used to go down to the studios and made friends with all the porters," he said in the oral history. "They would collect scripts for me. I think at one point I had about four or five thousand scripts."
Mr. Silverman earned a bachelor's degree at Syracuse University and a master's in television and theater arts in 1959 from Ohio State University. (He later donated his boyhood collection of scripts to Ohio State.)
His master's thesis was a 406-page analysis of ABC's programming from 1953 to 1959, and it helped get him a job at WGN-TV in Chicago in what was called the continuity department, "basically screening commercials and approving copy for live TV," as he related in the oral history.
"So I was a censor, basically," he said.
From there he went to WPIX in New York before landing at CBS.
Mr. Silverman was pivotal not only to important shows, but also to careers. He told of once being impressed by a comedian who was performing at a dinner at which Mr. Silverman was receiving an award. It was David Letterman, and in 1980, while at NBC, Mr. Silverman gave him his first talk show. It was a morning show, and it didn't last long, but it helped elevate Mr. Letterman's profile.
Mr. Silverman is survived by his wife, Cathy, and two children, Melissa and Billy.
Though Mr. Silverman was associated with countless prime-time shows, he also had a hand in a number of daytime series in his initial job as head of daytime programming for CBS.
In the oral history, he told of once wanting to make a scary animated show about kids in a haunted house, with a dog as a background character. His superiors resisted, thinking the idea was too frightening. After the rejection, he recalled, he was on a plane listening to music when Frank Sinatra's "Strangers in the Night" came on.
"I hear him say, 'Scooby-dooby-doo,"' Mr. Silverman said, slightly misrendering Sinatra's "doo-bee-doo-bee-doo," "and it's at that point I said: 'That's it. We'll take the dog, we'll call it 'Scooby-Doo' and move him up front, and it'll be the dog's show."'
"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!" premiered in September 1969 and became an enduring franchise.

Amnesty, by Aravind Adiga (Scribner, Feb. 18)
Ever since his refugee application was denied, Danny, who came to Australia from Sri Lanka, has tried to stay under the radar. But when he hears about a murder -- and realizes he may hold a key to the case -- he must weigh the risks of exposing his undocumented status to the authorities. Adiga, the author of the Booker Prize-winning novel "The White Tiger," brings to life the precarious circumstances and impossible choices that immigrants face in his new book.
Apartment, by Teddy Wayne (Bloomsbury, Feb. 25)
It's 1996, and Wayne's achingly lonely narrator is enrolled in Columbia's M.F.A. program, where he finds solace in an unexpectedly intense friendship with a fellow student, Billy. When he offers Billy the chance to live rent-free in his apartment, the relationship becomes a crucible, driven by questions about power, class and masculinity.
Apeirogon, by Colum McCann (Random House, Feb. 25)
Two fathers, one from Israel and one from Palestine, are linked by their shared grief: Rami's teenage daughter was killed by a suicide bomber, and Bassam's 10-year-old daughter was fatally shot by the police after leaving a candy store. McCann, who won the National Book Award for his 2009 novel, "Let the Great World Spin," draws on the men's real-life stories for this novel, which follows their friendship and shared efforts to bring about peace.
The Cactus League, by Emily Nemens (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Feb. 4)
This debut novel by the editor of The Paris Review follows a baseball team, the Los Angeles Lions, and the grand unraveling of its star outfielder, Jason Goodyear. Set during spring training in the Arizona desert, it features a quirky cast -- Goodyear's ex-wife, a sportswriter hoping for a juicy story, the team's groupies and even the stadium's organist.
Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction, by David Enrich (Custom House, Feb. 18)
Enrich, the finance editor for The New York Times, traces Deutsche Bank's 150-year history, from its origins as an advocate for German commerce to its less savory headlines: deals with rogue states, money-laundering scandals and its relationships with the Kushner family and President Trump, among other developments.
The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success, by Ross Douthat (Avid Reader, Feb. 25)
The Times's Op-Ed columnist explores what he sees as a stagnating culture in the United States, and examines the technological, economic and even biological forces that he believes are to blame.
Everywhere You Don't Belong, by Gabriel Bump (Algonquin, Feb. 4)
This debut novel tells the story of Claude, a young black man born on the South Side of Chicago and raised by his grandmother. As tensions between the police and his neighborhood intensify, he avoids getting involved, hoping that once he leaves the city for college he can carve out a new identity.
The Girl With the Louding Voice, by Abi Daré (Dutton, Feb. 4)
Growing up in Nigeria, Adunni -- the teenage heroine of Daré's debut novel -- strives for an education, but her plans are overturned after her father sells her to an older man. She eventually escapes the marriage and heads to Lagos, where she works for a wealthy family and encounters yet more punishing setbacks. Despite what she endures, this is a courageous story of a woman asserting her own voice.
In the Land of Men: A Memoir, by Adrienne Miller (Ecco, Feb. 11)
Miller sets out to detail the misogynistic, old-boy culture of print magazines in the 1990s as she charts her path from a young editorial assistant at GQ to the first female literary editor at Esquire. Her dealings with the writer David Foster Wallace -- both professional and personal -- occupy a large part of the book.
The Man in the Red Coat, by Julian Barnes (Knopf, Feb. 18)
Belle epoque Paris comes alive in this biography of a pioneering French doctor, Samuel Jean Pozzi, who was the subject of one of John Singer Sargent's most famous paintings. Barnes, the author of "The Sense of an Ending" and other beloved books, sketches his subject's life in fascinating detail, including entanglements with Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Sarah Bernhardt.
Real Life, by Brandon Taylor (Riverhead, Feb. 18)
In Taylor's debut novel, Wallace -- a shy African-American student at a Midwestern college -- feels out of place and keeps to himself. But several confrontations dismantle his defenses and unnerve him, forcing him to reckon with his desires.
The Resisters, by Gish Jen (Knopf, Feb. 4)
In her latest novel, Jen imagines a future surveillance state called AutoAmerica, where you're either a Netter, with a nice home, an income and other luxuries, or a Surplus. Gwen, who comes from a Surplus family, is an incredible baseball talent. When word of her skill gets out, she must decide whether to leave her caste and way of life behind.

Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's 50-Year Battle for a More Unjust America, by Adam Cohen (Penguin Press, Feb. 25)
After the election of President Richard Nixon and the retirement of Chief Justice Earl Warren, who oversaw a number of significant civil rights cases, the Supreme Court was destined for radical change, the ramifications of which would be felt for decades. Cohen, a former member of The Times's editorial board, argues that, starting under Nixon's tenure, the court has consistently arrived at decisions that have made the country less fair.
Weather, by Jenny Offill (Knopf, Feb. 11)
It's been six years since Offill's award-winning novel, "Dept. of Speculation," and she returns with a story written in a similarly fragmented style. Lizzie is trying to balance her own dread about impending disaster -- environmental, political, cultural -- while answering mail for the host of a hot-button podcast.

Texto completo: The final episodes of "Bojack Horseman" hit Netflix. And the most recent "Spider-Man" movie airs on Starz.
What's Streaming
BOJACK HORSEMAN Stream on Netflix. After six seasons swilling whiskey and deadpanning, the sweater-wearing title character of this animated Hollywood satire is putting down the reins. The series has followed Bojack, an anthropomorphic horse voiced by Will Arnett, as he navigates a fictional version of Hollywood, where he lives as a has-been 1990s sitcom star. Toward the end of the most recent batch of episodes, he accepted a job at Wesleyan University. How he adjusts to collegiate life will be one of the questions that the final installments -- which hit Netflix on Friday -- will answer.
TED BUNDY: FALLING FOR A KILLER Stream on Amazon. Those interested in learning just how wicked the serial killer Ted Bundy was have no shortage of Bundy-related programming to choose from -- Netflix released both a feature film and a documentary series about him last year -- but this Amazon documentary series promises a fresh perspective, looking at his behavior against the backdrop of 1970s feminism. It focuses on the misogyny of Bundy's crimes, and includes the voices of some of the women affected by them. Those women include Elizabeth Kendall, who in the early 1980s published a book about her relationship with Bundy.
THE PRODIGY (2019) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Early intelligence comes with a heavy helping of crazy in "The Prodigy," a horror movie about a gifted youngster who is possessed by the spirit of a serial killer. As he grows up, Miles (Jackson Robert Scott) exhibits increasingly disturbed behavior (one example involves a classmate and a wrench). The plot involves his parents (Taylor Schilling and Peter Mooney) racing to determine what's wrong with him before things become too dire. It all adds up to "a ho-hum horror movie given a mild boost by its credible performances," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times.
What's on TV
SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME (2019) 8 p.m. on Starz. Peter Parker takes a break from New York to web-sling around Venice and London in this most recent "Spider-Man" movie. Parker is, of course, the alter-ego of the nimble Spider-Man, who for the past several years has been played by the British actor Tom Holland. Holland's version of the hero is a high schooler, and in this movie, he goes on a school vacation to Europe, where his pursuit of love with MJ (Zendaya) is rudely interrupted by a bearded villain played by Jake Gyllenhaal, among other loud things. "As is often the case with these movies, a smaller, livelier entertainment is nested inside the roaring, clanking digital machinery," A.O Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "The filmmakers try to enliven the big fights and action sequences by injecting a bit of self-consciousness about the illusion-driven craft they pursue, and a few sequences take place in an austere, dreamlike virtual realm where visually interesting things are allowed to happen. For a little while, anyway."

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
KAREN BERNARD at Douglas Dunn Studio (Feb. 6-8, 8 p.m.). A longtime creator of interdisciplinary dance, Bernard follows up last year's "Poolside" with a new work called "Lakeside," a continuation on the theme of memory within the darker context of trauma. "Lakeside" is ostensibly a duet between Bernard and the dancer Lisa Parra, but there's another presence that feels like a third character: a yellow and black costume from Bernard's past. The two continually exchange the garment as they navigate a haunting scenario that casts them each as witness, victim and perpetrator of a murder. The minimalist movement, paired with video by Bernard, coalesces to comment on violence against women.

COMPANHIA DE DANÇA DEBORAH COLKER at the Joyce Theater (Feb. 4-5, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 6-8, 8 p.m.; through Feb. 9). This Brazilian troupe returns to the Joyce after a long hiatus with a work that takes its name and themes from João Cabral de Melo Neto's poem "Cão Sem Plumas" ("Dog Without Feathers"). It examines life along the Capibaribe River and the nearby drylands of northeast Brazil. In Colker's interpretation, vigorous dancers covered in dust are meant to embody the region's impoverished residents. Extraordinary film of the landscape serves as a backdrop to the choreography, which combines contemporary dance with ritualistic gestures, acrobatic partnering and striking ensemble tableaus.

FLY-BY-NIGHT DANCE THEATER at Five Angels Theater (Feb. 1, 8 p.m.; Feb. 2, 7 p.m.). Twenty years ago, Julie Ludwick and Janet Aisawa founded this company upon the principles pioneered by Robert Davidson, a champion of aerial expressive dance, which fuses elements of contemporary dance with equipment like low-flying trapezes. To celebrate the troupe's anniversary, Ludwick has choreographed a number of works to be performed by a handful of aerial artists, including Aisawa, with live music by Paul Uhry Newman.
212-627-4409, flybynightdance.org
ADAM LINDER at the Museum of Modern Art (Feb. 1-March 8). In its recent redesign, MoMA included a studio space to demonstrate its commitment to incorporating performance into its collection. Linder's "Shelf Life" is one of its first commissions, and an apt one since his interest lies in thinking about choreography within the parameters of an exhibition. The work, for six performers, breaks down dance into three components, which Linder refers to as its "nervous system": the barre (training), the body (physical abandon) and the brain (control). Dancers cycle through these three phases in various configurations. The results will be on view daily at 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 and 3:30 p.m., and Fridays and the first Thursday of each month at 1, 3, 5 and 7 p.m.
212-708-9400, moma.org
NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (Jan. 31, 8 p.m.; Feb. 1, 2 and 8 p.m.; Feb. 2, 3 p.m.; Feb. 4-6, 7:30 p.m.; through March 1). The coming week brings a potpourri of programs: The "New Combinations" bill on Friday and Tuesday pairs Jerome Robbins's "Opus 19/The Dreamer" (1979) with Christopher Wheeldon's "Polyphonia" (2001), Justin Peck's "Bright" and Alexei Ratmansky's new work, "Voices." The Saturday and Sunday matinees highlight collaborations between Balanchine and Stravinsky, while the performances on Saturday evening and Wednesday juxtapose Balanchine with Peck in two slightly different mixes. The program on Feb. 6 again includes Balanchine ("Haieff Divertimento" and "Episodes") and Peck (the lovely "Rodeo: Four Dance Episodes") along with Robbins ("Concertino").

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'AGRIPPINA' at the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 6, 7:30 p.m.; through March 7). Handel's early Venetian opera arrives at the Met in a production by David McVicar, and with an all-star cast. Joyce DiDonato takes the title role, with Kate Lindsey as Nerone, Iestyn Davies as Ottone, Matthew Rose as Claudio, Duncan Rock as Pallante and Brenda Rae as Poppea. Harry Bicket conducts.
212-362-6000, metopera.org
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Jan. 31, 8 p.m.). How many orchestras would come up with a Beethoven tribute concert without any works by Beethoven in it? Not many, but the American Symphony revels in being different. Leon Botstein conducts Spohr's "Historical Symphony," Reger's "Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Beethoven," Liszt's "Fantasy on Motifs From Beethoven's Ruins of Athens" and Ustvolskaya's Piano Concerto. Lucas Debargue is the soloist. And if you want some actual Beethoven, Botstein and his orchestra can walk you through the Symphony No. 5 at Symphony Space on Sunday at 4 p.m.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
DORIC STRING QUARTET at Weill Recital Hall (Feb. 6, 7:30 p.m.). The Doric is one of the most accomplished young string quartets around, which is saying something at a time when we're inundated with them. Alex Redington, Jonathan Stone, Hélène Clément and John Myerscough play works by two composers they have recorded to considerable acclaim -- Haydn and Schubert -- and give the United States premiere of Brett Dean's String Quartet No. 3, "Hidden Agendas."
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
SUSAN GRAHAM at Alice Tully Hall (Feb. 4, 7:30 p.m.). With Malcolm Martineau at the keyboard, Graham weaves songs by Grieg, Strauss, Fauré, Mahler and many more composers through the eight songs of Schumann's "Frauenliebe und -leben." Be sure to hear that even if you somehow manage to find a ticket to the other big vocal recital, on Friday evening at Zankel Hall, in which Peter Mattei sings Schubert's "Winterreise."

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 5-6, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 11). All power to the Philharmonic for its Project 19, a multiyear effort to commission new works from 19 women composers, in honor of the passage of the 19th Amendment. The first fruit is Nina C. Young's "Tread Softly," appearing here along with Haydn's Cello Concerto No. 1 and Mozart's "Great" Mass. Carter Brey is the cello soloist, and the vocalists in the Mozart include Miah Persson and Nicholas Phan.
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). Baroque music from this orchestra and its principal conductor, Bernard Labadie, who deliver two works by Handel and four by Vivaldi, including two settings of the "Salve Regina." They are joined by the violinist Daniel Hope and the contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
CAROLINE SHAW at Miller Theater (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). Shaw's music is plenty familiar now, so we might see this composer portrait as a celebration of her recent success. There's a nod to the past with performances by the Attacca Quartet of three string quartets, "Punctum," "Entr'acte" and "Blueprint," two of which are featured on a widely heralded recording on New Amsterdam/Nonesuch. And there's a nod to the future: In addition to joining So Percussion for her song cycle "Narrow Sea," Shaw performs songs created with that quartet for a future recording project, "Let the Soil Play Its Simple Part."

Texto completo: Authorities issued warrants for men suspected of helping smuggle the former executive out of the country to avoid criminal charges.
TOKYO -- Japanese prosecutors on Thursday issued arrest warrants for three Americans suspected of helping the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country, where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial wrongdoing.
Mr. Ghosn surprised the world, and embarrassed the Japanese authorities, when he slipped out of his home in Tokyo in late December and turned up a day later in Lebanon.
Prosecutors want to arrest Michael Taylor, 59, a former Green Beret; his son, Peter Maxwell Taylor, 26; and George Antoine Zayek, 60. The warrant said they had helped Mr. Ghosn avoid immigration checks and board a private jet in Osaka that took him to Turkey on the first leg of his escape.
They also issued a new warrant for the arrest of Mr. Ghosn, who "illegally left the country" without notifying the immigration authorities.
The document was the first official confirmation by the Japanese authorities of some of the details of Mr. Ghosn's flight. Mr. Ghosn has shared next to no information about the escape, citing concern about the safety of those who aided him.
According to the warrant, Michael Taylor and Mr. Zayek accompanied Mr. Ghosn from Tokyo to Osaka, nearly 300 miles to the west, where they hid him in "portable luggage" and helped smuggle him through a private jet terminal and onto a plane. Mr. Ghosn is believed to have hidden in a large black box typically used for transporting audio equipment.
Mr. Taylor is a private-security contractor with extensive contacts in Lebanon dating to the 1980s, when he was deployed to Beirut as part of a team of United States Special Forces.
Mr. Zayek, whose part in the escape was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, was born in Lebanon and previously worked with Mr. Taylor's Boston-based security company. The arrest warrant was the first public mention of Peter Taylor's involvement. All three are believed to be American citizens, prosecutors said.
The Taylors and Mr. Zayek have been in the Middle East since Mr. Ghosn's escape, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawyers for the Taylors did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Zayek could not be reached for comment.
Japan has an extradition treaty with the United States, potentially putting the men within reach of Japanese prosecutors if they were arrested by American authorities.
In a news conference, a deputy chief prosecutor, Takahiro Saito, said Peter Taylor had "played an important role in the escape," having met with Mr. Ghosn at least seven times in Tokyo between July and the day of his escape on Dec. 29.
Mr. Saito said he believed that the younger Mr. Taylor had been a key conduit for planning the escape, ultimately reserving a Tokyo hotel room for Mr. Ghosn and providing him with the key. On the day of his flight, Mr. Ghosn traveled from his home in central Tokyo to the nearby hotel, where he changed clothes before meeting with the other two men, who accompanied him to Osaka, he added.
After the private jet landed in Istanbul, Mr. Ghosn is believed to have boarded another private jet flight to Beirut. Michael Taylor and Mr. Zayek are suspected of taking a commercial flight to Lebanon; the Turkish authorities have released photos showing the two men passing through passport control at the Istanbul airport.
A veteran of the Lebanese civil war, Mr. Zayek has worked with Michael Taylor for decades, including on security contracts in Iraq. He is the brother of Elias Zayek, a founder of the Lebanese Forces militia who was assassinated in 1990. Mr. Zayek has also spent time in the United States, earning diplomas in 1982 from the Gemological Institute of America in California, according to school records.
When he was a security consultant, The New York Times hired Michael Taylor to assist in the rescue of David Rohde, then a Times reporter, who was kidnapped by militants in Afghanistan and held for seven months in Pakistan's tribal areas. In 2012, Mr. Taylor was indicted for his role in a plan to obstruct a federal fraud investigation into bid rigging of Defense Department contracts and served time in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud.
The planning behind Mr. Ghosn's flight from Japan began last summer, according to someone familiar with the details of the escape. For months, the person said, Michael Taylor worked with a team of more than a dozen operatives from around the world to scope out airports and seaports in Japan, looking for security flaws that would allow Mr. Ghosn to slip out of the country by plane or boat. The team considered a number of options, including putting Mr. Ghosn on a ship to Thailand. The preparation cost more than $ 1 million, the person said.
The warrants were announced a day after prosecutors raided the Tokyo office of Mr. Ghosn's former lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, looking for evidence related to the escape. Mr. Hironaka told reporters afterward that prosecutors had tried to confiscate materials Mr. Ghosn used to prepare his defense, forcing open a door in the office and breaking open drawers and cabinets that they believed might contain relevant documents.
During the raid, prosecutors tried to seize a personal computer used by Mr. Ghosn in Mr. Hironaka's office. Mr. Hironaka has refused to turn over the computer, citing his responsibilities as Mr. Ghosn's former lawyer.
Mr. Saito said Mr. Ghosn had met the younger Mr. Taylor four times in the lawyer's office.
Since Mr. Ghosn's flight, prosecutors have worked hard to turn up the pressure on him. Interpol issued a so-called red notice at Japan's request, asking that cooperating countries arrest him. Prosecutors have also issued an arrest warrant for his wife, Carole Ghosn, accusing her of providing false testimony about her husband's case.
For the time being, the couple, who both hold Lebanese passports, are living in Beirut. Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan and a policy of not handing over its citizens to foreign governments.
In Japan, Mr. Ghosn faced charges of hiding his compensation from regulators and using Nissan's resources for his own financial benefit. But he has strongly denied the allegations, arguing that they were part of a corporate coup intended to thwart his efforts to strengthen Nissan's alliance with its French partner, Renault.
While free on bail in Japan, Mr. Ghosn largely stayed out of the spotlight. But since his escape, he has repeatedly lashed out against Japan's justice system, where, he said, he had no chance of receiving a fair trial.
After his surprise arrest in November 2018, Mr. Ghosn said, he was held in solitary confinement for long periods and interrogated for hours without a lawyer.
He was released after posting nearly $ 14 million in bail. Until his escape, he lived in a home in central Tokyo. As a condition of his bail, the authorities monitored his comings and goings and forbade him to use the internet outside his lawyer's office. Mr. Ghosn was also not allowed to see or even speak to Mrs. Ghosn, except for two brief video calls, because of prosecutors' concerns that she might help him tamper with witnesses or evidence.

Texto completo: Four Democratic presidential candidates hoping for success in the state remained in Washington for President Trump's Senate trial.
DES MOINES -- Four Democratic presidential candidates hoping for breakout performances in the Iowa caucuses next week spent Thursday in Washington listening to questioning in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.
But the man on trial appeared in Des Moines for a rally to fire up his supporters before the caucuses on Monday. It was his second rally in three nights.
In a state where the Democratic field faces a competitive and critical contest on Monday night, the president told his supporters that they had a "front-row seat to the lunacy and the madness of a totally sick left." He called the Democrats the party of "socialism and blatant corruption," even as he sits accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Unlike the Democrats, Mr. Trump does not face a competitive contest in Iowa, where his two Republican challengers -- Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts -- have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support.
But the Trump campaign views a show of force before the caucuses as an opportunity to try to slow any momentum the winning Democrat hopes to gain from the close race. And Mr. Trump's team is seeking to build excitement ahead of the first chance voters have had to show their support for the president since the 2016 election.
Mr. Trump tried to belittle his Democratic opponents on Thursday with his signature nicknames, referring to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as "Sleepy Joe," Senator Bernie Sanders as "Crazy Bernie" and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as "Mini Mike." He poked fun multiple times at the pronunciation of the name of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and accused the field at large of "glorifying illegal immigration."
Four years after voters first saw Mr. Trump's name on a ballot, he leaned into some of the original, fear-mongering themes that defined his entry into politics, calling undocumented immigrants "stone cold rapists." The line was a callback to his kickoff speech in 2015, when he said of undocumented immigrants: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."
Mr. Trump seemed aware that he was rocketing into a state where Democrats have been camped out for months, noting that "we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street."
But his focus on the Democratic field in front of him appeared to be divided by his political enemies of the past and his foils in Congress.
The president reminisced about the 2016 election, expressing a longing for the former Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and rehashing a four-year-old campaign gaffe where she described some of his supporters as "deplorables."
"Maybe we take another crack at Crazy Hillary," Mr. Trump said. "She was so easy."
And he broke up his re-election pitch with invective aimed at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, whom the president referred to as a "sick puppy," and a diatribe against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he accused of letting her district in San Francisco fall into decay.
"We're having probably the best years we've ever had, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?" Mr. Trump said. But he claimed it was still a "happy period because we call it 'impeachment light."'
"This is not easy," he said, "you got maniacs doing a number on you for three years."
Mr. Trump spoke as the Senate waited on Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to announce his decision on whether to support hearing from witnesses during the impeachment trial. A couple of hours after Mr. Trump left the stage, Mr. Alexander said he was a "no" on hearing from more witnesses. His is a critical vote, and his decision will help determine whether Mr. Trump receives a swift acquittal as soon as Friday.
Trump officials said the caucus on Monday, even if it was not competitive, would be an important milestone for a campaign that has essentially been going on since Mr. Trump's famous escalator ride in Trump Tower in 2015. "This will be the first time his supporters are able to take part in the process that begins his re-election," said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.
Before the rally on Thursday night at Drake University, Mr. Trump made a brief stop in Warren, Mich., where he spoke to manufacturing workers the day after he signed the revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law.
Mr. Trump's trade deals are a key part of his re-election message. But it was clear that the impeachment trial -- which Republican senators are hoping to wrap up quickly without hearing from additional witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser -- was on his mind.
"I've kept my promise, not only my promise of loving the people of Michigan, but my promise of taking care of it so other countries aren't ripping us off," Mr. Trump told the crowd gathered at Dana Inc., a major auto parts manufacturer of axles, transmissions and other key components in Warren, an industrial city north of Detroit. "You remember the tax cut? It was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and what do they do? They impeach you. It's frankly a disgrace to our country."
The Trump campaign plans to follow up on the Des Moines rally with a blitz of appearances at caucus sites on Monday by roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress to generate enthusiasm among Iowa Republicans.
Mr. Biden on Thursday spent significant time during campaign stops in Iowa marveling at the band of Trump surrogates and supporters planning to flood the state, suggesting it was proof Mr. Trump's campaign was running scared. "I never saw another party have so much interest in, in a Democratic caucus," he said. "I wonder why they're all coming. I wonder why they're here."
Mr. Trump already has deep support in Iowa, a state he won in 2016 by more than nine points. Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, has been a strong Trump supporter who has echoed the president's description of a Democratic Party defined by "left-wing nuts." Campaign officials have tried to reward Mr. Kaufmann's loyalty with presidential visits intended to motivate other state chairmen to follow suit.
The president last held a campaign rally in Iowa in Council Bluffs in October 2018 as part of his push before the midterm elections. In June, he traveled to the state to speak at the Iowa Republican dinner on the same day that Mr. Biden was crisscrossing the state, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two would look like.
Since then, however, Mr. Biden has slipped from his front-runner status in the state, where Mr. Sanders has emerged on top in a handful of polls. But Mr. Sanders as well Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado spent the day in the Senate chamber.

To the Editor:
Re "Trump Just Acts Like a Politician" (Op-Ed, Jan. 25):
Josh Blackman draws a false equivalence between the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and Donald Trump in 2019. We can debate the wisdom of President Lincoln's decision to allow troops home to vote -- but he made that decision to serve the national interest in a time of war, not to benefit his political career. President Trump's pressure on Ukraine's leader went directly against our national interest, in order to benefit himself alone.
I am positive that President Lincoln would have thrown away his career, his wealth and indeed his life to preserve the union. Can the same be said about our current president?

Teenagers and Their Phones: A Guide for Parents
To the Editor:
Re "The Menace of Screen Time Could Be More of a Mirage" (Business Day, Jan. 18):
Some headlines imply that smartphones are destroying a generation, while others say there is little to worry about. This debate does not help with the pressing question, What is a parent to do?
Excessive screen time can be a red flag that a teenager is having emotional struggles. Teenagers often go on screens to escape hard feelings. But short amounts of time can pose risks, too. It takes only a minute to experience online cruelty. Still, much of the time that teenagers are on screens, they do not experience negative things.
If we are overly scared, we put teenagers on the defensive, alienating them. If parents take the opposite approach and are hands-off, teenagers are also likely to disengage.
There are a few simple actions all parents can take to help their teenagers. Foster open conversations and stave off defensiveness by first acknowledging the important role that their phones play in their lives and then ask about the hard stuff.
Encourage them to be mindful of how their digital experiences make them feel. Address irrefutable problems like inadequate sleep by requiring phones out of their rooms at bedtime.
Simple steps like these can help guide parents away from paralysis from the academic debate to a path of better parenting.

Texto completo: The Public Theater's summer lineup includes a serious tale of political rebellion and a musical take on a comedy.
The Public Theater announced on Thursday that it will bring a new production of "Richard II" and a version of its 2017 musical adaptation of "As You Like It" to the Delacorte Theater in Central Park this summer for its free Shakespeare in the Park series.
"There is no issue in the world that can't be helped by a little Shakespeare," the theater's artistic director, Oskar Eustis, said in a statement. "This summer, 'Richard II' explores the extraordinary danger and possibility of regime change and 'As You Like It' celebrates a Forest of Arden where all refugees are welcome."
Saheem Ali, who helmed the recent Signature Theater revival of Anna Deavere Smith's "Fires in the Mirror," will direct "Richard II." The play was last staged at the Delacorte in 1987, when the founder of the theater program, Joseph Papp, directed Peter MacNicol in the title role. Having it return during an election year that began with an impeachment trial is a pointed choice: "Richard II" tells a story about political rebellion and abdication. The play will run May 19 through June 21. Casting has not yet been announced.
In the second half of the season, the Public will present the reimagined 2017 adaptation of "As You Like It," which was a product of the theater's Public Works program. Directed by Laurie Woolery with original music by the composer Shaina Taub and choreography by Sonya Tayeh, the adaptation placed more than 200 amateur performers alongside professional actors. (Alexis Soloski called the result "thrilling" in her review for The New York Times.) The adaptation ran for only a handful of days that year. This summer, it returns with Taub, Darius de Haas and Joel Perez reprising lead roles -- and it will have a new set, among other changes. "As You Like It" will run July 14 through Aug. 8.
The shows will be free, and tickets will be available in person and by digital lottery. More information is available at publictheater.org.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Thursday moved to drop the threat of punishment to oil and gas companies, construction crews and other organizations that kill birds "incidentally," arguing that businesses that accidentally kill birds ought to be able to operate without fear of prosecution.
Conservation groups said the proposed new regulation from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which operates under the Department of Interior, would substantially weaken the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and put millions of birds in danger. The threat of fines and prosecution has, for decades, helped prod industries to take steps to protect birds, like affixing red lights on communication towers, they say.
But industry leaders and administration officials said they expected businesses to continue to voluntarily protect bird habitats. Removing the threat of punishment, they said, would bring regulatory certainty and eliminate legal disputes over whether the law covers birds killed unintentionally, whether from an oil spill or the blade of a wind turbine.
Aurelia Skipwith, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, called bird conservation "an integral part" of the agency's mission. By specifying that entities should be held liable only if they can be proven to have set out to kill birds, she said, "we are taking action today to make sure our rules and regulations are clear."
The proposed regulation, if finalized, would cement a legal opinion that the Department of Interior issued in 2017 that previous administrations had interpreted the law too broadly and that only actions explicitly intended to kill birds should be forbidden.
That interpretation has already had significant consequences for migratory birds. According to internal agency documents recently obtained by The New York Times, the Trump administration has discouraged local governments and businesses from taking simple precautionary measures to protect birds, and federal wildlife officials have all but stopped investigating most bird deaths.
With a presidential election coming in November, the Trump administration is moving quickly to finalize dozens of regulatory rollbacks and other actions to weaken environmental protections viewed as burdensome by industry.
In recent weeks, the administration has scrapped a clean water regulation aimed at protecting streams and wetlands, and blocked an effort to require Americans to use energy-efficient light bulbs. Within the next month, the administration plans to weaken vehicle emissions standards and a rule restricting mercury, a toxic chemical emitted from coal-burning power plants. Completing the rule curtailing the Migratory Bird Treaty Act before the November election will be difficult, but the agency has indicated it will push aggressively to do so.
"It's a race against the clock," Bob Dreher, senior vice president of conservation programs at Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental organization, said of the proposed regulation.
Any legal guideline, like the one now governing bird-death enforcement, can be easily overturned; the 2017 opinion on incidental avian deaths reversed guidelines written by the Obama administration to enshrine the government's ability to fine and prosecute those who accidentally kill migratory birds. Mr. Dreher noted that codifying the opinion into regulation, as the Trump administration is trying to do, would make it harder for a future president to issue a quick reversal.
"They're trying to entrench this as much as they can, and get stuff locked into place," he said, but added, "We're going to fight it."

Six conservation groups and eight states have already sued to block the underlying legal opinion. Last week, a group of former Interior Department officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations filed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.
Oil industry representatives said that they have worked voluntarily to protect birds and would continue to do so. They also accused the Obama administration of abusing the law by singling out oil and gas companies for prosecution. The new rule, several business leaders said, brings regulatory certainty to companies worried that bird deaths would make them criminally liable for millions of dollars.
Erik G. Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore oil and wind industries, called it "welcome news for safe and responsible energy development." He said the proposal would prevent "the unnecessary criminalization" of accidental bird deaths that he said had blocked or slowed energy projects.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act makes it illegal "by any means or in any manner" to hunt, take, capture or kill birds, nests or eggs from listed species without a permit. Beginning in the 1970s, federal officials used the act to prosecute and fine companies up to $ 15,000 per bird for accidental deaths on power lines, in oil pits, in wind turbines and by other industrial hazards.
In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon disaster killed 11 people and spewed more than 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of birds were killed, and BP agreed to pay $ 100 million for criminal violations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Under the current legal guidance and the proposed regulatory changes, that episode would no longer trigger criminal liability because the birds were killed unintentionally. Illegal acts are also protected under the plan. For example, a farmer who sprayed a banned pesticide that killed birds would not be held liable as long as the birds were not the "intended target."
The rule will appear in the Federal Register on Monday and the public will have 45 days to comment on it.

Texto completo: Readers urge senators to vote to convict or to merely vote "present" as a protest, and wonder about Alan Dershowitz, "Was he serious?"
To the Editor:
Dear Respected Senators:
Our president has a talent for making everything about him. This impeachment proceeding has his name all over it, but is actually about something much bigger. It is about the direction our country takes and the way it will exist in the world.
And it is very simple. All you have to decide is this: Was what President Trump did the kind of behavior you want to see emulated and repeated by future presidents, other elected officials and appointed officials? Are you laying out for the American people a new norm of acceptability? If that is what you wish to give us, vote "acquit."
On the other hand, if you want to issue a stern warning to future elected and public officials that such behavior is not acceptable, is not what we are about and is damaging to our country, then vote "convict."
Just as the impeachment proceedings are not just about Mr. Trump, they are also not just about you, your political future, your comfort zone, your approval ratings, your constituents. Try to remember: Your vote is about all of us.
Margaret Troupin
New York
To the Editor:
If the impeachment "trial" comes to a quick conclusion without witnesses, as now seems likely, I have a serious request for our esteemed Democratic senators. Can they please vote "Present" or "NV" (Not Voting) on acquittal? Then the history books can only say, "In the end, the president was acquitted by 53 Republican senators; the Democrats all abstained, citing the fact that a trial without witnesses and evidence did not meet the standards that the framers of the Constitution presumed when they established the powers of impeachment."
The stunning arguments being made by the Republicans and their lawyers have shown their complete disdain for the rule of law. This act of defiance would be one small way to remind future generations that Democrats did everything in their power to resist the onslaught of unchecked authoritarianism.

To the Editor:
Re "6 Takeaways From Senators' Questions to Impeachment Lawyers" (nytimes.com, Jan. 29):
When I read that Alan Dershowitz argued that "if the president does something that he thinks will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," I had to read it twice to make sure I had not misread it.
The claim is so undemocratic and absurd that my first reaction was not a legal rejoinder but a question: Was he serious?
Chase Webb
Portland, Ore.
To the Editor:
Dear Mr. Dershowitz: If you are going to make the shocking claim that a president is permitted to do absolutely anything to ensure his re-election, including cheating in that election, as long as he believes that his re-election would be "in the public interest," then you must prove that the president believes in acting in the public interest. You can prove this only by giving us examples of how in his years as president he has distinguished between his own interests and those of the public, and, when they conflicted, chosen in favor of the public. Good luck.

Texto completo: Readers react negatively to criticism of a new and acclaimed novel about migrants.
To the Editor:
Re "Hype Over Novel on Migrants Turns Into Backlash for Author" (front page, Jan. 26):
The critics of Jeanine Cummins assert that she is guilty of appropriation because the protagonist in her novel "American Dirt" is a Mexican woman fleeing the drug cartel, and Ms. Cummins is not. Therefore, Shakespeare should not have written "Othello," Joyce "Ulysses," Flaubert "Madame Bovary" or George Eliot "Silas Marner." Everyone is condemned to write autobiographies.
It's fiction! "There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book," Oscar Wilde said. "Books are well written, or badly written." Picasso added that "art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth."
The lies of Ms. Cummins's critics threaten all art.
David Jelinek
New York
To the Editor:
Was Harriet Beecher Stowe guilty of "enslavement porn" or "cultural appropriation" when she wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin"?
Yes, it is a sentimental, stereotyped portrayal of enslaved people in the South by a white woman, but it was a runaway best seller and helped turn the tide of public opinion against slavery in the 1850s.
More power to Jeanine Cummins, the author of "American Dirt," if she's written a book that will likewise create sympathy and understanding for the plight of desperate migrants fleeing murder and torture.
Let's worry about authorial purity once we've come a little closer to social justice.

Chief Justice Won't Allow Naming of Whistle-Blower

Texto completo: Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, read the name to reporters and posted it on Twitter after failing to get Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to say during President Trump's impeachment trial.
WASHINGTON -- Senator Rand Paul clashed publicly on Thursday with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. after the Kentucky Republican tried and failed to ask a question at President Trump's impeachment trial that would have named the person widely thought to be the whistle-blower whose complaint formed the basis for the charges.
In a striking moment on the Senate floor, Chief Justice Roberts, who is presiding over the trial and has the task of reading senators' questions aloud, refused to read one from Mr. Paul, instead saying: "The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted."
Mr. Paul, visibly angry at being thwarted by the chief justice, quickly left the Senate chamber while the trial was still in session and rushed to a news studio upstairs in the Capitol, where he read the question the chief justice had rejected -- and the name of the individual in question -- in front of television cameras, complaining that his question "deserved to be asked."
"I think it was an incorrect finding not to allow the question," he told reporters.
The extraordinary back and forth reflected the determination of some of Mr. Trump's staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill to shift the focus of the impeachment proceeding away from the president's conduct and toward what many Republicans suggest was a plot by his opponents to manufacture a basis for removing him.
Mr. Paul's question asked whether the House impeachment managers or members of the president's legal defense team were aware of reports that two individuals "may have worked together to plot impeaching the president before there were formal House impeachment proceedings." Moments after meeting with reporters, Mr. Paul also posted the question, including the person's name, on Twitter.
His push to ask the question began on Wednesday, when he submitted it and it was repeatedly rejected, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss it. On Thursday, Mr. Paul escalated the matter, standing up in the Senate chamber and handing forward a handwritten card bearing the question, in line with the trial rules. Chief Justice Roberts paused to read it silently, then turned instead to a piece of paper he had on the desk in front of him and appeared to read a prepared line indicating his decision not to ask the question aloud.
The Kentucky Republican's disclosure of the person's name was not the first time that he has done so. He has repeatedly urged media organizations to reveal the person's name, and in at least one interview with a Washington radio station, he said it aloud himself.
There are federal whistle-blower protections in place designed to prevent workplace retaliation and to make it more difficult to fire, demote or harass civil servants who report wrongdoing. Although neither the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 nor related statutes explicitly give a whistle-blower the right to anonymity, some lawyers and experts have said exposing the identity of a whistle-blower could expose them to retribution or be tantamount to trying to intimidate a witness.
Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, has said the whistle-blower followed the procedures properly, and intelligence officials have informally told their staffs that the anonymity of the whistle-blower should be respected.
Like Mr. Paul, conservative news organizations and activists have sought to focus attention on the whistle-blower's identity since October, just weeks after the intelligence officer first expressed concerns about Mr. Trump's July 25 call with the president of Ukraine. The call prompted the House inquiry that eventually led to Mr. Trump's impeachment and the Senate trial.
As the impeachment inquiry expanded beyond the allegations contained in the whistle-blower's initial complaint, Mr. Trump's defenders repeatedly pressed for examination of the whistle-blower's motives. They argued that the effort to remove Mr. Trump from office was a deep-state conspiracy orchestrated by unelected bureaucrats loyal to former President Barack Obama and working in concert with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
They seized on a report by The New York Times that Mr. Schiff learned through an aide about the outlines of a C.I.A. officer's concerns about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine a few days before the officer filed a whistle-blower complaint.
At the news conference, Mr. Paul asserted that the two had been "working together for years looking for an opportunity" to impeach the president.
Several House Republicans loyal to Mr. Trump asked questions about the person widely believed to be the whistle-blower during the closed-door depositions of witnesses conducted by the Intelligence Committee. The interviews were later transcribed and released publicly. Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, used the person's name during an open committee hearing in December.
Democrats argue that the focus by Mr. Paul and other conservatives on the whistle-blower is misplaced, because the House investigation uncovered extensive evidence corroborating and expanding upon the initial allegations. Mr. Schiff and others have also criticized the push to reveal the person's name, saying it puts the person in danger and makes it less likely that other whistle-blowers will come forward in the future.
In his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Paul insisted that his question had nothing to do with unmasking a whistle-blower, saying he was merely trying to get information about people who might have been working inside the government against Mr. Trump's interests. He said the question "made no reference to any whistle-blower or any kind of person, a complaint from the whistle-blower."
In a statement after the news conference, Sergio Gor, a spokesman for Mr. Paul, said in a statement that the senator "wanted to ask about various individuals who worked for President Obama's administration and whether they colluded with Adam Schiff. Nowhere does he allege, nor does he know if, any of them are the so-called 'whistle-blower.' Those reporting otherwise are misreporting."
But Mr. Paul's efforts to reveal the name have put him at odds with many of his colleagues, including Republicans.
Just before Mr. Paul sent his question to the desk on Thursday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, made comments as he opened the day's question period that appeared to be directed at discouraging Mr. Paul's actions.
"We've been respectful of the Chief Justice's unique position in reading our questions," Mr. McConnell said. "And I want to be able to continue to assure him that that level of consideration for him will continue."
Hours before Mr. Paul tried to reveal the person's name on the Senate floor, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that he did not believe that should happen.
"Not in this environment," he told reporters.
Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The number, which has steadily increased since the Jan. 8 attack, is now at 64.
WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department said on Thursday that 64 troops had sustained traumatic brain injuries after the Iranian ballistic missile strikes on Ayn Al Asad Air Base in Iraq this month, up 14 from an earlier announcement this week.
The number, which has steadily increased since the Jan. 8 attack, is a clear indicator of the lasting and unseen effects so common in America's long wars, made strikingly prevalent by the roadside bombs scattered in Iraq and Afghanistan that killed and maimed thousands of troops.
Eight are being treated in the United States, while 21 are in Landstuhl, Germany, and 39 have returned to duty in Iraq, according to a Pentagon statement. The higher number of 64 was first reported by CNN.
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, speaking to reporters during a news conference alongside the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, said on Thursday that the Pentagon took those types of injuries "very seriously."
President Trump had seemed to dismiss the brain injuries at a news conference in Davos, Switzerland, last week. "I heard they had headaches," Mr. Trump said. "I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries I have seen."
Mr. Esper defended the president on Thursday. "He's very concerned about the health and welfare of all of our service members, particularly those that were involved in our operations in Iraq," Mr. Esper said.
Mr. Trump's sentiments echoed those common in the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where troops rattled by explosions, but visibly uninjured, were ushered quickly back to duty, only to have long-term effects from the blasts eventually manifest weeks and months afterward.
Traumatic brain injuries in troops are often caused by the intense and rapid overpressure that follows a nearby explosion.
Only in the last several years has the Pentagon made a considerable effort to understand brain injuries and their lasting effects, which sometimes bring long-term physical or mental disabilities.
The Trump administration at first said there were no injuries from the attack on American troops but recanted a week later, noting that several had been evacuated for possible concussions.
Pentagon and military officials have pushed back on the notion that they withheld any information about the injuries, pointing out that the absence of visible wounds meant the Pentagon was not made aware until days later. They noted that the symptoms of concussions and traumatic brain injuries often take days or weeks to appear.
The ballistic missiles that hit the base in Iraq were launched by Iran in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani, by an American drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3.
To contend with the threat of Iranian ballistic missiles, which can travel more than a hundred miles and evade rudimentary defenses, the Pentagon is looking to move Patriot air defenses into Iraq.
But while both Mr. Esper and General Milley said they believe the weapons are necessary for American defenses, the Iraqi government is currently holding up the weapons' deployment.
"That is one of the matters we have to work on and work through" with the Iraqi government, Mr. Esper said on Thursday.
There are roughly 5,000 American troops in Iraq.

Set in a boardinghouse in Duluth, Minn., in 1934, it centers on various down-at-heart, down-at-heel residents.

212-246-4422, 2st.com
Last Chance
THE BIG APPLE CIRCUS at Damrosch Park (closes on Feb. 2). This popular local circus folds its big tent. The current iteration is sometimes racier than usual, but who can't help enjoying the Lopez Troupe riding bicycles on a high wire or Jayson Dominguez surviving the Wheel of Death? The real stars: the magnificent Savitsky Cats, balls of fluff with acrobatic chops.
212-257-2330, bigapplecircus.com
'TIMON OF ATHENS' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (closes on Feb. 9). Fashioned for this age of inequality, Simon Godwin's adaptation of Shakespeare's (and Thomas Middleton's) vexed semitragedy ends its run. Starring Kathryn Hunter as a plutocrat who goes broke, the production adds in fragments from other Shakespeare plays, plus a sonnet. Jesse Green called it an "energetic and somewhat Frankensteined revival."

Re "The Menace of Screen Time Could Be More of a Mirage" (Business Day, Jan. 18):
Some headlines imply that smartphones are destroying a generation, while others say there is little to worry about. This debate does not help with the pressing question, What is a parent to do?
Excessive screen time can be a red flag that a teenager is having emotional struggles. Teenagers often go on screens to escape hard feelings. But short amounts of time can pose risks, too. It takes only a minute to experience online cruelty. Still, much of the time that teenagers are on screens, they do not experience negative things.
If we are overly scared, we put teenagers on the defensive, alienating them. If parents take the opposite approach and are hands-off, teenagers are also likely to disengage.
There are a few simple actions all parents can take to help their teenagers. Foster open conversations and stave off defensiveness by first acknowledging the important role that their phones play in their lives and then ask about the hard stuff.
Encourage them to be mindful of how their digital experiences make them feel. Address irrefutable problems like inadequate sleep by requiring phones out of their rooms at bedtime.
Simple steps like these can help guide parents away from paralysis from the academic debate to a path of better parenting.

Texto completo: Michael R. Bloomberg's campaign will air a 60-second ad promoting his record on gun control, while President Trump has lined up a commercial celebrating his time in office.
DES MOINES -- Two billionaires will pitch their presidential candidacies amid the beer and car commercials of the Super Bowl on Sunday, with Michael R. Bloomberg spending a full minute addressing gun violence and President Trump using 30 seconds to highlight his first years in office.
The Bloomberg ad, which his campaign says it hopes will "stop people in their tracks," features an emotional story told by a mother still grieving the loss of her son, shown onscreen in youth football gear, who was killed by gunfire at the age of 20. She points to Mr. Bloomberg's record on seeking tougher gun laws as the reason she now has "a dog in the fight" for the presidency.
By contrast, Mr. Trump's ad features relatively general themes and imagery of the president's rallies, with a narrator boasting about low unemployment and the military. The ad could be mistaken as a generic Trump campaign ad; it is not particularly yoked to the football game, nor does it contain the sort of creative or conceptual touches that distinguish expensive Super Bowl ads.
Yet with the president's flair for dramatics and the suspense of a great reveal, the Trump campaign said that it would be airing two different 30-second ads during the game, and that the second ad "will be seen by the world for the first time when it actually airs."
The dueling presidential ads, which the campaigns revealed Thursday, are as much a contrast in substance -- the Trump ad celebrates a "safer" America while the Bloomberg ad points to children killed by gun violence -- as they are a show of financial might and messaging power.
And they provide further evidence that the 2020 election will be a yearlong brawl on the national airwaves, with well-financed candidates like Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump exploiting their vast resources to reach huge audiences. Never before have two presidential candidates aired national ads during the Super Bowl.
Both campaigns spent $ 11 million for 60 seconds in front of what is regularly the largest television audience of the year (predictions for this year's Super Bowl, which will be broadcast on Fox, hover around 100 million viewers).
Despite its eight-figure sticker price, Mr. Bloomberg's ad is a relatively small slice of his relentless national advertising strategy: He has already spent $ 275 million of his multibillion-dollar fortune on television, radio and digital media.
His campaign has spent roughly $ 90 million on television ads that feature some attack on Mr. Trump, but, notably, the Super Bowl ad does not even mention the president.
Instead, it opens with Calandrian Kemp sharing the story of her son, George Kemp Jr., as the camera pans across childhood pictures of George in football gear. He was shot and killed in 2013 during an altercation while he was at mechanic school; he was 20.
"I just kept saying, you cannot tell me that the child I gave birth to is no longer here," Ms. Kemp says in the ad, her voice breaking. The screen then shows white text on a black background: "2,900 children die from gun violence every year."
That figure has been cited by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group primarily financed by Mr. Bloomberg.
Ms. Kemp then praises Mr. Bloomberg's record on gun control. "I know Mike is not afraid of the gun lobby -- they're scared of him," she says. "And they should be."
The ad is scheduled to air between the end of the Super Bowl halftime show and the beginning of the third quarter, the campaign said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.] In the age of data-driven, targeted advertising, spending so much on a single ad to reach such a broad audience may seem wasteful. But Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said the thought behind buying an ad during the Super Bowl was simple: It will reach the largest available audience, and Super Bowl ads are often talked about well after the game.
"It's a time when people get together and they sit down and they watch the Super Bowl, but they also know that there are these ads and there's a lot of conversation about the ads," Mr. Wolfson said. "It's a very wide net, it's a broad swath of Americans, and this is an issue that there's been an awful lot of agreement on."
The campaign said it had selected an ad about gun violence for the Super Bowl slot because it was an issue "central to Mike Bloomberg." Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, made the final call. When shown a variety of ads to choose from, Mr. Bloomberg was "adamant" that the campaign run the one featuring Ms. Kemp.
"I cried the first time I saw it," Mr. Wolfson said. "Other people who saw it in the office cried. There are a lot of fairly hard-bitten political people here."
Mr. Trump's ad begins with a news report from Mr. Trump's favorite night -- election night 2016 -- as a narrator intones that "America demanded change, and change is what we got."
Quick flashes of military operations -- an aircraft carrier cutting through choppy seas, a fighter jet making a hard banking turn -- give way to a recited list of economic realities under Mr. Trump: rising wages and low unemployment.
At the end of the ad, Mr. Trump is shown speaking at one of his raucous rallies, proclaiming, "Ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg have shown a propensity for advertising during sporting events, which are some of the rare broadcasts that still capture live audiences in an age of digital streaming platforms. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign ran ads throughout the N.F.L. playoffs, and Mr. Trump advertised during the World Series last year.
Mr. Bloomberg is not competing in the Iowa caucuses, which will take place the night after the Super Bowl, nor has he mounted a concerted effort in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, which also vote in February. He is instead focusing on the 14 states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 3, when about 40 percent of the Democratic delegates will be allocated.
By flooding the airwaves across the country, Mr. Bloomberg is betting he can drown out his Democratic rivals, who are still focused on campaigning in the early-voting states. The advertising blitz has helped him move up to 7 percent support in the latest New York Times national polling average, good enough for fifth place.
Of course, seeing two political ads in a night that is built on entertainment could turn off some viewers. But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers said they were not concerned about running an emotional ad about a divisive issue amid the other, often humorous commercials.
"I think it's going to stop people in their tracks," Mr. Wolfson said. "Frankly, amid the dancing raisins and souped-up cars, a mother speaking fundamental and powerful truths about her experience and her son's loss will draw an awful lot of attention, deservedly so."

These Brands Have Better Uses for Money Than a Super Bowl Ad

Texto completo: Stella Artois, Burger King and other companies have decided against showing their wares on the year's most-watched broadcast.
Stella Artois has big plans to promote itself during the Super Bowl.
None of them involve a commercial.
Instead of spending up to $ 5.6 million on a 30-second spot, the beer brand is sponsoring a three-day event in Miami, the host city of the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.
The decision to skip what is typically the most-watched broadcast of the year seems counterintuitive. During last year's N.F.L. championship, Stella Artois aired a commercial starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Jeff Bridges that was credited with pulling the brand out of a slump.
The move seems even more unorthodox when you consider that many of Anheuser-Busch's other major brands will advertise during the game on Sunday. But Peter Van Overstraeten, a vice president at the company, said it was smart to sit this one out.
"It's a matter of balancing and making sure our efforts are not lost in the big sea of messaging that's going on," he said.
The gathering, called Port de Stella, started Thursday. It features a performance by the musical duo Sofi Tukker, appearances from celebrities like the actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas and pop-up restaurants catered by chefs like Rosio Sanchez. Visitors can skip causeway traffic by taking yachts emblazoned with the Stella Artois logo from South Beach to the event's downtown Miami location.
In addition to its status as secular national holiday, Super Bowl Sunday is an advertising bonanza, a day when commercials are not only tolerated, but sought out. TiVo, the digital video recorder that allows viewers to bypass ads, will revive an option that skips over the football and goes straight to the promotional spots.
But limited space and rising prices, as well as a growing preference for other forms of advertising, mean that many companies end up on the sidelines.
Burger King and Skechers, which advertised during the game last year, will not return for Super Bowl LIV. Wix, a website-building platform that has appeared during the Super Bowl since 2015, is also going to skip it -- a risky move, perhaps, since its main rival, Squarespace, will air a commercial showing Winona Ryder in her birthplace, Winona, Minn.
Fox, which will broadcast the game this year, said it quickly sold out all 77 of its national advertising slots -- and added more to accommodate demand. Many companies, including Porsche and New York Life Insurance, are returning to the game after decades away. Others, like Facebook and Saucony, are making their Super Bowl debuts.
But some businesses are priced out. Even Hollywood studios have scaled back.
Others have decided the exposure may not be worth it. In addition to the costs of producing a game-worthy ad and booking a slot, there is the effort and expense that goes along with Super Bowl commercials, which have become the centerpieces of elaborate strategies rolled out across multiple platforms before, during and after the contest. There are advance teasers on social media, publicity stunts, behind-the-scenes videos, extended cuts -- a multifaceted approach known in the industry as a 360-degree operation.
Some brands have come up with ways to get attention at this time of year without the cost and headache of suiting up for the game. Acreage Holdings made news last year when CBS turned down its pitch for a Super Bowl commercial, a rejection that still shows up in the marijuana company's marketing materials.
Skittles also avoided last year's broadcast, instead producing a sold-out musical at a New York theater on Super Bowl Sunday with the actor Michael C. Hall performing songs like "Advertising Ruins Everything."
Television advertising remains an enormous business, worth $ 42 billion in the United States last year, according to the media intelligence firm Magna. But companies are spending less on TV as they shift their ad budgets to the digital realm. And with cord-cutting on the rise, the number of viewers watching the Super Bowl television broadcast has gone down in recent years. In 2017, 111.3 million viewers watched the game on Fox, a number that dropped to 103.4 million in 2018, when it was broadcast by NBC. Last year the number of people who watched the Super Bowl on CBS fell to 98.2 million, with 2.6 streaming it.
Companies that stay away take another factor into consideration: They are able to glean a lot more information about people clicking on online ads than the people who see their commercials on TV.
The actor and entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds, who owns a wireless service called Mint Mobile, made much of his decision to stay away from this year's Super Bowl in a full-page ad that ran in The New York Times. After noting that companies were spending more than $ 5 million to book time on the broadcast, he emphasized that he would not be doing the same, saying in the ad: "that's a HARD no."

Texto completo: Also this week, African climate activists and a popular Berkeley class
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
Last summer, when we discussed how to make your climate change donations count, our reporting suggested that one of the most effective strategies is donating to political campaigns.
But what if you're not into politics and would rather help out a nonprofit organization instead? Unless you're a scientist or policy wonk, figuring out who's actually making a difference can feel like an impossible task.
A good place to start would be Founders Pledge. That group -- inspired by effective altruism, a broad social movement that relies on evidence and analysis to determine where donations will do the most good -- helps entrepreneurs navigate the world of giving, in part by examining which charities offer the greatest return on investment.
John Halstead, the group's head of applied research, spent nine months writing a 152-page report aimed at climate change philanthropists. He ultimately recommended the Coalition for Rainforest Nations and the Clean Air Task Force as the most cost-effective organizations. The report cited the groups' past successes in fighting global deforestation and supporting clean energy innovation.
Other adherents of the effective altruism movement have backed BURN, a social enterprise that lets donors finance fuel-efficient stoves in Kenya, and The Clean Energy Innovation Program, a subset of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. (Disclosure: Both the Clean Air Task Force and Clean Energy Innovation Program support the expansion of advanced nuclear power.)
If you'd rather plant trees, ImpactMatters, a charity evaluator that says it shares "some methodological commonalities" with effective altruism researchers, highlighted Eden Reforestation Projects as the most cost-effective tree-planting nonprofit of the 56 it reviewed.
The data-based reports of effective altruism and groups that share its philosophy provide a good starting point for donors. But it's important to recognize that their analyses do not necessarily reflect the entirety of the climate change movement.
With that in mind, we asked two prominent climate change experts to share which charities they deemed worthy of donations (even if they didn't have a chart to back them up).
Kate Marvel, an associate research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, recommended Project Drawdown, which identifies global climate solutions; the N.A.A.C.P. Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which addresses the human and civil rights aspect of the issue; and the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, which combats "the war on science."
On the policy side, Vicki Arroyo, a law professor and executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center, recommended the Environmental Protection Network, which defends against budget cuts and regulatory rollbacks that could harm public health and the environment.
This is just a sampling of environmental organizations, of course, and you shouldn't be afraid to forge your own path.
If you go it alone, ClimateWorks Foundation, which helps large foundations "tackle climate change on a global scale," suggested first pinpointing the impact area (for instance, transportation or renewables), the approach (like mobilization or innovation) and the geographic location that interest you. Once you've found organizations that check those boxes, you can assess their backgrounds using tools like Charity Navigator and GuideStar.
You could also look through the recipients of grants from a reputable foundation. Since big foundations are experienced at recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of nonprofits, and since most perform due diligence before awarding funds, their grantee lists can also serve as road maps for individual donors.
A photo erases an activist, and highlights a problem
Young people are at the forefront of climate activism. But the most prominent young people challenging world leaders and corporations are often from the West. We hear and see much less about climate activists from Africa.
That's why an episode at the World Economic Forum last week in Davos, Switzerland, stung for many Africans. The Associated Press published a photo of youth activists at the meeting. But editors at the agency cropped out Vanessa Nakate, an activist from Uganda. She was the only person of color in the group. The symbolism was not good.
"It was, like, the hardest thing," she said in a video on her Twitter feed. "What really hurt me the most is that I was just thinking about the people from my country, and the people from Africa, and how much I've seen people being affected."
"Who is going to be able to speak for all those people?" she asked.
The A.P. ultimately replaced the cropped photo with the original version and issued an apology. The agency said a photo editor had removed Ms. Nakate because of composition problems: The building behind her was distracting, a statement said.
Africa will be hard-hit by climate change even though it is a tiny emitter of greenhouse gases. And, while many parts of the world can afford to think of climate disruptions in the future tense, many Africans are already living with them. Worse, many African countries don't have the resources needed to deal with climate change.
That's why Ms. Nakate and many others are speaking out for Africa. Youth-led climate and environmental initiatives, from plastic repurposing programs to tree-planting initiatives, are having an impact across the continent. But they get very little attention.
It's important that those efforts are seen, too.
At Berkeley, a student-led class takes a new approach
It's no secret that concerns about climate change and environmental degradation are growing on college campuses. That's led students and professors alike to explore novel ways to teach the subject in the classroom.
This semester at the University of California, Berkeley, one of the college's most popular courses is, remarkably, being taught by a 21-year-old senior, Sage Lenier. The class, titled Zero Waste: Solutions for a Sustainable Future, takes a fairly unusual approach -- by focusing on practical steps that students can take to shrink their ecological footprints.
Ms. Lenier, a conservation and resource studies major, said she'd been inspired to create the course after becoming dissatisfied with how environmental issues are typically taught. "We'd learn about huge problems like rising greenhouse gas emissions or topsoil collapse, but there wasn't much focus on what students could actually do about it," she said. "We'd end up feeling very depressed."
Berkeley allows students to create and teach their own classes, with approval from professors. Ms. Lenier designed a curriculum that walks through the science of modern waste streams, examining the links between our consumption habits -- what we buy, what we throw out, what we eat -- and problems like climate change. She focuses on steps that individuals and communities can take, like reducing reliance on single-use plastics, adopting more sustainable diets and shifting to a circular economy that produces less waste and requires fewer resources.
"I wanted to show people that there's a light at the end of the tunnel," Ms. Lenier said.
The course has struck a nerve. When it started in the spring of 2018, 25 students enrolled. But word spread quickly: For the latest iteration of the course, which starts on Wednesday, Ms. Lenier is expecting 300 students. Last summer, her curriculum won an award at the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference.
The class isn't a substitute for traditional studies of, say, climate science or energy systems. But Kate O'Neill, a professor at Berkeley's department of environmental science, policy and management who sponsors the course, said that Ms. Lenier offered a valuable advocacy-oriented perspective that academics don't always emphasize. "It's a unique model," Dr. O'Neill said, "and she's been able to attract a wide audience beyond the core environmental constituency."

Texto completo: A reader rebuts an Op-Ed writer's claim that both presidents' actions were motivated by personal interests.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Just Acts Like a Politician" (Op-Ed, Jan. 25):
Josh Blackman draws a false equivalence between the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and Donald Trump in 2019. We can debate the wisdom of President Lincoln's decision to allow troops home to vote -- but he made that decision to serve the national interest in a time of war, not to benefit his political career. President Trump's pressure on Ukraine's leader went directly against our national interest, in order to benefit himself alone.
I am positive that President Lincoln would have thrown away his career, his wealth and indeed his life to preserve the union. Can the same be said about our current president?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Two pivotal Senate Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah – announced Thursday they would vote to subpoena witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, but it remained unclear whether there were enough votes for additional testimony.
Both were expected to join Democrats in voting to subpoena witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton, along with potential swing votes from GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
But Alexander said he would vote against witnesses.
“I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense," Alexander said.
'The Russians are coming': Moments from a busy day in Congress and the impeachment trial
The announcements turned all eyes on Murkowski, who told reporters she is still weighing her options.
“I am going to go reflect on what I have heard, re-read my notes and decide whether I need to hear more," she said.
Because a majority of the Senate sets policy in the trial, the 47 Senate Democrats need at least four of the 53 Republicans to support subpoenas to summon witnesses or documents, as House managers have urged.
The Senate is expected to vote Friday on subpoenas. A motion to subpoena a witness would fail on a 50-50 tie. It's not clear whether Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding, would break the tie.
Alexander, Collins, Murkowski and Romney were among a handful of Republican senators who kept open the possibility of calling witnesses as House Democrats, who prosecuted the case, and Trump's defense team each presented three days of opening arguments. Senators posed written questions for both sides during eight-sessions Wednesday and Thursday.
Bolton's offer became more urgent after the New York Times reported that his pending book described Trump telling his aide that he suspended $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine under the condition of investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
But Trump has denied telling Bolton that the Ukraine aid was tied to investigations. He also suggested he might fight to block Bolton's testimony under executive privilege, to protect the confidentiality of advice from top aides.
Collins said she would support witnesses and said that if they are approved, House managers and Trump's defense team should agree on a limited number for each side. The Senate could then vote on the precise number, she said.
"I believe hearing from certain witnesses would give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity," Collins said. "Therefore, I will vote in support of the motion to allow witnesses and documents to be subpoenaed. "

Murkowski offered a hint about her thinking when she asked Trump's defense team Thursday why the Senate shouldn't call Bolton.
"This dispute about material facts weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses with direct knowledge," Murkowski said in the written question, read by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, warned that agreeing to call additional witnesses would establish new standards for impeachment, if the House can send "half-baked" cases and leave the Senate to complete the investigation. Philbin also said Bolton hadn't confirmed the newspaper report.
“It will do grave damage to this body as an institution to say that the proceedings in the House don’t have to really be complete," Philbin said. “That’s not the way the way that his chamber should allow impeachments to be presented to it. "
The clash over witnesses has been contentious throughout the trial. As the trial opened, the Senate rejected Democratic proposals for witnesses in a series of party-line votes, but held out the prospect for more votes after arguments and questions were done.
House managers led by Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said the trial wouldn't be fair without compelling witnesses who refused to testify during the impeachment inquiry, including Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.
Schiff argued that the House couldn't wait for courts to enforce subpoenas because an appeals decision is still pending for former White House counsel Don McGahn, while Trump represents a threat to the 2020 election.
“He will not be acquitted,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , told reporters Thursday about Trump. “You cannot be acquitted if you don’t have a trial. And you don’t have a trial if you don’t have witnesses and documentation. ”
But Trump’s defense team said the House should have summoned witnesses and fought in court to enforce subpoenas. Jay Sekulow, another defense lawyer, argued that no witnesses were needed because the House managers said they already had overwhelming evidence to prove their case.
But Sekulow said Trump's team would want to call its own witnesses if any were allowed. Sekulow said he would like to call Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry.
Trump's lawyers said the trial could last months longer if senators open the door to witnesses. But Schiff suggested that witnesses could be deposed within a week and that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could quickly resolve disputes over which witnesses are relevant and which deserve executive privilege.

Trump's bogus case against impeachment witnesses: No national security secrets are at risk

Texto completo: When it comes to blocking witnesses from testifying and keeping evidence out of the public view, President Donald Trump and his defense team have used every tool they’ve got. One of their top rationales is national security.
According to this line of argument, which is meant to scare Senate Republicans out of caving, allowing testimony from witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton could jeopardize national security. Trump himself argued last week that Bolton’s testimony posed a national security risk.
“He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it’s not very positive?” Trump said. The president also added that Bolton’s departure in September wasn’t exactly amicable, “so you don’t like people testifying when they didn’t leave on good terms. ”
And that was before the New York Times obtained a description of Bolton’s book and reported that Trump told Bolton directly that he wanted Ukraine military aid withheld unless Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced investigations into political opponents, including the Bidens.
An upcoming challenge
The Senate is scheduled to vote as early as Friday on whether to call witnesses, a reckoning Trump is desperate to head off. His defense team and Senate allies have floated various options to avoid it, including forcing Bolton to testify in a classified setting, ensuring the public doesn’t get to hear what he has to say. But of course, now everyone has a very good idea of what he might say, and it’s not positive for the president. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. , suggested that in lieu of Bolton testifying, senators should be allowed to read his manuscript in a classified setting. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the idea absurd.
A secret plot: Trump is being impeached over an extortion scheme, not a 'policy dispute'
With the vote on witnesses fast approaching, the White House has also claimed that Bolton’s book contains “significant amounts of classified information,” an assertion Bolton disputes. The White House has warned Bolton’s lawyers that the book can’t be published until this information is removed. The memoir, “The Room Where It Happened,” is scheduled to come out March 17.
Trump’s lawyers have repeatedly claimed that executive privilege protects all presidential conversations about national security matters from congressional scrutiny. Advisers are “absolutely immune from compelled testimony before Congress,” especially on matters of “foreign relations and national security,” they wrote in a Jan. 18 response to the articles of impeachment.
Under this logic, any presidential action related to national security or foreign policy would essentially be shielded from impeachment, creating a presidential immunity the Founders never intended. As George Washington and his advisers made clear: Executive privilege claims mostly go out the window in the impeachment context.
And to the extent where actual secret items (nuclear codes, foreign asset identities) could be at risk, then that is a good argument for protective measures like redactions or accessing information in a closed session or a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (a secure room), rather than the White House’s blanket refusal to provide any testimony or documents to Congress. As for Trump and his conversation with Bolton about Ukraine aid, former U. S. Attorney Barbara McQuade argues that the president waived his executive privilege when he tweeted that Bolton was lying.
We already know Trump's secrets
Setting aside the legal and historical precedents and arguments, it is also important to acknowledge this: There are no national security secrets at risk here. The building blocks of the Ukraine story — and the impeachment articles — are already known. The most important piece of evidence was made public by the White House in November: the record of Trump’s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president.
It is right there for all to see that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, and thereby invited a foreign country to interfere in the upcoming election. Trump’s request set off so many alarm bells that National Security Council staffers sought the advice of White House lawyers about what to do. It also prompted an intelligence official to share his or her concerns with a colleague, who passed them on to CIA General Counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood.
Elwood found these concerns reasonable and serious enough to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department. That same intelligence official eventually filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector general, who tried to pass it on to Congress, as required by law, before being stopped by the Justice Department in consultation with the White House.
No Daniel Webster: On impeachment: Jay Sekulow bumbles the John Bolton witness question
In addition to the phone record, we now have hours of testimony from key witnesses that tie Trump’s request of Zelensky to a months-long pressure campaign that included removing the U. S. ambassador to Ukraine to appease corrupt Ukrainian actors, as well as withholding high-level U. S. meetings and almost $400 million in military assistance.
The only missing pieces of the puzzle are what the principal actors — men like Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry — said and did throughout the summer to try to appease Trump’s corrupt request as well as manage the fallout on Capitol Hill and within the U. S. government.
It’s true, having them testify could reveal how little they think of the president. That in and of itself might be a national secret, but it's probably one the public should know before it votes again in November.

Texto completo: Connections " between couples, parents and children, neighbors, friends and siblings (both blood relatives and those with a non-biological kinship) " is the theme of this year's Oscar-nominated short films. There's never really an intentional, or even unconscious theme to these things, but when you sit down to watch more than five hours of them in a row, a mood " an atmosphere, a leitmotif, a tone of voice that echoes from film to film " sometimes starts to emerge.
If, as a recent 'Saturday Night Live' sketch joked, white male rage is the common denominator in many of this year's feature nominees, then family " the kind you're born into and the kind you make " is the hallmark of the shorts.
As they do every year, area theaters will present three separate programs of the Oscar-nominated shorts: animated, live action and documentary. In addition to the commercial run, the National Archives will also offer its annual free screenings of all nominated shorts in its William C. McGowan Theater (use the special events entrance on Constitution Avenue at Seventh Street NW). Doors for the Archives' ever-popular presentations open 45 minutes before start time. Reservations can be made by calling 202-357-6814 or visiting archivesfoundation.org/events . The schedule is as follows:
Live action: Feb. 8 at noon.
Animated: Feb. 8 at 3:30 p.m.
Documentary: Feb. 9 at 11 a.m.
Here are this year's nominees, with our prediction about which film will win.


Live action Two of the live-action shorts share a weird synergy: 'Brotherhood' and 'Nefta Football Club' center on brothers in Tunisia. In the first film, the eldest of several Tunisian brothers returns home from Syria, where his family suspects he had run off to join ISIS (the film's title is also a play on the Muslim Brotherhood). The tension with the young man's father, who looks especially askance at his son's teenage, niqab-wearing bride, is palpable, leading to a shocking choice. 'Nefta' has a much lighter twist, and it concerns two boys who face a hard decision after they come across a headphone-wearing donkey carrying several bags filled with white powder. Don't worry: It's a comedy.
Inspired by the true story of a Guatemalan orphanage where, in 2017, 41 children perished in a fire, 'Saria' focuses on the friendship between two of those girls. 'The Neighbor's Window' is more fanciful, and it concerns the connections between the residents of two apartments with facing windows. Although it involves voyeurism of a sort, it's no 'Rear Window.' Rather, it's a story of a touchingly unexpected commonality that can be discovered by complete strangers.

Our pick: Commonality is also the theme of the Belgian thriller 'A Sister,' in which two women " one in jeopardy and the other working in an emergency-services call center " are, for the film's taut, 16 minutes, tethered by a nerve-racking phone connection.
Unrated. At area theaters. Contains mature thematic material, drugs, nudity, sex, mistreatment of children and coarse language. 104 minutes.


Animated Stop-motion puppetry is in full effect this year, with three of the five nominees " 'Sister,' 'Daughter' and 'Memorable' " utilizing the labor-intensive animation technique. It's put into especially effective service in poignant stories about, respectively, China's one-child policy, the legacy of an emotionally distant parent and an elderly married couple struggling with the dementia of the husband, a painter.
As for the other two candidates: 'Hair Love' is a bittersweet charmer about an African American father struggling to tame his little girl's unruly locks; and 'Kitbull' " from SparkShorts, a low-budget incubator under the Pixar umbrella " tells the story of a tentative relationship between a feral kitten and a pit bull who can't hack the dogfighting ring.

'Kitbull' has a hand-drawn look that belies the slick style more commonly associated with its parent studio, not to mention a fairly sobering subject. But despite the mainstream appeal of its central story " one of interspecies animal friendship " it doesn't pack quite the emotional, visual or storytelling wallop of the stop-motion offerings. (In addition to the five nominees, Landmark's animation showcase will, as always, mix in a few films that weren't nominated to pad out the program. One of them, 'Henrietta Bulkowski,' a stop-motion tale of a hunchbacked woman who dreams of becoming a pilot, features the voices of Chris Cooper and Ann Dowd. It's not up for an Oscar, but it's a delight.)
Our pick: 'Sister,' from Chinese-born, Los Angeles-based Siqi Song, who tells a story of phantom longing, using felted wool dolls and a de-saturated, almost black-and-white color palette.
Unrated. At area theaters. Contains some mature thematic material and brief strong language. 85 minutes.


Documentary This year's nonfiction shorts run the gamut from the feel-good 'Walk Run Cha-Cha,' a lovely story of a Vietnamese immigrant couple for whom dancing is more than exercise or entertainment (made under the auspices of the New York Times's acclaimed Op-Docs program), to the feel-very-very-bad. 'In the Absence' tells the story, in excruciating, ticktock fashion, of a 2014 ferry accident off the coast of South Korea that killed more than 300 passengers because of a chain of official incompetence.
Two of the nominees fall somewhere between those extremes: 'Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone (If You're a Girl)' profiles the Kabul outpost of Skateistan, an international nonprofit organization that offers formal schooling and skateboarding lessons in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa. 'St. Louis Superman' is a portrait of Bruce Franks Jr., a Missouri battle rapper who ran for the state legislature " and won " after being spurred to activism by the epidemic of gun violence in his titular hometown, one instance of which hit, sadly, very close to home. Both films balance inspirational messages with gritty realism about life and death.

Our pick: Ever heard of resignation syndrome? Neither had I, before 'Life Overtakes Me.' This utterly fascinating Netflix film looks at several immigrant families seeking asylum in Sweden, where the condition " a medical mystery also known as traumatic withdrawal syndrome " has affected hundreds of children, putting them into a sleeplike, catatonic state for months, most likely because of the stress and uncertainty of being in migrant limbo. It's a mesmerizing, deeply unsettling and ultimately hopeful gem of nonfiction storytelling.
Unrated. At area theaters. Contains mature thematic material and some coarse language. 160 minutes.

Pompeo on high-risk, high-reward trip to Ukraine as Trump's trial continues

Texto completo: Secretary of state is likely to face questions as impeachment vote looms
KYIV, Ukraine " Secretary of State Mike Pompeo returned to the country at the epicenter of President Trump's impeachment trial Thursday in a visit to Ukraine that presents both risks and opportunities for an administration eager to prove the president's innocence.
As lawmakers in Washington deliberate Trump's fate, Pompeo will be feted by a parade of senior Ukrainian officials desperate to project unity with an administration it relies on for military support against pro-Russian separatists.
When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears with Pompeo before cameras on Friday, White House officials hope the former comedian will reiterate a message that has become central to Trump's defense: The president never pressured Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rivals.
By simply repeating that line, Zelensky will be giving Pompeo a valuable deliverable at a time when some Senate Republicans are expressing unease about the impeachment process and pushing for witnesses to appear before the upper chamber.
A top aide to Zelensky who is angling to become his new chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has urged his boss to embrace a pro-Trump line for the sake of his embattled country, according to diplomats familiar with the deliberations.
'From the Ukrainian point of view, they just want a joint presser with the secretary of state saying the U.S. supports Ukraine in its war with Russia,' said Angela Stent, a Europe and Russia scholar at Georgetown University. 'I'm sure Zelensky will also say what he's said before: He didn't feel pressured to investigate the Bidens.'
But the visit also presents risks for Pompeo, the president's closest adviser, who continues to face criticism inside and outside the State Department for overseeing the ouster of the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.
Before landing in Kyiv, the capital, Pompeo told reporters his message to U.S. diplomats in Ukraine will be to 'tell them how much we love them, appreciate them, appreciate their family members and their sacrifice.'
'Talk about the important work that the United States and Ukraine will continue to do together to fight corruption inside of that country,' he said aboard his plane Wednesday.
The nation's top diplomat will be setting foot in the U.S. Embassy on Friday, home to some officials who expressed concern and alarm at the halt of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine last year, the lack of a White House meeting for Zelensky and alleged repeated efforts to force Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.
David Holmes, a senior diplomat at the embassy, testified in November that he overheard Trump on a phone call inquiring about the Biden investigations in an account that Trump publicly denied. Holmes also corroborated other officials' claims that a White House meeting with Trump was contingent on a Ukraine investigation into Biden and the Ukrainian energy company his son used to work for. It 'was made clear that some action on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office meeting,' Holmes said.
It is unclear whether Pompeo will interact with Holmes during his embassy visit, but he is expected to hold a closed-door question-and-answer session with diplomats there.
One prominent impeachment witness who won't be present is William B. Taylor Jr., the former top diplomat to Kyiv who stepped down earlier this month. Taylor sharply criticized the Trump administration's Ukraine policy last year as 'crazy' and extortionate, and he hasn't gone into retirement quietly. He took direct aim at Pompeo in a New York Times column Sunday for purportedly asking a reporter if she thinks any Americans 'care' about Ukraine.
'The answer should be yes,' Taylor wrote. 'Ukraine is defending itself and the West against Russian attack. If Ukraine succeeds, we succeed.'
Besides confronting his own diplomats, Pompeo is likely to face questions from reporters about Ukraine " a topic that has elicited angry responses from him and even controversy.
Last week, Pompeo allegedly lashed out at NPR host Mary Louise Kelly in an expletive-fueled off-microphone rant after an interview in which she questioned his role in Trump's Ukraine policy. In particular, Kelly asked if Pompeo owed Yovanovitch an apology for failing to defend her when the president pushed her out.
'He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine,' Kelly later said. 'He asked, 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?' He used the f-word in that sentence and many others.'
Yovanovitch, a career diplomat respected within the department, accused Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani of waging a smear campaign against her because her anti-corruption efforts threatened the business interests of Giuliani's clients.
After his NPR interview, Pompeo issued a statement accusing Kelly of lying about what topics the interview would include and breaking a promise to keep the 'post-interview conversation off the record.'
On the plane, Pompeo didn't deny asking her about whether Americans care about Ukraine, but he pushed back at the idea that he thought they did not. 'Of course the American people care about the people of Ukraine,' he said.
Kelly said she notified Pompeo's staff that she would ask questions about Ukraine, a claim subsequently corroborated in emails between Kelly and his staff, and said she never agreed to have the post-interview conversation off the record.
The dust-up continued into this week when the State Department barred another NPR reporter, Michele Kelemen, from traveling with Pompeo on his trip. Pompeo told reporters on his plane that he did Kelly 'the favor of granting her an interview,' but suggested she did not conduct it 'straight down the middle.'
Whether Pompeo can avoid another blowup with reporters during his stay is unclear. But his Ukrainian counterparts are likely to be compliant and welcoming, said Andrew Weiss, a Russia scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
'The Ukrainians are in a horrible position,' Weiss said. 'They have zero interest in directly antagonizing the Trump administration and, like the rest of the world, have to deal with the U.S. government that's in place.'

Wrapping Up Impeachment; House answers to Senate questions show why it's time to end this trial.

Texto completo: The Senate will acquit President Trump on both House articles of impeachment. That much even Adam Schiff knows. The Senate trial is now all about the election and impeachment precedents, which are two of many good reasons for cleaning up the trial distortions and wrapping up the show this week.
Start with the media claim that defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz said a President can do anything to further his re-election as long he thinks it is in the national interest. This isn't what he said. The Harvard professor said explicitly that a President can be impeached for criminal acts. He could be impeached for soliciting a financial bribe, for example, or seeking a campaign contribution from a foreign source. He could also be impeached for exceeding his constitutional authority.
Mr. Dershowitz differs from the press in believing that a President cannot be impeached for acts of foreign policy that may be in his personal political interest but aren't themselves impeachable acts. Presidents conduct foreign policy in what they think is the national interest, but they also hope it will be in their political interest. Presidents typically act from "mixed motives," as Mr. Dershowitz put it, that are difficult to discern or to separate the high-minded from the self-interested.
It is thus too low a constitutional bar for the House to claim, as it does, that Mr. Trump can be impeached because Democrats think his motives were corrupt. The acts themselves must qualify as "high crimes and misdemeanors." Mr. Trump's acts don't qualify—because asking aid recipients to investigate corruption isn't illegal, and in any case the aid to Ukraine was delivered on time and no investigation of Joe Biden was started. This does not condone Mr. Trump's request, which was reckless and dumb, but it isn't an impeachable offense.
GOP Senator Susan Collins exposed another distortion when she asked House managers if Mr. Trump broke any law, and if so why they didn't include specific bribery and honest-services fraud statutes in the impeachment articles. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries dodged the statute issue by suggesting that the "abuse of power" article somehow encompassed these crimes. Mr. Schiff added that "we outlined the facts that constitute bribery in the article, but 'abuse of power' is the highest crime."
But acts are either crimes or not. The House can't have implied articles of impeachment, or sleeper articles that you see if you read between the lines. The President can't be expected to defend himself against charges the House didn't include.
The real reason House managers didn't include bribery or honest-services fraud is because they know Mr. Trump's acts would not qualify under the Supreme Court's definition of those crimes. The Court requires a specific kind of quid pro quo that didn't take place. So the managers settled for the vague and subjective "abuse of power," which turns out to be whatever the House managers say it is.
Another abuse is Mr. Schiff's offer to abide by any ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts on evidence and witnesses if the President's lawyers do the same. Mr. Schiff wants the President's lawyers to cede claims of executive privilege when he knows the Chief Justice has no judicial authority in the trial.
The Chief is in the Senate as the presiding officer, not as an Article III judge. The Senate can delegate certain trial powers to him if it wants, but it can't give him more power than the Senate has. And the Senate does not have the power to deny a President's claims of executive privilege.
Which brings us to the issue of witnesses—especially whether to subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton. Democrats claim to want witnesses, but they don't if it means calling Hunter or Joe Biden. They want Republicans to vote to end the trial without witnesses so they and the impeachment press can cry "coverup" from here to the election.
Our view is that whatever Mr. Bolton has to say won't change the outcome of the trial. The New York Times report of what is in the draft of Mr. Bolton's book doesn't include impeachable offenses. Mr. Bolton's account of Mr. Trump's behavior may be highly critical, but that is something for voters to assess and render a verdict on in November.
The country will be best served now if the Senate ends the trial promptly without witnesses and with a vote to acquit. The verdict would repudiate a House impeachment that has violated constitutional norms and distorted the separation of powers.

Texto completo: In a most unusual endorsement, the New York Times has endorsed both Senators Elizabeth Warren (MA) and Amy Klobuchar (MN) for the Democratic nomination for President. Apparently, the Editorial Board of the Times disagrees with Senator Bernie Sanders (VT), who allegedly told Warren that a woman could not win the Presidency. I'd love to see the right woman in the White House, but I've been among the many who have wondered openly if, in a polarized and sexist United States, a woman can win both the nomination and the Presidency.
Though polls are not a definitive measure of who will win an election, Warren and Klobuchar tend to poll more weakly than the men in the race - Vice President Biden, Sanders, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Have we come such a long way since 2016 that a woman is electable? Can so-called progressive men who want to get 45 out of the White House overcome their gender bias to vote for a woman?
Clearly, the Times not only thinks a woman can win, but in endorsing two women for the Democratic nomination, they are saying that women are the best of the Democrats in the race. And, in the past two years, we've seen signs that women are gaining politically. The women's sweep of the 2018 elections certainly bodes well for women. At the same time, is gender a sufficient qualification for the Presidency? Three years after the first flawed but overwhelmingly successffil Women's March in 2017, the realignment of the March "movement" has illustrated cracks in the foundations of feminism.
These flaws perhaps go back to the scuffle over who should get the vote first between our nation's first feminists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and civil rights activists like Frederick Douglass. In resenting the fact that Black men got the vote before white women, those early feminists used extremely disparaging language against Black men, using terms like "savage" to suggest these men did not deserve to vote.
Can anybody say "intersectionality"? Or to make it more clear, use the words of Sojourner Truth and say, "Ain't I A Woman." The women's march movement fell apart because women were not on the same page. Accusations against Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, two of the co-chairs of the March caused much discussion and rancor, so much so that the second Women's March attracted a fraction of the people who showed up to the first one. And the third March was operated on s different model. It did not equal the excitement or momentum of the first March, although there were many more local marches and other activities associated with the marches.
Women can't "come together" unless they acknowledge our differences, as well as our similarities. Thanks to Tarana Burke and folks like Professor Kimberly Crenshaw, some Black women are openly addressing issues of race and class in feminism. But I've heard few white women, either politicians or intellectuals, deal with issues of racism in the women's movement. Is there really "a women's movement"? There are women's issues, and women's marches, and an exhilarating display of anti-Trump sentiment three years ago (don't forget that 53 percent of white women voted for that man), but when do women come together?
In other words, gender is not a qualification for higher office. And if the women endorsed by the New York Times do not fully explore the concept of intersectionality and speak on it, they will likely sideline some votes, even though many others would vote for Bubba the Fool to get rid of 45. Both Warren and Klobuchar are exciting candidates. Warren's progressive ideas endear her to the left, and Klobuchar's more moderate approach to social and economic challenges appeals to others. The Times did a good job of contrasting the two women.
But can either win the Presidency? When then one-term Senator Barack Obama ran for President, l liked him very much but didn't think a Black man could succeed in this racist nation. Thankfully, I was wrong. Can a woman win in 2020? I'm hoping the best candidate will win, and the best candidate may well be a woman.

BOOKS
EMMA COPLEY EISENBERG'S short stories and essays have been published in most of the places you'd expect to find a literary rising star: McSweeney's, Tin House, The Paris Review, etc.
But now comes the moment of truth, a debut book, 300 pages, a major publisher and a review iri The New York Times.
Originally from New York, Eisenberg moved to the area in 2005, matriculating at Haverford College. In her newly released true crime-memoir hybrid, "The Third Rainbow Girl: The Long Life of a Double Murder in Appalachia," she refers to her Main Line alma mater as "my liberal arts college outside of Philadelphia, (where) I destroyed every God - religion, literature, politics, feminism, art - with my self-important words, dismissing each as problematic and essentially worthless."
Now, some 10 years after graduation, Eisenberg's writing has obviously evolved. The Times called her debut "evocative and elegantly paced," and that constitutes just a fraction of the praise heaped.
Maybe that's why there was such a healthy crowd on hand for Eisenberg's conversation with journalist and podcaster Sarah Marshall at the main branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia on Jan. 23. It could also be because Eisenberg is a prominent literary figure in town - she's the founder of the Blue Stoop writers' collective, a nonprofit that bills itself as "a home for Philly writers."
The memoir part of the book chronicles Eisenberg's move to, and years-long residency in, remote Pocahontas County, West Virginia, a part of Appalachia that's become fashionable to write about again - see, most notably, J.D. Vance's "Hillbilly Elegy" and the response it spawned.
Agrande esta imagen.

Eisenberg was careful not to treat Pocahontas County in any way that would recall Vance's treatment of Appalachia, which was, she said, "received really negatively by people. The feeling was that it was really untrue, both on a factual and an emotional level."
Pocahontas County was the site of an unsolved double murder in 1980. Three young women had traveled from out of state for a music and nature festival called the Rainbow Gathering. They never made it. Two of the women were murdered; the third lived but somehow disappeared from the scene. In the intervening years, there was an overturned conviction and leads that came to dead ends. The case turned cold, languishing for years, casting a pall over the community, sowing distrust between neighbors and exposing the roots of that region's historical sociocultural sensitivities.
The one thing Eisenberg didn't want to do was exploit the fissures in that community for her own benefit or to aid in the salaciousness of the book. She acknowledged that writing about real people and a real community comes with a burden of responsibility that doesn't complicate fiction writing.
"It is a really overwhelming and huge responsibility," Eisenberg said. "And there are moments where that feels heavy, and others where that feels really beautiful and important.
"No journalist is a clear pane of glass," she continued. "Everyone has their own biases and flaws and, if anything, I try to make those very clear throughout the book."

Eisenberg spent years reinvestigating the crimes and unpacking the region's social pathology. She took a regular job there, in a restaurant. She made friends her own age. And for being a writer who, given the nature of her work, had to keep some distance, especially emotionally, she said she almost felt like part of the community.
Almost.
"I did feel very taken in and very connected and very passionate about that community and certainly very welcomed," she said, but there was hesitation in front of that answer.
While Eisenberg said she isn't an observant Jew, she noted that being Jewish is very much a part of her identity, one that becomes stronger when in a place where there aren't a lot of other Jews around.
"I was definitely more aware of being a Jew than I was in other spaces, just because I grew up in New York, which was like Jew central, and then Haverford was heavily Jewish as well," Eisenberg said. "You definitely become more aware of your identity when you're in places where it's less common."
There were fish-out-of-water moments, she said.
"People would talk about Easter, and I'd be like, 'Which one is that again? Is that when he rose or he died?"' Eisenberg recalled, laughing. "It was definitely very interesting being a Jew in Appalachia. Many folks I interacted with had never met a Jew before." *

TV Host, Hollywood Fashion Maven Gene London Dies at 88

Texto completo: Headnote OBITUARY
GENE LONDON WON the livelihood lottery: He found a job where he could put his natural talents to use and live out his dreams - twice.
Over 60 years, London, who died at 88 on Jan. 19 at his home in Reading, lived a professional life in two acts.
London was best known locally as the anecdotally inclined and artistically talented host of "Cartoon Corners" (later known as "The Gene London Show"), the Saturday morning childrens television show that aired from 1959 to 1977 on local CBS affiliate WCAU.
In his second career, London became an historian of studio-era Hollywood, a designer, a retailer, a collector and a curator.
His sense of childlike wonderment, family says, drew him to the fashions and costumes worn by the biggest stars of old Hollywood. Along the way, he amassed a collection of clothing from that period that included around 60,000 pieces, many originally worn by stars like Joan Crawford, with whom he'd later come to have a personal friendship.
Agrande esta imagen.

In a 1993 profile, London told The New York Times that Crawford used to phone him late at night when she was "high on hootch."
Born Eugene Yulish, London got his love for show business and classical Hollywood from his mother, who used to take him to the movies in Cleveland, Ohio, his hometown.
Early in his TV career, London played Reject the Robot on the DuMont Network's "Johnny Jupiter," where, according to niece Sheri Brenner, he received more fan mail than any of the actors playing human characters.
A lucky break came in the form of recurring guest spots on the original "Today Show with Dave Garroway." It would be Garroway who'd introduce London to the TV executive who'd cast him in "Cartoon Corners."
From what friends and fans recall, over the next 30 years, London's show was like Philadelphia's version of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," balancing animated entertainment while serving as a live-action vehicle for London's singing, drawing and storytelling.
"He was the greatest storyteller most people have ever known," Brenner said, "and he could take you on an adventure with him that, as a kid, you were just completely immersed in wonderment by."
"Wonderment" and "magic." These were the two words that Brenner and her daughter Jordyn, London's grandniece, used repeatedly to describe him; it's why, they say, he was able to "get" children so well - he never stopped being one of them.
"He was a child in his heart, always, and he never lost that sense of fun and adventure and wonder and gratitude," Brenner continued. "He was like that his whole life."
Nearly 57 years later, former child actor and longtime area musician Andy Kahn remembers performing on "The Gene London Show"; he's got the 1963 clipping from the Philadelphia Jewish Times to prove it.
"The show was intellectual, educational, entertaining, with music - the whole thing," Kahn recalled. "And (London) was very bright and very talented. I could recognize that at 11."
Kahn appeared on London's program twice in the summer of 1963 with fellow child actor Robin Goldberg.
"I remember the first time we were there, they said, 'Make sure you're well-rehearsed and know what you're doing because this is live television; you don't get a second chance.'"
Second chances might be rare while you're on live TV, but once you've signed offi improbable opportunities abound, at least if you're London. A fortuitous profile in The New York Times chronicling his penchant for collecting and design, just as he was about to transition away from television, kick-started London's fashion career.
He opened in a retail shop in Manhattan's Flatiron District and maintained a cavernous studio in Gramercy for his private collection. He dressed celebrities for the Academy Awards and provided wardrobe pieces for Broadway stars. For "Gone with the Wind's" 50th anniversary, Ted Turner commissioned him to design replicas of the gowns worn in the film.
This wasn't unusual; stars gravitated to London.
When he was on TV, Kirk Douglas or Lucille Ball might drop by the set for a guest appearance and, in New York, "on any given day, you might find Diana Ross stopping by to search for rare textiles," Brenner recalled.
His life often didn't outwardly resemble real life, but family insisted London's successes anchored him to the one simple lesson he imparted to thousands of kids and ultimately his own beloved nieces and nephews: Believe in yourself.
"He taught me how to draw; he taught me how to paint; he taught me color theory; he taught me how to do everything. He always saw what I could do, and he really pushed me to achieve what he knew I could achieve, even when I didn't know it yet," said Jordyn Brenner, London's grandniece, now an art director at Amazon Studios, who's worked on marketing campaigns for shows like "The Marvelous Mrs. Maiséi."
"All of my inspiration for all of our campaigns came from him."
London is survived by his spouse, John Thomas, brothers Charles and Morton Yulish, and numerous nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, including Sheri and Jordyn Brenner.
A public memorial in Philadelphia for friends and fans will be announced at a later date. *

An open letter to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL NEWS FOR SAN FRANCISCO
BROKE-ASS
STUART
BROKE-ASS CITY
Hey Marc! Broke-Ass Stuart here. I've been trying to connect with you for a little while by emailing your team and tweeting at you, but I've had no luck so far. I don't take it personally though. After all, I am the guy who wrote a viral article naming your new building "The Butt Plug." You seem like someone with a good sense of humor though, so I'll just chalk up the radio silence to you being really busy. I mean you do run Salesforce, a gazillion dollar company, after all.
Anyway, now that I've got your attention, I'd like to use this as an opportunity to invite you out for a drink. Hell, I'll even buy as long as we go to a dive bar where I can afford it. Now, I know what you're thinking: "Is this the most shameless and public attempt anyone has ever made to get a Sugar Daddy?" and the answer is "Yes, yes it is." But not in a sex-related way. I'd like to talk to you about becoming the Sugar Daddy for Bay Area independent journalism. I guess you could call it being a benefactor.
As you know, the media business model is utterly broken. Journalism is one of those very rare things whose intrinsic worth grows while its monetary value plummets. I could get into the specifics of it, but you're a smart man and I'm sure you understand the harrowing economic realities of this current moment. If not, I'll be happy to discuss it in more detail when we get a drink at Specs'.
Over the past few years we've seen countless publications shutter, and witnessed surviving newsrooms shed talent at frightening speeds. And I'm not just talking about the big publications, many of which whose parent companies felt that profit was superior to doing what's important. Local independent journalism has been hit even harder.
Since you're a San Francisco dude, I'm sure you remember the glory of picking up a San Francisco Bay Guardian and it being nearly as thick as a novel. Inside you'd find an investigative piece about whatever Willie Brown was up to, an interview with a modern luminary like Cornel West, a review of the latest Dave Eggers book, and a list of every amazing cultural event happening that week. It was incredible. Independent media used to be so strong here that SF even had two competing alt-weeklies up until only a few years ago. Now in 2020, there is one, SF Weekly, and we're lucky to have any publications around at all. The ones left are hanging on by their fingernails.
That's why when we get a drink at Benders, I'm going to pitch you the idea of starting an organization that funds local independent journalism.
What I'm proposing is a fund that distributes $1 million every year to local publications like Mission Local, 48 Hills, the San Francisco Public Press, BerkeleySide, and, of course, BrokeAssStuart.com. Hell, you could even throw in an important legacy newspaper like the Examiner for good measure.
I'm not sure you understand how far $1 million a year could go in the world of local media. That money can fund up to 20 full time journalists, which is a huge amount. To put things in perspective, most independent outlets only have one or two full-time people who juggle writing, editing, social media, biz dev, sales and 80 other things. Adding 20 full-time journalists to the Bay Area could revolutionize the amount of vitally important stories being told. Local journalism is as impactful to our lives as our local politics and since the Bay Area is on the fore-front of nearly every social crisis affecting our nation, the stories we tell here could help shine light on how to make change everywhere.
Plus, you wouldn't even need to fund it all yourself. I'm sure you could get a couple other billionaire buddies to kick in. I know that you understand the importance of journalism, you did buy Time Magazine for $190 million. At that rate you could fund Bay Area journalism for the next 190 years!
In your recent New York Times op-ed titled "We Need a New Capitalism," I appreciate the fact that you called out your fellow billionaires. I call them out all the time but for some reason they don't listen to a guy named "Broke-Ass Stuart." While I think the existence of billionaires is a flaw in the system, not the ultimate reward, I dig the fact that you believe people like yourself should be paying more taxes.
In the article, you go on to say that "profits are important, but so is society." My question to you is, "What better reflection of society is there than a healthy, thriving culture of journalism?"
I guess we can discuss it when we grab a drink at The Stud.
Looking forward to hearing back from you!
Smooches!

WBGO JAZZ RADIO BEING PETITIONED

Texto completo: Headnote JAZZ NOTES
Since the explosive op-ed by Ronald S. Glover "Is there a Blackout at WBGO?" was printed in the Star Ledger on Nov. 19, the executive staff at the all jazz radio station has yet to respond. "The petition is a good way to go," said Glover. "The folks at WBGO are voiceless now but we are looking for a change and new leadership at the station."
Deborah Smith Gregory, president of the NAACR Newark branch, wrote a letter dated Dec. 13 to the WBGO Board ofTmstees, Community Advisory Board and the CEO. The letter, which was shared with this writer, expressed concern over management and the governing body of WBGO's lack of public response to the op-ed allegations which were published nearly a month ago. The letter also emphasized four points of concern they would like to see addressed. As of my last conversation with attorney and friend ofWBGO Alice Griffin there still hasn't been any response from station executives.
When a reporter from the New York Times recently reached out to the WBGO chairman of the Board for an interview, it was declined until after an upcoming board meeting, as Griffin informed this writer.
A WBGO Board meeting on Jan. 27 was postponed until the internal investigation of all allegations are completed by attorney Shontae Gray. A friend ofWBGO taking an educated guess says the investigation should be in its final stages
"What has amazed me is there hasn't been a public response since November 19," said former WBGO announcer Bill Daughtry (retired in 2019). "Everything is all true. When I retired most of it was whispers; it was the non-invitations that broke the camel's back. It is the on-air staff holding that station together."
Two excepts from Glover's piece in the Star Ledger (Nov. 19,1920), the proverbial straw, "I am a contributing member to the station and was recently caught unaware ofWBGO s 40th Anniversary Gala, on Nov. 6. Apparently, however, I was not the only one who was slighted. Alexandra Hill, WBGO news anchor, reporter, and producer of'Newark Today,' was also intentionally 'uninvited' or excluded from the $1,200/ticket event. Other on-air hosts and selected staff were invited to participate in tlfis historical moment, but not Ms. Hill and several other Black staffers.
"Currently, only five of the 15 members of WBGO's Board of Trustees are people of color or women. The rest of the board is comprised of white men who, quite notably, have no cultural heritage or links to the city of Newark. Equally alarming, the senior management of the station is composed of white men and women, and their signature program, 'Jazz Night in America' is run and operated by an all-white staff." (These excepts have been edited down due to space; for the complete piece please visit https://www.nj.com/opirffon/2019/ll/isthere-a-blackout-at-wbgo-opinion.html).
The current petition that is being circulated online is in solidarity with Glover's piece and reflects The Friends of WBGO's dissatisfaction with the current situation.
The Friends ofWBGO are jazz musicians, music educators, aficionados and appreciators, a worldwide family of dedicated supporters of jazz and WBGO, in particular; some have supported WBGO since its inception in 1979.
It states, "Specifically, this petition is occasioned by [our] receipt of the following information:
we have become aware of a culture of exclusion at WBGO; specifically, the absence of minority employees from managerial and other leadership positions;
we understand that the people of Newark, New Jersey ('Newark'), the home ofWBGO, are unwelcome on WBGO's premises;
we are dismayed that the musical outreach programs for the children of Newark and its environs is defunct and discontinued;
we are indignant that relief facilities ('Relief Facilities') for employees of and visitors to WBGO have not been repaired or renovated after severe flood damage years ago despite WBGO's receipt of insurance proceeds to remedy the problem. Relief Facilities have broken and missing fixtures both known and unaddressed by WBGO management despite numerous complaints."
To read the complete petition and sign please visit https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/jazz-loversplease-help-fix-wbgo.
Griffin wrote the petition and began its online circulation. "This is not a local issue-it extends beyond New Jersey to international listeners," stated Griffin. "There is a momentum happening with the petition, tiffs is about standing up."
Some of the signee comments are very revealing: "I have been a friend and supporter for many years. I served on CAB a number of times and was its chair for about three. I stopped my support after hearing from Cephas Bowles, when he was at home dying of cancer, on the treatment he received by the Board and new president ofWBGO. He was profoundly hurt by the way he was treated. He devoted many years to WBGO. I was appalled at how poorly he was treated and 'discarded.' I did not want to contribute to an organization that could treat a special human being so poorly. After a fewyears I recently resumed my contribution out of a sense of duty to continue to help perpetuate jazz."
Another commented, "WBGO is a valuable resource that deserves to be respected and enriched. Please do what is needed to fix these many problems."
And this anonymous signee wrote, "Unfortunately, I had an unpleasant experience with Amy Niles and have chosen not to renew my membership."
NEA jazz master and longtime WBGO employee Dorthaan Kirie, who played a significant role in making WBGO the great jazz station it is today, noted, "I watched its growth over the years and although I have a new life and career WBGO is always going to be part of me. So I will do whatever I can do to make sure it is the best in the world."

Texto completo: Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. was poised to run for New York City mayor in the 2021 city elections. However, he dropped a bomb earlier this week when he announced that he's not only dropping out of the race but is also retiring from politics after 22 years.
Diaz, 46, made the announcement in The New York Times during an interview saying that he wants to spend more time with his family. He will not seek any other political oftice once his term as borough president ends in 2021.
"You miss out on a lot," he said during the interview. "I want to hang out with them [his children] more. I haven't seen my youngest [Ryan], I've seen him three days in over the last 380 days, Ruben lives in the West Bronx and I see Ruben every other week? He lives right here."
Diaz was referring to his youngest son Ryan, who is in the military serving in Germany, and his oldest son Ruben.
In a letter he referred the AmNews to about his announcement that was sent to supporters, Diaz said that it was "time for a change" after serving two decades as a public servant.
"This decision is final, and no length of additional time will change that," he said. "Many New Yorkers have committed to support my future in numerous ways, and making this announcement now gives them enough time to make different plans."
Raising a reported $94,000, Diaz was in a somewhat crowded pool of other mayoral hopefuls including Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, City Comptroller Scott Stringer and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who all raised more.
Reports indicate Diaz plans to return all of the political donations he received.
Diaz was first elected to political office in 1997 at age 23 when he was elected to the New York State Assembly, making him one of the youngest people ever elected to the governing body. He is the son of current City Council Member and former State Sen. Ruben Diaz Sr.
During his time in office, he was an advocate and organizer for the family of Amadou Diallo in 1999 when Diallo was fatally shot by the NYPD in the Bronx. After he led a citywide march, Diaz's involvement made him a household name in city politics.
In 2009, then-president Barack Obama selected then-Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. to serve as director of the White House Office on Urban Affairs. A special election was held and Diaz entered the race winning 87% percent of the vote. He ran again in 2017 winning 86% of the vote in the Democratic Primary.
If he were to be elected, Diaz, a Puerto Rican, would have been New York's first Latino mayor. The Latino population accounts for 2.5 million of the city, at just under 30%.
"Throughout this journey, I have been honored and humbled by the support so many have shown to me," Diaz said. "That confidence has always guided my efforts to effect positive change for the Bronx, our city and our nation. To those who have supported me in that work, and who were excited to support my future, I thank you from the bottom of my heart."

Before Rosa Parks there was Ellen Garrison Jackson

Texto completo: In her opinion piece in the New York Times on the film "Little Women," Kaitlyn Greenidge evoked Ellen Garrison Jackson, a Black girl coming of age in Concord, Mass., whom she contrasted with the white girls in "Little Women." She pointed out that like Louisa May Alcott, the author of the novel on which the film is based, Ellen was the product of a family of socially committed activists.
Ellen would join several other activists in 1866 in the filing of petitions against discrimination in public transportation nearly a century before Rosa Parks and the emergence of the Montgomery Improvement Association. Of course, all of this was new to me and I began to inquire into her life and contributions, which was well-documented in the archives and newspapers in Concord.
Born Ellen Garrison in 1823 in Concord, her father, Jack Garrison, escaped slavery in New Jersey. Her mother, Susan Robbins Garrison, was the daughter of Caesar Robbins, a Revolutionary War veteran. He was a skilled farmer and laborer.
Ellen attended Concord's public schools, and, like her siblings, was a bright and intelligent student. She grew up amid a progressively active household where her parents often hosted a number of notable abolitionists. Among the visitors were Angelina and Sarah Grimke, and her mother and the sisters founded the Ladies' Antislavery Society of Concord. In 1838, Ellen and her mother's name were listed among 200 other Concord women on a petition protesting the government's treatment of the Cherokee.
Three years earlier, Ellen, at 12, as the city prepared for its bicentennial celebration, told her teacher that her mother had forbidden her to march in the procession. As the only Black child in her school, Ellen had been treated badly and ruled out of previous parades. But eventually both were persuaded to march in the procession, in which Ellen held the hand of a white classmate.
Shortly after her mother's death in the 1840s, Ellen moved to Boston and almost immediately became a member of the African Baptist Church where her uncle Obed Robbins was among the founders. Along with her church commitments she began teaching. She and several other activists launched a celebration of the community's abolitionists and began arousing the populace in signing petitions against discrimination in the public transportation and the school system.
In 1857, she married John Jackson, a free Black farmer from Delaware, but within a few years he died, and she moved to Newport, Rhode Island where she was placed in charge of a small private school. After the Civil War, she moved to Maryland to teach the recently emancipated, though she was often met with hostility and rebuke. Soon, she was as active here as she was in the North, often joining other members of her community in pushing for more civil and human rights.
On May 5, 1866 in a Baltimore train station after being forcibly removed, Ellen, along with another woman, contacted the local paper and reported the incident. This was done after she returned to the station and gathered more witnesses. Many of her friends and associates believed her situation would be the first test case of the month-old Civil Rights Act, but in July a Maryland grand jury dismissed her suit against the railroad. Even so, it would be among the many incidents to challenge the bulwark of a Jim Crow system that was to become even more intransigent.
By 1877, Jim Crow laws were fully in effect, following the Tilden-Hayes debacle. Faced with increasing reaction from nightriders and hostile managers of southern cities, many African Americans heeded the call to venture west, and Ellen quickly joined what became the "Exodusters" seeking better opportunities in places like Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Once settled in Barton, Kansas, she married a landowner named Harry Clark from South Carolina. Throughout the 1880s, she devoted much of her time to civic organizations and teaching, a career that earned her great praise from the city leaders.
Not much is known about Ellen near the end of her life, but it was noted that she owned her land and continued to inspire students at the local colored school. According to the collection of family history at the Robbins House in Concord, Ellen died in the 1890s, and other details of her active life and legacy can be found at this historic landmark.
A tweet from Martha Hazard-Small emphasized this research suggestion, noting the significance of Ellen's forebears as well as the important role African Americans have played in the history of New England, the South and out west.

'Splendid Suns' Production an Unflinching Triumph

Texto completo: Author Khaled Hosseini is known for his eloquent fiction, receiving critical acclaim for his portrayal of the beauty of Afghanistan and depiction of the universality of the human condition. His novels have been adapted to stage and as motion pictures to generally positive reviews.
However, each adaptation came up short in capturing the emotional intensity achieved in Hosseini's storytelling. Until now.
Award-winning playwright Ursula Rani Sarma's adaptation of Hosseini's New York Times bestseller "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is nothing short of a theatral triumph. Premier-ing in 2017 at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater, the production finally made its East Coast debut at Arena Stage.
The play follows the unlikely friendship between Laila and Mari-am, who find themselves bonded by their society's attack against women and their rights. Though they come from opposing backgrounds and generations, the women forge a lifelong bond, a plot device that offers compelling commentary on transcendent aspects of womanhood.
The stage adaptation is extremely successful in translating the enor-mousness of the story, its characters and its meaning. All senses are aggressively engaged in this production. Ken MacDonald's set design is versatile and just barren enough to believably represent coup-rid-den Kabul/Herit in the '90s. David Coulter's original music is dynamic and dramatic, the perfect copilot to the play's heavy plot.
Actors Hend Ayoub (Mariam) and Mirian Katrib (Laila) are incredible forces that lead their fellow actors vallianty. In violent scenes that were almost too difficult to watch, Ayoub and Katrib refuse to shy away from the rawness of those moments. Actor Haysam Kadri (Rasheed/Fight Captain) also gives a memorable performance, successfully embodying the hate and fear of a generation.
Director Carey Perloff, a longtime friend of Arena Stage Artistic Director Molly Smith, said the production "belongs in Washington, D.C.
Perloff statement is met with collective agreement, especially when she mentions the current state of Middle Eastern affairs.
Perloff also says what makes this show special is its depiction of "female friendship onstage." Theater is dominated by stories that are centered in white, male friendships. What makes this production magnificent, along with superb acting and visual and auditory elements, is its depiction of the bond between women.
In this sociopolitical climate, representation of brown and black women in different spaces, in different forms, is paramount. "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is vivid and evocative, but ultimately ends in a offering of hope and a better future to come.

Senate has duty to call witnesses

Texto completo: A Times editorial

President Donald Trump is not the only one on trial in Washington. History also will judge the U.S. Senates willingness to conduct a fair, impartial impeachment trial  and that verdict will not be favorable if Republicans refuse to allow witnesses. A trial without essential witnesses would be a sham, and the moment is fast approaching when senators will have to quit posturing and vote on whether to hear from key players or put partisanship ahead of their constitutional obligations.

It should not be so difficult for Republicans such as Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to vote to hear testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton. The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton wrote in his upcoming book that Trump told him directly in August that he wanted to keep withholding critical financial assistance to Ukraine until officials in that country announced an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Why wouldnt Senate Republicans want to hear that direct account, unless they are more interested in protecting the president than in acting as independent jurors?

Bolton clearly has first-hand information that fleshes out a more complete picture of Trumps intentions. His book manuscript reportedly describes his direct conversation with Trump about Ukraine and adds new details about the involvement of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr and Rudolph Giuliani, the presidents private attorney who was running his own Ukraine effort on behalf of Trump. Any independent trial would feature all of them as witnesses, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is more interested in ending this trial as quickly as possible than in developing a complete picture before delivering a verdict on the two articles of impeachment.

Its instructive that the White House has had a copy of Boltons manuscript since Dec. 30 as part of a standard review for classified material. Trump had to know its content for weeks before it became public Sunday. Of course, the president tweeted Monday that he never told Bolton the Ukraine aid was tied to investigating the Democrats. The senators should hear from Bolton directly, and they can judge his truthfulness.

To be sure, Boltons motives are not entirely pure and he is promoting his book. So what? The reality is the revelations about his book manuscript significantly undercut the weak defense presented by Trumps lawyers. One of their key arguments is there has been no direct testimony about the presidents motives in freezing $391 million in aid to Ukraine. Bolton could provide that testimony, and the Senate and the nation should hear it.

As Trump escalated his attacks on Bolton Wednesday, numerous outlets reported the White House moved last week to block publication of Boltons book and claimed it contains classified information that would threaten national security. It was unclear what raised concerns, and the timing is curious. The Senate should hear everything Bolton has to say, and as much of his testimony as possible should be public.

In an ideal world, there would be bipartisan support for hearing from witnesses during the impeachment trial. Rubio and Scott would be on board on behalf of all Floridians who want to see the full picture. At least Rubio has taken a low profile during the trial and appears to be paying attention. Scott has shown no such restraint, shamefully airing an ad in Iowa that trashes the impeachment process as a charade and parrots Trumps unfounded allegations about Joe Biden regarding Ukraine and his sons paid position on the board of a Ukraine energy company. Its conduct beneath a U.S. senator, particularly while sitting as a juror in an impeachment trial.

Surely there are at least four Republican senators willing to do the right thing and vote with Democrats to hear from Bolton and other witnesses. Do they really want to deliver an impeachment verdict first and hear the full story later?

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" – that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
"Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued at the Senate hearing on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued on Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump's behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.
With Trump preventing his closest advisers from testifying during the impeachment proceedings late last year, senators have an obligation at the trial to summon people like Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others.
But McConnell and the vast majority of his caucus seemed ready to forgo witnesses, arguing that they were under no duty to go on a "fishing expedition." Now there's a preview of what Bolton would say, and it goes to the heart of the allegations against Trump.
This impeachment trial – only the third in U.S. history – is much more than just a proceeding before the Senate. It's a vehicle for the American people to judge their president's character and conduct. For that, witnesses are imperative.
Bolton's book is slated for publication in March. To pass on the chance to thoroughly question and cross-examine him, under oath, would be a loss to history and expose these historic proceedings as a farce.

Texto completo: You can call John Bolton a lot of things — bully, brawler, neocon — but not many would call him a dummy.
This is especially true at this precise moment, when he may be the only person to emerge a winner from Donald Trump's impeachment trial.
To many Americans, the name John Bolton likely conjures up little more than a walrus-ian mustache to which the man's loyalty never wavers. Perhaps he keeps the little shrub to remind his upper lip not to curl with contempt toward those whose opinions differ from his own. As his friends and former colleagues will tell you, Bolton tends to be an absolutist with an affinity for black and white and no love for elitists or fools.
They will also tell you that he is above all a man of principle who would never sacrifice himself for the most-unprincipled president in modern history. Whether he is subpoenaed to testify before the Senate is virtually irrelevant considering that we already know what he knows.
For one thing, excerpts of his forthcoming book's manuscript were recently leaked to The New York Times. Among revelations therein: Then-national security adviser Bolton and Attorney General Bill Barr discussed "concerns that President Trump was effectively granting personal favors to the autocratic leaders of Turkey and China."
Also, Bolton writes that Trump explicitly made military aid to Ukraine contingent upon investigations into political foe Joe Biden and his son Hunter. But, then, we already knew that, too.
The rest is theater, which, frankly, has become a bit dull. Witnesses-to-the-rescue is a tempting notion, but it seems unlikely that Bolton's contribution would sway the Republican-majority Senate to convict the president.
In some conservative circles, bets are that Bolton wouldn't just be willing to testify, as he has said he would if subpoenaed by the Senate. He'd love to. One way or the other, his story, supported by the paper trail he created as national security adviser, will come out. It won't be good for Trump, but it won't necessarily hurt him in the immediate future. Everybody knows what Trump is. The only issue is whether enough senators care enough to convict him.
Trump and his loyalists have accused Bolton of trying to sell a book and make money. Note to the unpublished: Well-known writers such as Bolton typically are paid upfront by their publisher in the form of an advance. Whether the book makes money, thereafter, is primarily the concern of the publisher. Bolton's book's value has been reported in the neighborhood of $2 million.
Thus, money isn't likely Bolton's chief motivation. Far more compelling to someone like Bolton is what one might call principled justice. Trump embarrassed Bolton by ignoring his advice and then firing him by tweet (Bolton maintains he quit) for an offense that ought really to make Bolton's point-of-pride list: He objected to Trump's genius idea to host the Taliban at Camp David near the anniversary of 9/11.
So, no, Bolton isn't only selling books. He's saving his legacy — and giving back to Trump as good as he got. Testifying before the Senate might just make his day — in a Dirty Harry kind of way. But the book otherwise will stand when history passes judgment on a man who picked the right side.

To make peace plan work, Trump must push Bibi

Texto completo: Given the timing of the release Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, I have to begin by asking: Is this plan about two states for two peoples or is it about one diversion for two dirty leaders?
It sure feels like the latter. After all, both Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are, in effect, facing job-threatening charges — Trump for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and Bibi, who was literally indicted Tuesday, for fraud, bribery and breach of trust. They both had a huge need to change the subject and shore up their common base of right-wing Jews and evangelicals.
If I were Jared Kushner and had worked for three years on a peace plan — and was serious about it getting a fair hearing from all sides — there is no way I would have released it right now. This smells.
And yet, I also know that when America puts something this detailed on the table, it cannot be ignored, at least in the near term. Netanyahu already announced that with Trump’s blessings Israel will quickly move to apply its law (tantamount to annexation) to the West Bank’s Jordan Valley and all Jewish settlements in the occupied territory.
It will be interesting to see how the European Union, which funds much of the Palestinian governing infrastructure in the West Bank, responds once it’s studied the plan, not to mention the reaction of everyday Palestinians and Arabs.
(I don’t expect much. This conflict seems to have passed its fix-by date.)
OK, despite the obvious political motivation for the timing of the release of this plan, is there anything in it that would impress me that the Trump administration is actually serious about promoting a two-state solution?
Yes, if our president did something hard. What would that be? It would be his telling Netanyahu that before Bibi extends Israeli law to all these West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley, Trump wants one thing: an unequivocal public statement that Netanyahu accepts the fact that while Israel is getting East Jerusalem, more than 20% of the core West Bank, with all its settlements, plus the Jordan Valley, the remaining roughly 70% will become an independent Palestinian state, if Palestinians agree to all sorts of security requirements.
If Netanyahu is allowed to evade that question, then this whole thing truly is a farce — it’s just the new baseline for Netanyahu’s next West Bank land grab.
At the same time, while I understand why Palestinian leaders are denouncing this plan, they should nevertheless try to make some lemonade out of these Trump lemons. It’s not as if they have a lot of great options, and their resistance to the Israeli occupation has gotten them nowhere. If I were them, I’d tell Trump, “We will use this plan as a floor in negotiations with Israelis, not a ceiling.”
But bottom line: Without Trump getting Netanyahu to definitively end his claims to all of the West Bank, and without Palestinian leaders able to reunite their disparate political factions in Gaza and the West Bank into a single body that can theoretically say “yes” to a fair outcome for their people while also recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, Trump’s Deal of the Century will join a century-old library of failed Middle East peace plans.

Texto completo: Here’s good news: Florida is no longer in the climate-change denier club. Coastal states are lining up for $16 billion to pay for resiliency projects to address sea-level rise, but only one — that’s right, Florida — is using the words “climate change” in its application to the federal government, according to a Jan. 21 front-page New York Times article.
Louisiana, Texas and South Carolina officials engaged in “linguistic acrobatics,” to avoid using the term, according to the Times.
It wasn’t so long ago that such acrobatics were standard operating procedure in Florida too, under Gov. Rick Scott.
But no longer.
“Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to complicate the extent and threat of the hazards,” wrote Florida officials as they made their case for a fair share of the resiliency funding.
For people passionate about the issue, this could seem a baby step.
But make no mistake, real progress has occurred. Our state regulators and planners now have permission to plan for climate change without jeopardizing their careers. People can now talk freely to their representatives without having to fear that their concerns are disregarded.
One small example: recently, a coalition of civic groups in Jacksonville voted to change its name to The Jacksonville Resiliency and Climate Change Coalition, from simply the resiliency coalition. The group had kept climate change out of its name for largely political considerations in this conservative region.
The words we use matter, what we call ourselves matters. It’s progress that people now feel comfortable openly talking about climate change.
Time to raise the bar: climate crisis, anyone?

Texto completo: The “King of Paranoia Rock” was on to something.
When Rockwell sang Somebody’s Watching Me in 1984, the song became a smash hit, though not everyone could relate to its level of paranoia. Now, we all can.
The FBI and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies in the United States have been using technology that allows them to ascertain your personal information from just a photograph. According to a new report from the New York Times, an app called Clearview AI lets users snap a photo of someone, upload it to the database, and wait for the eerily accurate results.
Once Clearview has your photo, it can find matching images from its database of 3 billion photos, culled from sites such as Facebook, Venmo, and YouTube, and link to wherever those photos originally appeared. That could reveal people’s information, including their names, locations, and more. The system, according to the report, “goes far beyond anything ever constructed by the United States government or Silicon Valley giants.”
Yes, your photos from Facebook really can be used against you.
Luckily, your next-door neighbor can’t up and decide to use the app to start stalking — yet. But Clearview has been employed by more than 600 law enforcement agencies, as well as a handful of companies. If you trust the government to use it well, this could sound like a good thing. Federal and state law enforcement officers claim they’ve used the app to solve crimes from shoplifting to murder.
But it could easily backfire. Last year, one New York man sued Apple for $1 billion, alleging that its facial recognition technology had led to his wrongful arrest.
As for the risk of misuse, Clearview inventor Hoan Ton-That says, “Our belief is that this is the best use of the technology.”
In short, anti-Big Tech and anti-Big Government sentiment may unite against an incredibly invasive form of facial recognition technology. When Rockwell sang, “I always feel like somebody's watching me/Who’s playing tricks on me?,” he was probably asking a rhetorical question. But now, we have an answer: Big Brother and his tech contractors.

Texto completo: Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein hired Black Cube, an Israeli private detective firm, in an attempt to block the New York Times from publishing sexual assault allegations against him.
Lawyer Dev Sen, of the New York law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, confirmed that his company connected Black Cube with Weinstein to "provide intelligence which will help the client’s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper.”
Boies Schiller Flexner signed a sealed contract with Black Cube, under the direction of Weinstein, which would award the Israeli firm $300,000 if they successfully kept the article from being published. The contract was personally signed by David Boies, a known champion of liberal causes, leading the New York Times to end his employment as a legal adviser to the paper.
Weinstein, 67, is standing trial for rape in New York, where he faces five counts with the possibility of life without parole. Journalist Ronan Farrow reported on the Israeli firm's work to befriend Weinstein's accusers in an attempt to gain critical information the movie producer could use against them.
Weinstein is also facing an indictment in Los Angeles, where prosecutors have charged him with forcible oral copulation, forcible rape, sexual penetration by use of force, and sexual battery by restraint.

Texto completo: That the members of the U.S. Supreme Court are unequally fit to be the subjects of feature-length documentaries is a fact that few could deny. Whereas Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s life and times were more than sufficient to fill 2018’s hagiographic RBG, moviegoers are unlikely to line up to watch Justice Stephen Breyer judging architectural contests or giving lectures on the superiority of international law. Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation saga alone was the stuff of an American epic, but scenes of Chief Justice John Roberts grimly balancing the demands of the Constitution and the New York Times editorial page are unlikely to provoke much interest. In terms of sheer drama, the story of Justice Clarence Thomas is not only the most compelling that the current Supreme Court has to offer but among the most fascinating in all of American public life.
Now, thanks to a first-rate effort from filmmaker Michael Pack, that story has, at last, received the treatment it deserves.
Born in 1948 in the Low Country community of Pin Point, Georgia, the future associate justice famously learned little English until elementary school and once said he didn't become fully comfortable with the language until the late 1980s. Instead, the young Thomas and his family spoke Gullah, a creole language used primarily by the descendants of slaves in the marshlands of Georgia and South Carolina. When a house fire destroyed the family’s residence in 1954, Thomas moved with his mother and brother to a one-room tenement in still-segregated Savannah. There, the two boys wandered the streets instead of going to school, a state of affairs that changed only when the pair was sent to live with their grandparents in a move that Thomas characterizes as “the longest and most significant journey [he] ever made.”
Emerging from the squalor of the tenement, the children carried all of their possessions in grocery bags. (“Neither bag was full,” Thomas wryly notes.) Yet, once the boys were established in the home of Myers and Christine Anderson, they quickly found a security and order they had never known. Among the details recalled by Thomas are the revelations that he had “never been in a house with a bathtub” and that his grandfather greeted the brothers with the pledge that their “damn vacation [was] over.” A believer in laboring “from sun to sun,” Myers Anderson instilled in his grandchildren a work ethic that would see Thomas through his entire education — from the Catholic grammar school so disciplined “you could hear a gnat tiptoeing across cotton” to high school seminary, Holy Cross, and Yale Law.
Though a number of these details are already known to conservatives, Created Equal brings them stirringly to life with archival footage, period photographs, and overhead shots of the coastal South so beautiful they wouldn’t have been out of place in Cary Fukunaga’s season of True Detective. Similar to last year’s superb Apollo 11, Created Equal eschews an outside narrator and relies instead on editing and the occasional supertitle to propel the plot forward. When voice-over does become necessary, Pack uses excerpts from Thomas’s 2007 memoir, My Grandfather’s Son (read by the author, of course), as well as clips from interviews conducted for the film. All are smoothly arranged, astutely chosen, and highly enlightening.
As Thomas departs Yale and begins the career that would take him from the Missouri attorney general’s office to the highest court in the land, Created Equal’s pacing necessarily increases. Though the film covers Thomas’s work in Jefferson City, in Sen. John Danforth’s office, and at the Department of Education, Pack rightly focuses on his subject’s swiftly evolving ideology. A self-described “lazy libertarian” at Yale, Thomas went to Missouri convinced that all incarcerated African Americans were “political prisoners,” a view he abandoned only when forced to do so by the realities of black-on-black crime. Long repelled by the chaos and contradictions of desegregation busing (“Someone [had] a theory, and then they insert[ed] human beings”), Thomas was swept up in the Reagan Revolution, drawn by the hope that the great man would end “the indiscriminate social engineering of the ’60s and ’70s.”
Perhaps the crucial moment in Thomas’s ideological development came in 1987, when he gave a series of interviews to Juan Williams (then of the Atlantic) and first heard the racially charged taunts of “Uncle Thomas” that would become a regular feature of his professional life. By admitting to Williams that his sister back in Savannah was so “dependent” that “she [got] mad when the mailman [was] late with her welfare check,” Thomas forever marked himself as “the wrong black guy.” From then on, he tells the camera, “there was no going back.” Indeed, when the white journalist Hodding Carter III subsequently characterized Thomas as a “chicken-eating preacher” who “gladly parroted the segregationists’ line,” the civil rights community uttered not one word in objection.
Unsurprisingly, such treatment continued in the aftermath of Thomas’s elevation to the bench, and it is to Pack’s great credit that he refuses to shield our eyes from such attacks. Rather, Created Equal forces our gaze directly onto the nakedly racist political cartoons and sketch-comedy skits with which Thomas was assailed in the years after his confirmation. In one particularly bigoted example, the justice dons a Ku Klux Klan robe in place of his judicial garb. In another, he grins subserviently while shining Justice Antonin Scalia’s shoes. Though such images horrify, Pack was right, and wise, to include them. The Thomas who emerges in this film simply cannot be understood in their absence.
As for the confirmation hearings themselves, suffice it to say that viewers will be startled anew by the similarities between Thomas’s “high-tech lynching” and what awaited Kavanaugh 27 years later. That, and the insufferable smugness of Judicial Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, are those scenes’ inevitable takeaways.
Yet, despite a somber second half, Created Equal remains hopeful, even uplifting. Seeing the dirt-poor Savannah boy at the film’s heart and knowing what he would become is a reminder we live in an extraordinary nation. Of that message, Clarence Thomas would certainly approve.

Texto completo: On Feb. 28, 2018, the New York Times put out a five-minute “explainer” video of the concept of nationalism. “Nationality is weird,” the New York Times’s Max Fisher intones as the video starts, soon explaining that this is “because national identity is made up.” The thrust of the video is to set up the forces of 19th-century nationalism against a countervailing idea of a cosmopolitan community of values: “Today, we are fighting over whether to keep that kind of national identity,” Fisher says, before admitting that constructing an equally alluring alternative is proving to be challenging.
On the surface, Fisher’s argument seems to toe the line of the so-called modernist nationalism scholars, who argue that national identity has been “constructed” top-down and that this construction is mostly a product of economic development and industrialization. But it overlays that work with a kind of progressive optimism that badly distorts both the scholarship and our broader understanding of history. It concludes that since national identities are constructed, they are essentially superfluous. They may be alluring and deeply embedded in our psyches, but they can and should be overcome.
John Connelly’s new book, From Peoples Into Nations, takes aim at just this kind of breezy postmodernism. It is an ambitious work that both embraces existing thinking on nationalism and seeks to extend and complicate it. The book argues that nationalism, rather than being simply “invented” and thus somehow external to history, is, in fact, the terrain upon which history plays out. Connelly’s argument is not that nationalism is some kind of eternal, unchanging force — he agrees with the modernist scholars insofar as they insist that national identity was constructed, largely by elites in the 19th century, and is more often than not based on a common language. He is more skeptical, however, about the claim that industrialization is the main driver in this process and the attendant conclusion that nationalism is or ought to be a spent force. Indeed, he denounces the conceit that “had things gone differently, humans might have imagined no national communities at all.”
Books1_020420.jpg
From People Into Nations is a rich narrative history of Central and Eastern Europe rather than a work of political science. Its many examples refract kaleidoscopically against each other in ways that often frustrate easy generalizations. But what seems key for Connelly’s overarching theory is the agonistic element: Modern nationalist movements grew out of a perceived threat to a group’s existence. It is in this sense that nationalism distinguishes itself from ideologies such as liberalism, socialism, communism, or fascism. Nationalism is something much more fundamental and basic. “As soon as patriots created national languages,” Connelly writes, “nationalism itself became the language of politics, and no one who wanted power could avoid speaking it.”
Against the strict “modernist” theory, Connelly points to the existence of coherent national identities that stretch back into the medieval period. He singles out the Serbs, with their tradition of epic poetry, as an iconic example often glossed over in the theoretical literature. “The ballads created a firm sense of identity among villagers who could not read or write, telling them they were Christian, Serb, and ‘virtuous’” in contrast to the occupying Ottomans (and their Islamicized Slavic brethren). Modern Serbian nationalism, which would start to develop more fully in the 19th century (and which was indeed driven by elites), readily drew on these deep preexisting reservoirs of identity.
Further north, Connelly notes, a different kind of premodern identity developed among various geographically bounded aristocracies. Language didn’t tightly bind the Polish or Croatian nobles together — they tended to speak French or Latin, like nobles across the European continent. But they did feel a kind of political cohesion born of both a shared cultural history and privilege. Peasants, however, did not count. “The early modern Polish or Croatian nobility did not think of Polish or Croatian-speaking peasants as part of their nation and often considered these peasants a lower form of humanity,” Connelly writes.
Both of these two types of premodern national identity were shaped “against” another, but neither focused on language as something to unify around. And by the time language finally did come to play a role, it did so as a threat. A more recognizably modern Hungarian nationalism was aroused among the Magyar aristocracy in 1781, when the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II decided to impose German as the official language of the realm, displacing Latin. Fearing that German-speaking administrators would soon arrive and leave them at a permanent disadvantage, Hungarian patriots began resuscitating the vernacular Hungarian language, which most of them didn’t even speak that well. In Bohemia, where the aristocracy was both weaker and more thoroughly Germanized, the reaction was more muted. Visitors noted “murmurs and ostentatious use of Czech in the court in Vienna, a language [the nobles] spoke to stable boys and not in good company.”
Connelly pays ample attention to the role German Romanticism played in the development of national culture in Central Europe, but only to underline how the logic of agonism was already unavoidable by that time. Many of the “awakeners” from across the Habsburg Empire who excavated local languages and cultural myths felt they were laboring largely alone and feared that their national project would die with them. Connelly wryly points out that the fact that similar “zealots” popped up in almost every country he writes about proves that there were plenty of people willing to do the “hard work” of nationalism. By the mid-19th century, nationalism was emerging across the European continent in opposition to some kind of cultural hegemony, whether French, German, Austrian, or Ottoman.
This sense of threat cuts in poignant ways across Connelly’s sprawling narrative. Austria-Hungary’s nervous overextension into Bosnia in 1878, in a bid to prevent the rise of irredentism that might rile up its own Slavs, ended up fueling a radical Serbian nationalism that ultimately destroyed the empire. Otto von Bismarck’s decision to exclude Austria from a unified German Reich created the circumstances under which resentful Germans from Bohemia (later interwar Czechoslovakia) became eager foot soldiers for the National Socialist German Worker’s Party. Theodor Herzl’s encounter in 1895 with Karl Leuger, the anti-Semitic mayor of Vienna and future inspiration to a young Adolf Hitler, finally convinced him that only a Jewish state could ensure the survival of the Jewish people. The genocidal Ustashe in Croatia, like their counterparts in Romania and Slovakia, embraced an especially vicious kind of violent racism as their governing ideology precisely because they were weak and politically illegitimate. It’s not that Connelly is in any way callous or glib about the immense human costs and cataclysmic consequences of modern nationalism. Rather, he conceives of nationalism as a substrate for history itself. To wish that things had worked out differently is to indulge in ahistorical fantasy.
The book ends, a bit abruptly, in the present moment, with a dry description of the violent Balkan Wars in the 1990s that segues into an account of the rise and faltering of the postnationalist European Union. Though Stalinism partially co-opted nationalism in creating vassal states in the Soviet Union’s periphery, it never fully triumphed. By 1989, communist economic policies created such a prosperity gulf with the rest of Europe that once the Iron Curtain lifted, most Eastern Europeans prioritized growth over almost anything else. The EU held out great promise for the impoverished countries of the East. Its early success at coaxing many of these countries into far-reaching reforms convinced many that the postnational project had legs. Since 2008 and the global financial crisis, however, the EU has taken serious hits to its credibility. The migrant crisis of 2015, in particular, created anxieties that no adroit politician could afford to ignore. And European nationalism is once again raising its head — and not just in the East.
It’s in understanding the current moment that From People Into Nations proves most useful. A bien-pensant reader of the New York Times might see the return of nationalist forces across the continent as a throwback to more barbarous times. The stubborn deplorables backing Viktor Orban in Hungary and Law and Justice in Poland simply haven’t been educated out of their parochial attachments to “imagined communities.” For close readers of Connelly, however, seeing things this way is a category error. The return of nationalism to Europe is indeed troubling, as the forces it has the potential of unleashing can be profoundly destructive. But rightly understood, nationalism is the natural language of the politics of insecurity. To focus on intellectually overcoming it, rather than looking for the reasons for its reemergence, would be a waste of time.

A Babylon Bee in their bonnets

Texto completo: In August 2019, the New York Times published a warning.
“The line between misinformation and satire can be thin, and real consequences can result when it is crossed,” it cautioned. “On social media, parody can be misconstrued or misrepresented as it moves further and further from its source. And humor has been weaponized to help spread falsehoods online.”
The subject of the New York Times article is not the satirical website the Onion. It is not New Yorker humorist and inexplicable viral goldmine Andy Borowitz. It is not the satirical “news” programs that dominate streaming services and late-night television.
The newspaper's target is the Babylon Bee, a Christian satirical website that launched in 2016 amid little fanfare and boasts now roughly 15 million monthly page views. For the New York Times and other newsrooms of equal size and influence, the success and reach of the conservative comedy group represent a real problem for the health of American democracy. Satire, you see, is dangerous because people cannot be trusted to know what is real and what is fiction.
Or some satire, it seems.
Do not be fooled into thinking the news media's newfound concerns for satire have anything to do with protecting the public from falsehoods. The alarms that sound now for the Babylon Bee stem from transparent partisan politics.
The Babylon Bee launched the same year that Hillary Clinton lost a winnable election to Donald Trump. Her defeat triggered a party-wide nervous breakdown, leaving both Democrats and their allies in the press in perpetual pursuit of ways to explain how Trump won the presidency.
They blame Russia, which they concede now is a grave geopolitical foe. They blame Facebook, which they previously credited with helping President Barack Obama win two terms in office. They also blame “fake news,” a term that started out narrowly enough to mean disinformation cooked up by activist bloggers and trolls but now means anything that is disagreeable or can be misconstrued, including political commentary and even satire. This means the Babylon Bee.
It's equal parts amusing and infuriating for the Babylon Bee’s leadership.
“When it comes to the bias of the corporate press, nothing has been more illuminating for us than the recent attacks on our brand of humor by supposedly impartial fact-checkers like Snopes and news organizations like CNN,” Babylon Bee Editor-in-Chief Kyle Mann told the Washington Examiner.
He adds, "While we'd always been ready and willing to give outlets like these the benefit of the doubt, it's undeniable now that we are often singled out because we make fun of the ‘wrong’ targets.”
That the news media's warnings about the Babylon Bee come after nearly two decades of reporters and news commentators fawning over the likes of former Comedy Central host and faux newsman Jon Stewart has not been lost on the conservative group’s top brass.
“The hypocrisy is blatant,” said Mann. “When liberal late shows and satire sites fool people, they say it's because the satire is hitting close to home. When our satire is mistaken for real news, they say we're a dangerous threat to democracy that must be silenced.”
Mann says his critics need to pick one: “Either progressive humor should be under the same scrutiny we are, or they need to admit that we're simply cutting too close to the bone for their comfort.”
Mann claims the Babylon Bee is being “singled out” by the press. He's not wrong.
Since its debut, reporters and news commentators have gone after the website with a seemingly relentless stream of criticism, fact checks, and analyses highlighting the perils of online humor.
An article from Harvard’s Nieman Lab, of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, cautioned in 2019, “Maybe you know that article is satire, but a lot of people can’t tell the difference.” Snopes, which publishes copious “fact checks” of the Babylon Bee’s satirical work, including an article titled “CNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine To Spin News Before Publication,” has gone so far as to promote a junk study “proving” the conservative comedy site poses a public risk. Snopes’s bizarre crusade against the Babylon Bee goes well beyond mere criticism. A “fact check” last July outright accused the conservative group of intentionally deceiving readers, an allegation that threatened the Babylon Bee’s standing on Facebook and all the web traffic that goes with it. The “fracas” between the Babylon Bee and Snopes, Poynter argued in March 2018, “highlights the notoriously thin line between satire and misinformation.”
“Even if a story’s intention is to entertain,” Poynter cautioned, “the effect could still be misinformation if the headline is believable enough.”
Then there's all the online media commentary aimed at the alleged dangers of the Babylon Bee’s humor.
“A post from a satirical website has been shared more than 500k times saying the DNC called for the flag to be at half-mast because of Soleimani,” Daily Beast contributor Cindy Otis tweeted in January. “Some family members just called bc their Republican friends on [Facebook] are circulating it like it's legit. We have a lot of work to do, all.”
The article in question is titled: “Democrats Call For Flags To Be Flown At Half-Mast To Grieve Death Of Soleimani.”
It is clearly a joke.
Her fears were echoed elsewhere by CNN disinformation reporter Donie O’Sullivan, who tweeted, “To put this in perspective, this is the same number of engagements the top NY Times and CNN stories on Facebook had over the past week. A lot of people sharing this ‘satirical’ story on Facebook don't know it is satire.”
O’Sullivan, who is himself a fan of the Onion, added, “Having a disclaimer buried somewhere on your site that says it’s ‘satire’ seems like a good way to get around a lot of the changes Facebook has made to reduce the spread of clickbait and misinformation.”
His CNN colleague Brian Stelter said earlier that the Babylon Bee is a “fake news site,” adding derisively that “they call it ‘satire.’”
It is impossible to ignore that the press has never gone after the Onion or even Borowitz with anything near this level of intensity. The press rarely, if ever, worried about political satire during the first decade of the war on terror, back when Stewart the media darling spoon-fed his viewers a steady diet of deceptively edited interviews. Political satire was not as grave a threat to democracy when voters said they got their news from Stewart and the many copycat shows that cropped up around his critically acclaimed program. Polls showing voters relied on the former Comedy Central host as a legitimate source of news information despite his obviously partisan lean did not inspire panic or anger in the press. On the contrary, the news media adored Stewart, even as he gained a reputation for intentionally misrepresenting the facts. The Newseum actually honored Stewart in 2019 with his own display, praising the "news" anchor for becoming the “go-to source for information for a new generation of news consumers.”
Many “viewers considered Stewart a more trusted source for news than actual broadcast journalists,” the Newseum said in a press release that hailed him as an indispensable contributor to the core mission of the free press.
The conversations today about the pitfalls of satire were conspicuously absent during the height of Stewart’s popularity. What changed?
It's simple, says Babylon Bee senior writer Frank Fleming. Donald Trump won the White House.
“I think why we're being targeted now is that after Trump was elected, a lot of the Left seem to be doing whatever they can to avoid self-reflection,” Fleming told the Washington Examiner.
He added, "It’s a tough pill to swallow that people have a rational reason to prefer Trump over them, so many of them are turning to external explanations like ‘people are getting tricked by Facebook ads’ or ‘people are getting tricked by the Babylon Bee.’ But I feel like that’s getting cause and effect backwards.”
Fleming, who stresses that the website is not trying to trick anyone, notes that no one ever seems to cry “fake news” whenever one of its articles mocking Trump or his Cabinet goes viral.
“No one loved the Democrats up until they saw an inaccurate meme, but when people have strong negative feelings toward a person or group, they’re more likely to be credulous toward more negative information about that person or group,” he said. "The real question the Left need to be asking is what about their behavior and policy proposals have turned people so strongly against them, but it’s a lot easier to pretend their problem is the Bee tricking lots of people.”
Mann has a blunter assessment of the matter.
“The more zealous a movement is, the less that movement can abide mockery and humor. Since the Left is now a religion, its prophets and priests want to silence the heretics that mock their faith,” he said.
Mann added, “They'd do well to learn how to laugh at themselves, as we Christians have had to do while being the butt of the joke for the last several decades.”

'Same Washington playbook': Buttigieg blasts Biden as yesterday's man

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg singled out Democratic primary rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders by name while arguing he's best positioned to take on President Trump in 2020, a notable shift from his usual indirect swipes.
"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump," Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and the youngest candidate in the race at 38, said during a campaign stop in Decorah, Iowa, on Thursday.
Buttigieg has pitched himself as a happy medium with the best elements of both the Vermont senator, 78, and the former vice president, 77, in that he is a fresh face that can inspire enthusiasm, but not so radical that he will alienate voters with a purist left-wing policy approach.
"Then I hear Sen. Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you've got to go all the way here and nothing else counts," Buttigieg continued. "And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for. A majority ready to make sure that the public sector steps up and delivers healthcare, just not so sure about the idea of forcing everybody onto that public plan. A majority that's ready for a game-changing transformation in the affordability of college, but not so sure about the idea of covering every last penny for the tuition of the children of millionaires and billionaires."

While Sanders proposes free college tuition regardless of income and a "Medicare for all" healthcare system that would eliminate private insurance, Buttigieg proposes making college tuition-free for families earning less than $100,000 and a public option for healthcare that would keep much of the private insurance sector intact.
Until Thursday, Buttigieg had declined to name his rivals when criticizing their candidacies. However, his campaign sent out fundraising emails in the last week targeting Sanders.
One fundraiser email highlighted a New York Times story that said Trump's advisers see Sanders as "their ideal Democratic opponent" in November. "If things stay steady until the Iowa Caucuses in just nine days, Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party. But we need a candidate who can beat Donald Trump," another fundraising email said.
Buttigieg on Monday refused to name Sanders when several reporters asked him multiple questions about the emails.
"I stand by any of the communications that have come out from my campaign on this," Buttigieg said in Boone, Iowa.
Biden and Sanders are Buttigieg's biggest competitors for a strong showing in Iowa, which analysts believe is essential for his path to the Democratic presidential nomination. The RealClearPolitics average of Iowa polls has Sanders leading the field at 23.8%, Biden at 20.2%, and Buttigieg at 15.8%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is in fourth place with 14.6%, followed by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar in a distant third at 9.6%.

Texto completo: An evangelical pastor lashed out at former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, saying Jesus would have "beat the crap out of him" for being "disloyal to the President."
In a series of tweets on Monday, the Rev. Rodney Howard-Browne, 58, angrily reacted to a tweet Bolton had posted with the parents of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died in 2017 after being detained by the North Korean government for 17 months.
“You are a slime ball of the highest order .... I should have knocked your sorry butt through the door of the Oval Office into the rose garden when I saw you. I would have gladly been arrested .... what a Benedict Arnold ..... I am glad you were fired !!!!!” Howard-Browne tweeted.
Tweet
Calling him a "globalist sellout," he told Bolton that he needs to "return to the deep state ocean he swam out of." In a now-deleted tweet, the pastor concluded his remarks by writing: "WWJD: he would have made a whip and beat the crap out of him!!!!" Other accounts screenshotted the tweet to document the incident.
Tweet
Howard-Browne was one of many pastors invited to the White House in 2017 to lay hands and pray on President Trump. The religious leaders discussed a plethora of policy issues at their meeting with the president, including religious freedom, judicial nominees, and criminal justice reform.
He founded a megachurch called The River at Tampa Bay Church in Florida, which is attended by thousands, and is the lead pastor there. He also founded Revival Ministries in 1997, an international evangelism group. The group says it has traveled to more than 57 countries and has ministered to nearly 18 million people.
Howard-Browne's comments follow recent reports that Bolton wrote in his unpublished memoir that Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government, asking it to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in exchange for foreign aid. The New York Times originally reported the allegations in the draft manuscript.

'Vile piece of garbage': Susan Collins receives threatening messages ahead of impeachment witness vote

Texto completo: Sen. Susan Collins has received multiple threatening voice messages as she prepares to vote on whether the Senate will call witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial of President Trump.
The messages, some vulgar and profane, accuse Collins of being a shill for Trump and betraying her oath to uphold the Constitution.
"What a vile piece of garbage you are," one caller said. "You've seen exactly what the president did ... If you don't have the guts and the integrity, I sure hope you didn't breed. I sure hope you don't have children or grandchildren because their future is f---ed."
Collins, who represents Maine, is up for reelection this fall.
"You're going to lose Susan Collins," another caller said. "You're just a little bitch for Trump."
Other critics mocked Collins and said she lacks morality.
"Are you in some kind of satanic cult," one angry caller said. "I don't understand why you're doing the devil's work."
Collins has not indicated if she would vote for or against witnesses to be called in the trial, only saying that she assumes that having additional witnesses "would be helpful."
Tweet
Collins is one of four moderate Republicans whom Democrats are seeking to convince to break with Trump and support witness testimony in the trial. A vote on the matter is expected Friday.
The top witness Democrats seek is John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser. In a new book set to be released later this year, Bolton claims the president discussed a freeze on military aid to Ukraine with him.
House impeachment managers argue this is a clear example of Trump's corrupt conduct.
Collins found herself at the center of a similar partisan battle in the runup to a razor-thin Senate vote late 2018 during the Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
“I mean, it’s not fun,” Collins told the New York Times after she received death threats during that stretch of several days. “Death threats are not fun. Protests are not fun. Being mobbed — sorry, I know the media hates that word — being mobbed when I go to vote. I do not enjoy that at all. I find that exhausting.”
Collins eventually sided with Trump and voted to confirm Kavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the bench.

The international style

Texto completo: There’s a New York collection featuring works by Henry Moore, Fernand Leger, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Henri Matisse, Barbara Hepworth, Rufino Tamayo, Candido Portinari, and numerous others. It doesn’t appear on museum listings because it isn’t housed in one — it’s in the United Nations complex in Manhattan. Somehow, in the midst of performing all of its other functions, the U.N. has acquired a striking amount of great art.
This art is not curated in any traditional sense. In fact, there’s no curator. The U.N. has no budget for buying art nor any mechanism for shedding it. Politics and donor interests naturally play a role in the functions of essentially all museums, but seldom so overtly as here, where suggestions about moving a piece can earn you the opprobrium of not just a grandee but a nation-state.
The U.N. began receiving art donations soon after its building opened in 1952. Like most new homeowners, the U.N. initially wasn’t very choosy about what filled up its blank walls. But space soon grew constricted, and there’s been more than one moratorium on art acquisitions. Currently, the complex features 300 gifts from 193 countries. These range from tapestries to mosaics to coins to busts to even a movable type model.
The U.N. eventually established a theoretical limit of one donation per country. Werner Schmidt, a U.N. public information officer, explained that the limit is “really about equal representation" and that "we want all member states’ voices.” Like most international protocols, this one has been broken repeatedly. A number of states have made multiple donations, and others are constantly offering to.
Another concern is the maintenance of these donations, for which there are no official sources of revenue. There’s no endowment, and the organization doesn’t use member dues to pay for it. Typically, donor states are asked to refurbish their own pieces. Some donations have been removed due to decay, and many have required substantial touching up (especially in a building that didn’t ban smoking indoors until 2008).
In the early years, the U.N. often accepted donations from individuals and foundations. But today, Schmidt says, “We are now only focused on donations by member states because we know where to find them.” One of the most famous works in the building, the stained glass Peace Window by Chagall, was donated by U.N. employees in 1964. Several panels are broken or missing. “If it was donated by a member state,” Schmidt explains, “we could say, ‘Here’s the bill. Wouldn’t you say this needs some restoration?’” They’re not about to ask current U.N. staff to pay for it.
Of course, not every state survives. There’s a relic of East Germany in the U.N. plaza in the form of The Rising Man, a bronze statue by Fritz Cremer now tended to by Germany.
The Arts Committee, which vets donations, is theoretically charged with questions of aesthetics. But its responsibilities, as explained by current head Viktorija Kocman, are principally diplomatic. A former undersecretary, Brian Urqhart, told the New York Times in 1983 that the collection featured “some monstrosities,” but the current staff is far more polite. Kocman explained that “most of the problems are simply about equity and space. Equatorial Guinea, for example, donated a beautiful sculpture. They wanted it inside the building, but it’s too heavy. It would fall through the floor. So I worked with them to find a suitable location.” The committee is also careful not to accept art that could be directly insulting to other states.
There’s an effective hierarchy of art in the building. The most desired locations for donations are the hardest to access — for instance, the second-floor delegate’s lounge, to which there is no tour access. And just as membership on the U.N. Security Council offers states a whole set of grandfathered privileges, countries that donated art early often get pride of place. Nigeria’s donation, the sculpture Anyanwu by Ben Enwonwu, graces a curved wall in a prime spot thanks to being gifted in the ‘60s. Moving works is rare, but it has happened: Finland graciously consented to shift its plaza sculpture to make room for a memorial to international slavery.
You can still see plenty of art on normal tours, with plaza access recently restored. Hepworth’s Single Form sculpture is excellent, as is Moore’s Reclining Figure: Hand and Carl Fredrik Reutersward’s Non-Violence, featuring a revolver with a barrel twisted to uselessness. One Russian gift, Zurab Tsereteli’s Good Defeats Evil, is a powerful depiction of St. George defeating a dragon, wrought out of parts of Pershing and SS-20 missiles. The Sleeping Elephant statue, donated by Kenya, Namibia, and Nepal, raised eyebrows on account of its prominent genitalia; hedges were planted to shield the impressionable. There’s even a Slovenian beehive, tended to by “Beekeepers without Borders.”
Inside the building’s main entrance is Tamayo’s La Fraternidad mural, a marvelous donation from Mexico. And the works decorating some of the main chambers, including Fernand Leger’s murals in the General Assembly and Per Krohg’s bizarre but captivating mural in the Security Council, are fascinating as well.
The lack of any conventional curation lends the collection interest. There’s a 1,700-year-old mosaic from Tunisia, as well as a tapestry about the Chernobyl disaster from Belarus. There’s an 11th-century stone sculpture of the Hindu god Surya from India and an impressive number of modern South American paintings. The fact that their placements aren’t driven by thematic or chronological coherence, or even any intentional aesthetic juxtaposition, makes for a reliably novel and somehow refreshing museum-going experience. If some works are overly domineering or gaudy, there’s also little frivolity (no one wants his or her state represented by a Jeff Koons), and the donations from actively Marxist states are immensely more bearable than the latest exhibition from your local woke curator. If aggregating the interests of all the nations of the world doesn’t always work well in the General Assembly, doing the same for their art collections somehow does.

Tom Steyer campaign eyes throwing Iowa support to rivals, with Warren and Biden most vulnerable

Texto completo: FAIRFIELD, Iowa — Tom Steyer hasn't cracked 5% in any reputable Iowa poll, but rival 2020 Democratic campaigns are concerned about his chances in Monday's caucuses.
The Washington Examiner spoke with two senior Steyer campaign officials Wednesday evening who said they've been approached by aides to opposing candidates interested in coordinating a caucuses strategy should the California businessman fail to win 15% support in an individual precinct — the minimum level needed to continue on to the next round of voting.
Under Iowa caucuses rules, supporters of one candidate can switch to another in the second phase of voting should their initial choice not meet the minimum levels of support.
"We haven't made any deals with anybody, but we've been approached my multiple campaigns," a Steyer aide said. "We don't have to make those decisions yet, considering the trajectory of our numbers."
Despite the coy language of his staffers, Steyer did tell a woman who attended a town hall on Wednesday evening that if she was concerned about what to do during the second round of voting, a staffer would instruct her on who to support.
The likelihood that Steyer's campaign will try to strategically assist another candidate on caucus day remains high. A RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Steyer's support at 3.2%, although his campaign says internal numbers indicate a last-minute surge of support. Steyer has shown no indication of dropping out after a poor finish in Iowa, meaning he has an incentive to weaken who he believes are tougher competitors. As a billionaire former hedge fund manager, Steyer has the resources to stay in the race for some time.
Steyer's message of liberal capitalism and environmentalism occupies an awkward ideological position within the primary. Needing to keep the left flank of the party fractured, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is an obvious target. Hobbling Warren's candidacy would give Steyer and opening to take on socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders directly.
Former Vice President Joe Biden figures to be another target if Steyer throws his caucuses support to another candidate. Polling has also shown Steyer with relatively high minority support relative to most of the field, though well behind Biden. Steyer would have to gain on the 36-year Delaware senator in South Carolina, where the black vote dominates. In an attempt to cut Biden's delegates, Steyer's campaign could benefit from a strong finish by the moderate Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
Other campaigns are already in the process of working out a caucus-day truce. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Biden is considering a deal with Klobuchar to direct supporters to caucus for the Minnesota senator in precincts where he does not garner 15%. In return, Klobuchar's supporters would do the same in other precincts.
Klobuchar's campaign said they were not open to such a deal at the time.
Such arrangements are not uncommon. In 2004, Dennis Kucinich and John Edwards agreed to team up in order to stop John Kerry, the ultimate winner of that cycle's caucuses.

Alan Dershowitz's impeachment argument is perfectly logical and that's why liberals are twisting it

Texto completo: You can tell how effective Alan Dershowitz has been as a member of President Trump’s impeachment team by how vehemently liberals are trying to discredit his performance thus far.
Dershowitz said during Senate trial proceedings on Wednesday that the evidence demonstrates that Trump had a “mixed motive” in asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, including the motive to gain a political advantage as well as advance national interests.
Well, yes, that’s the “mixed motive” every single elected official has when they make every single decision of every single day, assuming they’re not completely corrupt.
And that’s precisely the point Dershowitz so eloquently made on the Senate floor.
“Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest, and mostly, you’re right,” he said. “Your election is in the public interest, and if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”
Trump’s critics are acting as though Dershowitz was arguing that anything a president does at all, so long as he believes it’s in the public interest and his own political preservation, is fair and fine, which would be absurd. But don’t count on Trump’s critics for the context of Dershowitz’s argument.
He was referring to the ridiculous “abuse of power” charge that makes up one of the Democrats’ impeachment articles, the assertion that even if what Trump did was legal, that he stood to benefit politically makes his actions in and of themselves an impeachable “abuse of power.”
Dershowitz addressed that twisted logic in previous remarks on the Senate floor. “The claim,” he said Monday, “that foreign policy decisions can be deemed abuses of power based on subjective opinions about mixed or sole motives that the president was interested only in helping himself demonstrate the dangers of employing the vague subjective and politically malleable phrase ‘abuse of power’ as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the removal of a president.”
In other words, to remove a president from office for taking lawful action that he believed advanced public interest and that happened to benefit him politically would set a stupid precedent for what justifies an impeachment.
Critics might find reason to dispute or reject that argument, but they’ve opted to rebut something Dershowitz didn’t say.
“Trump could give pardons for free to the indicted Russian hackers who attacked the 2016 election and basically encourage them to do it again in 2020, according to Alan Dershowitz and Trump’s team,” tweeted David Corn of the liberal Mother Jones.
No, that’s not what Dershowitz said.
Formerly sane Republican Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post said the logical end to Dershowitz’s position is that Trump “can rig elections, have opponents jailed, anything to cling to power.”
No, that’s not what Dershowitz said.
New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait, an otherwise very smart liberal, summed up Dershowitz’s argument by writing, “If it helps the president win, then you can’t impeach.”
No, that’s not what Dershowitz said.
Dershowitz has all along, in fact, said that a crime or “criminal-like behavior” would merit impeachment and probably removal from office.
President Richard Nixon, for example, tried to cover up a burglary. That’s criminal-like behavior.
President Bill Clinton, for example, lied to a grand jury. That’s a crime.
Trump? Well, the worst version of events is that he withheld foreign aid (ultimately released) to Ukraine in hopes that he could get its government to investigate the Bidens in a matter that journalists themselves have been probing for years (coming away with more questions than answers). That’s not a crime, nor could it reasonably be described as criminal-like behavior.
Dershowitz isn’t even the first person to make this argument. Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, made the same case in an op-ed for the New York Times last week.
“Politicians pursue public policy, as they see it, coupled with a concern about their own political future,” wrote Blackman. “Otherwise legal conduct, even when plainly politically motivated — but without moving beyond a threshold of personal political gain — does not amount to an impeachable ‘abuse of power.’”
This isn’t an argument to say that House Democrats can’t do the impeachment that they did. It’s an argument that House Democrats shouldn’t have done the impeachment that they did and that to remove a sitting president based on an “abuse of power” charge, wherein nothing even remotely illegal took place, would be a tragedy.

There’s nothing controversial about that position. But that’s why Trump’s critics aren’t addressing it.

Texto completo: Yes, John Bolton said that he would lie to defend national security. No, it is not relevant to claims that Bolton apparently makes in his upcoming book.
I note this in light of Sean Davis's argument to the contrary. The Federalist writer references Bolton's 2010 comments on the Fox Business Network that he would lie to protect national security. Davis suggests that those comments undermine the claims in Bolton's book. The New York Times has reported that the former national security adviser's book alleges that President Trump did indeed withhold aid from Ukraine to extract that nation's agreement to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
That is the central contention of Democratic efforts to convict Trump in his impeachment trial.
Don't get me wrong: I recognize that we must ask questions here. Why, for example, did Bolton wait to make his claims in his book and not when the impeachment saga began? It is also wholly legitimate to point out that other witnesses would supposedly contradict Bolton's apparent claims about the president's motives. As Davis observes, both Attorney General William Barr and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney say Bolton's claims are untrue.
That said, I believe Davis misreads what Bolton is saying and what importance those statements have for Bolton's credibility in his book.
Davis notes Bolton's response to Andrew Napolitano's question: "You would lie in order to preserve the truth?"
Bolton: "Absolutely. If I had to say something I knew was false to protect American national security, I would do it."
It doesn't sound great, but Bolton then adds: "I don't think we're often faced with that difficulty, but would I lie about where the D-Day invasion was supposed to take place to deceive the Germans? You better believe it."
The former U.S. ambassador's point is a good one. After all, the Allies did indeed deceive the Nazis in preparation for the D-Day landings. And they did so with elaborate setups and conspiracies in schemes such as Operation Bodyguard. Deception is often a pivotal element of any successful military campaign.
Davis also fails to address Bolton's response to Napolitano's follow-up question: "Can you break the law, as a diplomat, as a government leader, if you think there's a greater good?"
Bolton: "No, you cannot break American law without suffering the consequences. Period, closed quote."
Bolton's affinity for deception is clearly tied to national security and not to the willful manipulation of the American people.
The best way to address the Bolton issue is to get him to testify speedily and up-front. Only that course of action would allow those judging Trump to weigh Bolton's potentially significant statements before voting to convict or acquit the president.

The Polish fantasy series behind The Witcher

Texto completo: The Witcher seems to be everywhere right now. Billboards for the Netflix show, starring Henry Cavill as a monster-hunting mercenary, dot the highways, and a second season and animated film are on the way.
The show’s surging popularity has generated great demand for more Witcher content, leading many viewers back to Netflix’s source material. The Last Wish, the first book in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Wiedzmin (Witcher) series, returned to the New York Times bestseller list in January, nearly three decades after its publication in Polish and more than a decade after it was first published (in its entirety) in English. The book is sold out and back-ordered, not only in English but in French, with over a half-million new copies printed to meet the demand. While many Sapkowski enthusiasts have taken issue with Netflix’s interpretation of his series, the surge of interest in this criminally overlooked writer is welcome. His stories showcase a very different type of world than what English-language fantasy readers are familiar with. Steeped in fairy tales, packed with Polish sensibility, and presented with Sapkowski’s sardonic humor, the Witcher stories take their characters seriously but are never pompous about it.
Sapkowski is often described as the “Polish Tolkien.” While the two writers share a love for (and academic interest in) Arthurian myth and the somewhat-lost genre of “fairy tale,” the experience of reading each is drastically different. Sapkowski’s world is one seen largely in glimpses, especially at first. Readers of the Witcher stories come into that world at almost street-level, following the tales of a “witcher,” a wandering monster-hunter seeking work wherever he can find it. Indeed, The Witcher was a one-off, an entry in a story contest held by the magazine Fantastyka in 1986. But the short story’s roots ran deep and would spawn an entire saga.
The germ of the idea of the witcher — a sort of fantastical exterminator — was Sapkowski’s dissatisfaction with the Polish folk tale Szewczyk Dratewka, in which a cobbler slays a dragon through deception. Cobblers, after all, are not famed for their knowledge of magical creatures. He explained in a 2001 interview (translated by Reddit user Todokugo), “It seemed interesting to me to tell a story where instead of [the cobbler] Szewczyk or some other hero — an idealist who kills dragons and saves princesses — a professional would appear.” Perhaps Sapkowski, an economist, felt such a trade would be far too specialized for an amateur to pick up simply through plot demands and heroism. (In the second Witcher book, Sword of Destiny, Sapkowski includes The Bounds of Reason, his own version of the famous dragon story.)
In the same interview, he joked, “I thought that nobody would write fantasy, because back then — as I thought — everybody wrote about space and introducing socialism there. Meanwhile, it turned out that out of 300 works submitted, 298 were fantasy stories. Luckily it was ‘they killed him and then he bailed’ kind of fantasy, so my Witcher looked pretty good in comparison.”
The story turned out to be a massive success. Though a short, self-contained story, The Witcher not only established its protagonist, Geralt, but presented a lived-in world, with realistic conflicts and factions. As for the monster that Geralt is contracted to slay — it is a strzyga, a vampiric creature of Slavic legend. At a time in Poland when fantasy fiction was in its infancy, Sapkowski was drawing on the country’s own mythology and integrating it into the genre.
In subsequent stories, he would riff on more famous fairy tales, such as Beauty and the Beast (A Grain of Truth) and Snow White (The Lesser Evil), weaving his own stories around their themes. The popular versions of fairy tales often gloss over the drastic, sometimes quite dark consequences faced by their human characters. Sapkowski’s versions emphasize these consequences, and his protagonist is not one to ignore the moral dilemmas they raise.
In The Lesser Evil, for instance, Geralt refuses the offer of a job in which he would have to target someone based on the probability, rather than the certainty, of the person's guilt. He explains, “Evil is evil … Lesser, greater, middling, it’s all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I’m not a pious hermit. I haven’t done only good in my life. But if I’m to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.” Killing monsters is one thing, but conflicts between people are too gray for his liking.
Sapkowski has a knack for establishing believable characters who are interesting in their own ways. And they tend to subvert expectations. The saga’s female leads have their own motivations and drive, and they know to prioritize what’s important to them. They neither fall into the old trope of the helpless damsel in distress nor the newer trope of the strong female character, which reduces women’s personalities to a generic toughness. Instead, Sapkowski’s characters always come across as real people, who can be thoughtful, frustrating, charming, and infuriating alike.
It’s not surprising that Sapkowski’s writing found such a strong audience so quickly. His world is both human and fantastic, and its Polish flavor and acquaintance with Slavic legend add to its appeal. And it has inspired an incredible range of material, including one of the most talented bands I have ever heard, the Polish folk/metal band Percival Schuttenbach (named for a character from the Witcher novels), which uses medieval instruments and adaptations of traditional Slavic music from Bosnia to Russia to its own native Poland. In fact, when CD Projekt Red was adapting Sapkowski’s characters for its video game Wild Hunt, the company used Percival’s first two albums for much of the soundtrack. The music seemed practically ready-made for that purpose.
It is exciting to think of Sapkowski finally getting the attention he deserves in the English-speaking world. Even with what is lost in translation, the Witcher novels stand out compared to much of the genre and should interest readers who don’t usually care for fantasy. Andrzej Sapkowski refuses to coast on "destiny" or to make things run at the speed of plot; instead, he recognizes, as Geralt does, that good fantasy requires something more.

The culture war has come back to bite the media that made it

Texto completo: You'd think that when Donald Trump won the White House, in large part by bullying the press, journalists would have woken up to the fact that the culture war was already at their door, but, apparently, Charlie Warzel at the New York Times only just realized this week that the culture war, whatever that means, is already here for the media.
"The culture war will come for us all," Warzel writes in an opinion piece reflecting on the fracas surrounding reporter Felicia Sonmez. The Washington Post suspended Sonmez for sharing an old story about a rape allegation against Kobe Byrant just hours after his death, and, although the rest of the internet excoriated the reporter for insensitive timing, the Washington Post newsroom rallied around Sonmez, leading the paper to reverse its decision. Warzel astutely notes that newsrooms often hire writers specifically for their public profiles but then leave them out to dry when they err on social media, but it's his commentary on the internet mob, not media bosses, that's all the more telling.
"While the internet’s culture war dynamics are fraught, they’re not all that hard to understand," Warzel writes. "They come in the form of intimidation and threats toward journalists and angry campaigns toward advertisers and executives. Some of the responses are posturing and some are real, but all are engineered for maximum virality and outrage. Everyone’s exposed. But there’s an asymmetry to that exposure."
Yes, there absolutely is an asymmetry to the exposure of social media, that fertile ground for bad-faith rage to fulminate, but it's not biased against journalists. It's biased for them.
To understand the nature of this exposure requires understanding that, unlike culture clashes of the past, our contemporary "culture war" is more tribal or mob-driven than a sparring of values. There's a reason why the same mob that rails against Ben Shapiro, a conservative Orthodox Jew, also has knives out for Joe Rogan. It's also why alt-right and a specific, vitriolic wing of the Left so often join forces to try and take down figures such as Meghan McCain and Kyle Kashuv. Central to this culture war is not winning votes or hearts or minds. It's cancellation, or using social, economic, and litigatory forces to scare and shame people from any sort of civil discourse.
Consider, for example, when CNN bravely investigated the identity of an anonymous Reddit user whose GIF Trump later retweeted. The organization wrote that it wouldn't publish his identity because the Redditor seemed genuinely remorseful, but "CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change."
At least they never actually followed through on the threat. When the Daily Beast found the Bronx forklift operator who posted a "doctored" video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Facebook, it doxxed him.
But cancellation often has nothing to do with Trump or even with conservatism. When Carson King of Iowa, who had unexpectedly earned a million dollars from strangers for beer money donated it all to a children's hospital, Aaron Calvin of the Des Moines Register decided to dig up old racist jokes he had tweeted as a high school sophomore. Anheuser-Busch dumped its partnership with King as a result.
At least Calvin faced a reckoning when there was a widespread backlash to his hit job. After journalists botched the case of the innocent Covington Catholic High School students, many in the media continued. Further video showed that the students were victims of harassment, not perpetrators, but that didn't stop writers at Slate and Deadspin from vilifying them as "privileged" and "smug."
A free society requires a free press to serve as a check on the powerful, but for a free press to survive the passions of the people, it must remain fair. That doesn't include using massive public platforms to bully and harass anyone, especially private citizens and nobodies, who commit wrongthink.
And Warzel is absolutely correct that "angry campaigns toward advertisers and executives" damage democracy. Then why are the same activists screaming that Sonmez's life is at risk also rallying behind Media Matters's calls to shut down Fox News programming?
The media may not have started the culture war, but they made it metastasize. Maybe now that they're getting a taste of their own medicine, they'll reconsider if it's worth it.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump lost Colorado by 5 percentage points in 2016, and he’s on pace to lose it by more this year. His most recent approval rating there was 39%, according to Morning Consult.
His unpopularity creates a problem for Cory Gardner, a first-term Republican senator from Colorado, who will be running for reelection this year — which makes Gardner’s behavior during the impeachment trial especially striking. Rather than act as the senator he is, with his own power to shape events, Gardner has served as a Trump loyalist.
Gardner has not expressed skepticism about the obvious lies Trump’s lawyers are telling. Gardner doesn’t seem concerned about Trump perverting foreign policy for his own personal interests. And Gardner has shown no interest in hearing all the relevant evidence by calling witnesses to testify.
We now know that John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, heard the president demand the precise quid pro quo that he has since denied. For Bolton to be called to testify, however, at least four Republican senators would have to join with the 47 Democrats and independents to create a majority.
Gardner would seem to be an obvious candidate for one of those four. Yet media coverage typically overlooks Gardner. He’s simply assumed to be a Trump defender.
Gardner is making a bet. Even though many of his constituents — most, perhaps — believe that Trump has violated his oath of office, Gardner has evidently decided that he can safely ignore them.
In November, Colorado’s voters will get a chance to prove him wrong.
For more …
— Gardner recently dodged questions from a Denver television station about whether he would vote to call witnesses. He also refused to answer questions from The Denver Post about whether the Senate would call witnesses. “Silence has become the norm for Gardner on the topic of impeachment,” The Washington Post’s Justin Wingerter wrote.
— In October, Gardner issued a statement calling the House impeachment process a political circus. “I hope,” he said, “that everyone supports a fair and transparent process.”
— “Mr. Gardner’s invisibility — he hasn’t held a town hall-style meeting in two years — is also pragmatic, a means of avoiding questions about his ties to the divisive president, especially as the Senate impeachment trial nears,” The Times’s Elaina Plott wrote this month.
— Other vulnerable Senate Republicans who have shown little sign of supporting a full hearing of the evidence include Martha McSally of Arizona, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa.

Texto completo: It’s nothing but noise, all the time. We get hammered every second from an incessant sousaphone of tweets and from the righteous rage machine that screams at us in this digitized 24/7/365 communications world that we have built.
What you might not know is that we have long had a name for what started this all: “disruptive innovation.” The concept was pioneered by Clay Christensen, a high-profile and well-regarded Harvard professor of management who died of cancer last week at 67. Professor Christensen’s remarkable legacy grew out of a seminal book he published in 1997, “The Innovator’s Dilemma.”
The book covered esoteric industries like the disk drives market and excavating to analyze and illustrate the power of disruptive technologies. His ideas exploded through the then-nascent internet scene and throughout Silicon Valley. I recall reading an early copy and thinking that it was a manifesto that the tech world would embrace — and that Professor Christensen was tech’s prophet.
The Intel founder and chief executive Andy Grove was a fan. So was the Apple legend Steve Jobs. Both men were doubtlessly attracted to the idea that start-ups made up of outsiders could find ways to create new markets and new value — and disrupt and overwhelm established companies.
In the face of disruption, older companies could do almost nothing. It wasn’t that they couldn’t see the new threats of start-ups, but that they were stuck on serving their current businesses, and they failed to change their products and services out of fear of cutting into profits.
Professor Christensen’s formula was elegant: “First, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper; they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second, disruptive technologies typically are first commercialized in emerging or insignificant markets. And third, leading firms’ most profitable customers generally don’t want, and indeed initially can’t use, products based on disruptive technologies.”
It was that simple. Professor Christensen’s book came out a year before Google was founded, seven years before Facebook, eight years before YouTube and 11 years before Uber. Each of these companies, knowingly or unknowingly, would follow his map.
While Professor Christensen would go on to write a sequel and many more books on adjacent topics ripe for disruption, like education (“Disrupting Class” in 2008) and health care (“Innovator’s Prescription” in 2009), it was his initial idea that was devastatingly insightful.
I use the term devastate because, though no fault of Professor Christensen’s, disruptive innovation took a turn for the worse in tech. Silicon Valley failed to marry disruption with a concept of corporate responsibility, and growth at all costs became its motto. The more measured approach that Professor Christensen taught was ignored.
Thus, in tech, the idea was more like “destructive innovation,” which to me was distilled in Facebook’s famous sign that was once plastered all over the walls at its headquarters: “Move Fast and Break Things.”
I have always wondered why the company chose those words. I have no problem with “move fast,” which Professor Christensen would not have quibbled with, since being nimble was a core competency that he touted. It was the word “break” that stuck in my head like a bad migraine.
Why use a violent and thoughtless word like “break” and not one more hopeful, like “change” or “transform” or “invent”? And, if “break” was to be the choice, what would happen after the breaking? Would there be fixing? Could there be any fixing after the breaking? “Break” sounded painful. And, back to today’s subject, Professor Christensen never talked about that.
In fact, Professor Christensen’s approach was quite the opposite. He learned in 2010 that he had lymphoma, then he had a stroke. Within two years, he published the book that I like best, titled “How Will You Measure Your Life?” It is at turns spiritual and sometimes self-helpy, taking Professor Christensen’s management thinking and applying it to how to live a life.
This book should be newly relevant, as tech is casting about for its next act; we’ve been talking about the negative impact of tech’s disruptive innovations for a while now. Techies measure everything — and so Professor Christensen’s bracing prescriptions are perhaps perfect as the tech industry seeks redemption.
For example, he wrote:
“It’s easier to hold your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold them 98 percent of the time.”
And: “In fact, how you allocate your own resources can make your life turn out to be exactly as you hope or very different from what you intend.”
And, most of all: “Decide what you stand for. And then stand for it all the time.”
Perhaps the tech industry does not deserve the kind and good advice that Professor Christensen imparted, but it should take it anyway. That way, while he rests in peace, it could give us some, too.

Texto completo: Regarding President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the instant conventional wisdom is that it’s a geopolitical nonstarter, a gift to Benjamin Netanyahu and an electoral ploy by the president to win Jewish votes in Florida rather than Palestinian hearts in Ramallah.
It may be all of those things. But nobody will benefit less from a curt dismissal of the plan than the Palestinians themselves, whose leaders are again letting history pass them by.
The record of Arab-Israeli peace efforts can be summed up succinctly: Nearly every time the Arab side said no, it wound up with less.
That was true after it rejected the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan, which would have created a Palestinian state on a much larger footprint than the one that was left after Israel’s war of independence. It was true in 1967, after Jordan refused Israel’s entreaties not to attack, which resulted in the end of Jordanian rule in the West Bank.
It was true in 2000, when Syria rejected an Israeli offer to return the Golan Heights, which ultimately led to U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty of that territory. It was true later the same year, after Yasser Arafat refused Israel’s offer of a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which led to two decades of terrorism, Palestinian civil war, the collapse of the Israeli peace camp and the situation we have now.
It’s in that pattern that the blunt rejection by Palestinian leaders of the Trump plan — the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, denounced it as a “conspiracy deal” — should be seen. Refusal today will almost inevitably lead to getting less tomorrow.
That isn’t to say that the plan, as it now stands, can come as anything but a disappointment to most Palestinians. It allows Israel to annex its West Bank settlements and the long Jordan Valley. It concedes full Israeli sovereignty over an undivided Jerusalem. It conditions eventual Palestinian statehood on full demilitarization of a Palestinian state and the disarming of Hamas. It compensates Palestinians for lost territories in the West Bank with remote territories near the Egyptian border. The map of a future Palestine looks less like an ordinary state than it does the MRI of a lung or kidney.
Then again, much of what the plan gives to Israel, Israel already has and will never relinquish — which explains why the plan was hailed not only by Netanyahu but also by his centrist rival Benny Gantz. Critics of Israeli policy often insist that a Palestinian state is necessary to preserve Israel as a Jewish democracy. True enough. But in that case, those critics should respect the painful conclusions Israelis have drawn about just what kind of Palestinian state they can safely accept.
More important, however, is what the plan offers ordinary Palestinians — and what it demands of their leaders. What it offers is a sovereign state, mostly contiguous territory, the return of prisoners, a link to connect Gaza and the West Bank, and $50 billion in economic assistance. What it demands is an end to anti-Jewish bigotry in school curriculums, the restoration of legitimate political authority in Gaza and the dismantling of terrorist militias.
Taken together, this would be a historic achievement, not the “scam” that liberal critics of the deal claim. The purpose of a Palestinian state ought to be to deliver dramatically better prospects for the Palestinian people, not tokens of self-importance for their kleptocratic and repressive leaders.
That begins with improving the quality of Palestinian governance, first of all by replacing leaders whose principal interests lie in perpetuating their misrule. If Abbas — now in the 16th year of his elected four-year term of office — really had Palestinian interests at heart, he would step down. So would Hamas’ cruel and cynical leaders in Gaza. That the peace plan insists on the latter isn’t an obstacle to Palestinian statehood. It’s a prerequisite for it.
At the same time, it’s also essential to temper Palestinian expectations. The Jewish state has thrived in part because, dayenu, it has always been prepared to make do with less. The Palestinian tragedy has been the direct result of taking the opposite approach: of insisting on the maximum rather than working toward the plausible. History rarely goes well for those who try to live it backward.
For all the talk about Trump’s plan being dead on arrival, it says something that it has been met with an open mind by some Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They know only too well that the Arab world has more important challenges to deal with than Palestinian statehood. They know, too, that decades of relentless hostility toward the Jewish state have been a stupendous mistake. The best thing the Arab world could do for itself is learn from Israel, not demonize it.
That ought to go for the Palestinians as well. The old cliché about Palestinians never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity has, sadly, more than a bit of truth in it. Nobody ought to condemn them to make the same mistake again.

Texto completo: Republican defenders of President Trump’s impeachment justify his allegedly legitimate concern in insisting the Ukrainian president announce on CNN a criminal investigation against former Vice President Joe Biden for corruptly orchestrating the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
They claim Shokin had been actively investigating Biden’s son, Hunter, and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where he sat on the board of directors, for fraud. The argument follows that, based on an obvious conflict of interest, The vice president corruptly prevented any further investigation of his son or Burisma.
The counter argument by the Democrats is the allegation is baseless and Joe Biden did nothing wrong.
There’s little doubt Hunter got a sweet deal and he openly admits he was probably hired in large part because his last name was Biden and his dad was vice president. He also admits he was probably not the most qualified applicant to be considered because of his lack of experience in the gas industry. Nevertheless, he wasn’t a dunce. He was a lawyer educated at Yale and had served on other boards, including Amtrak and other nonprofit organizations. Still, being paid as much as $50,000 a month might admittedly be considered excessive.
That being conceded, he was a grown adult and didn’t require a father’s approval to get a job anywhere he wanted. Obviously, that kind of monetary incentive made the offer difficult to refuse for anyone even if it might put your dad in a difficult position.
There’s also no doubt Joe later bragged he got Shokin fired by threatening to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee by the United States unless he was. And Shokin was fired just a short time thereafter. Does it then follow that getting rid of Shokin excluded Hunter from being criminally investigated or at least solidified his position on the board by saving Burisma from further criminal inquiry.
First, let’s look at Shokin’s reputation as the Ukrainian general prosecutor working in that capacity off and on from about 1980 to 2016. He was apparently less than the criminal crusader he and the Republicans attempt to portray.
Shokin has been and still is closely associated with Dmytro Firtash who was a close ally of formerly corrupt and Russian-backed Ukrainian President Yanukovych. Firtash allegedly worked for organized crime involved in a fraudulent scheme involving the gas industry. He is currently fighting extradition to Chicago where he is facing fraud charges.
On Sept. 25, Joe Risen, national security journalist, noted, “The then-vice president [Biden] issued his demands for greater anti-corruption measures by the Ukrainian government despite the possibility that those demands would actually increase — not lessen — the chances that Hunter Biden and Burisma would face legal trouble in Ukraine.”
Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Kyiv-based Anti-Corruption Action Center, told Radio Free Europe that Shokin “dumped important criminal investigations on corruption associated with [former President Viktor] Yanukovych, including the Burisma case.” Furthermore, “Ukrainian prosecutors and anti-corruption advocates who were pushing for an investigation into the dealings of Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevskly, said the probe had been dormant long before Biden leveled his demand.”
Radio Free Europe reported, “Ironically, Joe Biden asked Shokin to leave because the prosecutor failed [to pursue] the Burisma investigation, not because Shokin was tough and active with this case.”
Internationally as well, Shokin was viewed as a corrupt prosecutor. The European Union, for one, welcomed his dismissal. Jan Tombinski, the EU’s envoy to Ukraine, said, “The decision creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the prosecutor general’s office. I hope that the new prosecutor general will ensure that his office becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.”
The new Ukrainian general prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko has stated he rebuffed an investigation of the Bidens demanded by Rudy Giuliani due to there being no evidence of wrongdoing by either. He told the New York Times that even though the positions held by Hunter and Joe could be a conflict of interest, that wasn’t illegal.
The vice president’s motive was based solely on rooting out corruption with no connected personal benefit. The motive by President Trump was personal and intended to buoy his re-election chances.

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump signed the revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law Wednesday, fulfilling a campaign promise to rewrite “one of the worst trade deals” in history.
“Today we are finally ending the NAFTA nightmare,” Trump said during a White House signing ceremony, calling the new trade deal a “colossal victory” for farmers, factory workers and other countries.
Much of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement simply updates the 25-year-old NAFTA, with new laws on intellectual property protection, the internet, investment, state-owned enterprises and currency.
But the 2,082-page pact also includes significant changes in several key areas, including provisions designed to incentivize car production in North America and open Canadian markets for American dairy farmers.
[ Read more: Trump says U.S., China have reached trade deal; Sunday tariffs off ]
It rolls back a special system of arbitration for corporations that has drawn bipartisan condemnation and also includes additional provisions designed to help identify and prevent labor violations, particularly in Mexico. Some of those changes were inserted at the insistence of Democrats, who used their control of the House to secure long-desired policy changes.
Here are highlights from the new USMCA.
Steering more car production to the United States
NAFTA required automakers to produce 62.5% of a vehicle’s content in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. The new agreement raises that threshold, over time, to 75%. That’s meant to force automakers to source fewer parts for an “Assembled in Mexico” car from Germany, Japan, South Korea or China. The pact also requires 70% of a vehicle’s steel and aluminum to originate in North America, with steel being both melted and poured on the continent.
For the first time, the new agreement also mandates that 40% to 45% of the parts for any tariff-free vehicle must come from a so-called high-wage factory. Those factories must pay a minimum of $16 an hour in average salaries for production workers. That’s about triple the average wage in a Mexican factory right now, and administration officials hope the provision will either force automakers to buy more supplies from Canada or the United States — or cause wages in Mexico to rise.
However, critics caution that factories may be able to game the rules by including some high-paid managers in their calculations. And there are risks to the changes.
Automotive analysts have warned that the wage provision could raise costs for U.S. car companies and car buyers, slowing the auto market and weighing on economic growth overall.
The final provision, as written, could also prove relatively ineffective at shifting production because it is not indexed to inflation. An average wage of $16 an hour will be less constraining in 2023 dollars than it is today.
Stronger labor rules in Mexico
USMCA includes expansive changes that, at least on paper, should help level the playing field between workers in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
NAFTA’s original provisions on labor and environment were added as side letters after the original agreement was signed, to win the support of Democrats and ensure the deal’s passage during the Clinton administration. USMCA moves these chapters into the main body of the trade agreement, meaning issues like the right to organize are now subject to the pact’s normal procedures for settling disputes.
The deal also expands those commitments, requiring more protections for workers, blocking imports of goods made with forced labor, and setting up mechanisms to ensure that those rules are enforced.
In response to the concerns of congressional Democrats, it sets up an independent panel that can investigate factories accused of violating labor rights and stop shipments of that factory’s goods at the border. It establishes an interagency committee to monitor Mexico’s labor changes, as well as American attachés who will report to Congress on the progress.
In an annex to the agreement, Mexico also committed to enact sweeping legal changes to combat forced labor and violence against workers, and allow for independent unions and labor courts. The International Trade Commission has estimated that, if the changes are made, they would increase wages for Mexico’s unionized workers and decrease their pay gap with American workers.
Less protection for drug companies
In a major concession to Democrats, the Trump administration agreed to pare back certain protections for an advanced and very expensive class of drugs called biologics. The final agreement removes a provision that had offered the drugs 10 years of protection from cheaper alternatives in both Canada and Mexico.
The agreement expands other protections for intellectual property rights, for example, extending the 50 years of protection for copyrights in NAFTA to 70 years. It also includes new criminal penalties for theft of trade secrets, including cybertheft.
In a major win for tech firms, it gives internet companies like Facebook and YouTube certain protections from lawsuits related to the user content posted on their platforms. It also sets new standards by prohibiting governments from asking tech companies to disclose their source code or put duties on electronic transmissions.
Wins for American cheese (and wine)
The agreement gives American farmers some additional access to foreign markets, particularly in Canada. It does not dismantle Canada’s so-called “supply management system,” which dictates how much Canadian farmers should produce so they can be profitable. But Canada did agree to eliminate a program that helps sellers of certain milk products, at home and abroad, and open its market to U.S. milk, cream, butter, cheese and other products. In return, the United States expanded access to its market for Canadian dairy and sugar.
It also creates a list of cheese names that Mexico and the United States agree can be marketed without restriction in their respective countries, and it forces grocery stores in British Columbia to stop their practice of selling British Columbia-only wines on certain shelves and stock U.S. wines alongside them.
— Ending a Special System of Arbitration for Companies
One of the biggest areas of contention stemmed from the mechanisms that companies and governments could turn to when they believed another party had violated NAFTA.
In a major change, USMCA rolls back a special system of arbitration that allowed companies to sue governments for unfair treatment. The provision was criticized both by the Trump administration, which said that it encouraged outsourcing, as well as by Democrats, who said it gave corporations too much power to challenge environmental and consumer regulations.
The system can no longer be used in disputes between the United States and Canada and is limited to disagreements between Mexico and the United States that involve a narrow range of industries, including petrochemicals, telecommunications, infrastructure and power generation.
Other systems for settling disputes between governments were basically maintained. The Trump administration ultimately gave up on an effort to eliminate the Chapter 19 provision, which gives the three countries a neutral way to challenge each other’s tariffs and other actions. The administration also gave in to Democratic demands for removal of a provision that would have allowed any country to block a case against it from moving forward, if it so wished.
But the USMCA retains a more controversial addition by the Trump administration — a sunset clause that requires the three countries to review, after six years, whether to remain in the agreement. If any country decides not to continue with the pact, USMCA will expire 16 years later.

Texto completo: Park City • When writer-director Benh Zeitlin was unexpectedly thrust into the middle of the Oscar melee in 2012 with his debut feature, “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” it was a surreal, discomforting experience filled with stiff tuxedos and awkward small talk — light years away from his ragtag existence in New Orleans, where he makes lyrical, atmospheric movies with his friends.
Zeitlin was soothed somewhat by the people he met on the trail: a sit-down with Daniel Day-Lewis, a kind word from Sally Field, an interaction with Martin Scorsese, who was struggling at the time with his edit of “Wolf of Wall Street.”
“It was cool to see someone that legendary be just as stressed as me when I was cutting ‘Beasts,’ ” said Zeitlin, a Hollywood outsider who before his Oscar run had visited Los Angeles only once in his life.
Eight years later, this onetime Oscar wunderkind finally popped back up at this year’s Sundance Film Festival with his sophomore effort, “Wendy,” a grassroots “Peter Pan” seen through the eyes of a liberated, adventurous Wendy Darling. Where had he been?

The pressures of the Oscar spotlight can be enormous. As nominees this year have surely discovered, becoming part of the Hollywood ecosystem comes with its own set of challenges, ones that often require you to conform to specific expectations rather than pursue your own creative endeavors. Zeitlin and another director who went through a similar experience, Tom McCarthy of “Spotlight,” resisted that pressure — and at Sundance in January, the results of their decisions were on display.
Zeitlin’s time among the glitterati had crystallized what he wanted his future to look like, and it was nothing like theirs. As the recipient of two highly coveted nominations — best director and best adapted screenplay (his film also drew a best picture nomination) — Zeitlin had earned an invitation into the club. He could have easily parlayed his success into a hefty studio payday, yet he chose a decidedly different route. He did hire an agent, temporarily, to fend off incoming offers, including the opportunity to work on a megabudget “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie for Disney. “He served as my bouncer,” said Zeitlin, now 37, who instead took his newfound cachet and created his own pirate adventure.
“When it became clear that we were going to have this opportunity to make whatever we wanted, we were like, ‘OK, we got to make the craziest one now, because who knows if they’ll ever let us back in,’ ” he said.
The Oscar visibility did buy him something: a bigger budget, a more ambitious palette and significant development money from his new studio partner, Fox Searchlight — the company that secured a first-look deal with the auteur when it paid $2 million for U.S. rights to “Beasts.”
He filmed on the islands of Montserrat and Antigua, on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula and in Louisiana. Postproduction lasted close to two years. And the film was made using the same unconventional approach he employed for “Beasts”: writing and rewriting all the way through production with his sister, Eliza Zeitlin, who also served as the production designer; casting nonactors to play the roles; and preferring practical magic — like using a thermite mixture to create underwater fire — to computer graphics.
Zeitlin debuted his film Sunday to mixed reviews. The Playlist’s Greg Ellwood said “Zeitlin’s talent to soar cinematically remains intact,” while Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote, “By the ninth montage of cliffs and shore and joyful screaming down a hill, it all starts to feel a little like a film-school reel.”
Zeitlin’s decision to spend so much time on his own arts-and-crafts project left many shaking their heads. They may be equally perplexed to see writer-director Tom McCarthy, who took on the Catholic Church in the best-picture winner “Spotlight” (2015), return to Sundance with “Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made,” a kids movie co-starring a computer-graphic polar bear that will debut on Disney Plus next week.
“I’ve seen a lot of people win Oscars, win best pictures, do that thing, and then it’s like they’re almost trying too hard to go back to the well,” McCarthy said. “I didn’t want to do that.”
The awards race marathon — which this year concludes on Feb. 9 — is a boon for the industry: Studios spend gobs to promote their best films, and the Hollywood ecosystem froths from the trickle-down economics. Everybody from trade publications to florists to limo drivers benefits from the awards industrial complex — everyone except maybe the talent. Yes, their star power rises in both ephemeral and concrete ways, but for those hellbent on creating their own destiny, the months away from their work can be dispiriting.
Zeitlin had been away from his New Orleans home for most of the year after the Sundance debut of “Beasts.” “I was both desperate to get home and desperate to get to work,” he said. “It was the first year I hadn’t created anything, and that was the most intense feeling.”
McCarthy also had moved his family temporarily to Los Angeles for his awards-campaign obligations. It was a “wholly uncreative” time, he said.
The 53-year-old director, who began his career as a character actor, had been warned years earlier that this would happen. Back in 2004, he had a toe-dip experience with the awards race when his directorial debut, “Station Agent,” vied briefly for accolades against Peter Jackson’s final “Lord of the Rings” installment. McCarthy kept running into the New Zealander on the campaign trail, and Jackson’s frenetic pace didn’t align with the rest of the nominees’ behavior. His secret: In between all the glad-handing he would hole up at a hotel in Los Angeles writing “King Kong” with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.
“He said to me, ‘If you can, cling to the work,’ ” McCarthy recalled.
Cut to 2016, and McCarthy found his creative reprieve two weeks before the Oscars, when his New York theater friend Brian Yorkey asked him to help out on a new Netflix series, “13 Reasons Why.” A surprising follow-up to “Spotlight”? Maybe. But the project was set to start shooting soon, and McCarthy could dive in, writing and directing on what would become one of the streaming giant’s most popular series.
“I really just wanted to work,” McCarthy said. “I didn’t have another movie ready, and I didn’t want to just jump into another movie.”
That same ethos has now returned McCarthy to Sundance 17 years after the festival launched his directing career. His friends have given him grief for giving up his indie cred; one text message read, “See you’re keeping it real at Sundance with your Disney movie.” He, too, is aware of the irony. For “Station Agent,” his producers gave out beef jerky as the film’s party favor. For the “Timmy” premiere, Disney created an ice sculpture of a polar bear.
Still, McCarthy finds no shame in making a kids movie. To him, chronicling the adventures of a quirky, complicated kid detective was just as invigorating as depicting the Boston Globe newsroom in “Spotlight.”
“This film was still a tremendous challenge, dealing with what does it mean to make a movie for 10-year-olds, and what does it mean to have a polar bear in the movie? Whenever I’m engaged like that, I’m happy,” he said.
Zeitlin’s grand experiment of keeping Hollywood at arm’s length has also meant he could maintain his single-minded approach to making movies. It helps that he’s changed very little since “Beasts.” He moved into a different rented house, though not a nicer one. He’s single. He doesn’t own a car or even a pet.
“My biggest fear is not being able to make my art,” he said. “If people don’t like my movie or whatever, knowing that I can always go home and live, and make things that I want to make has always been really important to me. So I’ve never taken on anything that would be a real problem if I lost it.”

Texto completo: Michael Taylor, the former Green Beret and suburban Massachusetts football coach who became a global sensation after reportedly orchestrating the brazen escape of former Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn from Japan last month, is now facing criminal charges.
On Thursday, Japanese officials issued an arrest warrant for Taylor, 59; his son, Peter Taylor, 26; and a longtime acquaintance, George Antoine Zayek, 60. The three are accused of helping Ghosn bypass immigration checkpoints during the escape.
In court documents, Japanese prosecutors allege Michael Taylor and Zayek were with Ghosn when he traveled nearly 300 miles from Tokyo — where he was under house arrest while facing charges of financial crimes — to Osaka. After hiding Ghosn in a large luggage container, the three allegedly boarded a private plane to Istanbul.
From there, media reports indicate, Ghosn was whisked overnight onto another plane that , which took him to Lebanon, a country where the former businessman maintains citizenship and which does not extradite its citizens to Japan.
Taylor did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Thursday.
Reached by phone Thursday, Steven J. Brooks, a Boston-area attorney who has represented Taylor in the past, said he was unaware of Taylor's whereabouts and, at this point, is not involved in the current case.
“I can offer nothing to the process at this point in time," he said. “I haven't spoken to Michael in quite a while."
The elder Taylor's connection to the Hollywood-esque plot was first reported earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal, which described in detail the efforts of Taylor and Zayek.
Among the new details laid out by Japanese officials, however, is the alleged involvement of Taylor's son, Peter, a former football player at Lawrence Academy who helped his father start a low-calorie sports drink company.
The Journal and The New York Times reported that prosecutors allege Peter Taylor had a significant role in the plot, having met with Ghosn on at least seven occasions in the preceding months, including on the day of the Dec. 29 escape.
Prosecutors believe the younger Taylor met Ghosn on the day before the escape and handed him a key to a hotel room.
On Thursday, the whereabouts of both Taylors remained unknown.
But with a now-real chance that Japan will seek extradition of the two, a return to the United States carries some risks for both Taylors. If Japan does seek extradition, the request could become an interesting test of the relationship between the two countries, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has more than most other world leaders cultivated ties with President Trump. .
“Japan is a close ally, and this is a huge national embarrassment" for them," said Joshua Levy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at the Boston law firm Ropes & Gray. “So my guess is this is going to get more attention at the [Department of Justice] if there's an extradition request than an average case."
According to Boston-area defense attorney Martin Weinberg, who has handled a dozen or so extradition cases, Taylor's fate could hinge on the particulars of the US-Japan extradition treaty.
To warrant extradition, Weinberg said, the alleged crimes in Japan must be the same as, or very similar to, crimes in the United States. Additionally, they must meet the requirements of the extradition treaty, as well as probable cause standards.
“I do think Taylor's got a position, if Japan seeks his extradition and if the US arrests him on a warrant, to defend himself," Weinberg said.
The Department of Justice, which handles international law enforcement matters for the federal government, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The Ghosn case is but the latest addition to Taylor's incredible resume and string of adventures.
In the early 1980s, Taylor, an Ayer native, spent time in Lebanon as a member of the US Special Forces, before leaving the Army with an honorable discharge in 1983 and going to work as a private securities contractor, the Globe recently reported, citing sources including court papers in an unrelated case. On various occasions, he was hired to help extract individuals from high-risk situations, including a young girl whose father had abducted her to Lebanon.
His undercover work with federal authorities was credited with once aiding in the seizure of $100 million worth of hashish from an international drug ring based in Lebanon.
But trouble also seemed to follow him.
During his work as an undercover informant in the hashish case, Taylor caught the attention of a Massachusetts state trooper who believed Taylor was engaged in illegal activity outside the realm of the undercover case.
Taylor, who also worked as a private investigator, was eventually charged with several felony wiretapping and related charges stemming from the trooper's investigation. He pleaded guilty in 1999 to planting marijuana in the car of a client's estranged wife and persuading an officer to arrest her, according to a 2001 Boston Herald story.
In 2011, Taylor was investigated for allegedly paying kickbacks to obtain Department of Defense contracts in Afghanistan worth roughly $54 million, according to court documents. After spending 14 months in a Utah jail, Taylor pleaded guilty to one count of violating the federal Procurement Integrity Act and one count of wire fraud.
Outside the shadowy world of his professional work, Taylor appeared to live a typical suburban existence. He played in a softball league and helped clear neighbors' driveways. For three years, he was head football coach at the posh Lawrence Academy in Groton — though that, too, would eventually result in controversy.
Shortly after his resignation in 2011, the Independent School League handed down various sanctions against the school, stripping it of two league titles won under Taylor. The academy's then-headmaster later acknowledged that several of its student athletes had been funded “beyond their demonstrated need."
In e-mails to the Globe earlier this month, Taylor declined to discuss any ongoing legal matters .At the time, Taylor said that he was traveling abroad but declined to say where. He did suggest, however, that his return to New England could be imminent.
In an e-mail to a Globe reporter on Jan. 9, he wrote: “I'll be glad to sit with you over a coffee and chat in the very near future."

Cal Thomas: Election campaigns that resemble endless wars

Texto completo: I love Ireland for its natural beauty, its people, its food (some of it), its music, its writers and especially its elections, which are shorter, less costly and designed to engage citizens and boost voter turnout.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
On January 14, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called a general election for February 8. That means a campaign of slightly more than three weeks. In the process, the Irish Parliament was dissolved. What a delightful thought. If only the U.S. Congress could be at least occasionally dissolved. It could use some dissolving, or at least disinfecting, after the toxic impeachment and trial of President Trump.
Unlike Irish politics, U.S. election campaigns increasingly resemble endless wars. Like those wars, campaigns cost too much and never seem to resolve the conflict.
Multi-billionaire Michael Bloomberg says he is willing to spend up to $1 billion of his fortune to either win the Democratic nomination, or if he doesn’t, to help the eventual nominee defeat President Trump. Recent presidential campaigns have cost over 1 billion (some estimates put the cost of 2020 ad spending alone at over $6 billion), so Bloomberg’s spending will ensure this year’s presidential campaign will set another record.
As soon — or possibly before — this election season ends, people will be talking about 2024 and 2028. It never ends and real problems are rarely solved.
The process begins with candidates establishing “exploratory committees” during which the “explorer” speaks about carefully poll-tested subjects and repeats them ad nauseum, while fundraising and appearing on TV.
Does any of this time and money spent produce real solutions to obvious problems, such as reforming entitlement programs and reducing debt? If it did, by now, wouldn’t those solutions have been implemented? The goal of too many politicians is not solving problems but getting elected and then re-elected.
All of this contributes to generally low voter turnout compared to other developed nations. This gives power to activists on both the left and right, which skews the results and gives no clear picture of where most Americans would like to see the country go. For example, consider how often the parties exchange power in Congress and the presidency. Why do we elect a liberal like President Obama and then eight years later elect President Trump, who has been enacting and promoting the conservative agenda?
Ireland isn’t the only country that has sane campaign and election practices.
In 1926, the longest Canadian election — from announcement to voting — was 10 weeks.
According to mic.com, an American internet and media company based in New York City that caters to millennials, “Election spending is strictly limited in the U.K. Each party cannot spend more than $29.5 million in the year before the election. The New York Times reported that the combined spending of both major British political parties in 2010 came out to around the same amount as the American presidential candidates spent … on expenses related to raising money in 2012.”
German political parties may not release more than one 90-second television political ad during a campaign. That would not please U.S. networks and local stations, which make a fortune from political ads. TV expenses in America are a major contributor to the escalating costs of campaigns, even though studies show the ads change few minds.
Brazilian elections are held on weekends, making it more convenient.
Not every country’s campaign and election practices may be worthy of copying in the U.S., but some are. Why can’t we learn from others to improve the process by which we nominate candidates and elect presidents? We can, but will we? A corollary question: What’s stopping us? The answer: only our lack of will.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The University of Maine at Farmington’s celebrated Visiting Writers Series opens the new year with a talk by filmmaker and writer, Caryn Waechter. Waechter will discuss her work at 7:30 p.m., Thursday, Feb. 6, in The Landing in the Olsen Student Center. Sponsored by the UMF Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program, the series events are free and open to the public.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-14471226" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/UMF-waechter-020620-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />
Waechter is a director and photographer based in LA. She is a graduate of Columbia University’s MFA film program where she concentrated in directing. Her first short film “BEAT,” shot guerilla-style on super 8 film in underground NYC clubs, marked her voice as “bold, mysterious and musically-driven.”
Her awards include New Line Cinema Award for Best Director for “God is Good” and Best Female Director from Tangerine Entertainment for her directorial debut feature film “The Sisterhood of Night” (2015), produced by Lydia Dean Pilcher (The Talented Mr. Ripley) and starring Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar films), Georgie Henley (Narnia films), Kara Hayward (Moonrise Kingdom) and Olivia DeJonge (The Visit) about teenaged girls finding their way through the digital age.
On the day of its theatrical release, The New York Times raved: “Caryn Waechter, the director, is impressive here in her first feature.” Waechter is also a main contributor to Ridley Scott and Kevin Macdonald’s YouTube documentary “Life in a Day” (masterfully cut by Arrival’s editor Joe Walker), where her footage on one specific day was picked from 80,000 submissions and 4,500 hours.
It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, where she was invited to talk about her shooting process live on YouTube. Her footage was then used in Clint Eastwood’s 2012 Chrysler Super Bowl commercial “It’s Halftime in America.”
Once a trained ballet dancer, Waechter shoots and photographs EDM festivals and New York City’s underground nightlife. Her sophomore feature “DeadCon,” a horror film about the horrors and isolation of being a social media influencer, just came out on Netflix. It was produced by Hyde Park Entertainment and Gunpowder & Sky.
Currently, Waechter has five projects in various stages of development.
More Information on the UMF Creative Writing Program
As the only Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program in the state of Maine and one of only three in all of New England, the UMF program invites students to work with faculty, who are practicing writers, in workshop-style classes to discover and develop their writing strengths in the genres of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. Small classes, an emphasis on individual conferencing, and the development of a writing portfolio allow students to see themselves as artists and refine their writing under the guidance of accomplished and published faculty mentors. Students can pursue internships to gain real-world writing and publishing experience by working on campus with The Beloit Poetry Journal, a distinguished poetry publication since 1950; or Alice James Books, an award-winning poetry publishing house.

Texto completo: Fotis Dulos, principal sospechoso en la desaparición en mayo de su esposa Jennifer en Connecticut, sigue hospitalizado en estado grave tras ingerir monóxido de carbono en un aparente intento de suicidio.
Mientras, un juez de Connecticut ordenó que Dulos sea arrestado una vez que sea dado de alta del Jacobi Medical Center de El Bronx (NYC) , donde está recibiendo tratamiento en condición “grave”.
El martes, la policía y los paramédicos se apresuraron a su casa de Farmington (CT), donde inicialmente se dijo que Dulos (52) había sido declarado muerto en la escena, según New York Times. Más tarde se informó que había sido hospitalizado en Connecticut en grave condición y luego trasladado a El Bronx.
Un día después de que Dulos fuera hospitalizado, ayer el abogado de su suegra, Gloria Farber, le pidió a un juez que designara a un cuidador para la enorme mansión de Farmington.
“Se considera que su condición es crítica, y se desconoce si Fotis Dulos sobrevivirá o no , o cuál será su capacidad mental o física en el caso de que sobreviva”, escribió Richard P. Weinstein el miércoles en una moción para la designación de un receptor.
Dulos, de 52 años, está acusado de asesinato en relación con la desaparición el 24 de mayo de su esposa Jennifer Farber Dulos (50), madre de sus cinco hijos, de la que estaba separado. Desde entonces los niños han estado bajo custodia de su suegra en Manhattan (NYC).
El sospechoso fue puesto en libertad después de publicar un bono de garantía de $6 millones de dólares a principios de este mes, recordó el diario Hartford Courant.
Dulos, un constructor de casas de lujo, está acusado de matar a su esposa en su casa, meter su cuerpo en su auto y conducir al parque Waveny de New Canaan. El cuerpo no ha sido encontrado.
La ex novia de Dulos, la hispana Michelle Troconis, está acusada de conspirar con él en el asesinato.
Un tercer acusado, el abogado Kent Mawhinney, amigo de Dulos, también fue procesado y detenido por conspiración en el caso.

Wegman: Who gets to pick the president?

Texto completo: Who elects the president of the United States?
In a democracy, that shouldn’t be a trick question. Thanks to the Electoral College, it seems like one. The American people cast their ballots on a Tuesday in early November, but on a national level that vote is legally meaningless. The real election happens about six weeks later, when 538 presidential electors — most of them average citizens chosen by local party leaders — meet in their respective state capitals and cast their ballots.
Nearly always, the electors vote for the candidate who won the most popular votes in their state. But do they have to? That’s the question that the Supreme Court has agreed to answer in two related cases it will hear this spring. The cases — one from Colorado and one from Washington — raise an alarming prospect: Can presidential electors vote for whomever they please, disregarding what the voters of their state said?
More than 160 “faithless electors” have chosen to go this route since the nation’s founding, a tiny fraction of all electoral votes in history. But the issue has become freshly relevant because of a concerted effort to persuade dozens of Republican electors in 2016 to switch their votes to prevent Donald Trump from taking the White House. In the end, 10 electors voted or tried to vote for someone other than their state’s popular-vote winner — the most in a single election in more than a century. (In 1872, 63 electors went against their pledge to vote for Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican candidate, but that was because Greeley died shortly after Election Day.)
Even though faithless electors have never come close to changing the outcome of an election, more than two dozen states have passed laws requiring their electors to vote for the state’s popular-vote winner. Some punish those who don’t, while others replace faithless electors with ones who will do the job they pledged to do.
Last May, Washington state’s Supreme Court ruled that the state had the power to impose a $1,000 fine on its four faithless electors, on the ground that the Constitution gives the states total authority to decide how to appoint their electors.
Three months later, a federal appeals court in Denver went the opposite way, ruling that the founders clearly intended for electors to act independently and vote according to their consciences, not to the dictates of any political party. Once a state appoints an elector, the court said, its power over that elector ends. They cannot punish someone, or replace him or her, for voting a certain way.
The Constitution doesn’t include any explicit guidance on the matter. So who’s right? In a way, they both are.
The framers of the Constitution, and the states that ratified it, clearly expected electors to vote as they pleased. In Federalist No. 68, Alexander Hamilton wrote that electors would be men “selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass” and “most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.”
And yet, the Electoral College has almost never worked that way in practice. Less than a decade after the Constitution was drafted, the framers’ idea of an independent elector was effectively kaput. As soon as national political parties took shape, elections became a partisan competition, and it was only logical that electors would start to take sides. In the election of 1796, electors were already pledging themselves either to John Adams, the sitting vice president and a Federalist, or to Thomas Jefferson, the former secretary of state and a Democratic-Republican. When one elector pledged to Adams changed his mind and voted for Jefferson, Federalists were outraged. One wrote, “Do I choose Samuel Miles to determine for me whether John Adams or Thomas Jefferson shall be President? No, I choose him to act, not to think.”
That’s been the operating assumption ever since, and it is almost never questioned. Even the term “faithless” is revealing: What faith is an elector who votes his or her conscience breaking? Didn’t the founders intend electors to be faithful above all to the country?
Yes — and yet they are not now and essentially never have been. For this reason, however the Supreme Court resolves the issue, which it will do by early summer, little will change in practice. Political parties and their candidates, who currently choose their own slate of electors in each state, are already careful about selecting people for their partisan loyalty. That selection process will only become stricter if the court rules that states may not interfere in any way with electors’ votes.
And faithless electors are unlikely to affect the outcome even if the Electoral College tally is very close, as it was in 2000, when as few as three Republican electors could have broken their pledges and handed the presidency to the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, who won the most votes nationwide. None did.
That makes sense. Americans would rightly revolt if a handful of people they’d never heard of ignored their votes and decided the election for themselves. It’s almost as if we believe that we, the people, should be voting directly for the president — the only official whose job it is to represent all of us equally, wherever we live. Which raises the question of why we still have an Electoral College at all.

PD Editorial: Without witnesses, impeachment trial isn’t complete

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is on trial in the U.S. Senate — and so are Republican senators.
If, as appeared increasingly likely on Thursday, wavering senators fall back into line and reject entreaties to hear from witnesses, Senate Republicans will be guilty of shirking their constitutional obligation to conduct a fair and impartial trial.
A trial without witnesses is no trial at all.
Trump’s acquittal, and his inevitable claims of exoneration that follow, will ring all the more hollow if the senators judging his conduct choose party over duty.
For months, the president has denied that he withheld $391 million in congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine, a U.S. ally fighting a war against Russian-backed rebels, while pressing for an investigation of Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate for president. In presenting their case to the Senate, Trump’s lawyers have repeatedly insisted there is no firsthand evidence contradicting the president’s assertions.
John Bolton says otherwise.
The New York Times reported this week that Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser during the period in question, wrote in his forthcoming book that the president told him directly he wanted to withhold financial assistance until Ukrainian officials complied with his demand to announce an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter, who had been on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.
Bolton also stated publicly that he was willing to testify, if subpoenaed.
Why would senators ignore his offer?
And why is the White House scrambling to block Bolton’s testimony with claims of executive privilege and to block publication of his book unless he does have information the president wants to keep from Senate jurors and the American public?
Trump’s allies are questioning Bolton’s motives. Bolton, no doubt, is interested in boosting sales of his book. And he may want to settle some scores with a president who sacked him via Twitter. But the former national security adviser is reputed to keep detailed notes, which could be subpoenaed as well.
Should he testify, Bolton would be questioned by the House manager and cross-examined by the president’s lawyers. His testimony would be delivered under penalty of perjury — and, it’s safe to say, there would be virtually no prospect of a pardon from President Trump.
Moreover, senators need not limit themselves to testimony from Bolton. Trump’s attorneys should have the opportunity to call any witnesses who can buttress his claims that his sole interest was rooting out corruption. More likely, they would ask to call one or both of the Bidens. As with Bolton, that’s a decision for the Senate.
Impeachment trials are rare. The Senate has conducted just 15 of them during the 231-year history of the republic. Every one of them has had witnesses. Trump’s would be the first if Republican senators stick to their apparent plans.
A vote could come Friday. It would take just four Republicans to ensure that witnesses are called. There’s a short list of senators who might choose principle over partisanship: Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio. Chief Justice John Roberts, presiding over the trial, would vote in the event of a tie.
If the Senate wants its verdict to be taken seriously, it needs to demand a full accounting before making a judgment.
Let the witnesses testify.

Texto completo: TEL AVIV, Israel
Given the timing of the release of President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, I have to begin by asking: Is this plan about two states for two peoples or is it about one diversion for two dirty leaders?
It sure feels like the latter. After all, both Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are, in effect, facing job-threatening charges — Trump for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and Bibi, who was literally indicted Tuesday, for fraud, bribery and breach of trust. They both had a huge need to change the subject and shore up their common base of right-wing Jews and evangelicals.
If I were Jared Kushner and had worked for three years on a peace plan — and was serious about it getting a fair and full hearing from all sides — there is no way I would have released it right now. This smells.
But then my long-held view has always been that the Middle East puts a smile on your face only if a change for the better starts with them. Camp David started with Israelis and Egyptians, and America was brought in only later. Oslo was started by Israelis and Palestinians, and America joined only later. Tunisia, the only Arab Spring country to make its way to democracy, is the one Arab country that America had virtually nothing to do with. For a peace initiative to be serious and sustainable, it should always start with them.
And yet, I also know that when America puts something this detailed on the table, it cannot be ignored, at least in the near term. Netanyahu already announced that with Trump’s blessings Israel will quickly move to apply its law (tantamount to annexation) to the West Bank’s Jordan Valley and all Jewish settlements in the occupied territory. It will be interesting to see how the European Union, which funds much of the Palestinian governing infrastructure in the West Bank, responds once it’s studied the plan, not to mention the reaction of everyday Palestinians and Arabs. (I don’t expect much. This conflict seems to have passed its fix-by date.)
OK, despite the obvious political motivation for the timing of the release of this plan, not to mention much of its substance, is there anything in it that would impress me that the Trump administration is actually serious about promoting a two-state solution — and actually has a strategy to achieve one?
Yes, if our president did something hard. What would that be? It would be his telling Netanyahu that before Bibi extends Israeli law to all these West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley, Trump wants one thing: an unequivocal public statement that Netanyahu accepts the fact that while Israel is getting East Jerusalem, more than 20% of the core West Bank, with all its settlements, plus the Jordan Valley, the remaining roughly 70% will become an independent Palestinian state, if Palestinians agree to all sorts of security requirements.
Trump needs to say to Netanyahu: “Bibi, you say that I am the most pro-Israel president to ever sit in the White House. This plan was written with your team. I have supported your maximum position — absorbing all the Jewish settlements into Israel and all of traditional Jerusalem, and with no return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. Now I need to know, the Palestinians need to know, and the world needs to know, that this is not your new starting position. Will you agree right now that the remaining land will be a Palestinian state if the Palestinians agree to demilitarization and recognize Israel as a Jewish state? Will you agree — right now — to make no further claims ever to the West Bank and not build another settlement ever outside the areas that the Trump plan assigns to Israel?”
If Trump were to spend just a little bit of political capital doing that, I might start to take this plan seriously. But if Netanyahu is allowed to evade that question or turns Trump down with no consequences, then this whole thing truly is a farce — it’s just the new baseline for Netanyahu’s next West Bank land grab.
Indeed, if Bibi says he still wants more than this plan gives him already — as ultranationalists in his coalition argue — then he is openly declaring before the president of the United States that his appetite is for all of the West Bank and that his vision for Israel is that it become a binational/apartheid state that will hold the 2.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank without full political rights.
This is the moment when we find out whether Bibi — who for decades has told American presidents, “Test me with a real plan and I will show you that I can be a great leader” — has any greatness in him whatsoever or is just a corrupt political hack looking to stay out of jail and will do any short-term maneuver necessary, regardless of its long-term effect on Israel, to do so.
Because if Bibi is serious that his ambitions stop at what he’s now gotten from Trump, then he needs a whole new domestic coalition — the ultra-zealots in his coalition will be up in arms — and a more moderate national unity government in Israel might even be possible.
At the same time, while I understand why Palestinian leaders are denouncing this plan, they should nevertheless try to make some lemonade out of these Trump lemons. It’s not as if they have a lot of great options, and their resistance to the Israeli occupation has gotten them nowhere. Palestinian leaders have been feckless and divided for some time; they boycotted the design of this plan. Still, if I were them, I’d tell Trump, “Yes, but we will use this plan as a floor in negotiations with Israelis, not a ceiling.” They would surely gain a lot of U.S., Arab and European goodwill for trying that approach. What do they have to lose?
But bottom line: Without Trump getting Netanyahu to definitively end his claims to all of the West Bank, and without Palestinian leaders able to reunite their disparate political factions in Gaza and the West Bank into a single body that can theoretically say “yes” to a fair outcome for their people while also recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, Trump’s Deal of the Century will join a century-old library of failed Middle East peace plans.

The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Harvey Weinstein callously preceded an alleged rape with reassurances that he'd had a vasectomy, one accuser testified Wednesday.
Another accuser on the witness stand at Weinstein's New York City trial said the one-time Hollywood titan tried trading movie roles for sex, claiming the lewd offer was the kind of thing that happened all the time in the film business.
Both were aspiring actresses in their early 20s when they met Weinstein more than 15 years ago, and both say he preyed on their vulnerabilities and dreams of stardom.
Choking back tears, Tarale Wulff told jurors there was no stopping the much larger Weinstein as he grabbed her by the arm, pushed her onto a bed and raped her at his apartment in 2005, during what was supposed to be an audition.
Wulff, now 43 and a model, said she froze, thinking that would make it "easier to get through, to get past it."
Dawn Dunning testified that the year before, Weinstein put his hand up her skirt and fondled her genitals during a meeting in his hotel suite about her fledgling acting career.
At another meeting, Dunning said, he offered to put her in three movies, but only if she had sex with him and his
Assistant.
"When he said that, I kind of laughed, I thought he was kidding, and he had kind of a crass sense of humor," Dunning testified. "But when I started laughing, he got really angry and started screaming at me. He said, 'you'll never make it in this business, this is how this industry works.'"
Dunning, now 40, said Weinstein went on to namedrop actresses Salma Hayek and Charlize Theron, implying they had done similar things to achieve success - something both women have strongly denied.
Hayek has said she had to fight off Weinstein's constant harassment and bullying. Theron was upset when some accusers said he implied they had slept together.
Wulff and Dunning's experiences with Weinstein are not part of the underlying criminal charges against him, but their testimony could be a factor in whether he goes to prison at the end of his landmark #MeToo-era trial.
Prosecutors called them as witnesses under a state law that allows testimony about so-called "prior bad acts," enabling them to explore things like motive, opportunity, intent and a common scheme or plan.
Weinstein, 67, is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on Mimi Haleyi, at the time a "Project Runway" production assistant, in 2006 and raping another aspiring actress in 2013. That woman could testify later this week.
Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual.
His lawyers raised doubts about Wulff's recollection after she disclosed that she had worked with a therapist for a year to fill gaps in her memory. Speaking to reporters later, Wulff's lawyer called that line of questioning a "red herring" and said her memory of being raped has never altered.
Weinstein's lawyers also questioned why Dunning waited until last summer to tell prosecutors that Weinstein had fondled her after she had gone public with the jobs-for-sex allegation, first in an article in The New York Times in October 2017.
Weinstein, who was subdued in his interactions with reporters during the trial's first week, seemed looser as he left the courthouse, proclaiming "It went great today. The lawyers killed it." He likened a portion of Dunning's testimony to bull excrement.
The jury of seven men and five women has already heard from Haleyi, who tearfully testified Monday that she tried to fight off Weinstein before he sexually assaulted her, and actress Annabella Sciorra, who testified last week that he overpowered and raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they agree to be named or gone public with their stories, as Haleyi, Wulff, Dunning and Sciorra have done.
Wulff testified that on an occasion before the alleged rape, Weinstein grabbed her arm as she served cocktails at one of his usual Manhattan haunts, led her toward a darkened terrace and started masturbating.
Wulff, who'd met Weinstein at the members-only club, said she froze and scooted around him to go back to the bar.
Dunning told jurors she met Weinstein while waiting tables at a different Manhattan night spot, one where bottle service was a trendy indulgence for the rich and famous.
Weinstein immediately appeared to take an interest in her fledgling acting career, she said, and invited her to a lunch meeting where, noting his infamous temper, she said he was "on the phone a lot yelling at people."
Several meetings followed, Dunning said, including one at a boutique hotel in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood where Weinstein was using a suite as a temporary office. At one point, she testified, Weinstein led her into a bedroom and put his hand up her skirt.
"I stood up. I was in shock," Dunning said, fighting back tears as she described the alleged incident when she was 24. "He just started talking really fast. He said, 'Don't make a big deal about this. It will never happen again.'"
Dunning said she "just kind of gave him the benefit of the doubt" when Weinstein said it wouldn't happen again. She said she didn't scream or yell and didn't tell anyone because she was embarrassed and didn't want to be a victim.
Dunning said that she later agreed to meet Weinstein at a cigar bar, but that an assistant took her to a suite where the producer was standing in a bathrobe.
There, she said Weinstein showed her a contract for three movie roles she would get on the condition she had "a threesome with his assistant."
Dunning said she didn't know what Weinstein would do after she laughed off the offer, so she ran for the door and down the hall to the elevator.
"He was a big guy. He was towering over me," she testified. "I was really scared."

And FRANK BAJAK
The Associated Press
GENEVA - Sophisticated hackers infiltrated U.N. networks in Geneva and Vienna last year in an apparent espionage operation that top officials at the world body kept largely quiet. The hackers' identity and the extent of the data they obtained are not known.
An internal confidential document from the United Nations, leaked to The New Humanitarian and seen by The Associated Press, says dozens of servers were compromised including at the U.N. human rights office, which collects sensitive data and has often been a lightning rod of criticism from autocratic governments for exposing rights abuses.
Everything indicates knowledge of the breach was closely held, a strategy that information security experts consider misguided because it only multiplies the risks of further data hemorrhaging.
"Staff at large, including me, were not informed," said Geneva-based Ian Richards, president of the Staff Council at the United Nations. "All we received was an email (on Sept. 26) informing us about infrastructure maintenance work." The council advocates for the welfare of employees of the world body.
Asked about the intrusion, one U.N. official told the AP it appeared "sophisticated" with the extent of damage unclear, especially in terms of personal, secret or compromising information that may have been stolen. The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity to speak freely about the episode, said systems have since been reinforced.
Given the high skill level, it is possible a state-backed actor was behind it, the official said. "It's as if someone were walking in the sand, and swept up their tracks with a broom afterward," the official added. "There's not even a trace of a clean-up."
The leaked Sept. 20 report says logs that would have betrayed the hackers' activities inside the U.N. networks - what was accessed and what may have been siphoned out - were "cleared." It also shows that among accounts known to have been accessed were those of domain administrators - who by default have master access to all user accounts in their purview.
Jake Williams, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec and a former U.S. government hacker, said the fact that the hackers cleared the network logs indicates they were not top flight. The most skilled hackers - including U.S., Russian and Chinese agents - can cover their tracks by editing those logs instead of clearing them.
"The intrusion definitely looks like espionage," said Williams, noting that the active directory component - where all users' permissions are managed - from three different domains were compromised: those of United Nations offices in Geneva and Vienna and of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
"This, coupled with the relatively small number of infected machines, is highly suggestive of espionage," he said after viewing the report. "The attackers have a goal in mind and are deploying malware to machines that they believe serve some purpose for them."
The U.N. is known to have been trying to patch its myriad IT systems for years, and Williams said any number of intelligence agencies from around the globe are likely interested in infiltrating it.
The hack was not severe at the U.N. human rights office, said its spokesman, Rupert Colville. "We face daily attempts to get into our computer systems," he said. "This time, they managed, but it did not get very far. Nothing confidential was compromised."
Clearly concerned that word of the hack could have a chilling effect on people reporting human rights violations to it, the office said in a statement issued later that it wanted to "assure all concerned parties" no sensitive information was compromised.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said earlier Wednesday that attack was "serious," compromised "core infrastructure components" and was contained. T he earliest activity appeared to have come in July and was detected in August, he said in response to emailed questions. He said the world body does not have enough information to determine the author but added that "the methods and tools used in the attack indicate a high level of resource, capability and determination."
Dujarric noted that the U.N. "detects and responds to multiple attacks of various level of sophistication on a daily basis."
Peter Micek, general counsel of the digital civil liberties nonprofit AccessNow, said U.N. leadership made a "terrible decision" from an information-security standpoint by denying staff information about the breach.
"It's best practice to alert people, let them know what they should look out for (including phishing attacks and social engineering) and inform them of what steps are being taken on their behalf," he said.
Otherwise, you are compounding the threat, and a missed opportunity for a teaching moment becomes an example of "intransigence and obfuscation, which is unfortunate," said Micek, who works with U.N. human rights workers to shore up their cyber-defenses.
The internal document from the U.N. Office of Information and Technology said 42 servers were "compromised" and another 25 were deemed "suspicious," nearly all at the sprawling Geneva and Vienna offices. Three of the "compromised" servers belonged to Human Rights agency, which is located across town from the main U.N. office in Geneva, and two were used by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe.
The report says a flaw in Microsoft's SharePoint software was exploited by the hackers to infiltrate the networks but that the type of malware used was not known, nor had technicians identified the command and control servers on the internet used to exfiltrate information. Nor was it known what mechanism was used by the hackers to maintain their presence on the infiltrated networks.
Security researcher Matt Suiche, the Dubai-based founder of the cybersecurity firm Comae Technologies, reviewed the report and said it appeared entry was gained through an anti-corruption tracker at the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime.
The report mentions a range of IP addresses in Romania that may have been used to stage the infiltration, and Williams said one is reported to have some neighbors with a history of hosting malware.
Technicians at the United Nations office in Geneva, the world body's European hub, on at least two occasions worked through weekends in recent months to isolate the local U.N. data center from the i nternet, re-write passwords and ensure the systems were clean. Twenty machines had to be rebuilt, the report says.
The hack comes amid rising concerns about cyber espionage.
Last week, U.N. human rights experts asked the U.S. government to investigate a suspected Saudi hack that may have siphoned data from the personal smartphone of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, in 2018. On Tuesday, the online civil rights sleuths at Citizen Lab published a report on the attempted hack of the T he New York Times's bureau chief in Beirut, Ben Hubbard, about the same time by a Saudi-linked group.
The U.N. human rights office is particularly sensitive, and could be a tempting target. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and her predecessors have denounced alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and in places as d iverse as Syria, Venezuela, Myanmar and Saudi Arabia.
Richards, of the U.N. Staff Council, complained of uncertainty over the safety of U.N. networks. "There's a lot of our data that could have been hacked, and we don't know what that data could be," he said.
"How much should U.N. staff trust the information infrastructure the U.N. is providing them?" Richards asked. "Or should they start putting their information elsewhere?"

Texto completo: Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey sent the strongest signal yet that he won't support calling witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, saying Wednesday he was "very, very skeptical" any witness could change how he would ultimately vote on Trump's political fate.
"As I've said from the beginning, my decision about a witness is going to be whether or not there is a fact in dispute that a witness can shed enough light on that it could resolve the dispute, and do so in a way that would change my mind about how I ought to vote on the final question," Toomey said. "And I'm very, very skeptical ... that that criteria is going to be met."
Toomey's stand on one of the only major questions left in the trial leaves Democrats with dwindling options when it comes to persuading Republicans to agree to call witnesses who might shed additional light on Trump's conduct with Ukraine. Democrats need support from at least four GOP senators to subpoena additional witnesses and documents, including John Bolton, the former Trump national security adviser who has reportedly written in a forthcoming book that the president was personally involved in a scheme to withhold military aid in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrat Joe Biden.
Bolton, who has said he would testify if subpoenaed, could be the first witness with firsthand information to directly link Trump to the plot. The revelation about his book has rocked the impeachment trial after weeks of Republican resistance to calling witnesses.
"Look, the public's going to hear it. They're going to read a book," Toomey said when asked if there's a public interest in having the former Trump aide testify under oath. "I expect that he's going to be doing a tremendous amount of media interviews. I think there's going to be a lot of information out there. The job before us is not to entertain, you know, all kinds of possible discussions about this. It's to evaluate the articles of impeachment that have been brought over by the House."
Toomey spoke to The Inquirer and the Morning Call of Allentown on Wednesday morning, the day after opening arguments in the impeachment trial concluded and as Republicans began to truly confront the question of whether any of them would vote to call witnesses. A vote on the issue is expected as soon as Friday.
Without witnesses, a final vote on impeachment could occur Saturday.
Toomey's vote against Trump's removal appears virtually certain. He said Wednesday that Democrats presented a "very weak case, a very badly flawed case," and that "I have not yet seen even the allegation of an act that rises to the level of impeachment."
Toomey's comments came one day after sources close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told reporters that Republicans don't yet have enough votes to block witnesses, a clear sign to those wavering to make their intentions known.
Toomey, who won reelection in 2016 by vowing to be "an independent voice" in the Senate and has criticized some of Trump's behavior and policies, largely echoed the White House and GOP arguments on this issue, including by raising questions about Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.
Democrats this week have escalated their insistence that Bolton be called to testify. The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton wrote that Trump personally told him he was withholding $391 million in military aid to Ukraine unless the country began an investigation into the Bidens, the central accusation in the impeachment charges.
Republicans are "tying themselves in all kinds of pretzel knots to avoid the truth," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday.
Toomey said that if witnesses are called, it would only be fair for both parties to have the opportunity to call them, and that the GOP would almost certainly seek to hear from Joe or Hunter Biden. He said Hunter Biden would be important because his past position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma offers another explanation for why Trump might have withheld aid.
"The House managers have rested a tremendous amount of their case on the notion that President Trump could not possibly have had any motive whatsoever for asking for an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens except his corrupt personal political motive," Toomey said. "But when you look at the facts involving Hunter Biden and Burisma, it's begging for an investigation about corruption."
He noted that Hunter Biden, with few qualifications, landed a lucrative seat on the board of the energy company while his father was vice president and spearheading policy toward Ukraine.
Democrats have scoffed at the notion that Trump was concerned about nepotism or corruption, noting that Trump only raised alarms about Burisma once Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential race.

Texto completo: BY ELANA SCHOR
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Bernie Sanders is approaching next week's Iowa caucuses in a position to become the first major-party Jewish presidential nominee in the nation's history. And at a time of resurgent anti-Semitism, he's talking in more depth about how his faith shapes his broader worldview.
Soon after the one-year anniversary of the massacre at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, Sanders penned a column on combating
Anti-Semitism that outlined how his family's history underpins his commitment to fight bigotry. After five New York Jews were stabbed while celebrating Hanukkah last month, Sanders used an Iowa menorah-lighting stop to connect his immigrant father's journey to America, "fleeing anti-Semitism and fleeing violence," to ideals he described as imperiled by attacks on Jews - and other minority groups.
Just last week, Sanders tweeted a video featuring his campaign's Jewish outreach director, Joel Rubin, discussing the Vermont senator's "intrinsically Jewish values."
Sanders has described his pride in being Jewish since his first Democratic presidential run in 2016. But he's known more for detaching from organized religion than embracing faith, and his model of Jewish American candidacy - aligning with "the tradition of Jewish social justice" while criticizing Israeli government policy toward Palestinians - breaks the mold cast by observant Jew Joseph Lieberman, the Democrats' vice-presidential nominee 20 years ago.
Sanders' increased engagement with his Jewishness comes as a Democratic super PAC unveils a six-figure ad campaign in Iowa challenging his candidacy and raising questions about his health.
Sanders "doesn't buy into that concept of anti-
Semitism and Jewish identity as defined by Israel," said Rubin, who joined the campaign earlier this month, in an interview.
The 78-year-old democratic socialist connected his Jewishness to his liberal policies during remarks last fall to J Street, a progressive Jewish American group whose conference drew five Democratic presidential candidates.
"If there's any group on earth that should be trying to bring people together around a common and progressive agenda, it is the Jewish people," Sanders said, adding that he believes in Israel's "right to exist in peace and security" and would extend the same right to Palestinians.
Sanders later raised a topic that promises to complicate his unifying vision of Jewish American values. Blasting conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told the audience: "It is not anti-Semitism to say that the Netanyahu government has been racist."
Sanders is hardly alone among Democrats in opposing Netanyahu's bid to annex West Bank settlements. But if Sanders prevails in the crowded Democratic presidential field - which includes moderate Jewish rival Michael Bloomberg - he'll face a president in Donald Trump whose messages about anti-Semitism and Jewish identity are closely connected to the Israeli government.
Trump signed an executive order last month that stoked debate over when criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti-Semitism. The president also continues to embrace Netanyahu, releasing a Middle East peace plan alongside him on Tuesday, and last year said Jews who vote for Democrats are disloyal to their religion as well as Israel.
If Sanders is pitted against Trump, who would court Jewish votes as an ally of Netanyahu's government, the senator would have to carve out more nuanced terrain as a proud Jewish critic of that government. Bloomberg offers a contrasting approach, declaring that he "will always have Israel's back" in a Sunday speech that poked at Sanders' 1960s volunteer stint on a leftist kibbutz in Israel.
Rubin acknowledged that Sanders is on the outside of legacy Jewish groups that view supporting Israel as sacrosanct.
"The Jewish establishment has a hard time looking at a Jewish politician who stands up for Jewish rights and makes it a Jewish American argument first," said Rubin, who was J Street's founding political director. But he asserted that "the predominant majority of American Jews" agree with Sanders.
A survey last year by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that 42% of Jewish Americans said Trump favors Israel too much. A similar share of Jewish Americans, 47%, said Trump strikes the right balance.
Even as Israel remains a polarizing topic, Sanders' candidacy underlines a point that many Jews can agree on: Jewishness means different things to different people, presidential candidates included. While he eschews organized religion, Sanders was bar mitzvahed in his youth and has said he believes in God.
"The Jewish community is not a monolith," Rabbi Hara Person, the Central Conference of American Rabbis' chief executive, said by email.
"It is certainly an important sign of progress in our country that Sanders is comfortable talking about and embracing his Jewish identity in the 2020 election and encompassing it as a value of who he is as a candidate," added Person, who said she is not endorsing Sanders.
Halie Soifer, who heads the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said that Sanders "identified himself in a way most American Jews can relate to" by linking his faith to his progressive agenda.
"Where there's a robust debate in our community relates to his policies on Israel, and in that regard, I don't know that his Judaism really comes into play," added Soifer, whose group is not endorsing a Democratic primary candidate.
Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic, even as Trump continues his outreach. According to AP VoteCast, 72% of Jewish voters backed Democratic House candidates in 2018 and 74% disapproved of Trump's handling of his job.
Rubin described his job with the Sanders campaign as three-fold, energizing Sanders' existing Jewish American supporters while also fielding challenges on high-priority Jewish issues and convincing new supporters that Sanders' perspective is worth their time.
He may have a particularly tough road ahead with Jewish groups alienated by Sanders' use of campaign surrogates who have made polarizing remarks about Israel-Palestinian relations.
Among those divisive figures is Muslim-American activist Linda Sarsour, who last month had to clarify her remarks after saying that Israel "is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else." Among the prominent Jewish Americans who pushed back was the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, who tweeted that her remarks were "anti-Semitism plain and simple."
Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic strategist who heads the group Democratic Majority for Israel, said that "it's fair to say (Sanders) is greatly concerned by" rising anti-Semitism. But he warned that Sanders' use of surrogates whose remarks on Israel have offended some Jewish Americans reflects a blind spot.
"There's something wrong with somebody who professes to be concerned about anti-Semitism" but won't disavow it when it comes from within his own camp, Mellman said.
His group's separate political action committee is running an ad against Sanders this week that does not mention Israel but raises doubts about the candidate's health after a heart attack last fall. The Sanders campaign raised more than $1.3 million in the day since it began using the ad to rally supporters, a figure first reported by The New York Times.

Texto completo: Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey sent the strongest signal yet that he won't support calling witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial, saying Wednesday he was "very, very skeptical" any witness could change how he would ultimately vote on Trump's political fate.
"As I've said from the beginning, my decision about a witness is going to be whether or not there is a fact in dispute that a witness can shed enough light on that it could resolve the dispute, and do so in a way that would change my mind about how I ought to vote on the final question," Toomey said. "And I'm very, very skeptical ... that that criteria is going to be met."
Toomey's stand on one of the only major questions left in the trial leaves Democrats with dwindling options when it comes to persuading Republicans to agree to call witnesses who might shed additional light on Trump's conduct with Ukraine. Democrats need support from at least four GOP senators to subpoena additional witnesses and documents, including John Bolton, the former Trump national security adviser who has reportedly written in a forthcoming book that the president was personally involved in a scheme to withhold military aid in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrat Joe Biden.
Bolton, who has said he would testify if subpoenaed, could be the first witness with firsthand information to directly link Trump to the plot. The revelation about his book has rocked the impeachment trial after weeks of Republican resistance to calling witnesses.
"Look, the public's going to hear it. They're going to read a book," Toomey said when asked if there's a public interest in having the former Trump aide testify under oath. "I expect that he's going to be doing a tremendous amount of media interviews. I think there's going to be a lot of information out there. The job before us is not to entertain, you know, all kinds of possible discussions about this. It's to evaluate the articles of impeachment that have been brought over by the House."
Toomey spoke to The Inquirer and the Morning Call of Allentown on Wednesday morning, the day after opening arguments in the impeachment trial concluded and as Republicans began to truly confront the question of whether any of them would vote to call witnesses. A vote on the issue is expected as soon as Friday, after senators spend Wednesday and Thursday posing questions to impeachment managers and the White House defense team.
Without witnesses, a final vote on impeachment could occur Saturday.
Toomey's vote against Trump's removal appears virtually certain. He said Wednesday that Democrats presented a "very weak case, a very badly flawed case," and that "I have not yet seen even the allegation of an act that rises to the level of impeachment."
Toomey's comments came one day after sources close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told reporters that Republicans don't yet have enough votes to block witnesses, a clear sign to those wavering to make their intentions known.
Toomey, who won reelection in 2016 by vowing to be "an independent voice" in the Senate and has criticized some of Trump's behavior and policies, largely echoed the White House and GOP arguments on this issue, including by raising questions about Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.
Democrats this week have escalated their insistence that Bolton be called to testify. The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton wrote that Trump personally told him he was withholding $391 million in military aid to Ukraine unless the country began an investigation into the Bidens, confirming the central accusation in the impeachment charges.
Republicans are "tying themselves in all kinds of pretzel knots to avoid the truth," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday.
He accused the GOP of prioritizing Trump's acquittal above seeking more information. "Talk about being political. Talk about being cynical. ... We, the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, have an obligation to seek the truth. A fair trial matters, whatever the outcome."
Toomey said that if witnesses are called, it would only be fair for both parties to have the opportunity to call them, and that the GOP would almost certainly seek to hear from Joe or Hunter Biden. He said Hunter Biden would be important because his past position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma offers another explanation for why Trump might have withheld aid.
"The House managers have rested a tremendous amount of their case on the notion that President Trump could not possibly have had any motive whatsoever for asking for an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens except his corrupt personal political motive," Toomey said. "But when you look at the facts involving Hunter Biden and Burisma, it's begging for an investigation about corruption."
He noted that Hunter Biden, with few qualifications, landed a lucrative seat on the board of the energy company while his father was vice president and spearheading policy toward Ukraine.
Democrats have scoffed at the notion that Trump was concerned about nepotism or corruption, noting that Trump only raised alarms about Burisma once Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential race. Trump also pressured Ukraine to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory about 2016 election interference.
Joe Biden, as vice president, led a push to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor while his son sat on the energy company's board. But Biden was carrying out the official policy of the United States and its European allies in trying to oust a prosecutor noted for being soft on corruption. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing, and the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time.
Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) said that despite Hunter Biden's Burisma job, the Trump administration approved 45 installments of aid to Ukraine worth $1.5 billion until June 2019, a few months after Joe Biden became a presidential candidate.
"Hunter Biden is irrelevant and a distraction," Schumer said.
One Democrat, the moderate Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has partnered with Toomey in the past in pushing gun control legislation, said Wednesday morning on MSNBC that Hunter Biden would be a relevant witness to call.
Earlier this week, Toomey had reportedly floated a proposal with Republican colleagues that would essentially amount to a witness trade, in which each party would get to call one witness. Democrats sharply criticized that idea on Tuesday.
Toomey said that he was not advocating for additional witnesses, only saying that if there were any called, both parties should do so.

Texto completo: Companies in Minnesota and across the U.S. are starting to see disruptions caused by the fast-growing outbreak of a pneumonialike coronavirus that has shut down business in some of China's largest cities.
Minnesota companies such as 3M, Medtronic and Cargill said they have not yet had major issues, but they have adjusted their operations and are ready to pivot should the situation change. Polaris said on a conference call that shipments from its suppliers are still getting to the U.S., but the recreational vehicle maker is unable to send employees there to work out future deals.
Other U.S. companies are signaling more serious consequences. Ford and Toyota said they are idling some of their vast Chinese assembly plants for an extra week. Apple is rerouting supply chains, and Starbucks has closed more than half of its 4,292 stores in its second-biggest market and said it would take a quarterly and full-year financial hit.
On Wednesday, British Airways suspended all flights to mainland China, while United Airlines, American Airlines and Air Canada are joining the growing number of carriers reducing service.
The full extent of the hit to the broader business world is not yet clear. Most of China had already been shut down since at least Friday for the annual Lunar New Year holiday, a weeklong nationwide hiatus. But with the outbreak showing no signs of slowing, many companies are already preparing for a longer slowdown.
"Our members are dealing with varying degrees of disruption in their businesses, including supply chain issues, temporary closings of some retail outlets and factories, and other challenges," said Jake Parker, senior vice president of the US-China Business Council, which represents major companies. "If travel restrictions and quarantines are expanded or the holiday extended beyond Feb. 8, that will amplify these problems."
China has become an essential part of the modern global industrial machine. China alone accounts for roughly one-sixth of global economic output. It is the world's largest manufacturer and trader.
But China's importance goes beyond what it makes. Its consumers buy more cars and smartphones than anybody else. When they go abroad, Chinese tourists spend $258 billion a year, according to the World Tourism Organization, nearly twice what Americans spend.
China has cut off access to the central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. That has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The outbreak has infected nearly 8,000 on the mainland and abroad and has killed more than 150 people.
Minnetonka-based Cargill Inc. has a large and growing presence throughout China, including in Hanchuan, about 10 miles west of Wuhan. The global agribusiness is asking its employees to cancel business travel to Wuhan and Hubei Province, where the outbreak originated, until the outbreak is better understood.
"The safety and well-being of our colleagues is our top priority," said April Nelson, a Cargill spokeswoman. "We also have flexible work options and support services for any employees that have been exposed to coronavirus or have traveled to Wuhan."
Before the outbreak, several Minnesota companies, including Cargill and Austin-based Hormel Foods Corp., had planned to suspend production for the Lunar New Year.
Hormel will resume production, as planned, on Monday and is asking all of its office workers in China to work from home an additional week until Feb. 10.
Cargill's workers throughout China are just now returning to work from the holiday. The company said it will further suspend production or temporarily close offices if needed.
Medical-device maker Medtronic, which is run from offices in Fridley, said the virus has had no direct impact on its workers in China nor its operations in the country, though the situation remains "fluid."
China is a major manufacturing and research location for Medtronic. The med-tech company has 843,000 square feet of manufacturing and R&D space in the country, according to securities filings. China is also one of Medtronic's four largest markets for sales, along with the U.S., Western Europe and Japan.
"While we continue to support our employees in the region, Medtronic is also contributing to efforts in China through donations of medical technology and supplies to support patient treatment and recovery," spokesman Ben Petok said in an e-mail. "This is a dynamic event and we will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates to our employees and customers as the situation warrants."
3M has ramped up production of its respiratory masks at factories in China and elsewhere to meet the steep demand because of the coronavirus. Like Medtronic, the Maplewood-based company also has donated masks and other health care supplies.

Texto completo: A free and independent press is, and should always be, an impenetrable bulwark of our democracy. "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter," wrote Thomas Jefferson in a 1789 letter. The media's hallowed role, embodied in the First Amendment, assures near-total freedom to report (and even misreport) the news.
Press freedom, however, implies a responsibility to place truth above narrow partisan campaigns. That's why editorial and commentary pages must be kept separate from news reporting. That separation has often been breached, but certain prominent news organizations have branded themselves clarions of truth. The New York Times long nurtured such a reputation. So it is profoundly disappointing to see the Times's news pages increasingly corrupted by the political views of its reporters and editorialists.
Candor requires that I note my own lack of objectivity. For complex reasons, I have been the object of unfounded and vicious attacks by the Times for more than three decades. An article in October falsely suggested that I had intervened to obtain opportunity-zone status for the 107,000-acre Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, or TRIC, to benefit what the Times said was my minority investment in a partnership holding 688 acres of raw land in TRIC. (It's my longstanding practice not to divulge what's in my portfolio.) The singular focus on this tiny sliver of the 107,000 acres makes no sense. TRIC's 99.4% owners include Tesla, Google, Panasonic, Walmart, Blockchains, Berkshire Hathaway, Switch and other giant companies that have spent billions of dollars at TRIC and have lobbied on its behalf.
I had no knowledge about the extensive activities of the major corporate owners, their lobbyists or advisers. I am not a manager, director or officer of the partnership that owns 688 acres. Yet the Times ignored the major corporate owners to focus on me, a clear indication of their intent to deceive their readers. I can take care of myself, but I'm concerned about all those other victims caught in the middle of partisan mudslinging by the institutions that claim dedication to the truth.
As Fred Smith, founder and CEO of FedEx, wrote in these pages in November, the Times attacked his company by "printing selected facts, connecting unrelated events, and implying nefarious activities when there were none whatever." That's exactly what the Times did to me last fall in a long article about Nevada real estate investments. Mr. Smith's complaint centered on provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its benefits to FedEx that the Times asserted were unfair.
A different provision of the act established opportunity zones, which provide incentives for private capital to create jobs and assist families in economically depressed areas. It appears the Times doesn't like the opportunity-zone concept. They and others might prefer direct government assistance rather than incentives to private capital. While reasonable people have taken principled positions on both sides of this debate, it's a problem when a newspaper violates its mission by carrying editorial views over to the news pages.
This is part of the Times's multiyear campaign opposing virtually every initiative of the Trump administration. The paper attacked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whose department oversees opportunity zones. Then it determined it could conjure a news story virtually out of thin air if it could link Mr. Mnuchin in some way to a private citizen who might benefit from provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Apparently I fit the bill, and the paper deployed six reporters and researchers for several months looking for dirt. They didn't find any—I did none of the things they hinted at. But the editors weren't about to let an absence of facts kill a breathless front-page exposé about how I and other investors stood to "Profit From Trump Tax Break for Poor Areas." The Times claimed, wrongly, that the Treasury secretary directed regulatory changes for my benefit. Not only did he not make the changes for my benefit, the changes didn't benefit me. The article reached false conclusions by claiming that mere coincidences proved intent, or by conflating events that occurred months apart in a dizzying feat of obfuscation. This ignored the public record of what really happened.
This is irresponsible journalism. The Times, which sometimes seems to exist in an alternate universe, knew before publication that important conclusions and implications in the article about me were wrong because we and the U.S. Treasury gave them every relevant fact. I've never spoken to Mr. Mnuchin, any other government official or anyone else about putting TRIC in an opportunity zone; I have never authorized anyone to act for me on that matter and no one has ever asked me to take any action related to it; I had no knowledge of any lobbying to put TRIC in an opportunity zone.
We gave the Times these and many other facts. They, and anyone with an internet connection, could have easily found the truth. I asked my lawyers to do just that by retaining someone to go online and figure out the real story from the public record. In three days this person found a deep trove of facts that the Times's six reporters had apparently chosen to ignore. Anyone who wants to know the truth can find an article telling the real story plus a fact sheet and timeline at www.mikemilken.com . These documents provide a sobering antidote to the errors, omissions, deceptions and bias in the Times article.
The Times has now sent my office new questions that suggest another article is in the works. I will vigorously counter any further journalistic mendacity with hard facts and, where appropriate, other actions. But the greater risk is that no one is safe when a previously respected news organization deploys its considerable resources to twist the truth. Keep that in mind as you read future articles attacking opportunities for upward mobility through job creation.

Resumen: "American Dirt" has been criticized for its depiction of Mexicans. Here are 8 books by Latin American authors to read instead.

Texto completo: What was supposed to be a grand literary reception has turned into something of a debacle.
Jeanine Cummins’ border-crisis book "American Dirt" had a lot of star power behind its release last week, including Oprah Winfrey’s: She chose it for her book club.
Slam dunk, right?
But the criticism immediately started coming in hard and fast, with many arguing the books' depictions of Mexicans are insensitive and flawed. Complicating the issue is Cummins' own ethnicity: She identified as white in an op-ed for The New York Times in 2016 (though recently she has also claimed Puerto Rican ancestry), and has no Mexican heritage.
A petition signed by 124 writers, including such prominent names as Luis Alberto Urrea, Carmen Maria Machado and Viet Thanh Nguyen, asks Winfrey to reconsider her book club selection. The outcry has been so passionate, publisher Flatiron has canceled Cummins’ book tour, citing security concerns.
More on 'American Dirt':The controversial book endorsed by Oprah continues to garner criticism
I was among those who found the book problematic. I especially objected to Cummins’ author’s note justifying her decision to write the book. “I was worried that, as a nonimmigrant and non-Mexican, I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico, set entirely among immigrants,” Cummins writes. “I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it. ”
Lots of someones “slightly browner” than Cummins have written excellent books about the issues that “American Dirt” attempts to tackle: undocumented immigration, the U. S. -Mexico border crisis and violence in South America, among others.
The book debuted at No. 2 on the USA TODAY Best-Sellers List, so chances are, you may have read it by now and formed your own opinion. It might differ from mine. Wherever you fall on the “American Dirt” divide, consider adding these eight recently published books written by Latin American authors to your reading list.
1. “Lost Children Archive,” by Valeria Luiselli (Knopf, fiction)
What it's about: A mother, father and two children set out on a road trip from New York to Arizona. The father is researching Apache culture and the mother is creating an audio documentary on children in the border crisis – a crisis they themselves get caught up in when their children go missing. The book was awarded an Andrew Carnegie Medal for excellence in fiction.
2. “Children of the Land,” by Marcelo Hernandez Castillo (Harper, nonfiction)
What it's about: A Mexican-born poet turns to prose to recount his family’s struggle to become American citizens, the stress of hiding in plain sight and the often-dehumanizing immigration system. Kirkus Reviews calls it “a heartfelt and haunting memoir just right for the current political and social climate. ”
3. “Where We Come From,” by Oscar Casares (Knopf, fiction)
What it’s about: After his mother’s sudden death, 12-year-old Orly is sent to spend the summer with his aunt in the Texas border city of Brownsville. There he finds his aunt’s house turned into a way station for coyotes moving immigrants across the border. A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says the book “delivers a truly timeless emotional punch. ”
4. “Fruit of the Drunken Tree,” by Ingrid Rojas Contreras (Doubleday, fiction)
What it’s about: Inspired by her own life, this Colombian writer sets her story in her birth country at the height of drug lord Pablo Escobar’s reign of terror, where two young girls, their mother and a mysterious teenage maid live in constant threat of violence. “This striking novel offers an atmospheric journey into the narrow choices for even a wealthy family as society crumbles around them,” says Publishers Weekly.
5. “A Dream Called Home,” by Reyna Grande (Atria, nonfiction)
What it’s about: Grande, a former undocumented Mexican immigrant, shares her quest to find her place in America as a first-generation Latina university student in this inspiring memoir. She’s also the author of “The Distance Between Us,” a memoir about her childhood spent torn between two parents and two countries.
6. “Everyone Knows You Go Home,” by Natalia Sylvester (Little A, fiction)
What it's about: On the day of her wedding, Isabel meets the ghost of her father-in-law, who reappears in search of redemption every Day of the Dead. Isabel gradually learns the family’s history in a story that poses questions about borders and belonging. “A forceful record of migration within a family and the dangers and triumphs of our undocumented population,” says Kirkus Reviews.
7. “Citizen Illegal,” by José Olivarez (Haymarket, poetry)
What it’s about: The son of Mexican immigrants, Olivarez celebrates his Mexican-American identity and examines how those two sides conflict in a striking collection of poems. Publishers Weekly calls it a “devastating debut. ”
8. “In the Country We Love: My Family Divided,” by Diane Guerrero (Henry Holt and Co. , nonfiction)
What it’s about: “Orange Is the New Black” and "Jane the Virgin" actress Guerrero was 14 years old when her parents were deported. Guerrero, who was born in the U. S. , stayed behind. Here, she tells her story of resilience in the face of adversity, and coming of age without the two people she needed most. Kirkus Reviews calls it “a moving, humanizing portrait of the collateral damage caused by America’s immigration policy. ”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As the Senate debated whether to prolong his impeachment trial, President Donald Trump traveled to Iowa Thursday to troll his Democratic rivals days before the state's voters cast a ballot to nominate his challenger in November.
“The good people of Iowa have had a front-row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left," said Trump, who is rallying in Des Moines on the eve of a pivotal vote that will decide whether senators will hear witnesses in the trial.
Less than 10 minutes into his remarks, Trump mocked Joe Biden's alleged forgetfulness, the pronunciation of Pete Buttigieg's name, cracked a joke about Mike Bloomberg's height and slammed the former New York mayor for skipping early states.
Trump lambasted Democrats as a party "run by left-wing extremists,” before turning his attention to the impeachment trial underway back in Washington.
Trump called Democrats "totally sick" and predicted that Republicans in the Senate were going to treat him "very fairly. "
"Watch," Trump said. "Just watch. "
Embracing harsh rhetoric to describe Democrats, Trump claimed that his rivals wanted to "nullify your ballots, poison our Democracy and overthrow the entire system of government. "
Trump is rallying in Iowa four days before Democrats there hold the nation's first presidential nominating caucus. Though Trump doesn't face a serious challenge for the nomination in Iowa or anywhere else, the president's campaign has described the event as a "good workout for our ground game" ahead of the November general election.
Trump also touted his recent trade agreements with China, Mexico and Canada. Trump signed a "phase one" trade agreement with China that lifts some tariffs in exchange for Beijing agreeing to purchase billions more in U. S. agricultural products.
"You're going to make a lot of money," Trump told the crowd. "You're going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. "

The rally is the president's fourth in 2020, and it marks his first return to Iowa since he traveled there in June to tout his efforts to promote gasoline with higher blends of ethanol – a popular position with many Iowa farmers. The president has scheduled a rally in New Hampshire early next month ahead of that state's primary.
"If we don't win, your farms are going to hell," he warned.
Five Democratic presidential candidates crossed the state Thursday to make their final pitches. Also in Iowa were Biden, Buttigieg, John Delaney, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang.
Biden claimed that the Trump campaign is focusing so much on Iowa because the president is afraid of his reelection chances.
"Well, folks, look, what do you think? It seems to me that they’re trying to smear me to try to stop me because they know if I’m the nominee I will beat Donald Trump," Biden said.
More: Deemocratic candidates, in Iowa on the same day as Trump, claim they they can beat the president
Earlier, the former vice president told Iowans that "character is on the ballot" this year.
"The American people are good, decent, honorable people and given half a chance, they’ve never, ever, ever let their country down," Biden said. "They deserve a president who tells them the truth, not lie after lie after lie. "
Bernie Sanders tweeted earlier Thursday that: "In just four days the people of Iowa will take the first stand against the divisiveness and bigotry of Donald Trump. "
Thursday's rally set up a split-screen moment between the president and the ongoing trial, where senators lobbed questions at White House lawyers and Democratic impeachment managers for a second day. The Senate could vote as soon as Friday on whether to extend that trial by calling witnesses.

Iowa: Trump plans show of GOP force in Iowa at pivotal phase in impeachment trial
Trump's visit to Iowa initially appeared to offer the president an opportunity to take a victory lap. Senate Republican leaders had signaled the impeachment trial could wind down as soon as Friday, potentially yielding the long-expected acquittal on charges that Trump abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine.
But that timeline was thrown into question earlier this week when The New York Times reported that a forthcoming memoir by former Trump national security adviser John Bolton alleges the president demanded Ukraine officials open an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in exchange for U. S. foreign aid.
The allegation was at the center of Trump's impeachment, and the bombshell revelation left some centrist senators open to extending the trial by calling Bolton and potentially other witnesses. It's not clear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the votes to block the calling of witnesses.
Supporters began lining up at the Knapp Center at Drake University more than a day before the president was set to touch down in the state, according to the Des Moines Register. Trump made a stop in Michigan earlier Thursday to highlight his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a rare bipartisan win for the president that will have implications for Iowa farmers and manufacturers.
Trump said he had just come from Michigan, a state that “is booming now because of me. ”
Days after the rally, as Iowans caucus, the Trump campaign is expected to send an unusually long list of GOP heavyweight surrogates to the state, including Cabinet officials, congressional leaders and members of Trump's family.

In these dark days, a pair of journalists shine a light

Texto completo: It's always slightly amusing to be told how useless and duplicitous and unpopular journalists are by — wait for it — politicians.
The most recent example is courtesy of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who as the nation's top diplomat is about as popular with his 75,000 employees as the Wicked Witch of the West was with those flying monkeys.
Last week, Mary Louise Kelly, co-host of NPR's “All Things Considered," was granted an interview with Pompeo. To her questions about Iran, he gave mostly vague answers. Kelly's questioning got under Pompeo's skin, especially when she asked whether he owed Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, an apology after President Trump and his minions smeared her before removing her from her post.
One of Pompeo's aides ended the interview abruptly and Kelly was summoned to Pompeo's private quarters, where Pompeo proceeded to scream and swear at her for about as long as the nine-minute interview.
Pompeo challenged her to find Ukraine on an unmarked map. She did so, displaying a keen knowledge of geography that immediately rendered her unfit for any role in the current State Department. Pompeo also called her a liar, which, if true, would have immediately rehabilitated her in the administration's eyes and made her an exceptionally qualified candidate for a job at Foggy Bottom, where these days loyalty to the president is valued over those phony baloney oaths to the Constitution.
Pompeo and Kelly then released versions of the events that were diametrically opposed. Given their respective track records, to paraphrase John Kelly, no relation, I believe Mary Louise Kelly.
So the man who is supposed to be the nation's most diplomatic person blew his top and went on a profanity-laced tirade against someone who was doing her job, when all he had to do, if he didn't like the questions, was not answer them.
I guess we can rule out Pompeo appearing on “Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me" anytime soon.
Give Pompeo this much: He was just following his boss' lead.
What's The Washington Post's excuse?
Last Sunday, after news broke that Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and seven other people were killed when their helicopter crashed in California, Washington Post political reporter Felicia Sonmez tweeted a 2016 article about the 2003 rape allegations against Bryant. As a survivor of sexual assault herself, Sonmez thought that part of his legacy deserved to be included in the torrent of grief and retrospective that followed the tragic death of a basketball legend and international celebrity.
Sonmez was attacked on social media, where some people who thought she had shown poor taste offered what they considered a proportionate response by threatening to kill her. Some charming person posted her home address online.
While such unhinged attacks are not surprising in the noxious ether of social media, the decision by her newspaper to suspend her certainly was.
Many of Sonmez's colleagues sprang forward to defend her. Erik Wemple, the Post's media critic, called out his own bosses. More than 300 Post journalists signed a letter from the Newspaper Guild defending Sonmez and urging her bosses to rescind any discipline and be more supportive of her. Shaken to their senses by their own journalists, the Post's honchos reinstated Sonmez on Tuesday.
Watching all this, sadly, was Gina Scaramella, executive director of the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. Scaramella said Sonmez reacted to the overwhelming publicity surrounding Bryant's tragic death the way many survivors of sexual assault did.
“To see everybody focusing on" his celebrity “to such a degree feels so isolating and silencing for survivors," she said.
Given the Post's important reporting in recent years that has held sexual predators to account, “it was so disappointing to see them in a silencing role," Scaramella said.
The good news is that the attempts to intimidate two good journalists failed miserably. Pompeo even unwittingly spurred an NPR fund drive, with far fewer interruptions.
As the great Dan Barry says, “Onward."

Texto completo: Disability’s burden
Editor: I recently read a story about the vast number of opioids prescribed in Lackawanna Country.
There was a big headline about the growth of the use of opioids. Did anyone ever look into the aging population in this area? My point is, as we age the more problems we have with our bodies.
I am guilty of getting into my 60s, too. At sundown my neuropathy is unbearably painful. When I go to my doctor I explain to him about my problem feet. He takes my blood pressure, checks my heart and says, take Tylenol. I paid him $200 for this checkup.
My grandma use to say, take two aspirins and call me in the morning. She could have made millions. I am sorry for people who suffer from addiction and I personally know of some friends whose lives were ended by addiction. However, there has to be a happy medium for this problem.
Why should I have to live in pain? I had to retire early and become nonproductive. I’m sitting, soaking and watching the world go by without me in it and waiting for the grim reaper.
A philosophy professor wrote years ago in the New York Times: “Addiction seems to involve a total abdication of reason, a messy tangle of emotions and a lack of will.”

Section 8 flood
Editor: This is for all the homeowners and property owners of Lackawanna County who foolishly voted for those who are the county commissioners now.
You all must feel you don’t pay enough in property taxes, because if the guy who leads them now gets his way you are about to. Democrats never met a tax dollar they didn’t like.
It’s what they do, you see, live off the work of others. Did you ever wonder how a city so distressed as Scranton manages to flood the area with as many out-of-state Section 8 housing inhabitants as possible? They keep coming in all the time.
Who OKs this? Democrats, that’s who.
Where do you think most of the heroin comes from? Those carloads of gangbangers with out-of-state plates who can be seen all over now, that’s who.
It doesn’t do the area any good that the only newspaper in town bashes our duly elected president daily while putting the most corrupt lifetime Washington, D.C., politicians on a pedestal. Change your name to the Commie Times. It’s what you promote. Own it.
I know of many homeowners in Monroe County who have for-sale signs in their front yards thanks to that county’s recent reassessment, which did nothing but raise everyone’s taxes. Remember that the next time you see the people who somehow just got elected to run the county take more money from you to finance their club.

Need for restraint
Editor: Having served as director of communications for the chief financial officers of the cities of Houston and the District of Columbia, I say Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti’s policy of managing the communications of her administration by directing media inquiries through her office is not unusual.
It is the practice and policy she followed as a public servant and most likely as a private sector employee. She may have learned it in her education as best practice.
As a government reporter in Houston, I brought understanding of the relationship between public servants and media when I moved into government. My angriest days on either side of the story came from the unresponsiveness of bureaucracy, so we improved response times for interviews and information. Cognetti’s administration must do that.
When I served in a Lackawanna County administration, a communications manager often joined in media interviews. County Commissioner Debi Domenick’s refusal to discuss the qualifications of her hire, an employee paid by taxpayers, is a separate matter. As a new public official, if she hasn’t been educated about right-to-know requirements, that must be done.
The editorial (“Bad start as shades drawn at city, county,” Jan. 20) correctly points out that the county and city use formal records requests too readily and often inappropriately. That needs to change.
Cognetti drew national attention for running as an independent and being the first woman mayor of a city traditionally entrenched in backroom politics. The editorial is right that the administration needs a balanced relationship with the media to report how she and her team plan to make the city better.
It is too soon for The Times-Tribune to conclude this is a betrayal of Cognetti’s pledge to improve transparency and accountability. Less than a month into a new administration it is time for deep breaths, all around.

Resist autocracy
Editor: Our president has declared the current impeachment proceedings to be a hoax.
It’s far from a hoax. Our democracy is at risk from an authoritarian leader. Should we wait until he orders our troops to fire on dissidents staging peaceful protests? Should we wait until he establishes poor farms and work camps for our most vulnerable citizens? Should we wait until he disenfranchises all minorities and legal immigrants? Should we wait until he abolishes all social programs and impoverishes the sick and elderly? Should we wait until freedom of the press is relegated to the dust bin of history?
I say no. An educated electorate is our best defense against these atrocities. Our education must start in the Senate today.

Bloomberg's $11 million Super Bowl ad: Gun violence and a grieving mother

Texto completo: DES MOINES — After the dazzle and pop of Jennifer Lopez and Shakira's Super Bowl halftime show this Sunday, Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is hoping to “stop people in their tracks" with an emotional ad featuring a mother who lost her son to gun violence.
In the minute-long ad, which the campaign released Thursday, Calandrian Kemp tells the story of her son, George Kemp Jr., as the camera pans across childhood pictures of George in football gear. He was shot and killed in 2013 during an altercation while he was at mechanic school; he was 20.
“I just kept saying, you cannot tell me that the child I gave birth to is no longer here," Kemp says, her voice breaking. The screen then shows white text on a black background: “2,900 children die from gun violence every year."
That figure has been cited by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group primarily financed by Bloomberg.
Kemp then praises Bloomberg's record on gun control. “I know Mike is not afraid of the gun lobby — they're scared of him," she says. “And they should be."
The ad cost the campaign $11 million for 60 seconds in front of what is regularly the largest television audience of the year; predictions for this year's Super Bowl, which will be broadcast on Fox, hover around 100 million viewers. The ad is scheduled to air between the end of the halftime show and the beginning of the third quarter, the campaign said.
President Trump's reelection campaign has also purchased 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game, but it has not released a preview of its spot.
New York Times
Clues offered to a Sanders presidency
Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who is running for president in the Democratic primaries, is considering dozens of executive orders he could unilaterally enact on a wide range of domestic policy issues if elected, including immigration, the environment and prescription drugs, according to two people familiar with the campaign's planning and an internal document reviewed by The Washington Post.
Sanders has risen in national and early-state polling in the final days before Monday's Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the Democratic presidential primary, which has fueled concerns among some party insiders that he could win the nomination.
Aides have presented Sanders with a list of possible executive actions, including more than a dozen options for reversing President Trump's immigration policy, such as lifting the cap on the number of refugees accepted into the United States and immediately halting border wall construction. Another option is the reinstatement of an Obama-era program that granted legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to America as children.
The document reviewed by the Post shows how the Sanders campaign has already begun extensive planning for how the senator would lead the country in his first days as president if he won the Democratic nomination and defeated Trump in November. Many of the proposals Sanders has floated on the campaign trail do not have support from congressional Republicans and are opposed by some Democrats, so a willingness to move forward without congressional approval could determine whether many of his policies are enacted.
The list of potential executive orders includes unilaterally allowing the United States to import prescription drugs from Canada; directing the Justice Department to legalize marijuana; and declaring climate change a national emergency while banning the exportation of crude oil. Other options cited in the document include canceling federal contracts for firms paying less than $15 an hour and reversing federal rules blocking US funding to organizations that provide abortion counseling.

Abrams backs Warnock in Georgia Senate race
Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial nominee whose campaign energized Georgia's Democratic voters, Thursday put her political star power behind the US Senate bid of the Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.
Abrams, who announced her endorsement via Twitter, praised Warnock as "a leader who sees all of us and serves all of us." She also included a link where people could contribute money to Warnock's campaign, which kicked off Thursday morning.
Warnock's candidacy, along with Abrams's pledge to help him win, is the latest development in what is shaping up as a contentious contest that is key to Democrats' hopes of retaking the Senate.
Abrams, who was heavily courted to run for the Senate but declined, is one of the party's most popular political figures. Since narrowly losing the governor's race in 2018, Abrams has focused on voting rights, raising millions of dollars for a national effort to beef up voter education and protection operations in battleground states ahead of this year's election.
Warnock announced his bid in a three-minute video that traced his path from growing up in public housing in Savannah to leading the congregation of Ebenezer Baptist Church.
Warnock is eyeing the seat currently held by Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican business executive who was appointed to the post by Republican Governor Brian Kemp following the retirement of Senator Johnny Isakson.
Warnock's announcement came a day after Representative Douglas Collins, Republican of Georgia, a top defender of President Trump, confirmed his candidacy for the seat, a move that divided Republicans.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee immediately made clear it would support Loeffler and suggested Collins's entrance into the race will hurt the prospects of other Republicans on the ticket and put Georgia in play in the presidential election.
In addition to Warnock, two other Democrats are running: Ed Tarver, a former federal prosecutor in Georgia under President Barack Obama; and Matt Lieberman, the son of former senator and vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.

Who Is Kevin Clinesmith? Even after the collapse of the collusion thesis, good luck getting the press corps interested in allegations of Obama-era abuse.

Texto completo: It was an almost unbelievable story—fit for a spy novel, and among the most disturbing and consequential allegations of governmental abuse in recent history. The alleged abuse went right to the heart of our ability to participate in free and fair elections. But much of the U.S. media seems ready to forget about it.
On December 9 Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz reported that a critical piece of evidence used to obtain a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate in 2016 was falsified by an FBI lawyer.
Even before the release of the report, the New York Times had the scoop in November but buried it under a headline which suggested a sort of vindication for the FBI: "Russia Inquiry Review Is Said to Criticize F.B.I. but Rebuff Claims of Biased Acts; A watchdog report will portray the pursuit of a wiretap of an ex-Trump adviser as sloppy, but it also debunks some accusations by Trump allies of F.B.I. wrongdoing."
"Sloppy" is a nice way of describing how a federal court was misled into turning surveillance powers against a U.S. citizen volunteering for the presidential campaign of the party out of power.
When the inspector general's report arrived in December, it cast the falsified evidence as the most egregious on a long list of problems in the FBI's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications targeting Trump supporter Carter Page:
We identified significant inaccuracies and omissions in each of the four applications—7 in the first FISA application and a total of 17 by the final renewal application... All of the applications also omitted information the FBI had obtained from another U.S. government agency detailing its prior relationship with Page, including that Page had been approved as an operational contact for the other agency from 2008 to 2013, and that Page had provided information to the other agency concerning his prior contacts with certain Russian intelligence officers, one of which overlapped with facts asserted in the FISA application.
Mr. Page had been helping a U.S. intelligence agency collect information on the Russians. The FBI not only never told the court he was assisting the good guys—the bureau falsely presented some of his helpful activities as evidence he was helping the bad guys.
Before the last renewal for wiretap authority in 2017, after Mr. Page had disclosed his actual role in the press, Inspector General Horowitz reports that the FBI lawyer said Mr. Page had never had a relationship with the other U.S. government agency and "altered the email that the other U.S. government agency had sent" so that it appeared to state that Page had not been a source. The IG adds that the FBI lawyer then forwarded the doctored email to his supervisor. Shortly thereafter, the supervisor "served as the affiant on the final renewal application, which was again silent on Page's prior relationship with the other U.S. government agency."
Back in November, while leading with its absolution of FBI leadership, the Times reported that the FBI lawyer who allegedly altered the record is named Kevin Clinesmith. According to the Times:
... Mr. Clinesmith worked on both the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia investigation. He was among the F.B.I. officials removed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after Mr. Horowitz found text messages expressing political animus against Mr. Trump.
Shortly after Mr. Trump's election victory, for example, Mr. Clinesmith texted another official that "the crazies won finally," disparaged Mr. Trump's health care and immigration agendas, and called Vice President Mike Pence "stupid." In another text, he wrote, in the context of a question about whether he intended to stay in government, "viva la resistance."
Since then, the press pack seems to have lost interest. According to the Factiva news archive, in the last month only one story on Mr. Clinesmith has appeared in any of America's 50 largest newspapers.
On December 31 Mr. Clinesmith made a brief appearance about a dozen paragraphs into a Washington Post report. The Post story featured an interview with a Times reporter attempting to explain why the Times presented the Horowitz report largely as a vindication of the FBI.
Mr. Clinesmith deserves the presumption of innocence just like every other American. Perhaps media outlets will decide he's also deserving of a fraction of the coverage they devoted to promoting the FBI's bogus claims.
Presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued a public order on December 17 and noted the abuses described in the Horowitz report:
It documents troubling instances in which FBI personnel provided information to [the Department of Justice's National Security Division] which was unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession. It also describes several instances in which FBI personnel withheld from NSD information in their possession which was detrimental to their case for believing that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power.
In addition, while the fourth electronic surveillance application for Mr. Page was being prepared, an attorney in the FBI's Office of General Counsel (OGC) engaged in conduct that apparently was intended to mislead the FBI agent who ultimately swore to the facts in that application about whether Mr. Page had been a source of another government agency.
This column is struggling to recall a more serious allegation of abuse of our democratic process by officials of the federal government.
Others may have a different view, so perhaps a survey is in order. In the comments section below this column, readers are invited to opine on which one of the following scenarios represents the greatest threat to American liberty:
A) After identifying a U.S. citizen volunteering for the U.S. presidential campaign of the party out of power, the FBI makes false claims and persuades a federal court that the citizen may be a Russian agent and should be subjected to electronic surveillance.
B) After observing a U.S. citizen obtain a Ukrainian company board seat for which he was manifestly unqualified while his father was running Ukrainian policy for the U.S. government—and in which capacity the father would later demand the firing of a local prosecutor investigating the son's business associates—the U.S. President urges the government of Ukraine to investigate.

Texto completo: DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Lee Enterprises, the parent company of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, will buy Berkshire Hathaway's BH Media Group publications and The Buffalo News for $140 million, the company said Wednesday.
The deal covers 30 daily newspapers in 10 states as well as 49 paid weekly publications with digital sites and 32 other print products. Among the daily papers are the Omaha World-Herald in Nebraska, the Tulsa World in Oklahoma and the Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina. As part of the agreement, Lee will enter into a 10-year lease for BH Media's real estate.
Lee has been managing the BH Media publications since July 2018.
"This is a compelling and transformative transaction for Lee," said Mary Junck, Lee's chairman. "It both refinances our long-term debt on attractive terms and provides new revenue opportunities as well as operational synergies across an expanded portfolio."
Warren Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and CEO, is a lifelong fan of newspapers, but has said for several years that he expects most of them to continue on their declining trajectory, save for a handful of national papers such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
Still, he said he and his partner, Charlie Munger, have long admired Lee.
"We had zero interest in selling the group to anyone else for one simple reason: We believe that Lee is best positioned to manage through the industry's challenges," Buffett said.
Newspapers make up a small part of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns an assortment of more than 90 companies and holds major investments in companies like Coca-Cola Co., Apple and Wells Fargo.
Berkshire Hathaway is providing about $576 million in long-term, 9% financing to Lee, which Lee will use to pay for the Berkshire properties and refinance Lee's approximately $400 million in existing debt, much of which came with the purchase of Pulitzer Inc. for $1.5 billion in 2005.
In September, Lee's average cost of debt was 10%, according to securities filings. Berkshire will be Lee's sole lender after the deal closes.
Lee's portfolio will grow to 81 daily papers, nearly doubling its audience size and revenues, the company said.
It expects combined operations to provide as much as $25 million in annual revenue increases and cost cuts after the sale.
The deal is expected to close in mid-March.
Lee stock rose 84 cents or more than 67% to close at $2.10 in New York on Wednesday, after a nearly yearlong slump, during which shares sunk as low as $1.18.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein callously preceded an alleged rape with reassurances that he'd had a vasectomy, one accuser testified Wednesday.

Another accuser said the once-revered Hollywood producer tried trading movie roles for sex, claiming the lewd offer was the kind of thing that happened all the time in the film business.

Choking back tears, Tarale Wulff told jurors there was nothing she could do to stop the much larger Weinstein once he grabbed her by the arm and pushed her onto the bed at his New York City apartment in 2005 during what was supposed to be an audition.

Wulff, now 43 and a model, said she froze, thinking that would make it "easier to get through, to get past it."

Dawn Dunning testified that the year before, Weinstein put his hand up her skirt and fondled her genitals during a meeting in his hotel suite about her fledgling acting career.

At a subsequent meeting, she said, he offered to put her in three movies, but only if she had sex with him and his assistant.

"When he said that, I kind of laughed, I thought he was kidding, and he had kind of a crass sense of humor," Dunning testified. "But when I started laughing, he got really angry and started screaming at me. He said, ‘you'll never make it in this business, this is how this industry works.'"

Dunning, now 40, said Weinstein went on to namedrop actresses Salma Hayek and Charlize Theron, implying they had done similar things to achieve success -- something both women have strongly denied.

Hayek has said she had to fight off Weinstein's constant harassment and bullying. Theron was upset when some accusers said he implied they had slept together.

Wulff and Dunning's experiences with Weinstein are not part of the underlying criminal charges against him, but their testimony could be a factor in whether he goes to prison at the end of his landmark #MeToo-era trial.

Prosecutors called them as witnesses under a state law that allows testimony about so-called "prior bad acts," enabling them to explore things like motive, opportunity, intent and a common scheme or plan.

Weinstein, 67, is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on Mimi Haleyi, at the time a "Project Runway" production assistant, in 2006 and raping another aspiring actress in 2013. That woman could testify later this week.

Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual.

Jurors have already heard from Haleyi, who tearfully testified that she tried to fight off Weinstein before he sexually assaulted her, and actress Annabella Sciorra, who testified that he overpowered and raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s.

The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they agree to be named or gone public with their stories, as Haleyi, Wulff, Dunning and Sciorra have done.

Wulff testified that on an occasion before the alleged rape, Weinstein grabbed her arm as she served cocktails at one of his usual Manhattan haunts, led her toward a darkened terrace and started masturbating.

Wulff, who'd met Weinstein at the members-only club, said she froze and scooted around him to go back to the bar.

Dunning went public about the alleged jobs-for-sex proposal in an October 2017 article in The New York Times. She said she didn't disclose the alleged fondling to prosecutors until last summer.

Dunning told jurors that, like Wulff, she met Weinstein while waiting tables at a Manhattan night spot, one where bottle service was a trendy indulgence for the rich and famous.

Weinstein immediately appeared to take an interest in her fledgling acting career, she said, and invited her to a lunch meeting where, noting his infamous temper, she said he was "on the phone a lot yelling at people."

Several meetings followed, Dunning said, including one at a boutique hotel in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood where Weinstein was using a suite as a temporary office. At one point, she testified, Weinstein led her into a bedroom and put his hand up her skirt.

"I stood up. I was in shock," Dunning said, fighting back tears as she described the alleged incident when she was 24. "He just started talking really fast. He said, ‘Don't make a big deal about this. It will never happen again.'"

Asked by prosecutor Meghan Hast whether she was gaining anything by testifying at the trial, Dunning responded: "No, if anything I'm losing. This is the worst and hardest thing I've ever done."

Dunning said she "just kind of gave him the benefit of the doubt" when Weinstein said it wouldn't happen again. She said she didn't scream or yell and didn't tell anyone because she was embarrassed and didn't want to be a victim.

Dunning said that she later agreed to meet Weinstein at a cigar bar, but that an assistant took her to a suite where the producer was standing in a bathrobe.

There, she said Weinstein showed her a contract for three movie roles she would get on the condition she had "a threesome with his assistant."

Dunning said she didn't know what Weinstein would do after she laughed off the offer, so she ran for the door and down the hall to the elevator.

"He was a big guy. He was towering over me," she testified. "I was really scared."

Timing of Bolton leak is suspect

Texto completo: It was the seeming Perry Mason moment of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Just after the White House team presented its defense denying any quid pro quo over Ukrainian aid, former national security adviser John Bolton jumped up from the gallery to scream, "He did it!" Not really, but close.
A few hours after the start of the president's defense, details from Bolton's forthcoming book leaked, including his account of Trump asserting that $391 million in military aid would be withheld until Ukraine announced investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens. If that seems a tad contrived for either an episode or an impeachment, that is because it is. In responding to a defense built around Trump's insistence that his call was "perfect," this leak was perfect to a fault. Perfect timing. Perfect content. It was so perfect that there is little doubt that the Senate is being played.
The leak happened at the exact time that it would inflict the most damage on the defense and throw the trial into disarray. It occurred hours after the White House team gave opening statements that seriously undermined critical points made by the House managers, including the assertions that Trump never previously raised corruption in other countries or that this type of hold on aid was uncommon. It felt like the sudden discovery of a gun near the victim at the scene of a police shooting.
That does not mean the leak will not succeed. The disclosure about Bolton's book could well make the difference in securing the four Republican votes needed to obtain witnesses. But it could also succeed too well if it leads senators to plunge into the unknown of calling witnesses such as former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter. There are already indications that the leak may have secured the four votes for witnesses, while even Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said the Senate may need to subpoena the book draft itself.
The fact is that the story remains damaging on its face. It reaffirms not just that Bolton has relevant evidence but also that his testimony could significantly strengthen the nexus between the demand for investigations and the hold on aid. It could contradict statements made by Trump and cited by his legal team angrily denying any such connection. It would also change the account of Bolton denouncing the "drug deal" being "cooked up" by Rudolph Giuliani and, for the first time, make Trump the chef in chief.
As damaging as that leak may prove, though, it is not on its face devastating for the defense. The leak falls short of answering key questions that would likely have to be pursued in testimony. For example, Trump allegedly told Bolton that he wanted to "continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens," the New York Times reported.
That still leaves the question of intent. Trump has never denied asking for the investigations, but insisted that they were meant to deal with his concerns over ongoing corruption in Ukraine. Moreover, the first of the two investigations could not be a basis for impeachment. Trump asked for assistance in investigating allegations into the 2016 election - matters that were currently being investigated by U.S. Attorney John Durham. It is the Biden investigation that raises legitimate questions, but it comes down again to a question of intent. Finally, the leak refers to the freeze on the funds but does not indicate that Trump was prepared to hold the aid past the deadline at the end of September. (It was released on Sept. 11.).
The suspicions over the timing of the leak are magnified by the fact that Bolton could have been subpoenaed by the House and compelled to testify. Bolton has hardly been subtle about his knowledge or desire to testify. Indeed, he has been virtually wearing a sandwich board reading "Subpoena me" outside the Capitol for months. When the House refused to issue such a subpoena, Bolton continued to tease his knowledge, including a tweet reading, "For the backstory, stay tuned........ ."
Despite the earlier failure to call Bolton or subpoena his book, the House built up expectations with veiled references to a leak or "gotcha" story to pressure senators to allow witnesses. We didn't have to wait for the book and indeed we did not have to wait long at all - just for the start of the defense case.
Bolton's attorney has denied the reporting of the Times that Bolton circulated the draft for weeks among "close associates." He instead blamed the "corrupted" process of pre-clearance review at the White House. Whoever it was, the leak was delivered with lethal effect.
Still, it may prove too clever by half. The manipulation of the trial with a carefully placed leak will not sit well with some senators. Senators play others; they do not like to be played. The leak makes it more difficult for key senators (who were moving away from voting for witnesses) to bring the trial to an early close.
However, it also makes it less likely that senators will be inclined to support the Democrats in their effort to block witnesses sought by the White House team, including not just Hunter Biden but possibly the whistleblower. In other words, the fallback position for some senators would be a mutually assured destruction option: Allow both sides to lay waste to each other and leave it to the public to pick through the ruins.

Shadle teacher takes on polarizing topics AP class challenges students to look at issues critically

Texto completo: In these polarizing political times, teaching high school civics might be one of the toughest jobs.
Mark Miller makes it look easy - stimulating and constructive, too, even when the subject turns to impeachment or abortion.
In his U.S. government and politics class at Shadle Park High School, there are no angry fists - only raised arms seeking understanding in an age of informational overload and seemingly hidden agendas behind every headline.
If nothing else, Miller's students can agree to disagree.
During a recent discussion of U.S. Supreme Court cases, senior Joseph Broadhurst confessed to having "a hard time understanding how anyone could decide it any other way than this."
"Then, as I read them, I thought, 'Hey, that's a valid opinion,'" Broadhurst said. "And I talk with the other kids to at least listen to what they have to say."
This week the subject turned to Roe. v. Wade, the landmark case that evokes red-hot emotions over abortion.
But instead of raising their voices, the students raised questions - the kind that showed they'd done their homework.
Soon the discussion centered on the judicial concept of originalism, which asserts that all statements in the Constitution must be interpreted based on the original understanding of the authors or the people at the time it was ratified.
On Tuesday, Miller's class watched an interview in which former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia - the face of originalism until his death in 2016 - offered his opinion.
The students in this Advanced Placement class took it from there, offering their own observations as they delved into Roe v. Wade, an exercise in peeling the onion layers and getting to underlying issues such as privacy.
A teacher for 25 years, Miller has done this many times before - most recently during ongoing discussions over the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
The ultimate compliment came from Asher Sterling, who took the class partly for the AP credits but soon discovered that "there was a lot I didn't know about government."
Regardless of the topic, Sterling marveled at Miller's ability to lead discussions of historical and current issues with a combination of passion and nonpartisanship.
It also doesn't hurt to play devil's advocate, thereby challenging students to back up their positions.
"I think he argues from standpoints he doesn't necessarily believe in and makes us think," Sterling said.
Critical thinking is challenged, Miller believes, by a national shortage of unbiased media - a problem that predates Trump.
A few years ago, Miller recalls, he assigned students to get some definitive answers on the Affordable Care Act. Apart from public relations efforts by medical professionals and the insurance industry, there was little.
The problem is getting worse, Miller's students agreed on Tuesday as they look ahead to voting for the first time in their lives.
"It's hard," said senior Jarred McDougall, who understands that a newsfeed on Facebook might be biased.
"I just have to read it and understand that it's from a particular source and that parts may be true but not the whole thing," McDougall said. "Also that everyone has a purpose in writing."
For Miller, there's plenty of blame to go around for what has become an exhausting search for the truth.
"I tell them jokes about Walter Cronkite turning over in his grave," said Miller, who also said he thinks that "the role of the media in reporting on Vietnam was the beginning of position-oriented journalism."
More recently, Miller believes, the New York Times "has in certain instances done themselves in" with coverage of national politics. Trump's "over-the-top" communication style hasn't helped either, he said.
Neither has Twitter, said Miller. "There's a fairly significant population for which that's their news source  but things that look fairly factual on a Twitter feed has so much potential for bias."
"Basically, I tell them to be constantly skeptical of what they're looking at," Miller said.

Texto completo: To be the best, sometimes you actually do have to beat the best. That wasn't an issue for Sofia Kenin on Thursday, when she took down top-ranked Ashleigh Barty (7-6 (8-6), 7-5) in the Australian Open
Kenin, who became the youngest woman to defeat a world No. 1 in a major since 2002, will play in her first grand slam final match Saturday against unseeded Garbiñe Muguruza. She entered the Australian Open as the No. 14 seed.
"I'm so speechless. I honestly can't believe this. I've just dreamed about this since I was 5 years old," Kenin told the crowd during her post-match interview. "This wasn't really an easy one. "
Kenin is the first American other than a Williams sister to reach the Australian Open final since Lindsay Davenport in 1995. And Kenin is the first American woman to beat the No. 1 player at a major since Serena topped Venus at Wimbledon in 2002.
Get to better know the newest American tennis sensation:
Who is Sofia Kenin?
Kenin was born in Moscow before her parents emigrated to the United States from Russia when she was a baby. She was raised in Florida and goes by "Sonya" among those close to her, according to her website.
At age 7, Kenin began playing in USTA youth tournaments. By 2014, she was representing the U. S. at the Summer Youth Olympics and the Fed Cup team.
In 2017, she turned pro and made it to the third round of the U. S. Open before losing to Maria Sharapova. Kenin advanced to that stage of the U. S. Open for the next two years as well. Until this tournament, the 2019 French Open (fourth round) was the furthest she made it in a tournament. At Roland Garros that year, she upset Serena Williams in the third round.
Still, Kenin won 2019 WTA Most Improved Player of the Year honors thanks to three singles titles, and achieved her highest ranking (No. 12). According to The New York Times, Kenin will break into the top 10 for the first time in her career.
By turning pro, Kenin forfeited a scholarship to play tennis at Miami (Florida). Kenin's father, Alex, has served as her primary coach during her entire career.

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. officials say they try to avoid political bias. Try telling that to Democrats.
The relationship between the company and the political left is at an all-time low, more than a dozen Democratic operatives, campaign officials and leaders of progressive groups said in interviews, following a series of company policy decisions widely seen among their ranks as favoring President Trump. Many Democrats and campaign officials are increasingly criticizing Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in personal terms.
It is a stark departure from the 2016 campaign , when Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton. The relationship has frayed partly because of actions Facebook took to address criticisms of bias from conservatives and in part owing to revelations from U.S. intelligence and special counsel Robert Mueller's report on how Russia used Facebook to spread disinformation to boost Mr. Trump's campaign.
On the campaign trail and in Democratic political circles, there is little love left for the Silicon Valley giant, even as presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle rely on Facebook as a valuable platform for political advertising.
This month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Vice President Joe Biden and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer all lambasted Facebook over misleading videos, ads and hate speech on the platform. Mrs. Clinton recently called Mr. Zuckerberg authoritarian . Those public remarks came after behind-the-scenes discussions between Facebook and Democrats about whether the company was allowing harmful discourse ahead of the 2020 election.
"Progressives think the way Facebook has permitted and amplified disinformation has become antithetical to a well-functioning democracy," Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank, said in an interview.
Facebook representatives say the company is in an awkward position. Democrats want the company to fulfill its promise to combat misinformation, but conservatives argue that the fact-checking groups employed by Facebook are liberal and could unfairly limit their speech.
"People on both sides of the aisle disagree with some of the positions we've taken, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and communicating clearly about why we make the decisions we do," a Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement.
The social media platform remains a major part of campaign infrastructure.
"Facebook is the big bad ugly, but you talk to operatives about where they're spending their money and it's Facebook," said Tim Lim, a Democratic digital strategist.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren and some other presidential candidates are pushing for a breakup of the company , and the Massachusetts lawmaker's campaign asks supporters to confirm they aren't an executive at a big tech company before donating to her.
Still, she has put more than $6.8 million into Facebook ads since the start of 2019. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has also been critical of the company, spent more than $7 million in that time. Mr. Trump's campaign put more than $22 million toward Facebook ads during the period.
Mr. Lim said campaign officials feel they have no choice but to buy Facebook ads because voters spend so much time on the platform.
Not every campaign is keeping Silicon Valley at arm's length. A Facebook board member, Jeffrey Zients, who was National Economic Council director during the Obama administration, is backing Mr. Biden for president. He welcomed the former vice president to his Washington home for an evening fundraiser in November. He is among a number of co-hosts for a February fundraising event as well, according to an invitation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Biden has said it is worth taking a "really hard look" at breaking up tech companies including Facebook.
Conservatives have long complained of bias in Silicon Valley. In 2016, employees of Facebook donated almost 100 times more to Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump, according to federal data. That spring, conservatives were in an uproar after the tech-news site Gizmodo reported that the company altered a list of trending topics to suppress conservative content.
Facebook denied the Gizmodo article, but several conservatives visited the company's headquarters to discuss the issue.
Mr. Zuckerberg has relied on advice from Peter Thiel, a longtime Facebook board member and Trump backer. Joel Kaplan, one of Facebook's top policy executives and a former aide to President George W. Bush, has sometimes postponed or killed projects that risk upsetting the political right, the Journal has previously reported.
While Facebook was repairing its relationship with conservatives, many Democrats soured on the company.
Last year, Facebook refused to take down a video that had been altered to appear to show Mrs. Pelosi slurring her words. Facebook executives were divided on how to handle the video but fell back on the stance that a tech company shouldn't be the arbiter of truth, people familiar with the matter say.
Following that same logic, Facebook said in late September that it wouldn't fact-check posts, images or ads from politicians on the platform. In October, Facebook allowed an ad run by Mr. Trump's re-election campaign that included a claim about Mr. Biden's role in the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The former vice president's campaign said the claim was false.
In an Oct. 4 letter, the Biden campaign accused the company of selling "the tools to target certain segments of the population with lies." Facebook's global head of elections policy, Katie Harbath, who previously worked with Republicans, responded that the company strove to "empower voters to judge what politicians say for themselves." The New York Times earlier reported the email exchange, which the Journal also reviewed.
The Biden campaign then urged Facebook to remember that it "promised the public, the United States Congress, and its users…that its platform will no longer be a conduit for misinformation and a tool of political distortion."
Share Your Thoughts
How well do you think Facebook has been handling political messaging on its platform during this election cycle so far? Join the conversation below.
Earlier this month, Facebook stood by its decision to allow political ads to be targeted to small segments of American voters, unlike moves by its competitors Google and Twitter Inc. Mr. Trump's campaign used this method to reach narrow voter groups in 2016. Some Democrats say such targeting can make it hard to detect misinformation, even though others in the party have also used the tactic.
Ms. Sandberg has told Democratic operatives that the decisions are tough to make, according to people familiar with those conversations. One person characterized Ms. Sandberg's behind-the-scenes position as: "I'm a Democrat, this is so hard for me."
In some discussions with Democrats, Facebook staffers describe Facebook as the public's "favorite punching bag," this person said.
A senior Biden campaign official said Facebook had been "nominally cooperative" in making people from the company available to talk about policy differences. The official said Facebook had notified the campaign after a video surfaced on the platform that had been edited in a way that changed the meaning of remarks by the vice president, which Mr. Biden's allies said made the comments sound racist.
"The thing that I have taken away from all of our interactions with them is that they realize that misinformation is a problem that for PR reasons they realize they need to talk about," this person said.
"They understand they have an optics problem," the Biden official said.

Texto completo: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema may have questions for the U.S. House managers and President Donald Trump's lawyers in the impeachment trial of the president, based on note-taking during the trial.
But if she does, she isn't saying.
Ahead of Wednesday's proceedings, which kicked off a 16-hour stretch that gives all 100 senators the opportunity to pose questions, a spokeswoman for Sinema, D-Ariz., declined to comment.
Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., joined her Republican colleagues to pose two questions to the president's defense on Wednesday's proceedings. Before they began, a McSally spokeswoman did not respond to a request about any questions McSally had.
McSally asked her first question with a group of fellow Republicans. That question centered on whether House managers had met an evidentiary burden in the Senate to support removal.
Patrick Philbin, deputy counsel to the president, said the House used a standard of whether there was "clear and convincing evidence in the view of the members voting on it, that there was some impeachable offense," a standard he said was "definitely" lower than the standard that had to be met in the Senate trial.
"An impeachment is simply an accusation," he said. "... The House does not have to adhere to the same standard that is used in the Senate."
Soon after, McSally and another group of GOP senators asked whether the House sought to litigate executive privilege issues, something that could potentially block witnesses from testifying, during the month when the House held up articles of impeachment from the Senate.
The question, posed to the president's counsel, was taken on again by Philbin, who said the House did not.
To ask a question, senators must write it down on a six-lined question card and indicate who the question is intended for.
Party leaders sort through the questions to ensure there are no duplicates and forward the questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who presides over the impeachment trial.
Roberts will read the questions from the upper tier of the rostrum and will alternate questions between Republicans and Democrats. He will name the senator — or senators — who are posing the questions.
The question-and-answer phase of the trial will stretch for 16 hours over two days.
Trump is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, stemming from leveraging the presidency to persuade Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rivals.
Like their colleagues, Sinema and McSally were barred from talking or using electronics throughout the hours of hearing arguments from both the president's counsel and the House managers.
A marathon session last week that went on for more than 12 hours eventually appeared to get to Sinema, who slouched deeper back into the seat at her mahogany desk on the Senate floor.
She wrapped herself tightly in a colorful shawl and rested her head on her shoulder, closing her eyes for a few minutes as both sides argued about whether witnesses should be called to testify in the trial.
For the large part of the trial, both she and McSally remained attentive, looking at those presenting and up to large TV screens where both sides flipped through PowerPoint presentations.
McSally also flipped through a large white binder throughout the long days of presentations, peering down through her black-rimmed glasses as she scanned the pages with a pen. She jotted down notes in the margin of the pages.
Sinema also was a frequent note-taker, jotting down things in a rose-colored sparkly notebook each day.
But the two senators have kept their thoughts on the trial fairly a mystery, both in Arizona and on Capitol Hill, where they have evaded reporters and ignored their questions each day.
It's unclear whether either senator could support calling for additional witnesses to testify in the trial, a key question that will likely come up on Friday and could change the dynamics of the trial as a whole.
The squeeze on the senators takes a new turn as they face mounting public pressure to call witnesses as former national security adviser John Bolton offered tantalizing hints about his possible testimony in his forthcoming book.
Bolton wrote in a book manuscript that he has direct, first-hand knowledge about Trump's efforts toward Ukraine.
His manuscript was sent to the White House for review and was then leaked to the New York Times.
Bolton wrote that the president wanted to continue to freeze security assistance to Ukraine until officials there launched investigations into Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals. The information threatens to undercut the president's defense.
Trump has said he "NEVER" had such a conversation with Bolton.
Sinema voted earlier in the trial to hear from Bolton and other witnesses, as well as to gather additional evidence from federal entities.
McSally voted against doing so, but she has noted the rules governing the trial allow to consider hearing from additional witnesses after the question-and-answer period.
"The rules package does not — contrary to what some people have argued — eliminate the possibility of witnesses or documents in the future, if needed," she said in a Jan. 22 statement to The Arizona Republic.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Republicans in a closed-door meeting that Republicans did not have the votes to block additional witnesses from being called in the president's impeachment trial, according to multiple media reports.
The Wall Street Journal reported that McSally, Republican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Thom Tillis of North Carolina "addressed their colleagues in the meeting." All face competitive elections in 2020.
It is unclear what McSally may have said during that gathering. The Journal reported that Gardner told his colleagues that a longer trial would lead to more attacks by Democrats while Tillis said impeachment was a sham.
McSally spokeswoman Amy Lawrence declined to comment on the meeting.
"We don't comment on leaks from inside private meetings among Senators," she said Tuesday in a statement to The Republic.
On Monday, after attending a signing ceremony at the White House for the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, McSally again declined to say whether she wanted to hear from Bolton.
"We're not going to take questions on impeachment today," Lawrence said, responding to the question. "This is going to be strictly focused on USMCA."

Scholarship for Liebson to foster journalism

Texto completo: A journalism scholarship has been established at White Plains High School in memory of Richard Liebson, who covered the region's personalities, crimes, politics and developments over a long career at The Journal News/lohud.
His family hopes that the first Richard Liebson Journalism Scholarship will be awarded in June at White Plains High School's annual awards ceremony.
"For more than 30 years, Rich served Westchester with quality, community journalism, always shining a light on issues that needed attention," said his wife, Victoria Hochman, a former editor for The Journal News and Newsday, now manager of public relations for Thompson & Bender.
"He loved his job, but what he loved even more was mentoring young reporters," she said. "He wanted to make sure that they upheld the tradition he had learned from those before him: to be fair, accurate and ethical in pursuit of their work. That's why we decided to endow a scholarship in his name to support young aspiring journalists as a way to keep his memory alive."
Liebson died on July 28, 2019 at 61 from cancer at his White Plains home. He had worked for various incarnations of The Journal News/lohud since 1983, covering many of the major stories to hit the region. But he focused his coverage for long stretches on White Plains. He primarily wrote about crime and the courts during the 1990s and 2000s, mixing in coverage of veterans and the city's neighborhoods and ordinary folks, before covering politics and development in recent years.
Liebson graduated from Valhalla High School, but settled in White Plains more than 20 years ago. His two daughters, Morgan Shelby and Rebecca Liebson, are graduates of White Plains High School.
"Rich Liebson was both a devoted member of the White Plains community and dedicated journalist," White Plains Schools Superintendent Joseph Ricca said. "It is wonderful that this scholarship, established in his name at White Plains High School, will help to support students who also desire to enter the world of journalism. Talented journalists are torchbearers and have the power to bring information and knowledge to communities better than any other mechanism."
A GoFundMe account has been set up to raise money for the Liebson Scholarship fund. Liebson's family hopes to offer at least one scholarship each year of $1,000 or more.
His daughter, Rebecca, who is now a fellow at The New York Times, said that by watching her father, she saw how much strong watchdog journalism means to a community.
"At my dad's memorial service, several of his former sources came and spoke about how his reporting had a positive impact on their lives," she said. "When I look back on my career 30 years from now, I want to be able to say I did the same."
White Plains High School Principal Ellen Doherty thanked Liebson's family for establishing the scholarship for aspiring journalists in Liebson's adopted hometown.
"Mr. Liebson was a part of the high school community and we are thankful, on behalf of our future journalists, for this support," she said. "We know that without a free press, and writers courageous enough to pursue the truth, we all suffer."
Contributions to the fund can also be made by sending a check to:

Steyer open to deal on impeachment witnesses

Texto completo: Tom Steyer said Monday that he would be open to a compromise between Senate Republicans and Democrats allows each side to call witnesses in the impeachment trial — including former Vice President Joe Biden — if it secures testimony by Trump administration officials.
Asked by a reporter whether it would be fair for senators to trade testimony by Biden for testimony by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Steyer, who, like Biden, is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he's open to "anything that gets those administration people in front of those TV cameras under oath."
"I think it's absolutely critical that the administration officials who have the direct information about what went on testify in front of you — in front of that TV camera, with no editing, under oath, in front of the American people," he said. "I think that's critical, and I think that is the key thing. And anything we have to do to get that, I'm for."
But the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Need to Impeach founder also said he thinks Biden is a "red herring" and "not what this is about."
Biden said last week during an event in Osage, Iowa, that he would not offer to testify in the trial in exchange for securing Republican witnesses.
"They're trying to turn it into political theater but I want no part of being any part of that," he said.
Biden reiterated that stance on Monday, saying in a Iowa City Press-Citizen interview: "This is a classic Trump deal. It's the reason he is being impeached in the first place. He's trying to always focus on something else other than him."
Steyer's comments came as the team of lawyers representing President Donald Trump argued that the impeachment proceedings were partisan and unconstitutional.
Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that Bolton has written in an upcoming book that Trump said he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine until officials turned over documents related to the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump is on trial in the U.S. Senate after being impeached by the U.S. House on articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Steyer founded Need to Impeach, a group with the goal of impeaching Trump, in October 2017. He said Monday his goal throughout his Need to Impeach campaign has been to allow people to learn the truth through televised impeachment hearings.
"That's why I started Need to Impeach," he said. "Let the American people have the truth on TV under oath, and let us decide, because that's all I really care about."
Steyer made his comments to reporters following a town hall at Iowa State University's Scheman Building in Ames that drew more than 100 people. The event was the kickoff of Steyer's "Beat Trump" bus tour, which will take him around the state in the week leading up to the Feb. 3 Iowa Caucuses.

Texto completo: Doctors could be jailed for providing transgender youth with identity-related medical treatments under a new bill in the Kentucky legislature, the latest in a series of conservative legislative efforts in several states aimed at transgender minors.
The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Savannah Maddox, would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe medications, including puberty-blocking or hormone treatments, or conduct surgeries, for anyone younger than 18 with the intent to alter their gender.
Ostensibly aimed at barring children who could still be grappling with their gender identity from undergoing body-changing treatments, the measure drew a sharp rebuke from LGBTQ advocates and families who say it would only heighten risks for transgender youth.
"These sorts of decisions need to be made by medical providers, not politicians," said Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ-rights organization in Louisville. He said it represents a "coordinated political attack" on transgender people "for election-year purposes."
Maddox did not respond to messages seeking comment. But last fall she wrote on her Facebook page her intention to draft the bill, saying, "I am a strong advocate for parent's (sic) rights — but it is not the right of a parent to permanently alter a child's gender or identity, even when based upon certain behaviors or the perceptions of a child's mind which has not yet had time to fully develop."
It's rare for transgender minors to get surgery, and most have undergone years of consultations with doctors, counselors and family, often first changing names or how they dress, before any medications are adopted, experts said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week issued a study that found access to puberty blockers helped reduced risks of mental health problems and suicide attempts, which some studies say are as high 40% among transgender youth.
"It's a horrible thing," Cassie Kasey said of the bill.
Kasey said puberty blockers were important during a critical juncture for her transgender daughter, Maddie Dalton, who is now 20.
Dalton was among the first students at Louisville's Atherton High School to come out as transgender, and her subsequent push for a policy allowing her to use the women's restroom and locker room sparked a fiery public controversy in 2014 that made national headlines.
The measure joins several other proposed bills targeting transgender individuals in Kentucky's General Assembly this year.
That includes a resurrected "bathroom bill" that would ban transgender students from using public restrooms that align with their gender identities.
Another bill targets transgender individuals in sports, forcing student-athletes to compete in school sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.
Bills restricting access to hormone treatment and surgeries for young transgender people have been introduced in several states, including South Dakota, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
Such measures run counter to standards and guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, the group said.
The Kentucky Medical Association did not immediately provide a response to the legislation.
Some transgender residents said it would make getting knowledgeable transgender medical care extremely difficult for families.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving youths access to "comprehensive gender-affirming and developmentally appropriate health care" while laying out risks and benefits.
Janet Vessels, a Kentucky clinical counselor who works with transgender youth in collaborations with doctors, said providers follow established medical guidance and families carefully weigh risks and benefits at every step.
"They don't do it haphazardly," she said.
"There are a lot of things about trans kids that a lot of people don't understand," said Jeri Stine Hahn, who raised a Lexington transgender stepdaughter and who runs a support group for parents.
Her stepdaughter, Crystal Hahn, 20, said she socially transitioned at age 10, began hormone blockers at age 11 and began estrogen treatment at age 15. If the proposed bill were law, she said, the struggles would have been monumental.
"I genuinely don't know if I'd even be alive," she said.
Hahn believes the bills were fueled in part after conservatives seized on a case in Texas last year, when two parents clashed in a highly publicized custody battle that included a clash over their 7-year-old and gender identity.
According to media reports, the father alleged that the mother, a doctor, had pushed their child into self-identifying as a girl and advocated for related medical care, a charge the mother flatly denied.
Nonetheless, the father drew support from conservative politicians. Donald Trump Jr. last fall tweeted, "This is child abuse. People need to start to stand up against this bullshit."
The New York Times reported that the South Dakota bill received input from groups including the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom.
The Arizona-based group didn't comment on whether it had consulted on Kentucky's law but issued a statement.
"Our laws should protect every child's opportunity to have a natural childhood. While approaches may differ, we should all agree that there is nothing natural or healthy about pumping kids full of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones," said Matt Sharp, the alliance's senior counsel and director of state government relations. "Children should not be pushed to receive experimental treatments that can leave them permanently sterile and physically marred for life."
The proposed bill in Kentucky also would create protections for public employees who express opinions about gender identity.
And it says parents can withhold consent for "any activity designed and intended to form their child's conceptions of sex or to treat gender dysphoria," the mismatch between gender identity and a person's sex at birth.
The state, under the bill, cannot infringe on that decision.
Its intent may be to give objecting parents a legal foothold, Keisling said.
The measure exempts children with a medically verifiable genetic disorder of sexual development, the bill says.

Texto completo: As always, there is so much happening at the Baxter County Library. Here is just a few of the great programs, events and updates from the Library:
Apron Chronicles Apron Chronicles: A Patchwork of American Recollections will be on display at the Baxter County Library from Valentine's Day, Feb. 14 to Mother's Day, May 10. A series of apron-based programs will be held during the exhibits three-month run. The first program of the series will be Acrylic Painting 101 on Friday, February 21 at 1:30 p.m. Registration is required. Go to baxlib.org to register.
Apron Chronicles: A Patchwork of American Recollections is America's most nostalgic, thought provoking and generational-friendly traveling exhibition. Touring since 2004, Apron Chronicles presents the American experience through 21 photographs by Kristina Loggia, accompanying text in story form and 50 vintage aprons. Utilizing the apron as a symbol immediately recognized by everyone, Apron Chronicles explores the people behind the aprons and is ultimately more about life than fabric. The exhibit's diverse storytellers include an 111-year old mother and her only child and more.
Best-selling author EllynAnne Geisel's stories and vintage apron collection give voice to the exhibit, with Loggia preserving the storytellers' images in an environmental style that complements the unadorned honesty of their recollections. Apron Chronicles national recognition includes Time magazine, the New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning and NPR's Weekend Edition.
Historical documents In 1880, the Baxter County Building Commissioners contracted to build a new courthouse on the square in Mountain Home. The new courthouse endured almost a decade, and the wooden structure burned in February of 1890. Many of the county's valuable records burned or became water- and smoke-damaged, and it was not feasible for the records to be maintained within the county's collection. Seven months later, the Baxter County Quorum Court levied a tax to construct a new courthouse.
After the fire in 1890, County Clerk William F. Eatman immediately began the task of transcribing the damaged documents by hand. Eatman completed his task and his records were certified a little over a decade after the fire. Eatman served as Baxter County Circuit Clerk for 21 years, and he owned the Baxter County Abstracting Company of Mountain Home.
The damaged Baxter County Land Transactions date back to 1857. The end result of Eatman's 10-year task produced a certified six-volume set of land records. Unfortunately, the land transcriptions were never placed back into Baxter County's possession.
Over the decades, Wayne and Carolyn Camp came into possession of these historical documents. In December of 2019, Wayne and Carolyn Camp donated the records to the Baxter County Library, and these records are currently in the Library's digitization project. It is estimated the project will take three months to complete. Once the records are digitized, the six volumes will be given to the Baxter County Clerk's Office and placed in their vault. Then, the Baxter County Library will initiate the next phase of the project, which will be to transcribe the handwritten records.
"We are grateful to the Camps for their care and donation of the records, reference librarian and historian Vincent Anderson said. "These once lost land transcriptions will shed light on some of our history we thought vanished in the flames of 1890. We are looking forward to seeing familiar and unknown names of our region's pioneers to come to light."
In addition to the records, the Camps also donated a historic map of the Buffalo City and Lone Rock region detailing mining claims dating back to 1897.

Biden has the wrong view about internet free speech

Texto completo: Facebook is an easy target. The company is criticized by the right for perceived liberal bias and the left for its role in disseminating political falsehoods. And in this election year, the heat is on.
But it wasn't until this month that we learned former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the presidency, wants to put limits on Facebook and revoke a federal law that the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as "the most important law protecting free speech online." That would be a very big deal.
Understanding what's at stake may take a little reminiscing. If you were online in the early 1990s, it meant you had a subscription to a private service called CompuServe, Prodigy or America Online.
Our interaction online was pretty limited. Essentially, you could post your views on electronic bulletin boards. Soon came ever more accessible operating systems and browsers, and an unprecedented blossoming of online communication. We could all share our views in real time on sites hosted by media and technology companies, or on platforms created by a new generation of entrepreneurs.
Rare wisdom from Congress The marketplace of ideas would grow exponentially online. It was the fulfillment of the ideals of the First Amendment and its promise of free speech for all. But there was a hitch to this exciting development. If websites provided open access to those who wanted to share their views, what would happen if those posts were lies or libels? Aggrieved parties would sue the companies that allowed the post. The companies couldn't possibly check every post for accuracy, so they'd be sued out of existence.
In its wisdom (occasionally it happens), Congress passed a law in 1996 to help ensure that this free flow of views would continue: the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, specifying that sites on the internet would not be held liable for the defamatory posts of others.
Those who defame others online can still be sued, but the conduits for those views are largely free of liability. Yes, some of that free speech online is ugly and manipulative, but thanks to Section 230, a wealth of speech remains fluid and free. For now.
Facebook has earned criticism In a December interview published Jan. 17, Biden told The New York Times that Section 230 "should be revoked because (Facebook) is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false."
Facebook has earned a lot of the criticism coming its way. For all of its talk of lofty ideals, it has demonstrated time and again that it's all about revenue. The company has even refused to review political advertising for falsehoods or bar microtargeting of Facebook users, based on the principle that "people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public."
Translation: "We'll cash their checks and let them lie. You figure it out."
There's certainly merit in revisiting Section 230. We're a long way from dial-up modems. Even so, the notion that we should revoke a law that keeps the free exchange of ideas flowing all over the world is dangerous. Yes, we need to fight the onslaught of foreign and domestic hackers and bots intended to mislead Americans, sow divisions and undermine our elections. But we can't effectively fight those who would undermine American principles by losing sight of them ourselves.

Discrediting Bolton won't be easy for Team Trump NATIONAL VIEWPOINT commentary

Texto completo: "I'm with the Bush-Cheney team, and I'm here to stop the count."
Those words were bellowed by John Bolton in a Tallahassee library in December 2000, when he was part of a team of Republican lawyers trying to stop the Florida recount of votes cast in the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Until now, it was the most famous utterance President Trump's former national security adviser had ever made. That's about to change with the looming publication of his book, due out in March, about serving in the Trump administration. It's even vaguely possible Bolton could make an appearance in Trump's impeachment trial this week.
Still, it's worth considering the irony of Bolton's earlier words. The Bush-Gore Florida recount wasn't the beginning of our divided times, but it was a major inflection point. It pushed the internal combustion engine of partisanship into a higher gear, and we've never really revved back down. Now, Bolton is in the strange position of not fitting comfortably on either side of the partisan divide.
The gist of Bolton's story is that the president's story is not true. According to an account of the book's contents reported in the New York Times, Bolton heard Trump say he was withholding aid to the Ukrainians pending an investigation into Biden and other Democrats. (One wonders who these other Democrats were.)
The Times story says the book also contradicts statements about who knew what and when inside the administration, no doubt causing heartburn for acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, off-book fixer Rudy Giuliani and, of course, all of the GOP senators determined to avoid hearing from witnesses in the impeachment trial.
The response from Trump World is predictable. Bolton is a disgruntled liar, bitter over being fired and desperate to sell books. I have no doubt Bolton, a former colleague of mine at the American Enterprise Institute, is disgruntled. I'm also sure he very much wants to sell books. But I don't buy the lying part.
Bolton may be many of the things his detractors claim, but he's also an incredibly adept lawyer and bureaucratic infighter. On different occasions when National Security Council staffers Fiona Hill and Tim Morrison were dismayed by what the president was up to with Ukraine, Bolton's advice was to "tell the lawyers" (in Morrison's words). When Hill told Bolton that she'd heard Gordon Sondland - Trump's EU ambassador and administration point person on the Ukrainian scheme - tell the Ukrainians that he and Mulvaney would arrange a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation of Biden, Bolton replied, "You go and tell (NSC counsel John Eisenberg) that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you've heard and what I've said."
The notion that Bolton, a legendary note-taker, would volunteer to testify (if subpoenaed) only to perjure himself is absurd. That he would make false allegations in a book without contemporaneous corroboration seems far-fetched as well. There's only one way to know, though: Have Bolton tell his version under oath.
As of this writing, the ink on the official "Destroy Bolton" narrative hasn't dried yet, but an early contender is the charge that this is all just a replay of the tactics Democrats used to try to derail Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.
Except it's not at all. The only thing similar about the two controversies is that new allegations kept inconveniencing politicians who wanted to move on. By that standard, nearly every unfolding Washington scandal is like the Kavanaugh hearings.
Putting aside the hilarity of John "Stop the Count" Bolton being a willing pawn of the Democrats, there were no recorded telephone calls confirming elements of the allegations against Kavanaugh. None of the Kavanaugh accusations had the sort of corroboration and material evidence already in the public record in the impeachment case. And Trump's former national security adviser isn't relying on a decades-old unverifiable recollection, but on his memory of events from a few months ago.
The biggest difference between how the Senate handled the Kavanaugh smear campaign and how it's handling the impeachment case is this: With Kavanaugh, Senate Republicans bent over backward to hear from witnesses; with Trump, they've gone into a defensive crouch to avoid it. And that may not be enough any longer.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses that would bring President Donald Trump's impeachment trial to a swift close.
As the Senate entered a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Trump laced into Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had "begged" for his job, was fired and then wrote "a nasty & untrue book."
Trump's aides circulated a letter on Capitol Hill informing Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president conditioned the release of military aid for Ukraine on the country's willingness to investigate his political rivals. That is a central element of Democrats' impeachment case against the president, which charges him with seeking to enlist a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf.
Off the floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.
Democrats on Wednesday were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial.
"We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents, because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks," Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.
"Is it more likely than not? Probably no," Schumer said. "But is it a decent, good chance? Yes."
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had "heard enough" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.
And Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has said repeatedly that he wants to hear from Bolton and would vote in favor of witnesses and documents, conceded he did not know how many Republicans would join him.
"I'm sure there'll be others," he said. "How many there will be on my side of the aisle, I just don't know."
In answering questions, Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his reelection is in the national interest.
"Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest," said Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of Trump's legal team. "Mostly, you're right."
"If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," he said.
McConnell gave his party's first question Wednesday to Romney and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on calling witnesses. The trio teamed up to ask Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.
The selection of Collins, who is facing the toughest reelection campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward.
Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.
Democrats need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses, will break from his party.
Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Trump's lawyers of incorrectly stating that there was no evidence that Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Dershowitz's argument by saying it was "very odd."
"If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche," Schiff said. "All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt."

Senators' 'conflict' in impeachment

Texto completo: There are a few things to remember today with the impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump underway:
First, the Constitution was written before there were any political parties and the president and vice president might have opposed each other. For that reason, senators were chosen to judge impeachment proceedings; also, they were thought to be better educated and high-minded.
However, today having the Senate decide the fate of an impeached president is an obvious conflict of interest if the president is of the same party as the Senate majority passing judgment on him.
There has been much said and debated about whether a crime needs to have been committed for a conviction in impeachment. Alexander Hamilton, described impeachable offenses as arising from "misconduct of public men, or abuse of some public trust. Such offenses are political, as they relate chiefly to injuries immediately to society itself."
Are there high-minded Republican senators with enough courage to do the right thing?
Roger W. Quagliano, Fort Myers
Democrats and impeachment witnesses The Democrats have brainwashed half the American public and think the other half are morons. Their presentation on impeachment kept emphasizing there is overwhelming, indisputable evidence that Trump should be removed from office.
Then, in the halls of Congress, they complain that they need to have more witnesses, that documents must be released.
The Democrats didn't believe that when they prohibited Republican witnesses in the House hearings. Why doesn't Adam Schiff release all the transcripts from behind closed doors?
Democrats could have subpoenaed the witnesses they are calling for now by going through the proper legal channels, but they were too much in a hurry.
Now we have the typical playbook move by the media of dropping a bombshell with the anonymous leak of the Bolton manuscript, for the sole purpose to force the calling of witnesses.
This whole circus is a collusion effort, let by The New York Times and other media, to affect the 2020 election. So who is really circumventing the Constitution and our forefathers' vision for a republic.
Jeffrey Brown, Bonita Springs
Impeachment not just like other trials Many letter writers in recent weeks have complained that the impeachment process is "unfair" to the president or otherwise improper.
The president's defense attorneys have made this claim, as have government officials, and the president himself.
One is well-advised to read the Constitution itself rather than rely on people who are trying to spin the process or create the appearance of unfairness.
"The House of Representatives ...shall have the sole Power of Impeachment."
"The Senate shall have the sole power to try all Impeachments."
When the president is tried, the chief justice shall preside. Conviction requires the vote of two-thirds of the senators present.
"Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings."
That's why Sen. McConnell says the House does not get to tell the Senate how to run their part of the impeachment, and vice versa. Each chamber of Congress proposes its own rules and votes to accept them or not.
We must remember that impeachment is not the same as a criminal prosecution or a suit at common law, which are mentioned in the Bill of Rights. The impeachment process is not a courtroom trial, no matter what the attorneys may claim or try to suggest.
Edmund F. Becker, Fort Myers
Unlike previous impeachment cases This impeachment trial should be unlike any before it because the offenses are unlike any in previous impeachment trials.
Mr. Trump's offenses involve national security, election tampering, and separation of powers. This is too important to ignore any witnesses or documentary evidence.
I would like to hear what Mr. Bolton has to say about Ukraine. I would like to hear what Mr. Bolton might know of any deal struck between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan to make us abandon the Kurds (in northern Syria — editor's note).
The consequences of doing anything less could be nation-changing.
Ken Robey, Naples

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is preparing a massive show of GOP unity in Iowa ahead of the state's presidential caucus and as a pivotal vote in the Senate impeachment trial exposes rifts among Republicans who will decide his fate.
Days before Iowans choose a Democratic candidate in the nation's first presidential caucus, Trump will take the stage at Drake University in Des Moines for his fourth rally of the year. The campaign will then send an unusually long list of GOP heavyweights to Iowa, including Cabinet officials, congressional leaders and members of Trump's family.
The president's campaign and Republican observers described the parade of political events as a flexing of muscles – a warning to Democrats that Trump's operation is far better organized and funded than it was in 2016. But the display will also serve as a potent reminder of Trump's grip on the party as Senate Republicans wrestle with whether to end his impeachment trial or extend it further by hearing from witnesses.
Live impeachment updates: Trump Senate impeachment trial to resume with final questions
David Kochel, a veteran Republican political operative in Iowa, described the president's itinerary in the state as "classic Trump. "
"It’s a very smart move and it has little to do with his own nomination, which is not in doubt," said Kochel, a senior adviser to Jeb Bush's campaign in 2016. "It’s to fire up our base, and step into the middle of their primary dance and take some of the oxygen. "
The caucuses take place Monday, and the president's travel will coincide with a last-minute push by several of the Democratic candidates seeking to replace him.
Bolton: John Bolton stirs GOP fury but friends say he's prepared for a knife fight
Iowa power: Do winners of the Iowa caucus typically become president?
Trump brings GOP star power to Iowa
Trump's rally will come hours after an official White House event in Michigan to highlight his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a rare bipartisan win for the president that will have implications for Iowa farmers and manufacturers. Then, as the nation shifts its attention to the Democratic caucus race, Trump will send about 80 surrogates to the state.
The roster includes at least eight members of the Cabinet, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. ; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , are also expected to stump for the president. Donald Trump Jr. , Eric Trump and Lara Trump are among the president's family members heading to Iowa.
Incumbent presidents, who usually do not face serious challenges for the nomination, rarely devote so much attention to campaigning so early in the process.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh described the effort as a "good workout for our ground game" and said that the caucuses are "an opportunity to flex the organizational muscles of President Trump’s" operation.
Democrats in the state framed the events as a sign of "panicking. "
"No amount of kicking, screaming, or tweeting can spin that legacy of failure, or voters’ desperation for something new," said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price.
What impeachment questions were asked: Here are questions senators asked during Trump's impeachment trial
Rally on eve of key trial vote
Trump's visit to Iowa initially appeared to offer an opportunity to take a victory lap and a hard pivot to the election. Senate Republican leaders signaled the impeachment trial could wind down as early as Friday, potentially yielding the long-expected acquittal on charges that Trump abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine.
A New York Times report a forthcoming memoir by former Trump national security adviser John Bolton raised new uncertainty about the trial timeline. The Times said the book will allege the president demanded Ukraine officials open an investigation into Biden in exchange for U. S. foreign aid – an issue at the center of the impeachment debate.
A handful of centrist Senate Republicans, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, have said they are willing to hear from witnesses, including Bolton. Friday will be the pivotal day when the GOP-led Senate will decide whether to extend the trial in order to hear from witnesses, or to move forward with a vote on possible acquittal.
Trump, who came in second in the Iowa caucuses in 2016, carried the state in the general election by more than 9 percentage points. Polls suggest the contest could be closer this year, depending on who wins the Democratic nomination. The president was about 2 points ahead of Biden in a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released this month.
That same poll had Trump beating Sen. Bernie Sanders by 6 points and Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 5.
Trump last traveled to Iowa in June to tout his efforts to promote gasoline with higher blends of ethanol – a popular position with many Iowa farmers. He held a campaign rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, a month before the 2018 midterm elections.
What senators are thinking: Senators' questions at Trump impeachment trial show most minds are made up
'Demented hoaxes'
Republican operatives said the president's visit to Iowa was a signal he intends to remain on the offensive and isn't taking even the states he won handily for granted. They also predicted the effort may draw attention away from what is expected to be a huge turnout among Democrats. If the turnout is larger than usual, it could be read as a show of strength by Democrats with implications beyond Iowa.
"Deploying this many surrogates on caucus night – and the caliber of the surrogates covering the amount of ground statewide – will yield tremendous dividends as Iowa Republicans begin focusing on the general election," said Jimmy Centers, a Republican consultant who worked for former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad.
Centers rejected the idea that Trump's show of force in the state had anything to do with the impeachment trial, noting that voters have generally not named impeachment as a top election issue in polls. "The trial occurring around the Iowa caucuses," he said, "is nothing more than a coincidence. "
Trump barely mentioned the trial during a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday. He slammed Democrats for “demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts and deranged partisan crusades,” but that language is similar to what he has embraced at his rallies for years. Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters that Democrats had been working for years to overturn the results of the 2016 election. And he vowed they would not succeed.
"We will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the next election," Trump said. "We are going to have a victory that is even greater than 2016. "

Trump plans broader tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has announced plans to broaden his tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, saying the existing tariffs had not proved as effective as he had hoped in reviving U.S. production.
In a proclamation late last week, the president accused foreign companies of trying to "circumvent" the 25% tariff he placed on foreign steel and the 10% tariff he placed on foreign aluminum in 2018. Imports of steel and aluminum into the United States have declined since the tariffs went into place, he said, but imports of products made with those metals had "significantly increased."
The net effect "has been to erode the customer base for U.S. producers of aluminum and steel and undermine" the effect of original tariffs, Trump said.
As a result, he said, the United States will expand its tariffs to cover products made of steel and aluminum - like nails, tacks, staples, cables, certain types of wire, and bumpers and other parts for cars and tractors - as of Feb. 8.
For U.S. companies making these products, the announcement came as a relief.
Jeff Ferry, chief economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a trade group that counts companies making steel, cables and other products among its membership, called the measure "a wise move."
"What we've seen with the steel and aluminum tariffs is that it has stimulated both of those industries, leading to additional capital investment and additional jobs," he said, adding that he expected the new tariffs to stimulate the new industries as well.
For economists and trade experts, however, it was an "I told you so" moment.
Economists have long argued that by raising the price of steel and aluminum, Trump's tariffs would make it more expensive to produce things like nails or cars in the United States - and would encourage companies to import more of those items, rather than making them in the United States.
Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called this an example of "cascading protectionism" that he said was "entirely predictable."
"Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs have raised the cost of key inputs, making American companies that rely on those metals less competitive worldwide," Bown said. "Now Trump is expanding his tariffs to shield their products from competition as well. Where will it end?"
Richard Baldwin, a professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, wrote on Twitter that Trump was learning this particular lesson in economics "one failure at a time."
In his order expanding the tariffs, Trump pointed to large increases in imports of certain products made of steel and aluminum. From June 2018 to May, imports of items including steel nails and staples rose 33% from a year earlier, the order said. Imports of aluminum wire and cable were up 152% over the same period.
"This is really the blowback on the tariffs," Lisa Reisman, executive editor of MetalMiner, an industry publication, said in an email.
Trump has declared that his trade policies are delivering on his promises to revive the manufacturing sector by sheltering U.S. businesses from unfair competition and encouraging companies to move factories back to the United States.
But a study released by two economists at the Federal Reserve in December showed that the costs of Trump's trade approach to China had outweighed its benefits for manufacturers.
Tariffs offered U.S. companies some protection from Chinese imports, the study showed. But those positive effects were more than offset by the negative effects of the trade war, including the higher prices companies must pay to import components from China, and the retaliatory tariffs China had placed on the United States.

The essence of dumplings Bowl of creamy farro, mushrooms hits the spot

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A few years ago, I made the Russian baths a regular part of my New York life. The ritual of the shvitz - steaming, sweating and rinsing - is why I go (health!), but if I'm being honest, I also am very much there for the food (pleasure!).
I eat there not out of necessity, but because it's low-key and one of my favorite restaurants in town. My order changes every time - pickles, cabbage, soup, pickled cabbage soup - but I always get the pelmeni, tortellini-size dumplings filled with pork, served in a squat ramekin, coated in melted butter and a splash of the cooking liquid. Finished with caramelized onions, lots of dill and a generous portion of sour cream alongside, they are kind of the opposite of a healthy trip to the spa - unless you consider mental health a part of that journey. (I do.)
Every time I eat those little miracles, I can't stop thinking about how I could write a recipe that approximates them without asking someone to make dumplings. (I'd never do that to you.)
I thought about the chewiness of the dumpling wrapper, the delicately meaty taste of the filling and slight brothiness of the liquid they come in. I thought about how necessary the dill is, and about how I always wanted a squeeze of lemon but wouldn't dare ask.
And that's how I got here: creamy farro with crispy mushrooms, sour cream and lots of dill. Yes, there is also a side of lemon.
OK, so, no: A bowl of farro and mushrooms isn't exactly a plate of dumplings, but hear me out. The way the mushrooms are cooked and crisped alongside the thinly sliced, caramelizing leeks gives them such a delightfully meaty flavor that they're almost better than meat itself. The farro, toasted in the pot before it's cooked, reinforces that vague meatiness. (Chicken broth helps, but you can use vegetable broth or even water to keep it vegetarian.) In the end, the squeaky chew of each grain coupled with the porridge-y consistency reminds me of the dumplings swimming in that buttery broth.
Topped with sour cream and a sprinkle of a lemony dill mixture, made better with the addition of chives, it hits the spot, even without the shvitz.
Creamy farro with crispy mushrooms
and sour cream
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 1 hour
1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle,
torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley
4 cups vegetable broth, chicken broth or water
1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing
Sour cream, for serving
1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the leeks and half the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and crisped, 12 to 15 minutes. (They will start giving off moisture and steaming a little before this happens, so be patient.)
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a medium bowl leaving any olive oil behind. (They will have absorbed the oil as they cook, and released it back as they crisp.) Add a bit more olive oil so there's another 1/4 cup or so in the pot. Cook the remaining leeks and mushrooms, adding them to the bowl with the other mushrooms.
3. Without wiping the pot, add farro and season with salt and pepper. Cook over that same medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until farro is toasted on the outside (it will go from pale golden brown to a toastier golden brown), about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and 2 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring to a strong simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until farro is fully cooked and most (but not all) of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. It should still look a bit loose, like risotto or a porridge. Remove from heat and add half the chives.
5. Toss dill, remaining chives and lemon zest together in a small bowl. To serve, season farro with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls. Top with sour cream, mushrooms and leeks, and dill mixture. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing.

Texto completo: The Senate impeachment session for Thursday ended. The trial is expected to begin again on Friday at 1 pm.
Below is a recap of how things played out.
Direct evidence?
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, presented one of the final questions of the evening, asking if there was “any evidence that anyone was directed by President Trump to tell the Ukrainians that security assistance was being held on condition of investigation into the Bidens?"
House Manager Adam Schiff said there were two pieces of direct evidence of the conditioning of aid: U. S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland’s testimony, and the statements from acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
“The president made the direct link to Ambassador Sondland,” and Sondland talked with the Ukrainians about the linkage, Schiff explained.
Schiff also mentioned Mulvaney’s press conference in which the Trump administration aide had told reporters aid had been contingent on the opening of investigations, though Mulvaney later walked the remarks back.
Michael Purpura, counsel to the President, disagreed.
"In the House record before us, there was no evidence that the president told anyone to tell the Ukrainians that the aid was linked. ”
He cited Sondland’s testimony and Sen. Ron Johnson’s statements that Trump had told them there was “no quid pro quo” and no connection between investigations and aid.
Former Republican senator calls for witnesses in Senate trial
Late Thursday evening, former Sen. John Warner, a Republican who represented Virginia from 1979 until 2009, issued a statement calling for witnesses in the Senate trial of President Donald Trump.
"As a lifelong Republican and a retired member of the U. S. Senate, who once served as a juror in a Presidential impeachment trial, I am mindful of the difficult responsibilities those currently serving now shoulder," Warner said.
Warner said the Senate could not risk Americans believing the trial was a "sham" because of a lack of additional evidence, so he would urge the Senate to follow "judicial norms" and welcome "relevant witnesses and documents as part of this impeachment trial. "
During President Bill Clinton's trial, Warner voted against charges of perjury but for obstruction of justice.

Murkowski asks why Senators shouldn’t call John Bolton as a witnesses
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. , who is a potential swing vote, asked White House lawyers Thursday night why the Senate should not call former national security adviser John Bolton since the reported comments in his upcoming book contradict the president's legal team.
“This dispute about material facts weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses with direct knowledge,” the question asked, also pointing out the contradictions between Ambassador Gordan Sondland, Sen. Johnson, and Bolton on whether there was a quid pro quo. “Why should this body not call Ambassador Bolton?"
Philbin answered that the Senate shouldn't finish the House's job in terms of witnesses while adding Bolton hasn't verified reports about his manuscript.
“Ambassador Bolton has not come out to verify that to my knowledge, but then we should have this chamber called new witnesses and establish the new normal for impeachment proceedings as being that there doesn't have to be a complete investigation in the House, I think that is very damaging for the future of this institution,” Philbin said.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc. , grimaced slightly as his name was mentioned when Chief Justice John Roberts read out the question.
Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. , an undecided vote on witnesses, looked up from the book he was reading and stared over at Murkowski.
Bolton allegedly wrote in the book that Trump demanded Ukraine investigate a political rival in exchange for foreign aid, an accusation that is central to the impeachment case against the president.

Democrats see hope in having Chief Justice Roberts break a tie
Senate Democrats see hope in having Chief Justice John Roberts break a potential 50-50 tie vote on witnesses tomorrow.
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, told USA TODAY Roberts “should” help break ties on witnesses.
"I would like him to step up for the traditional system and help us bring witnesses," Brown said.
Roberts should “absolutely” break a tie,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N. Y. , told USA TODAY.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. , told reporters Roberts has "got the precedent if he wants to use it. "
"In Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial, the Chief Justice broke two ties in terms of the questions of the visibility around witnesses and evidence, so he's got the precedent if he wants to use it," Coons explained.
One Senate Democrat, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , submitted a question during the trial pointed at Roberts and his role in the process.
“At a time where large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the Chief Justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus refused witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the Chief Justice, Supreme Court of the United States and Constitution?” Warren's question read.
Republicans disagreed.
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. , a former clerk for Roberts, told reporters he would be “surprised if he broke the tie. ”
Hawley explained the prior precedent for then-Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase’s tie-breaking votes during Johnson’s impeachment trial was “fiercely controversial,” with multiple motions introduced in the Senate to try to overturn them, though they all failed.
“I think he would probably take an out because it gets political at that point,” said Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind.

Ex-Giuliani associate gives more material to impeachment investigators
Brace yourself for the possibility that House impeachment investigators might disclose more information from Lev Parnas, the Ukraine-born businessman who helped President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, seek damaging information about former Vice President Joe Biden.
Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, told a federal judge in New York on Thursday his office has downloaded material from his client's Apple iCloud account and turned it over to the House Intelligence Committee.
"We're doing everything possible to cooperate" with a subpoena issued last year, Bondy said. More material will be handed over as it is downloaded, he said, adding that he might make some of it public even if impeachment investigators do not.
During a Wednesday news conference with Parnas outside the U. S. Capitol, Bondy told reporters some of Parnas' material could implicate Trump.
Bondy discussed the evidence after a hearing in a campaign finance case in which Parnas, business associate Igor Fruman, and two co-defendants are charged with funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money to U. S. election candidates and committees.
The case includes a $325,000 contribution that Parnas and Fruman allegedly made under false pretenses to a super PAC supporting Trump.
Unlike Fruman, Parnas has broken ranks with Giuliani and Trump — who maintains he does not know Parnas, despite a video showing Parnas with his arm on the president's shoulder during a gathering at Trump's Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida.
Another hearing in the case is set for Monday. Attorneys for all but one defendant said their clients would prefer to waive their right to attend.
But not Parnas. "We couldn't keep him away, your honor," Bondy said.

Trump’s lawyers say Giuliani did not carry out U. S. diplomacy
The first bipartisan question of the trial came from Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Susan Collins, R-Me. , Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. , and Joe Manchin, D-W. V. , to Trump’s lawyers, asking them to “assure the American public” private citizens would not carry out American diplomacy.
"I want to make clear that there was no conduct of foreign policy being carried out here by a private person,” said Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin, noting the question likely referred to Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.
Witnesses in the impeachment inquiry described Giuliani as part of a “parallel track” of American diplomacy to pressure Ukraine to open politically motivated investigations, and Giuliani has said his actions in Ukraine were part of legal work to defend his client, Trump.
“The president’s policy is always to abide by the laws and continue to do so,” Philbin said, responding to a part of the question that noted unauthorized diplomacy by U. S. citizens was prohibited under the Logan Act.
Philbin also referenced precedent from previous presidents who had asked private citizens to act as messengers to foreign countries, as President George Washington had asked Gouverneur Morris to do with France.
“That is a remarkable admission,” House Manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said later in the trial.
“They have now acknowledged that the person in charge of this was not conducting policy. So the investigations that Giuliani was charged with trying to get Ukraine to announce were not policy,” Schiff said.
Instead, they were “domestic political errands,” Schiff argued.

McConnell huddles with key vote hours before witness vote
Hours before the Senate will decide whether it will consider additional witnesses and documents as part of the president's impeachment trial, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell huddled with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a key vote, for several minutes on the Senate floor during a break.
While the two were talking, Sen. Susan Collins, another key Republican vote, was approached by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, one of the Democrats who is thought to be considering Trump's acquittal. The two locked arms and Manchin escorted Collins to the back of the chamber, where the pair talked for several minutes then left together.
Manchin also greeted Sen. John Thune, the Republican whip attempting to unify the GOP in voting against witnesses, with a handshake that turned into a hug.

Trump’s lawyer claims Trump didn't ask Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens
Several Republican senators asked both President Donald Trump’s lawyers and Democratic impeachment managers under what circumstances a “president could request a foreign country to investigate a US citizen including a political rival who is not under investigation. ”
Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin answered the question by going back to the record of Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump had asked Zelensky to “do us a favor” and look into allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
Philbin, however, asserted that Trump had not called “for an investigation necessarily into Vice President Biden or his son, but the situation in which the prosecutor had been fired,” referring to the ouster of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
Republicans have argued Trump’s conduct on the call was justified because of his concerns about the Bidens and corruption.
Philbin continued, arguing that potential malfeasance by an American overseas would be “perfectly legitimate" to ask about, even if it’s “not something that would mean a criminal investigation here in the United States. ”
Sens. Susan Collins, R-Me. , Roy Blunt, R-Mo. , Marco Rubio, R-Fla. , and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, had posed the question. Collins is a key undecided vote on both allowing witnesses and Trump’s conviction or acquittal.
Democrats disagreed. House Manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said “it would be hard for me to contemplate circumstances where that would be appropriate. ”
Citing reforms made after the Watergate scandal, Schiff said such an ask would be “contrary to the history of our legal traditions. ”

Schiff cites the Justice Department’s argument against Trump’s lawyers
Arguing in support of the obstruction of Congress charge, House Manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , cited arguments made by Department of Justice lawyers today about the remedy for failure to comply with subpoenas.
Schiff said the Justice Department had argued Congress had the power to impeach the president if subpoenas were ignored – an incongruity, he said, that was in the category of “you can’t make this stuff up,”
“What more evidence do you need of the bad faith of this effort to cover up?”, Schiff asked senators.
Trump’s defense team has argued throughout the trial that the president cannot be impeached over failure to comply with subpoenas because of executive privilege.
The Democratic side of the chamber erupted in laughter and sounds of exasperation as Schiff spoke, and many Democrats looked at each other and shook their heads in disbelief.
Senator Jeff Merkley, D-OR. , threw his hands up in the air.
As Schiff kept speaking, and eventually answered the original question from Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, about the withholding of aid to Ukraine, many Republican chambers left the chamber and walked into their cloakroom off the Senate floor.
By the end of Schiff’s remarks, USA TODAY counted 13 empty seats on the Republican side of the chamber.

Jeffries: US 'is not a banana republic'
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, one of the House managers in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, declared that the United States “is not a banana republic” in blasting the president’s willingness to accept information from foreigners in his political campaign.
“It’s wrong in the United States of America,” said Jeffries, D-N. Y. “This is not a banana republic. ”
The articles of impeachment accuse Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, while withholding $391 million in military aid. Jeffries was responding to a question from Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. , about the implications of foreign countries interfering in U. S. elections.
The House managers had just played a video of Trump telling ABC News in the Oval Office that he would listen to what a foreign country offered. Another video featured Trump outside the White House telling reporters that China should investigate Biden.
“There’s nothing wrong with listening,” Trump told ABC News. “If somebody called from a country – Norway – we have information on your opponent. I’d think I’d want to hear it. It’s not an interference. They have information. I think I’d take it. ”
But Jeffries said Trump and his defense team were wrong, that foreign interference is illegal and disqualifying. He quoted FBI Director Christopher Wray saying the FBI “would want to know about foreign election interference. ”
Jeffries also quoted Ellen Weintraub, a member of the Federal Election Committee, who issued a statement on June 13, 2019, about foreign influence.
“It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U. S. election,” Weintraub said. “This is not a novel concept. Electoral interference from foreign governments has been considered unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation. ”
In a fiery summation, Jeffries said foreign influence is at the heart of the case about why the Senate should remove Trump from office.
“It is wrong. It is corrupt. It is lawless. It’s an abuse of power. It’s impeachable,” Jeffries said. “And it should lead to the removal of President Donald John Trump. ”

Justice Roberts refuses to read question from Sen. Rand Paul
WASHINGTON – Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. , submitted a question during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts refused to read.
“The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted,” said Roberts, who did not offer further explanation.
Paul walked out of the chamber after Roberts declined the question. He told reporters his question didn’t name the alleged whistleblower - although his question, which he wrote in a tweet, mentioned the name of an official some Republicans have speculated is the whistleblower.
The question revived allegations from some Trump allies that the whistleblower “conspired” with a House committee staff member to reveal information that would lead to the president’s impeachment. Paul did not offer evidence for the claim.
“It was an incorrect finding to not allow a question,” Paul said, but declined to say why he did not force a vote to overrule Roberts.
Before the question, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , opened the question session by assuring Roberts that the Senate would respect his "unique position in reading in reading our questions. "
“I want to be able to continue to assure him that that level of consideration for him will continue," he said.
- Bart Jansen
Pelosi: Trump 'will not be acquitted'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump can't be exonerated if senators don't call witnesses in his impeachment trial.
“He will not be acquitted,” Pelosi told reporters. “You cannot be acquitted if you don’t have a trial. And you don’t have a trial if you don’t have witnesses and documentation. ”
The speaker was responding to repeated questions from reporters about Democrats’ next move if the Senate clears Trump.
“We’re still prayerful, hopeful,” she insisted, “that the Senate will have the courage to hear the truth. ”
Does she think Trump will be chastened and understand that Congress is watching him, she was asked, or will he be emboldened?
Pelosi restated the question before answering.
“Does the president know right from wrong? I don’t think so,” she said. “That’s all I can say. ”
Attempt to block book: Donald Trump security officials threaten to block publication of John Bolton's book
Channeling Paul Revere, Pelosi warned that democracy and the nation’s system of government are at stake.
“The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming,” she said. “And the president has led a clear path for them to interfere, once again, in our election as they are currently doing. ”
Pelosi, who has said before that all roads lead to Russia, added: “I don’t know what the Russians have on the president, politically, personally or financially, but he doesn’t see Russia as an adversary. ”

Dershowitz responds to criticism of 'mixed motives' argument
Trump defense attorney Alan Dershowitz pushed back Thursday against criticism of his argument during the first day of questions in the trial that said it was not impeachable for elected officials to act for their own political benefit if they believe their election is in the public interest.
He said that engaging in a quid pro quo that broke the law, or was for personal financial gain, would be impeachable, however.
Critics, such as 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said Dershowitz’s argument placed the president above the law and paved the way for unrestrained abuses of power. And many compared it to former President Richard Nixon’s infamous declaration that no presidential act can be considered illegal.
Dershowitz said his argument was being “willfully misconstrued” and elaborated on his answer in a series of tweets. He said he was responding to the House impeachment managers’ “claim that any electoral benefit would constitute an impeachable quid pro quo. ” He said his point was that a president could act out of “mixed motives” that were both in the national interest and his or her own political interest.

Another 8 hours of questions on tap Thursday
The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump resumes Thursday with up to another eight hours of questions to House Democrats prosecuting the case and the president’s defense team.
The second and final question session begins at 1 p. m. With opening arguments out of the way for each side, the question phase sets up pivotal votes Friday about whether the Senate will call witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton.
Many of the questions Wednesday focused on Bolton because the New York Times reported that his pending book says Trump demanded Ukraine investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, in exchange for military aid. Trump has denied saying it and his defense team attacked Bolton as a disgruntled former worker.
'Is that true?': Here are questions senators asked during Trump's impeachment trial
Bolton's accusation could serve as confirmation of the central House impeachment allegation. But the National Security Council contends the book contains classified information, which could hinder its publication scheduled in March.
The House managers led by Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , contend that the trial won’t be fair unless the Senate calls witnesses such as Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.
But Trump’s defense team called the House case “half-baked” and said if witnesses were necessary, the House should have called them. Trump’s team also said the testimony could potentially be blocked by executive privilege, in order to protect confidential advice from top aides.
Several questions focused on the burden of proof senators should weigh in deciding whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. The president’s removal is unlikely because it would require a two-thirds majority in a chamber with 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats.
What are senators thinking?: Senators' questions at Trump impeachment trial show most minds are made up
Trump’s team has argued that the impeachment is unconstitutional because it isn’t based on violations of criminal statute, but on vague accusations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The defense lawyers argued that the House managers should have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, as with a criminal case.
House managers contend that the article on abuse of power has been used in past impeachment inquiries against former Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. In this case, Schiff said the charge is akin to bribery or extortion because Trump demanded an investigation in exchange for $391 million in military aid. The House managers said senators should use their own judgment in deciding whether to remove Trump.

Democrats court doom by backing Sanders

Texto completo: In 2018, a top adviser on the Bernie Sanders campaign published a book called "How Bernie Won." Its audacious title drove a story line about the 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton: Sanders hadn't lost, not really. Rather, he had won in the states that mattered most, and his ideas were proven to be winners.
This is a fairy tale – and a dangerous one. If Democratic voters, hungry for a winner, buy into that myth and believe that Sanders is the most "electable" candidate, they will be making a grave mistake that could hand the presidency back to Donald Trump.
Let's start with the actual results in the 2016 primary. It was not remotely close. Sanders lost by 3.8 million votes, 57-43%. Clinton won 34 states and territories to his 23. Still, Sanders' team contends that the 2016 results augur well for him, because he dominated in the Midwest, where the presidency is often decided. In particular, they claim that he is popular in the former "Blue Wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which turned red in 2016 and delivered Trump his victory.
In fact, Sanders lost to Clinton by over 200,000 votes in the nine states of the Midwest. In the three onetime Blue Wall battleground states, she topped him by more than 45,000 votes, though he beat her in Wisconsin and edged her by a point in Michigan. In Ohio, Clinton won by 14 points and nearly 166,000 votes. The best you can say for Sanders is that he didn't lose as badly in the Midwest as he did elsewhere.
Indeed, in the Sunbelt, the other area that Democrats hope to make a battleground in 2020, Sanders got crushed. He lost Florida 64-33%, Arizona 58-40%, North Carolina 55-41% and Texas 65-33%. Taken together, Clinton trounced Sanders in those four states by more than 1.2 million votes.
And, of course, those were only primary voters. What would the general electorate make of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.? We know that the Trump campaign will seek to label any Democratic nominee a "socialist" – a regular Republican tactic that usually goes nowhere because Democratic nominees have never really been socialists.
The charge would stick, because this is an identity that he himself has proudly trumpeted. And 55% of Americans view socialism negatively. That would be quite a weight around a nominee's neck in a general election.
The potency of this pending attack is also underscored by Sanders' central policy proposal: "Medicare for All." His plan would hand the government control over nearly a fifth of the American economy. It doesn't take much Trumpian demagoguery to label that "socialized medicine."
And we don't have to speculate about the political impact of Medicare for All. It was tested in the 2018 midterms when, as a University of Virginia study recently found, it cost Democrats in swing districts who embraced it nearly 5 points.
Worse, Sanders' overall record since 2016 guts his case. On the very day in 2017 that The New York Times published an op-ed he wrote entitled, "How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections," his favored candidate in the Virginia gubernatorial primary got blown out by moderate Ralph Northam, who went on to trounce the Republican in the general election.
In 2018, Sanders waded into the Michigan governor's race and backed Abdul El-Sayed, a young, far-left candidate. He lost every county in the state to the more mainstream Gretchen Whitmer. She went on to soundly beat the Republican by promising not a "revolution" but rather to "fix the damn roads."
This pattern repeated itself across the country. Sanders and his political organization backed candidates at every level, to little or no avail. Their endorsees did not flip House seats from red to blue in 2018, proving his ideas work only in safely Democratic places.

Texto completo: Doctors could be jailed for providing transgender youth with identity-related medical treatments under a new bill in the Kentucky legislature, the latest in a series of conservative legislative efforts in several states aimed at transgender minors.
The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Savannah Maddox, would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe medications, including puberty-blocking or hormone treatments, or conduct surgeries, for anyone younger than 18 with the intent to alter their gender.
Ostensibly aimed at barring children who could still be grappling with their gender identity from undergoing body-changing treatments, the measure drew a sharp rebuke from LGBTQ advocates and families who say it would only heighten risks for transgender youth.
"These sorts of decisions need to be made by medical providers, not politicians," said Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ-rights organization in Louisville. He said it represents a "coordinated political attack" on transgender people "for election-year purposes."
Maddox did not respond to messages seeking comment. But last fall she wrote on her Facebook page her intention to draft the bill, saying, "I am a strong advocate for parent's (sic) rights — but it is not the right of a parent to permanently alter a child's gender or identity, even when based upon certain behaviors or the perceptions of a child's mind which has not yet had time to fully develop."
It's rare for transgender minors to get surgery, and most have undergone years of consultations with doctors, counselors and family, often first changing names or how they dress, before any medications are adopted, experts said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week issued a study that found access to puberty blockers helped reduced risks of mental health problems and suicide attempts, which some studies say are as high 40% among transgender youth.
"It's a horrible thing," Cassie Kasey said of the bill. Kasey said puberty blockers were important during a critical juncture for her transgender daughter, Maddie Dalton, who is now 20.
Dalton was among the first students at Louisville's Atherton High School to come out as transgender, and her subsequent push for a policy allowing her to use the women's restroom and locker room sparked a fiery public controversy in 2014 that made national headlines.
The measure joins several other proposed bills targeting transgender individuals in Kentucky's General Assembly this year.
That includes a resurrected "bathroom bill" that would ban transgender students from using public restrooms that align with their gender identities.
Another bill targets transgender individuals in sports, forcing student-athletes to compete in school sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.
Bills restricting access to hormone treatment and surgeries for young transgender people have been introduced in several states, including South Dakota, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
Such measures run counter to standards and guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, the group said.
The Kentucky Medical Association did not immediately provide a response to the legislation. Some transgender residents said it would make getting knowledgeable transgender medical care extremely difficult for families.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving youths access to "comprehensive gender-affirming and developmentally appropriate health care" while laying out risks and benefits.
Janet Vessels, a Kentucky clinical counselor who works with transgender youth in collaborations with doctors, said providers follow established medical guidance and families carefully weigh risks and benefits at every step. "They don't do it haphazardly," she said.
"There are a lot of things about trans kids that a lot of people don't understand," said Jeri Stine Hahn, who raised a Lexington transgender stepdaughter and who runs a support group for parents.
Her stepdaughter, Crystal Hahn, 20, said she socially transitioned at age 10, began hormone blockers at age 11 and began estrogen treatment at age 15. If the proposed bill were law, she said, the struggles would have been monumental. "I genuinely don't know if I'd even be alive," she said.
Hahn believes the bills were fueled in part after conservatives seized on a case in Texas last year, when two parents clashed in a highly publicized custody battle that included a clash over their 7-year-old and gender identity.
According to media reports, the father alleged that the mother, a doctor, had pushed their child into identifying as a girl and advocated for related medical care, a charge the mother flatly denied.
The New York Times reported that the South Dakota bill received input from groups including the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom.
The proposed bill in Kentucky also would create protections for public employees who express opinions about gender identity. And it says parents can withhold consent for "any activity designed and intended to form their child's conceptions of sex or to treat gender dysphoria," the mismatch between gender identity and a person's sex at birth.
The measure exempts children with a medically verifiable genetic disorder of sexual development, the bill says.
Nearly three years ago Maddie Dalton became the first student at Louisville's Atherton High to come out as a transgender woman, and her push to use the women's bathroom sparked a public controversy.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A few years ago, I made the Russian baths a regular part of my New York life. The ritual of the shvitz - steaming, sweating and rinsing - is why I go (health!), but if I'm being honest, I also am very much there for the food (pleasure!).
I eat there not out of necessity, but because it's low-key and one of my favorite restaurants in town. My order changes every time - pickles, cabbage, soup, pickled cabbage soup - but I always get the pelmeni, tortellini-size dumplings filled with pork, served in a squat ramekin, coated in melted butter and a splash of the cooking liquid. Finished with caramelized onions, lots of dill and a generous portion of sour cream alongside, they are kind of the opposite of a healthy trip to the spa - unless you consider mental health a part of that journey. (I do.)
Every time I eat those little miracles, I can't stop thinking about how I could write a recipe that approximates them without asking someone to make dumplings. (I'd never do that to you.)
I thought about the chewiness of the dumpling wrapper, the delicately meaty taste of the filling and slight brothiness of the liquid they come in. I thought about how necessary the dill is, and about how I always wanted a squeeze of lemon but wouldn't dare ask.
And that's how I got here: creamy farro with crispy mushrooms, sour cream and lots of dill. Yes, there is also a side of lemon.
OK, so, no: A bowl of farro and mushrooms isn't exactly a plate of dumplings, but hear me out. The way the mushrooms are cooked and crisped alongside the thinly sliced, caramelizing leeks gives them such a delightfully meaty flavor that they're almost better than meat itself. The farro, toasted in the pot before it's cooked, reinforces that vague meatiness. (Chicken broth helps, but you can use vegetable broth or even water to keep it vegetarian.) In the end, the squeaky chew of each grain coupled with the porridge-y consistency reminds me of the dumplings swimming in that buttery broth.
Topped with sour cream and a sprinkle of a lemony dill mixture, made better with the addition of chives, it hits the spot, even without the shvitz.
Creamy farro with crispy mushrooms
and sour cream
Makes: 4 servings
Total time: 1 hour
1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle,
torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley
4 cups vegetable broth, chicken broth or water
1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing
Sour cream, for serving
1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the leeks and half the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and crisped, 12 to 15 minutes. (They will start giving off moisture and steaming a little before this happens, so be patient.)
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a medium bowl leaving any olive oil behind. (They will have absorbed the oil as they cook, and released it back as they crisp.) Add a bit more olive oil so there's another 1/4 cup or so in the pot. Cook the remaining leeks and mushrooms, adding them to the bowl with the other mushrooms.
3. Without wiping the pot, add farro and season with salt and pepper. Cook over that same medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until farro is toasted on the outside (it will go from pale golden brown to a toastier golden brown), about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and 2 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring to a strong simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until farro is fully cooked and most (but not all) of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. It should still look a bit loose, like risotto or a porridge. Remove from heat and add half the chives.
5. Toss dill, remaining chives and lemon zest together in a small bowl. To serve, season farro with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls. Top with sour cream, mushrooms and leeks, and dill mixture. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing.

As looming execution shows, Florida courts primed to bury their mistakes Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: Second in an occasional series

There is no room for confidence that Florida hasn't executed innocent people or won't do so again.
Former Supreme Court Justice Gerald Kogan, who had sought the death penalty as a prosecutor and opposed it in private practice, spoke in stark terms to an Amnesty International conference.
"We certainly have, in the past, executed those people who either didn't fit the criteria for execution in the State of Florida or who, in fact, were, factually, not guilty," he said.
That was 20 years ago.
At least 73 times in recent years, Florida's error-prone criminal justice system has convicted people who were later exonerated, including 29 who had been sent to death row.
More than 327,000 people went to Florida's state prisons during the past 10 years, so the exoneration rate is miniscule. If it proves anything, it is only the extraordinary difficulty of persuading the courts to admit and correct their human errors. Instead, the judiciary is primed to bury its mistakes.
Post-conviction barriers to fixing mistakes is one of the strongest reasons for abolishing the death penalty, as we and others have advocated.
No example is more damning than the ordeal of James Dailey, 76, who shouldn't even have been convicted 33 years ago, let alone be on the brink of execution, for a murder that another man has repeatedly said he committed alone.
Dailey's case exposes five of the system's faults: Questionable evidence, over-zealous prosecutions, unequal treatment of co-defendants, the reliance on rules and technicalities to the exclusion of fairness, and the failure of six recent governors to commute even one sentence to life in prison without parole.
As the Florida Supreme Court has declared on more than one occasion, innocence is not grounds to overturn a verdict, even with a life at stake. The defendant must show that the trial court or the state did something wrong, and that his attorneys didn't wait until too late to call attention to it. As in Dailey's case, there is a fatal phrase: "Procedurally barred."
No physical or eyewitness testimony linked Dailey to the 1985 murder of a 14-year-old girl in Pinellas County. After a co-defendant was sentenced to life in prison rather than death, the sheriff's office scoured the jail for inmates who might say that they heard Dailey say he did it. To jog their memories - or their imaginations - the lead detective brought newspaper accounts of the murder.
He turned up three snitches. The most harmful was a career criminal named Paul Skalnick, who was notorious for selling out fellow prisoners to get sweet deals for himself. He once boasted in a letter to Gov. Lawton Chiles that "I have placed 34 individuals in prison, including four on death row."
Skalnick was a serial con artist and, later, a bigamist who admitted to Dailey's jury that he had been charged with "grand theft," but "not murder, not rape, not physical violence in my life." In fact, according to ABC News and Dailey's attorneys, prosecutor Robert Heyman knew that his office had dismissed a child sex assault case against Skalnick in exchange for testimony against other inmates. Rather than expose the deception, Heyman argued to the jury that as a thief, Skalnick was a better sort of criminal - and a more credible witness.
Five days after Dailey was sentenced to death, Skalnick was released without bond on a grand theft charge despite a parole officer's earlier warning that he would "always be a danger to society." He skipped out and continued his crime spree in Texas, where he was eventually convicted of child rape.
Strong indications of perjury and prosecutorial misconduct are crucial issues in last-ditch appeals pending in Circuit Court at Clearwater and with the U.S. Supreme Court.
Having relied on the worst sort of hearsay testimony to uphold Dailey's death sentence, the Florida courts dismissed as hearsay the compelling evidence that Jack Pearcy, Dailey's co-defendant, committed the murder alone.
Pearcy admitted his guilt to other prisoners and signed two affidavits absolving Dailey. But when brought before a circuit judge, he balked at testifying. Pearcy, 64 and a prisoner for 33 years, was concerned about jeopardizing his chances for parole.
At the prosecution's request, according to Dailey's attorneys, the judge warned Pearcy that it could be against his best interest to repeat his confession in open court.
In an application to speak on Dailey's behalf at the U.S. Supreme Court, seven present and former prosecutors accuse the state of misleading the jury in 1987 to believe the jailhouse snitches "were testifying solely out of altruistic motives" and had more to lose than gain by helping the state convict Dailey.
The seven include former attorneys general of Virginia and Tennessee, and a former state attorney at Jacksonville, Harry Shorestein.
"The jury never learned," they wrote, "that all three informants had greatly profited from their testimony. All three had their sentences significantly reduced because they agreed to testify against Mr. Dailey....The prosecutor assured jurors that there was no reason to disbelieve the informants.
"The risk that the three informants fabricated testimony is very real ... the risk is so substantial that to proceed with an execution on this state of the record is untenable."
If Dailey were given a new trial, he would almost certainly go free - as he should.
Skalnick, who damned Dailey with highly suspect testimony, is no longer available to do it again. He was in a nursing home in Texas when a reporter found him for a New York Times Magazine lead story entitled "False Witness." Even if he could travel, his subsequent criminal record would disqualify him as a state witness.
Florida leads the nation in death row exonerations. Dailey's would make 30. It is long overdue.

Trump plans broader tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has announced plans to broaden his tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, saying the existing tariffs had not proved as effective as he had hoped in reviving U.S. production.
In a proclamation late last week, the president accused foreign companies of trying to "circumvent" the 25% tariff he placed on foreign steel and the 10% tariff he placed on foreign aluminum in 2018. Imports of steel and aluminum into the United States have declined since the tariffs went into place, he said, but imports of products made with those metals had "significantly increased."
The net effect "has been to erode the customer base for U.S. producers of aluminum and steel and undermine" the effect of original tariffs, Trump said.
As a result, he said, the United States will expand its tariffs to cover products made of steel and aluminum - like nails, tacks, staples, cables, certain types of wire, and bumpers and other parts for cars and tractors - as of Feb. 8.
For U.S. companies making these products, the announcement came as a relief.
Jeff Ferry, chief economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a trade group that counts companies making steel, cables and other products among its membership, called the measure "a wise move."
"What we've seen with the steel and aluminum tariffs is that it has stimulated both of those industries, leading to additional capital investment and additional jobs," he said, adding that he expected the new tariffs to stimulate the new industries as well.
For economists and trade experts, however, it was an "I told you so" moment.
Economists have long argued that by raising the price of steel and aluminum, Trump's tariffs would make it more expensive to produce things like nails or cars in the United States - and would encourage companies to import more of those items, rather than making them in the United States.
Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called this an example of "cascading protectionism" that he said was "entirely predictable."
"Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs have raised the cost of key inputs, making American companies that rely on those metals less competitive worldwide," Bown said. "Now Trump is expanding his tariffs to shield their products from competition as well. Where will it end?"
Richard Baldwin, a professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, wrote on Twitter that Trump was learning this particular lesson in economics "one failure at a time."
In his order expanding the tariffs, Trump pointed to large increases in imports of certain products made of steel and aluminum. From June 2018 to May, imports of items including steel nails and staples rose 33% from a year earlier, the order said. Imports of aluminum wire and cable were up 152% over the same period.
"This is really the blowback on the tariffs," Lisa Reisman, executive editor of MetalMiner, an industry publication, said in an email.
Trump has declared that his trade policies are delivering on his promises to revive the manufacturing sector by sheltering U.S. businesses from unfair competition and encouraging companies to move factories back to the United States.
But a study released by two economists at the Federal Reserve in December showed that the costs of Trump's trade approach to China had outweighed its benefits for manufacturers.
Tariffs offered U.S. companies some protection from Chinese imports, the study showed. But those positive effects were more than offset by the negative effects of the trade war, including the higher prices companies must pay to import components from China, and the retaliatory tariffs China had placed on the United States.

Texto completo: A couple months ago the New York Times reported on the death of Werner C Doehner, 90, of Laconia, New Hampshire. He was the last survivor of the Hindenburg disaster where three dozen people were killed. Not many people have heard of Werner C. Doehner, which is typical of the 1930s when people did not talk about tragedies in their lives. Post Traumatic Stress did not exist; people got on with their lives. Counselors and mental health experts were not available.
Eight-year-old Werner Doehner was aboard the Hindenburg for the three day Atlantic crossing. Along with his parents, Hermann and Matilde Doehner, he was joined by his brother and sister. The airship exploded in flames just over Lakehurst Naval Air Station at 7:30pm on May 6, 1937. Thirty-three people, including Werner Doehner's father and sister were killed.
"My dad was secretive about the disaster and didn't like to talk about it," son Bernie said. The zeppelin had made 62flights before the fatal one. Werner Doehner was the last survivor to be thrown from the zeppelin when his mother threw him and his brother from a cabin window. The three of them suffered burns and were in the hospital for a few months before being able to return to their home in Mexico. His father died at the scene and his sister died later at a hospital.
It is remarkable how lives can cross. Seventeen-year-old Bob Buchanan from Toms River had been hired as part of the ground crew to grab a rope as the Hindenburg came down. He tried to hold on when the zeppelin caught fire, getting mild burns in his attempt to secure the lines, but backed away as most of the ground crew did. It was an experience he didn't often talk about unless he was asked to give a presentation to groups in the area. Even then he talked about the tragedy, not his participation in trying to save people or the doomed Hindenburg.
Did Buchanan ever see victims and survivors dropping from the Hinderburg? Lying burned on the ground? Was he ever given the Doehners' names? Did he try to give aid or pull the survivors away from the fire? We will never know the answers to these questions unless records are kept somewhere. Bob Buchanan and Werner Doehner never talked specifics or names. Obviously, it was an extremely hard time for both of them. The stiff upper lip philosophy carried throughout both their lives.
Many photos of the Hindenburg flying over Long Beach Island or up and down the coast are in museums. Most are from previous trips, not the fatal one. People were enjoying themselves on New Jersey beaches; and many had their Brownie box cameras on them. How easy it was to grab cameras and point directly up into the sky as the Hinderburg passed overhead. Cameras have come a long way since Brownie box cameras were thought to be the latest gadget around; but they recorded many significant happenings. (One is the toppling of the Tucker's Island Lighthouse when previous/fired lighthouse keeper Arthur Rider's great nephew had his with him when the lighthouse fell into the sea).
Buchanan came from a family of sailors. H sailed boats all his life, and was an excellent sailor, becoming the winning skipper on Dr. John Crozier's A Cat Merry Thought at the Toms River Seaport's Old Boat Regatta in 1981. Today Merry Thought is sitting in the Herreshoff Museum, Bristol, Rhode Island. Halsey Herreshoff is hoping someone from the greater Barnegat Bay region will sponsor her restoration.
The Hindenburg was a gigantic zeppelin: 800 feet long by 135 feet in diameter. Rick Zitarosa, historian and vice president of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, describes the Hindenburg as a "huge flying billboard for German aeronautical supremacy billboard. It was a great flying machine bearing 50 foot Swastikas on its tail."
When the Hindenberg exploded and crashed to the ground, it only had 36 passengers aboard. Only wealthy people could afford such luxury travel. The Doehners were able to afford the fare for all their family from Frankfurt, Germany, to New Jersey. Bad weather had delayed the landing. The zeppelin was due to leave again that evening heading to Europe for the coronation of King George VI of England. Seventy-two people had booked the flight.
Thirteen passengers, 22 crew members and one person on the ground were killed. Werner Doehner's once took his son to Lakehurst to see the scene of the family tragedy. Bernie Doehner remembers that his electrical engineer father did not say much, nor was there much to see at the time. Werner Doehner worked in Mexico City and Equator over the years, before coming to the United States to work for General Electric. He retired to Parachute, Colorado, and later to Laconia, New Hampshire, with his wife during the last year of his life.
Wehner Doehner died on Nov. 8 at the age of 90 in Laconia.
The New Jersey Maritime Museum, 528 Dock Road, Beach Haven, has a request: if you have any family prints or home movie of the Hindenburg, will you bring them to the museum and share your stories? The Hindenburg still draws many people to the museum, where they ask about the display on zeppelins and the role they may or may not have played in Nazi espionage. Opinions and books differ on this subject.
The NJMM is open weekends, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sightseeing on LBI is perfect with no lights, some restaurants still open, magnificent sunsets and a chance to see the amount of construction going on. The museum is looking for a volunteer grant writer and someone who can scan old photos. Hours are on your own time schedule. For more information call 609-492-0202.

Texto completo: While uncertainty remains over whether witnesses will be heard from during the Trump impeachment trial, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey said Wednesday morning he's "very, very skeptical" any witness will change his verdict.
Toomey said he talked to his colleagues this week about the prospect of hearing witness testimony, but said he was not advocating for calling in any witnesses.
His view, the Pennsylvania Republican said, is that if senators decide to call in someone like former national security adviser John Bolton, then lawmakers also should hear from a witness selected by the president's defense team.
"I am not taking the position that we ought to have Bolton and some other witness," Toomey told reporters Wednesday. "I'm actually very, very skeptical about that. I was simply saying it would be unacceptable to have just one."
Republican leaders Wednesday evening seemed confident they had enough votes to block witness testimony. Four Republicans would need to vote for allowing witness testimony, and while at least two have suggested they want to hear from witnesses, it's not clear if others will come forward.
Toomey reiterated that he'll make a final decision on witnesses after the question-and-answer portion of the trial is over Thursday. He said he would only want to hear from someone who could resolve a disputed fact and "do so in a way that would change my mind about how I ought to vote."
"I'm very, very skeptical that ... criteria is going to be met," Toomey said.
A vote on witnesses was expected Friday.
Democrats, including Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, have advocated for hearing from witnesses during the trial. But Democrats also have opposed hearing from the Bidens and rebuffed the idea of matching witnesses from each side.
Their push for witnesses increased after The New York Times reported that Bolton writes in a forthcoming book that the president told him nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine would be withheld until the country assisted with investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and other Democrats.
Asked if the public should hear from Bolton, Toomey responded that they'll be able to read his book.
"I expect that he's going to be doing a tremendous amount of media interviews," Toomey said. "I think there's going to be a lot of information out there. The job before us is not to entertain all kinds of possible discussions about this. It's to evaluate the articles of impeachment that have been brought over by the House."
If the Senate does agree to go down the road of witnesses, Toomey said, Hunter Biden would be a relevant witness because his role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company could be a reason Trump withheld U.S. aid from the country.
Trump has claimed that the Bidens acted improperly in Ukraine, but he and his team have not provided evidence. Democrats argue that Trump's concern about the Bidens was tied to the former vice president's decision to run for president.

Call John Bolton as a witness

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" – that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
"Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued at the Senate hearing on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: "It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued on Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump's behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.
With Trump preventing his closest advisers from testifying during the impeachment proceedings late last year, senators have an obligation at the trial to summon people like Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others.
But McConnell and the vast majority of his caucus seemed ready to forgo witnesses, arguing that they were under no duty to go on a "fishing expedition." Now there's a preview of what Bolton would say, and it goes to the heart of the allegations against Trump.
Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-vote majority in the 100-member Senate, are considering their next move, and this is where the Democrats could grease the skids by laying out a deal with Republicans to allow prosecutors and defense lawyers to call relevant witnesses of their choice.
True, that might result in a subpoena for Hunter Biden, who worked for a scandal-marred Ukrainian energy company. (Did he show poor judgment? Sure. Should Trump be trying to outsource his opposition research to a foreign government? Absolutely not.) But if a compromise would allow Bolton and others to testify, it would serve the public's interest.
This impeachment trial – only the third in U.S. history – is much more than just a proceeding before the Senate. It's a vehicle for the American people to judge their president's character and conduct. For that, witnesses are imperative.
Bolton's book is slated for publication in March. To pass on the chance to thoroughly question and cross-examine him, under oath, would be a loss to history and expose these historic proceedings as a farce.

Texto completo: A journalism scholarship has been established at White Plains High School in memory of Richard Liebson, who covered the region's personalities, crimes, politics and developments over a long career at The Journal News/lohud.
His family hopes that the first Richard Liebson Journalism Scholarship will be awarded in June at White Plains High School's annual awards ceremony.
"For more than 30 years, Rich served Westchester with quality, community journalism, always shining a light on issues that needed attention," said his wife, Victoria Hochman, a former editor for The Journal News and Newsday, now manager of public relations for Thompson & Bender.
"He loved his job, but what he loved even more was mentoring young reporters," she said. "He wanted to make sure that they upheld the tradition he had learned from those before him: to be fair, accurate and ethical in pursuit of their work. That's why we decided to endow a scholarship in his name to support young aspiring journalists as a way to keep his memory alive."
Liebson died on July 28, 2019 at 61 from cancer at his White Plains home. He had worked for various incarnations of The Journal News/lohud since 1983, covering many of the major stories to hit the region. But he focused his coverage for long stretches on White Plains. He primarily wrote about crime and the courts during the 1990s and 2000s, mixing in coverage of veterans and the city's neighborhoods and ordinary folks, before covering politics and development in recent years.
Liebson graduated from Valhalla High School, but settled in White Plains more than 20 years ago. His two daughters, Morgan Shelby and Rebecca Liebson, are graduates of White Plains High School.
"Rich Liebson was both a devoted member of the White Plains community and dedicated journalist," White Plains Schools Superintendent Joseph Ricca said. "It is wonderful that this scholarship, established in his name at White Plains High School, will help to support students who also desire to enter the world of journalism. Talented journalists are torchbearers and have the power to bring information and knowledge to communities better than any other mechanism."
A GoFundMe account has been set up to raise money for the Liebson Scholarship fund. Liebson's family hopes to offer at least one scholarship each year of $1,000 or more.
His daughter, Rebecca, who is now a fellow at The New York Times, said that by watching her father, she saw how much strong watchdog journalism means to a community.
"At my dad's memorial service, several of his former sources came and spoke about how his reporting had a positive impact on their lives," she said. "When I look back on my career 30 years from now, I want to be able to say I did the same."
White Plains High School Principal Ellen Doherty thanked Liebson's family for establishing the scholarship for aspiring journalists in Liebson's adopted hometown.
"Mr. Liebson was a part of the high school community and we are thankful, on behalf of our future journalists, for this support," she said. "We know that without a free press, and writers courageous enough to pursue the truth, we all suffer."
Contributions to the fund can also be made by sending a check to:

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses that would bring President Donald Trump's impeachment trial to a swift close.
As the Senate entered a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Trump laced into Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had "begged" for his job, was fired and then wrote "a nasty & untrue book."
Trump's aides circulated a letter on Capitol Hill informing Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president conditioned the release of military aid for Ukraine on the country's willingness to investigate his political rivals. That is a central element of Democrats' impeachment case against the president, which charges him with seeking to enlist a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf.
Off the floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.
Democrats on Wednesday were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial.
"We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents, because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks," Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.
"Is it more likely than not? Probably no," Schumer said. "But is it a decent, good chance? Yes."
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had "heard enough" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.
And Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has said repeatedly that he wants to hear from Bolton and would vote in favor of witnesses and documents, conceded he did not know how many Republicans would join him.
"I'm sure there'll be others," he said. "How many there will be on my side of the aisle, I just don't know."
In answering questions, Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his reelection is in the national interest.
"Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest," said Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of Trump's legal team. "Mostly, you're right."
"If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," he said.
McConnell gave his party's first question Wednesday to Romney and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on calling witnesses. The trio teamed up to ask Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.
The selection of Collins, who is facing the toughest reelection campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward.
Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.
Democrats need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses, will break from his party.
Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Trump's lawyers of incorrectly stating that there was no evidence that Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Dershowitz's argument by saying it was "very odd."
"If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche," Schiff said. "All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses that would bring President Donald Trump's impeachment trial to a swift close.
As the Senate entered a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Trump laced into Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had "begged" for his job, was fired and then wrote "a nasty & untrue book."
Trump's aides circulated a letter on Capitol Hill informing Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president conditioned the release of military aid for Ukraine on the country's willingness to investigate his political rivals. That is a central element of Democrats' impeachment case against the president, which charges him with seeking to enlist a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf.
Off the floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.
Democrats on Wednesday were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial.
"We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents, because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks," Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.
"Is it more likely than not? Probably no," Schumer said. "But is it a decent, good chance? Yes."
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had "heard enough" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.
"I'm ready to vote on final judgment," Barrasso told reporters. Asked if Republicans planned to move directly to a vote on the two articles of impeachment Friday, Barrasso said, "Yes, that's the plan."And Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has said repeatedly that he wants to hear from Bolton and would vote in favor of witnesses and documents, conceded he did not know how many Republicans would join him.
"I'm sure there'll be others," he said. "How many there will be on my side of the aisle, I just don't know."
In answering questions, Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his reelection is in the national interest.
"Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest," said Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of Trump's legal team. "Mostly, you're right."
"If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," he said.
McConnell gave his party's first question Wednesday to Romney and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on calling witnesses. The trio teamed up to ask Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.
The selection of Collins, who is facing the toughest reelection campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward.
Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.
Democrats need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses, will break from his party.
Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Trump's lawyers of incorrectly stating that there was no evidence that Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Dershowitz's argument by saying it was "very odd."
"If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche," Schiff said. "All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt."

Trump plans broader tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has announced plans to broaden his tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, saying the existing tariffs had not proved as effective as he had hoped in reviving U.S. production.
In a proclamation late last week, the president accused foreign companies of trying to "circumvent" the 25% tariff he placed on foreign steel and the 10% tariff he placed on foreign aluminum in 2018. Imports of steel and aluminum into the United States have declined since the tariffs went into place, he said, but imports of products made with those metals had "significantly increased."
The net effect "has been to erode the customer base for U.S. producers of aluminum and steel and undermine" the effect of original tariffs, Trump said.
As a result, he said, the United States will expand its tariffs to cover products made of steel and aluminum - like nails, tacks, staples, cables, certain types of wire, and bumpers and other parts for cars and tractors - as of Feb. 8.
For U.S. companies making these products, the announcement came as a relief.
Jeff Ferry, chief economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a trade group that counts companies making steel, cables and other products among its membership, called the measure "a wise move."
"What we've seen with the steel and aluminum tariffs is that it has stimulated both of those industries, leading to additional capital investment and additional jobs," he said, adding that he expected the new tariffs to stimulate the new industries as well.
For economists and trade experts, however, it was an "I told you so" moment.
Economists have long argued that by raising the price of steel and aluminum, Trump's tariffs would make it more expensive to produce things like nails or cars in the United States - and would encourage companies to import more of those items, rather than making them in the United States.
Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called this an example of "cascading protectionism" that he said was "entirely predictable."
"Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs have raised the cost of key inputs, making American companies that rely on those metals less competitive worldwide," Bown said. "Now Trump is expanding his tariffs to shield their products from competition as well. Where will it end?"
Richard Baldwin, a professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, wrote on Twitter that Trump was learning this particular lesson in economics "one failure at a time."
In his order expanding the tariffs, Trump pointed to large increases in imports of certain products made of steel and aluminum. From June 2018 to May, imports of items including steel nails and staples rose 33% from a year earlier, the order said. Imports of aluminum wire and cable were up 152% over the same period.
"This is really the blowback on the tariffs," Lisa Reisman, executive editor of MetalMiner, an industry publication, said in an email.
Trump has declared that his trade policies are delivering on his promises to revive the manufacturing sector by sheltering U.S. businesses from unfair competition and encouraging companies to move factories back to the United States.
But a study released by two economists at the Federal Reserve in December showed that the costs of Trump's trade approach to China had outweighed its benefits for manufacturers.
Tariffs offered U.S. companies some protection from Chinese imports, the study showed. But those positive effects were more than offset by the negative effects of the trade war, including the higher prices companies must pay to import components from China, and the retaliatory tariffs China had placed on the United States.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is preparing a massive show of GOP unity in Iowa ahead of the state's presidential caucuses and as a pivotal vote in the Senate impeachment trial exposes rifts among Republicans who will decide his fate.
Days before Iowans choose a Democratic candidate in the nation's first presidential caucus, Trump will take the stage at Drake University in Des Moines for his fourth rally of the year. The campaign will then send an unusually long list of GOP heavyweights to Iowa, including Cabinet officials, congressional leaders and members of Trump's family.
The president's campaign and Republican observers described the parade of political events as a flexing of muscles — a warning to Democrats that Trump's operation is far better organized and funded than it was in 2016. But the display will also serve as a potent reminder of Trump's grip on the party as Senate Republicans wrestle with whether to end his impeachment trial or extend it further by hearing from witnesses.
David Kochel, a veteran Republican political operative in Iowa, described the president's itinerary in the state as "classic Trump."
"It's a very smart move and it has little to do with his own nomination, which is not in doubt," said Kochel, a senior adviser to Jeb Bush's campaign in 2016. "It's to fire up our base, and step into the middle of their primary dance and take some of the oxygen."
The caucuses take place Monday, and the president's travel will coincide with a last-minute push by the Democratic candidates seeking to replace him.
Trump brings GOP star power Trump's rally will come hours after an official White House event in Michigan to highlight his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a rare bipartisan victory for the president that will have implications for Iowa farmers and manufacturers. Then, as the nation shifts its attention to the Democratic caucus race, Trump will send about 80 surrogates to the state.
The roster includes at least eight members of the Cabinet, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., are also expected to stump for the president. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Lara Trump are among the president's family members heading to Iowa.
Incumbent presidents, who usually do not face serious challenges for the nomination, rarely devote so much attention to campaigning so early in the process.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh described the effort as a "good workout for our ground game" and said that the caucuses are "an opportunity to flex the organizational muscles of President Trump's" operation.
Democrats in the state framed the events as a sign of "panicking."
"No amount of kicking, screaming, or tweeting can spin that legacy of failure, or voters' desperation for something new," said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price.
Rally on eve of key trial vote Trump's visit to Iowa initially appeared to offer an opportunity to take a victory lap and a hard pivot to the election. Senate Republican leaders had signaled the impeachment trial could wind down as early as Friday, potentially yielding the long-expected acquittal on charges that Trump abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine.
A New York Times report on a forthcoming memoir by former Trump national security adviser John Bolton raised new uncertainty about the trial timeline. The Times said the book will allege the president demanded Ukraine officials open an investigation into Biden in exchange for U.S. foreign aid — an issue at the center of the impeachment debate.
A handful of centrist Senate Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, have said they are willing to hear from witnesses, including Bolton. Friday, the day after Trump's Iowa rally, will be the pivotal day when the GOP-led Senate will decide whether to extend the trial in order to hear from witnesses, or to move forward with a vote on possible acquittal.
Trump, who came in second in the Iowa caucuses in 2016, carried the state in the general election by more than 9 percentage points. Polls suggest the contest could be closer this year, depending on who wins the Democratic nomination.
Trump last traveled to Iowa in June to tout his efforts to promote gasoline with higher blends of ethanol — a popular position with many Iowa farmers. He held a campaign rally in Council Bluffs a month before the 2018 midterm elections, which gave Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds her first full term but also saw Democratic U.S. Reps. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne defeat Republican incumbents.
'Demented hoaxes' Republican operatives said the president's visit to Iowa was a signal he intends to remain on the offensive and isn't taking even the states he won handily in 2016 for granted. They also predicted the effort may draw attention away from what is expected to be a huge turnout among Democrats. If the turnout is larger than usual, it could be read as a show of strength by Democrats with implications beyond Iowa.
"Deploying this many surrogates on caucus night — and the caliber of the surrogates covering the amount of ground statewide — will yield tremendous dividends as Iowa Republicans begin focusing on the general election," said Jimmy Centers, a Republican consultant who worked for former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad.
Centers rejected the idea that Trump's show of force in the state had anything to do with the impeachment trial, noting that voters have generally not named impeachment as a top election issue in polls.
"The trial occurring around the Iowa caucuses," he said, "is nothing more than a coincidence."
Trump barely mentioned the trial during a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday. He slammed Democrats for "demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts and deranged partisan crusades," but that language is similar to what he has embraced at his rallies for years. Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters that Democrats had been working for years to overturn the results of the 2016 election. And he vowed they would not succeed.
"We will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the next election," Trump said. "We are going to have a victory that is even greater than 2016."

Texto completo: Monitor staff
Boot hockey doesn't cut it in this town.
Certainly not on Chris Brown's watch. The face of the Black Ice Pond Hockey Tournament, who created this event 10 years ago, couldn't bring himself to put hundreds of skates on ice last weekend and replace them with boots.
So he didn't. He canceled the final two days of the four-day event because of rain and warmth and slush, which turned the surface at White Park pond into, as Brown put it, “snow cones.”
“We could get by for a few hours playing in boots, but we thought it was in the best interest of everybody to cancel it,” Brown said Wednesday by phone. “Boot hockey is not what they signed up for.”
Not here. Let some other town switch to boots if the weather doesn't cooperate. This is Concord, a hockey town, and the Black Ice Tournament has served as a reminder and a promoter of this fact for a decade.
The tents that double as locker rooms at the park have been busting with history each winter. Weather permitting, of course.
If you've stopped by and were old enough to remember some of the glory years here, you surely ran into a who's who of hockey, the players who continue to keep the sport closely affiliated with the city. Where the sport was born, on Nov. 17, 1883, at St. Paul's School.
From then to now, history that is rich, rich, rich. The all-time Black Ice roster always includes big names from the sport's past. Names of players who starred in high school and college, and who played pro, coming back home. Or perhaps they never left.
I saw Tara Mounsey at the event a few years ago. She won gold and silver at the Winter Olympics in 1998 and 2002. Some considered her to be the best women's hockey player in the country.
I've seen former goalie Bruce Gillies at the event. He was a monster at Bishop Brady High School and then the University of New Hampshire before he faced The Great One, Wayne Gretzky, in a preseason NHL camp.
I saw the Blossoms, our version of the Hanson Brothers from the movie Slapshot. Lee Blossom played at Boston College and was named the Most Valuable Player in the prestigious Beanpot Tournament in the 1980s.
I saw Dunc Walsh, Concord High's hockey coach, and other familiar names and nicknames, like Farrelly and Tilly and Commy.
These are the players who called Everett Arena home. That's the arena named for former Concord resident Douglas Everett, who won a silver medal for the United States at the 1932 Winter Games.
The arena hosted semi-pro teams named the Concord Eastern Olympics and the Budmen, who packed Everett on Friday and Saturday nights, especially when hated Berlin came to town.
And a few years ago, the New York Times came here and published a hockey story that read, “No sport has captured the city's imagination quite like hockey.”
That's why boots were unacceptable, in an event that forced Brown and his dozens of volunteers to ride a roller-coaster for what seemed like forever.
It was unseasonably warm the weekend before the tournament. Then, a snowstorm.
“There was hesitation by the city, which wondered if it could get the pond back to safety, let alone skate there,” Brown said. It was warm, and then we said, ‘Oh my God, how long will it take to get the snow off?' ”
Too long. Snow on top of slushy ice made for bad skating, so Brown postponed the tournament, giving seven days' notice. He followed the backup plan, to move the event to this weekend. Then, reality hit him in the face.
Out-of-towners, who had planned months ahead of time to participate in the Black Ice, had gotten hotel rooms at good rates, and that was a one-shot deal. Our unique place in the political process made sure of that. The New Hampshire primary is on Feb. 11.
“All of our hotels and sponsors said, ‘Do you realize the primary is here,' ” Brown told me. “I said, ‘Great, the more the merrier.' But then they said they couldn't give us those rates and there would be no rooms anyway.”
By Martin Luther King Day, the pond had recovered nicely, public skating was being held and Brown realized there were “no guarantees we'd have better weather in February, so we said let's do it.”
The volunteers, who plan this thing a year in advance, went to work, raising the tents, smoothing the ice, spreading the word. The extended forecast was promising. Cold, with a little snow Friday and little more Saturday.
And Day 1, Thursday, was great. Solid ice, clear weather and lots of kids, hundreds of them, competing in a giant youth hockey jamboree.
“A great night,” Brown said. “Seventeen youth teams from the area, an awesome experience, tons of people.”
Then the temperatures rose. Rain fell. Spirits dampened.
Desperate to fulfill his commitment and make this work, Brown, mindful that 90 teams were ready to go, turned the event into a boot hockey tournament on Friday, the beginning of adult play.
“The surface had deteriorated, so the only safe use was through boot hockey,” Brown said. “It's the hockey you played at home when you didn't have ice.”
It was 35 degrees late Friday night, too warm to support a good ice surface. Slush was everywhere Saturday morning. Brown had seen enough.
“They didn't come here to play in boots,” he said.
The call to fold the tent came Saturday morning. Brown has seen freaky weather during the Black Ice before. He said he's had to juggle games, reschedule them or cancel them eight times in the past.
“The last week in January,” Brown said, “is supposed to be the coldest.”
Brown stopped short of an apology to those who had traveled from out of state. Instead, he stressed his utter disappointment in a letter he wrote to the Monitor and on the phone. Hockey people know the score when it comes to playing outside.
“People should understand,” Brown said. “I'm so disappointed to spend this much time with the volunteers, with 12 months of work and two weeks of set up. But because of Mother Nature, the plug had to be pulled, and people feel our pain.”
Soon, planning will start for next year. Brown said the Black Ice is held on a year-to-year basis, so there are no guarantees he can maintain the interest and financing needed to bring it back for an 11th time.
There are also no guarantees that the last weekend in January 2021 will be cold and clear. But Brown knows the significance of the Black Ice. He knows the sport's background and value around here.
“We think we understand how this tourney has impacted the city,” Brown said. “We created this winter festival and you see the lure of it and you get excited over what it has done.
“I'm disappointed we could not do it,” Brown continued, “but I try to stay positive through the whole thing, and we try to keep all the volunteers feeling positive as well.”
They were positive this time. That those boots were made for walking.
Not skating.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses that would bring President Donald Trump's impeachment trial to a swift close.
As the Senate entered a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Trump laced into Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had "begged" for his job, was fired and then wrote "a nasty & untrue book."
Trump's aides circulated a letter on Capitol Hill informing Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president conditioned the release of military aid for Ukraine on the country's willingness to investigate his political rivals. That is a central element of Democrats' impeachment case against the president, which charges him with seeking to enlist a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf.
Off the floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.
Democrats on Wednesday were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial.
"We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents, because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks," Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.
"Is it more likely than not? Probably no," Schumer said. "But is it a decent, good chance? Yes."
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had "heard enough" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.
And Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has said repeatedly that he wants to hear from Bolton and would vote in favor of witnesses and documents, conceded he did not know how many Republicans would join him.
"I'm sure there'll be others," he said. "How many there will be on my side of the aisle, I just don't know."
In answering questions, Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his reelection is in the national interest.
"Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest," said Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of Trump's legal team. "Mostly, you're right."
"If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," he said.
McConnell gave his party's first question Wednesday to Romney and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on calling witnesses. The trio teamed up to ask Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.
The selection of Collins, who is facing the toughest reelection campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward.
Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.
Democrats need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses, will break from his party.
Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Trump's lawyers of incorrectly stating that there was no evidence that Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Dershowitz's argument by saying it was "very odd."
"If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche," Schiff said. "All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt."

Texto completo: The trial this month was exceptional for a country that has resisted repatriating or extraditing terrorism suspects from battlegrounds in Iraq and Syria.
A Paris judge heard cases against 24 men and women charged with links to the Islamic State group. Witnesses were called. Prosecutors and defense lawyers made their statements. Verdicts were rendered.
But 19 of the defendants were presumed dead, and all were tried in absentia. It was, as the French news media have called it, a "ghost trial."
Antoine Ory, one of the defense lawyers, acknowledged as much. "In France, in 2020, we refuse to repatriate the living but we try the dead," he told the court.
The trial, which concluded last week with convictions for everyone, brought to light one of France's paradoxes when it comes to handling such cases.
The government wants to prosecute terrorism suspects, hoping to prevent them from falling through legal cracks and trying to piece together how the networks operated for evidence in future trials against the living.
But it does not want the trials conducted on its territory.
Since 2018, France has instead been at the forefront of the European negotiations with the Iraqi government to have European jihadis tried there, with only modest success.
With public opinion firmly against bringing home those who left to fight with the Islamic State, France has agreed to take back only some of its jihadis. The country was a significant provider of foreign Islamic State fighters, with around 1,000 people estimated to have left to join the militant group from 2012 to 2015.
For the last two years, French courts have been trying dozens of jihadis who are presumed dead. The courts have had little choice because intelligence services have not been able to get into the combat zones of Syria and Iraq to verify the deaths.
This month's trial offered a glimpse into what has become a convoluted approach to counterterrorism, even as France braces itself for the much-awaited trials of those accused of the assault on the newspaper Charlie Hebdo, and of the suspects in the November 2015 attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris.
France has invested a great deal in adapting its criminal justice system to the jihadi threat and now has some of the most expansive counterterrorism legislation in Europe.
"It is a judiciary that leaves room for interpretation," said Antoine Megie, an expert on counterterrorism laws at the University of Rouen, in northern France. "In order to be prosecuted, it is enough to be linked to jihadist activities."
But this month's trial showed that the process could also prove Kafkaesque.
The defendant Ory represented -- Quentin Roy, a man from the Paris suburbs who left to fight with the Islamic State in Syria in 2015 -- was a case in point.
The court files noted that Roy presumably blew himself up in Iraq in January 2016, saying he was linked to "military activities that led him to become a suicide bomber."
"You are trying a man who committed suicide," Ory told the court. "Has anyone ever seen such a contradiction?"
Roy was part of the so-called Sevran network, a jihadi recruitment web based in the small town of Sevran, on the outskirts of Paris, that operated from an informal prayer hall, later known as the "Daesh Mosque," using an alternative name for the Islamic State.
Among the 24 defendants at the trial, 13 had frequented the mosque.
Standing before the judges, Roy's parents, Veronique and Thierry, recounted how their son had converted to jihadi ideology in just a few months.
"It's the trial of sectarian radicalization," Veronique Roy said, as she described how her son, after his conversion to Islam in 2012, gave up his studies and his job and broke up with his girlfriend.
In September 2014, Quentin Roy told his parents he had to go to Frankfurt, Germany, for his work as an Uber driver. A few days later, he was crossing the border from Turkey to Syria.
As they did with the Roy family, judges at the trial turned to relatives to reconstruct the journey of the 19 defendants who are presumed dead.
Among those defendants were the brothers Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucine, who have been linked to the kosher supermarket attack by Amedy Coulibaly in January 2015.
Mohamed Belhoucine is considered to be the mentor of Coulibaly. Mehdi Belhoucine was accused of arranging the departure of Coulibaly's wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, for Syria. The Belhoucine brothers left France for Syria at the start of January 2015.
The Belhoucine brothers are believed to have died on the battlegrounds in Syria and Iraq in 2016. Their parents have received messages from Islamic State fighters notifying them of their sons' deaths.
But the truth of those reports, in territories beyond the reach of French investigators, cannot be verified.
Intelligence services also fear that acknowledging the death of jihadis could help some who are still alive cover their tracks. In August 2015, a leading French jihadi recruiter, Omar Omsen, faked his own death before resurfacing 10 months later in a TV interview.
"As long as we don't have exact proof of their deaths, we have to try them," Stephane Duchemin, the president of the court, told the mother of the Belhoucine brothers.
Even as the so-called ghost trials continue, the French government may be forced to moderate its stance and allow for the repatriation of former fighters. In part, that is because of the breakdown of the negotiations to continue conducting trials in Iraq, but also because of the worsening security situation in Syria, where hundreds of European Islamic State fighters are detained.
"If it is not possible to try them on site anymore, I don't see any other solution than to repatriate those people to France," the French justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, told the newspaper Liberation on Jan. 10. "We cannot risk that they escape into the wild."
Still, Belloubet acknowledged in an interview on French radio that "there is no change in our opinion" about bringing suspects home for trial.

Texto completo: Republican senators overseeing President Donald Trump's impeachment trial should be applauded for their brave efforts to contain a potentially damaging virus known as "information."
Information, if it spreads to the floor of the U.S. Senate, can cause GOP lawmakers to experience extreme nausea, truth recognition and, in rare cases, spine formation. In worst case scenarios, the information virus can result in presidential impeachment, which explains why Republicans are doing everything they can to keep witnesses out of Trump's trial.
Witnesses, such as former United Nations ambassador and national security adviser John Bolton, are known carriers of information. Allowing even one into the trial could result in a full-on outbreak of facts capable of wiping out all Republican talking points, including "no quid pro quo," "READ THE TRANSCRIPT!" and "Impeachment Hoax!"
Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, knowing some of his GOP colleagues might be vulnerable to information infection, said Tuesday: "I don't think the testimony of Ambassador Bolton would be helpful."
Sen. Lindsey Graham also seemed worried the virus might spread: "One witness would probably lead to a lot of witnesses."
Before you know it, information could be everywhere!
For a time, it seemed the impeachment trial would remain witness-resistant. But the New York Times reported on a part of Bolton's upcoming book that says Trump "wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens."
That's the central claim in the Democrats' impeachment case, that Trump withheld congressionally approved military aid from Ukraine to pressure officials there to launch investigations, including one against former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's potential political opponent.
Virulent information from a witness who can confirm the Democrats' allegations could be deadly to the Republicans' assertion that Trump is innocent. You don't have to be an epidemiologist to see that.
The threat Bolton posed to the health of the Republicans' excuse-making was obvious, so they immediately set out to quarantine the Senate trial from any such contagion.
It has worked thus far, but the coming days will be pivotal for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Trump loyalists trying to keep the virus in check.
They will have to resort to virus-blocking hypocrisy, which will likely include criticism of Bolton, a stalwart in conservative circles, as a not-to-be-trusted turncoat.
When Trump picked the ambassador to be his national security adviser in 2018, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted: "I also congratulate Ambassador John Bolton for his appointment as the next national security adviser. He's an excellent choice."
Asked on Sunday whether that "excellent choice" should testify under oath as a fact-witness to an issue at the heart of the impeachment case, Cotton said: "I'm not going to vote to approve witnesses."
That's the kind of bold leadership needed in times of a possible information epidemic.
To understand the scope of the threat Bolton poses, consider the masses outside the Senate who have already been exposed to a wide range of viral information.
Their minds have been infected by facts and evidence, forcing them to form opinions grounded in specific details relevant to the impeachment case. The results are horrifying.
A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 75% of Americans want the Senate to call witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial. A Reuters poll put the number at 72%. And a Monmouth poll showed a whopping 80% of the country wants to hear from people such as Bolton.
Thankfully Republicans are standing strong, knowing the will of the people is nothing more than just the ramblings of information-addled minds.
A vote on whether to call witnesses is expected Friday. Until then, I suggest our heroic GOP senators watch a minimum of five hours a day of Fox News to ensure their brains are properly vaccinated against information infection. They should also wear ear masks.
In the event of information exposure, lawmakers should immediately tent themselves in comments that contradict previous things they've said.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz gave a good example of this outbreak prevention maneuver Tuesday night. Back in September, he mocked Democrats for not being able to prove Trump's actions toward Ukraine amounted to an "illegal quid pro quo."
On Tuesday night, knowing Bolton's testimony could confirm an illegal quid pro quo, Cruz told Fox News: "Quid pro quo doesn't matter, it's a red herring. It doesn't matter if there was a quid pro quo or not."
That's how a lawmaker charged with the constitutional duty of impartially judging a president's behavior in an impeachment trial stops an information virus dead in its tracks. Just ignore the information and change your story until the chance of exposure has passed.
Then you acquit the president and celebrate how you valiantly saved America from the truth.

Too few babies being made in China

Texto completo: The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world's most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality.
About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4% fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born.
Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized.
Experts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the workforce who are educated and don't see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted.
"It's a society where nobody wants to get married and people can't afford to have children," said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. "On a deeper level, you would have to think about what kind of society China will become, not just demographically, but socially."
Eno Zhang, a 37-year-old engineer in a tech company in Beijing, said he had argued with his parents for 10 years about his decision not to have children. They have since given up, he said.
"I value my spiritual life and hobbies," Zhang said. "Children will consume too much of my energy."
While many countries are struggling with low fertility rates and aging populations, these issues are even more pressing in China, because the country's underdeveloped social safety net means that most older adults rely heavily on their families to pay for health care, retirement and other expenses.
Many young married couples are expected to shoulder the burden of taking care of their parents, in-laws and grandparents, without the support of siblings.
The birthrate in China fell to 10.48 per thousand last year, the lowest since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, a decline that has important implications for the country's economy and labor pool.
If birthrates continue to fall while life expectancy increases, there will not be enough young people to support the economy and the elderly, the fastest-growing segment of the population.
That will put pressure on the country's underfunded pension systems, overcrowded hospitals and companies.
Making matters worse, the slowing birthrate has meant that China's main state pension fund, risks running out of money by 2035 because of a decline in the number of workers, according to research commissioned by the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Despite the looming demographic crisis, the government still maintains tight control over reproduction.
The ruling Communist Party had sought for three decades to slow population growth by limiting most couples to one child and forcing many women to undergo abortions and sterilizations. In 2015, alarmed by the slump in births, it increased that limit to two children.
But the government is sending mixed signals. It still punishes couples who exceed the birth restrictions. The authorities fine single women who bear children, and bar them from using reproductive technologies like freezing their eggs.
The government's effort to raise the birthrate is also running into broader economic and social changes.
Education, housing and health care costs are rising. More women are getting university degrees and are reluctant to interrupt their careers. Some among the current generation of women of childbearing age, themselves the product of the "one child" policy, don't see what the fuss about offspring is all about.
Dong Chang, a 28-year-old administrative employee at a dentist's clinic in Beijing, said millennials like her enjoyed spending on themselves without batting an eyelid and would find it hard to sacrifice their wants for a child.
"We are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish," she said. "How can I raise a child when I'm still a child myself? And take care of him and feed him at midnight?"
Dong said that she was living with her boyfriend but that they had decided to not get married for the time being because they didn't want their parents to hound them about having children.
Melody Lin, a 26-year-old worker at a nonprofit, said she couldn't think of a reason to have a child. She said she had thought about conforming to societal norms and starting a family but decided against it after reading arguments that not all women need to have children.
"My parents think that I'm still young and will change my mind when I get older, but I think it's unlikely," she said.
China's total fertility rate -- an estimate of the number of babies a woman would have over her lifetime -- has fallen to 1.6 children per woman, and for years has remained below the "replacement" level of 2.1. That means China could soon see a shrinking population and a workforce too small to support its pensioners.
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said last year that China's population contraction would begin in 2027. Others believe it will come sooner or has already begun.
The accuracy and completeness of China's population figures, like other sensitive statistics, have been questioned for years, making exact projections and comparisons difficult.
Cai Yong, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, said he expected the low fertility rate to continue for at least a decade.
"There are a lot of parallels with this demographic crisis to global warming," Cai said. "The waters are rising slowly, and we need a longer-term strategy to deal with it."

Texto completo: Photographer Norris McNamara took shots of 1960s civil rights marches in the South and the aftermath of the December 1969 Black Panther raid in Chicago, while also recording some of the early history of Second City through his friendship with the group's co-founders Paul Sills and Howard Alk.
"He just happened to be in the middle of a lot of defining moments," said his daughter, Cornelia Daniels-McNamara.
McNamara, 78, died Dec. 27 in Symphony of Lincoln Park of complications from a series of health problems, his daughter said.
McNamara helped start the No Exit Cafe, which closed in Rogers Park in 1999, more than 40 years after its beginnings in Evanston, his daughter said. He was an enthusiastic sailor, a member of the Island Goats Sailing Society for those who made more than 25 Chicago-Mackinac races. He was a gifted teller of stories and jokes, valuable traits on those long races, according to Pat FitzGerald, a friend and client who often sailed with him and who co-owned one of McNamara's Tartan Ten-class sail boats.
McNamara was born in Chicago in 1941 and grew up in Evanston. After graduating from Evanston Township High School, he studied at Northwestern University but didn't graduate.
His mother was a reporter for a New York paper and may have helped him get an agent, a step that led to work as a photographer. In the early 1960s, his work included taking photos of Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama, McNamara's daughter said. A 2014 New York Times story noted that McNamara was one of several photographers hired in 1964 for the Southern Documentary Project, concentrating on educational and artistic activities in Mississippi.
He was soon back in Chicago, pursuing commercial photography and also taking photos of his friends and their activities, particularly performances at Second City and other theaters.
"Norris was part of the circle," said Carol Sills, who was married to Paul Sills from 1961 until his death in 2008. "He was a very good photographer and he was always photographing what was going on onstage, beginning with Second City."
"It was his nature to take photos of all of us all the time," said Jones Cullinan, who was once married to Alk. "He couldn't help taking pictures of people."
In the 1980s, McNamara closed his photography business and shifted his focus to marketing, doing business as McNamara Marketing.
FitzGerald, an architect and sailing partner, recalled putting McNamara in touch with a client who was developing a townhouse project called Park Lane in Lakeview, long before it became a popular neighborhood.
"The challenge was to get people to even consider a place so far north," FitzGerald said. "He did that quite eloquently."
Ads on buses that carried McNamara's tag line, "your search is over..." followed by Park Lane and a phone number resulted in relatively quick sales for the entire project, FitzGerald said.
McNamara went on to work on a number of projects with and for FitzGerald.
The two also sailed together for years on their own boats and on those of other people.
"We didn't always win the races," FitzGerald said. "But we never lost a party."
Some of those parties were land-based, at bygone Chicago watering holes such as O'Rourke's and Riccardo's, where McNamara was a regular.
He is also survived by his wife, Roxanne; a brother, Steven; and a grandson.
His first marriage, to Omie Daniels, ended in divorce. She died in 2016.
Plans for a memorial service are pending.

Texto completo: As the Chinese government struggles to combat a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened thousands and killed more than 100, it is relying on a medical system that is overburdened and overwhelmed even in normal times. While other parts of everyday life in China have significantly improved in the past decade, the quality of health care has stagnated.
In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, many people have to stand in line in the wee hours of the morning to secure appointments with doctors. When they do get an appointment, patients get only a couple of minutes with a doctor. During flu season, residents set up camp overnight with blankets in hospital corridors.
China does not have a functioning primary care system, so most people flock to hospitals. On an ordinary day, doctors are frustrated and exhausted as they see as many as 200 patients.
Those weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China -- like Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead.
Despite having dealt with the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago, many Chinese hospitals in smaller cities are not fully prepared to deal with a major outbreak like the current virus. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in poorer, rural areas nearby.
Last week, eight hospitals in Hubei province -- where Wuhan is situated and where most of the cases have appeared -- put out a call for face masks, goggles, surgical masks and surgical gowns. In the absence of proper equipment, some medical workers have resorted to cutting plastic folders to jury-rig goggles.
The government's response to the crisis could exacerbate the problems. Across China, authorities are sealing off cities, closing down schools and checking on residents. But the lockdown -- affecting more than 50 million people -- could make it difficult to get medical supplies to hospitals that desperately need them.
With medical facilities in short supply, the local government has also pledged to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days, and vowed that another new 1,300-bed hospital would be ready by the middle of next month.
It is taking a page out of the government's playbook during SARS, when it built a new hospital in Beijing in a week.
Chen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said it was more important to have a working system of family doctors who can act as gatekeepers for the hospitals.
"Without an efficient screening process," he said, "these two hospitals would not be very effective."
With no proven drugs to treat the new virus, health authorities have told doctors to prescribe a combination of treatments -- anti-viral HIV drugs as well as traditional Chinese medicine -- to patients.
Some of the medicines being prescribed are a mixture of ingredients like buffalo horn, jasmine and honeysuckle as well as anti-viral HIV drugs.
As happened with SARS, traditional Chinese medicine is prominently being touted as a way to treat this new coronavirus, but there is no clinical evidence that the gallstones of cattle, the roots of plants and licorice could combat it.

Texto completo: The Super Bowl commercial break has long been a place for comedy and celebrity cameos, for heartwarming snippets and carefully crafted taglines – for entertainment that many viewers find more compelling than the game itself.
Online and inside
USA TODAY's Ad Meter is already on the case. admeter.usatoday.com
Team owner Donald Trump? It could happen, Nancy Armour says. In Sports
That respite from the real world will be interrupted this year – at least for 120 seconds – for, you guessed it, presidential politics.
In a rare move, the campaigns of Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump have each purchased 60-second advertisement slots during Sunday's national television broadcast of Super Bowl LIV (6:30 p.m. EST, Fox) between the Chiefs and the 49ers. The ads cost more than $10 million apiece, and together, they represent a new frontier for both political advertising on television and the realm of Super Bowl commercials.
According to historical data from USA TODAY's Ad Meter, these will be the first two campaign ads to air nationally during the Super Bowl since at least 1989, when Ad Meter first began ranking Super Bowl ads by consumer rating.
"A candidate in a gubernatorial race might buy an ad for a particular state, or someone might buy an ad for a particular town or neighborhood," said Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University. "But a national Super Bowl ad is unheard of when it comes to political candidates."
Less than two years ago, Trump repeatedly targeted the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell on Twitter, incorrectly claiming the league's television ratings were in decline because players knelt during the national anthem. Now he, and Bloomberg, will use the Super Bowl's popularity to reach an estimated audience of more than 100million viewers with their campaign messaging.
NFL spokespeople did not respond to repeated messages from USA TODAY about the campaign ads, or about political advertising during the Super Bowl generally.
Representatives for Fox, which will broadcast Sunday's game, declined to comment – but the network is taking steps to avoid frustrating other Super Bowl advertisers. AdAge, an industry publication, reported last week that Fox will "isolate" the Bloomberg and Trump campaign ads by running them alongside the network's own promos to avoid upsetting other advertisers.
Joe Lockhart, the one-time White House press secretary who later worked as an executive for the NFL, said the campaign ads could have ripple effects on multiple fronts. The NFL would probably rather air "a funny Bud Light or Doritos ad than Donald Trump and Mike Bloomberg," he said. And the candidates could face blowback for injecting political divisiveness into the year's biggest sporting event.
"People watch football to escape from things like their job, politics, war in the Middle East, things like that. So it's generally not the place I think politicians traditionally go," Lockhart said. "But neither Donald Trump nor Michael Bloomberg are traditional politicians, so it's not that surprising."
'A little bit of cat-and-mouse'
Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump's reelection campaign, told USA TODAY in a statement this month that it first talked with Fox about airing an ad during the Super Bowl last fall. (Broadcasting of the game rotates among Fox, NBC and CBS.)
The campaign reserved its time slot in December and paid for the ad "a few weeks ago," Murtaugh said.
For the Bloomberg campaign, the decision to air its own Super Bowl ad was grounded in one-upmanship. Early news reports indicated that Trump would air a 30-second commercial, so Bloomberg bought 60 seconds. "Mike is taking the fight to Trump," campaign spokesperson Michael Frazier wrote in an email.
Hours after The New York Times first reported Bloomberg had purchased the 60-second ad, Trump's campaign said it had also purchased 60 seconds of time.
Lockhart described the ads, at their core, as "a little bit of cat-and-mouse."
"Once Trump decided to do it, Bloomberg wanted to show that he had the funds and the muscle to do it in an even bigger way," said Lockhart, now a CNN contributor and host of a podcast called "Words Matter." "It may not so much be the content of the ad, but the ability to one-up the president."
Erika Franklin Fowler, a professor at Wesleyan University who tracks political television advertising, said the exorbitant costs of Super Bowl ads have long kept political candidates away, leading them to instead opt for local or regional buys. In 2008, for example, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama purchased 30 seconds of advertising time in 24 local markets for $250,000, according to The New York Times.
Bloomberg and Trump are unique, Fowler said, because both obviously have money to burn. In fact, Bloomberg spent more than $75 million on TV advertising in the first month of his candidacy alone, according to figures from the Wesleyan Media Project.
"It's stunning," Fowler said of the New York billionaire's TV spending so far. "There's not another word for it."
Trump, meanwhile, has already used his Super Bowl ad to drum up support. His campaign ran ads on Facebook late last week offering up to 1 million supporters "early viewing access" to its Super Bowl commercial. The Facebook ads also attempted to entice supporters to donate by claiming without evidence that "the Fake News media will do everything they can to ensure our ad never gets aired."
'You're in lockstep'
Current and former network executives told USA TODAY that Fox likely had little choice but to allow Bloomberg and Trump to advertise during the Super Bowl, even though the ads might not be warmly received by otherwise festive football fans.
"I don't think anyone, either the league or Fox, was going to tell the president he couldn't buy an ad," Lockhart said. "And once you've told the president he can buy an ad, and Bloomberg wants an ad, you've got to sell him an ad."
For a network such as Fox, there is essentially a two-step approval process for Super Bowl commercials: Allowing the advertiser to buy time during the broadcast, and signing off on the content within the ad itself.
Networks will often lean on repeat advertisers with whom they have long-term relationships. First-time Super Bowl buyers – such as the Bloomberg and Trump campaigns – are vetted by the network to ensure they have both legitimate interest and the financial means to purchase time.
When the advertiser submits the ad in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, current and former executives said, it is reviewed by the NFL and the network. Either party has the right to block specific content that might be lewd, graphic or otherwise violate their policies.
In 2017, for example, 84 Lumber said Fox required the company to remove imagery of a border wall from its commercial. SodaStream claimed its 2014 ad was nixed because it ended with a parting shot at two of the game's longtime advertisers, Coke and Pepsi. And a 2005 Airborne commercial was banned because it included a glimpse of the late Mickey Rooney's bare bottom.
One senior media executive with direct knowledge of the Super Bowl advertising process said Fox and the NFL would have no viable reason to reject a campaign ad unless it violated either party's broadcast standards.
"When political candidates start inquiring about Super Bowl advertising, it's not the kind of thing you would keep from your partner at the NFL," added the executive, who was granted anonymity to speak openly about industry practices. "You're in lockstep. You're keeping the NFL informed every step of the way."
Neither Bloomberg nor Trump had publicly released the content of their Super Bowl ads as of Friday evening, and experts said viewers' reactions to the ads could depend in part on the messages they contain. But Calkins, the Northwestern professor, said the mere presence of campaign ads during the Super Bowl sends a message of its own.
"Super Bowl ads are very symbolic," Calkins said. "You're communicating that you care about your business, you're investing in your brand, you're willing to spend money. That's true for the products you see on the Super Bowl, but in this case, it is certainly also true of the candidates."

Trump, GOP plan show of force in Iowa

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is preparing a massive show of GOP unity in Iowa ahead of the state's Democratic presidential caucus and as a pivotal vote in the Senate impeachment trial exposes rifts among Republicans who will decide his fate.
Days before Iowans choose a Democratic candidate in the nation's first presidential caucus, Trump will take the stage Thursday at Drake University in Des Moines for his fourth rally of the year. The campaign will then send an unusually long list of GOP heavyweights to Iowa, including Cabinet officials, congressional leaders and members of Trump's family.
The president's campaign and Republican observers described the parade of political events as a flexing of muscles – a warning to Democrats that Trump's operation is far better organized and funded than it was in 2016. But the display will also serve as a potent reminder of Trump's grip on the party as Senate Republicans wrestle with whether to end his impeachment trial or extend it by hearing from witnesses.
David Kochel, a veteran Republican political operative in Iowa, described the president's itinerary in the state as "classic Trump."
"It's a very smart move and it has little to do with his own nomination, which is not in doubt," said Kochel, a senior adviser to Jeb Bush's campaign in 2016. "It's to fire up our base, and step into the middle of their primary dance and take some of the oxygen."
The caucuses take place Monday, and the president's travel will coincide with a last-minute push by several Democratic candidates.
Trump brings star power to Iowa
Trump's rally will come hours after an official White House event in Michigan to highlight his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a rare bipartisan win for the president that will have implications for Iowa farmers and manufacturers. Then, as the nation shifts its attention to the Democratic caucus race, Trump will send about 80 surrogates to the state.
The roster includes at least eight members of the Cabinet, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., are also expected to stump for the president. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Lara Trump are among the president's family members heading to Iowa.
Incumbent presidents, who usually do not face serious challenges for the nomination, rarely devote so much attention to campaigning so early.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh described the effort as a "good workout for our ground game" and said that the caucuses are "an opportunity to flex the organizational muscles of President Trump's" operation.
Democrats in the state framed the events as a sign of "panicking."
"No amount of kicking, screaming, or tweeting can spin that legacy of failure, or voters' desperation for something new," said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price.
Rally on eve of key trial vote
Trump's visit to Iowa initially appeared to offer an opportunity to take a victory lap and a hard pivot to the election. Senate Republican leaders signaled the impeachment trial could wind down as early as Friday, potentially yielding the long-expected acquittal on charges that Trump abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine.
A New York Times report a forthcoming memoir by former Trump national security adviser John Bolton raised new uncertainty about the trial timeline. The Times said the book will allege the president demanded Ukraine officials open an investigation into Biden in exchange for U.S. foreign aid – an issue at the center of the impeachment debate.
A handful of centrist Senate Republicans, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, have said they are willing to hear from witnesses, including Bolton. Friday will be the pivotal day when the GOP-led Senate will decide whether to extend the trial in order to hear from witnesses, or to move forward with a vote on possible acquittal.
Trump, who came in second in the Iowa caucuses in 2016, carried the state in the general election by more than 9 percentage points. Polls suggest the contest could be closer this year, depending on who wins the Democratic nomination. The president was about 2 points ahead of Biden in a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released this month.
That same poll had Trump beating Sen. Bernie Sanders by 6 points and Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 5.

Texto completo: Laurie Garrett, CNN:
"Seventeen years ago, I was covering the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus for several months as it spread across Asia, eventually reaching 37countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them. By far, the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: One had just a single health care worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments. The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training."
David Quammen,
The New York Times:
"'Novel coronavirus of 2019' isn't as novel as you might think. Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, (is) a senior author of the draft paper that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name. It was Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, showed that the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics. When you're done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one. Or do something about the current circumstances, (which) include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere. That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis, but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume -- with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan, China."
Frank Sieren,
Deutsche Welle, Germany:
"The scale of Beijing's measures so far is unprecedented. Only an authoritarian one-party state could have implemented them so rapidly: Some 56million people are under quarantine and air, rail and long-distance bus traffic has been suspended in at least 14 cities. What is incredible is that there have been no demonstrations, let alone riots, in the regions affected. The situation was different with the 2002-03 SARS outbreak: The scale of the epidemic was played down for months. By the time it had been brought under control, 800 people had died. Now, Beijing is providing information about the number of cases and casualties almost every hour. Even the construction of the new hospital is live-streamed."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Lyft Inc. said it cut 90 jobs, or 1.6% of its workforce, as it aims to turn a profit by the end of next year.
The layoffs affected employees in sales and marketing, according to company spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna. Lyft's sales team is "re-prioritising certain markets," she said Wednesday, while the marketing department is consolidating city-by-city groups into regional teams.
"We've carefully evaluated the resources we need to achieve our 2020 business goals, and the restructuring of some of our teams reflects that," Ms. LaManna said in an emailed statement. "We are still growing rapidly and plan to hire more than 1,000 new employees this year." Lyft has about 5,500 employees.
The layoffs were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Lyft and its ride-hailing rival Uber Technologies Inc. are under pressure from investors to show a path to profitable growth. Both companies went public last year with heavy losses on their books, and each has said it expects to become profitable by the end of 2021.
Uber shed more than 1,100 jobs amid a broad restructuring last year. This month, Uber sold its food-delivery business in India, which accounted for more than a quarter of Uber Eats' losses in the first nine months of 2019.
Electric-scooter-rental startups, which burst onto the scene on the back of venture-capital money, are also refocusing in an effort to make money. Lime said this month it would lay off 14% of its workforce. Lyft pulled its e-scooters from some American cities late last year, in a move that resulted in 20 job cuts.
Lyft wouldn't say if more cuts are planned. Its shares closed down 2.8% Wednesday.

Texto completo: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is selling its newspapers to publisher Lee Enterprises Inc. for $140 million, a rare admission by the billionaire investor that he views his current newspaper business as unsustainable.
Mr. Buffett, a lifelong newspaper lover, has said for years that Berkshire's newspaper business declined faster than he expected. In mid-2018, Berkshire hired Lee to manage all of its newspapers except the Buffalo News.
The sale announced Wednesday includes the Buffalo News along with the dozens of newspapers that Lee already manages for Berkshire, Lee said. Berkshire's newspaper collection includes the Tulsa World in Oklahoma, the Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia and Mr. Buffett's hometown paper in Nebraska, the Omaha World-Herald.
Berkshire is famous for hardly ever selling any of its operating businesses. In an "owner's manual" for Berkshire shareholders posted on the company's website, Mr. Buffett wrote, "Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns. We are also very reluctant to sell subpar businesses as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labor relations."
Berkshire's newspapers excluding the Buffalo News logged $373.4 million in revenue and $14.9 million in net income in 2019, Lee said. The newspapers' earnings have been declining for years.
Berkshire will still have financial exposure to the newspaper industry. As part of the sale, Berkshire is lending Lee $576 million at a 9% annual rate. Lee will use the money to pay for the acquisition, refinance its $400 million in existing debt and close its current credit facility, making Berkshire its only lender.
Lee's stock soared 67% Wednesday to $2.10.
The privately held media group MNG Enterprises Inc. said Wednesday it bought a 5.9% stake in Lee and plans to discuss the company's strategy with its management, including the Berkshire deal. MNG, which publishes dozens of newspapers across the country, has been an active acquirer and is known for aggressive cost-cutting at its titles. It is backed by hedge fund Alden Global Capital LLC, which became the largest shareholder in Chicago Tribune owner Tribune Publishing Co. in November 2019.
With the deal, Lee will run 81 daily papers, up from 50. The company currently owns news outlets such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson.
Lee said the deal should boost profits immediately. It also said it has found between about $20 million and $25 million in future savings.
Berkshire's newspapers have already shrunk considerably. The newspaper division and the Buffalo News employed 3,685 people at the end of 2018, down from 4,337 a year earlier, according to Berkshire's annual reports.
Mr. Buffett's decision to exit from the newspaper business underscores the widening divide in media between the handful of large, national players, including The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, and chains of smaller papers.

Texto completo: The National Security Council said the manuscript of former national security adviser John Bolton's forthcoming book contains "significant amounts" of classified information and can't be published in its current form, according to a letter the council sent to Mr. Bolton's lawyer.
"Under federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information," said the letter, dated Jan. 23, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. It was signed by Ellen Knight, senior director for Records, Access and Information Security Management at the NSC.
Mr. Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," is expected to go on sale on March 17, and will be published by Simon & Schuster, a unit of ViacomCBS Inc.
On Sunday, the New York Times published details of the manuscript, including that Mr. Bolton alleges President Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Mr. Trump's top 2020 rivals. Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, confirmed the report.
The claim goes to the heart of Democrats' case for impeachment and contradicts the White House's argument that the decision to hold up nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine wasn't related to Mr. Trump's push for investigations.
Mr. Trump said in a tweet Monday that he never told Mr. Bolton the aid was linked to the investigations.
Mr. Cooper later Wednesday released his email response to the NSC, dated Jan. 24, in which he sought urgent guidance on what it deemed classified ahead of possible testimony by Mr. Bolton before the impeachment trial.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on Wednesday pushed back on reports that he advocated to call witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial during a lunch with Republican senators this week, saying he was "not at all convinced" senators need to hear from witnesses.
The senator told reporters he remained "very skeptical" of calling Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, even after details from Mr. Bolton's upcoming book leaked to the press.
Mr. Toomey said his remarks to other senators were mischaracterized. Rather than calling for Mr. Bolton to testify, Mr. Toomey said, he had said Republicans should merely prepare for the possibility and be ready with a demand that they choose a witness of their own.
"I would underscore I am not taking the position that we ought to have Bolton and some other witnesses," Mr. Toomey said.
The witness that Republicans could choose to call, he said, were Hunter Biden or his father, former Vice President Joe Biden. The core of Mr. Trump's impeachment case is whether the president abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
The White House defense team has argued this week that Mr. Trump's demand was legitimate because Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, while his father pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company.
"The Bidens are very much relevant to this debate over impeachment," he said. "The House managers have rested a tremendous amount of their case on the notion that President Trump could not possibly have had any motive whatsoever for asking for an investigation."
"When you look at the facts involving Hunter Biden and Burisma - it's begging for an investigation about corruption," Mr. Toomey said.
At least one Democratic senator agrees with Mr. Toomey.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would consider Hunter Biden a relevant witness.
"I want people to tell me what you know," Mr. Manchin said. "We have an obligation and a responsibility to have a thorough trial. How do you have a trial without witnesses and evidence?"
Mr. Toomey's comments came as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., scrambled to get the votes he needs to block witnesses ahead of a Friday session.
Several Republican senators seemed open to the idea, particularly after The New York Times reported Mr. Bolton's book claims Mr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine for personal political reasons.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, have both said that report strengthened the case to come to some kind of deal to call witnesses. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are two others who are thought to be open to the idea.
Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told NPR on Wednesday he wants to read Mr. Bolton's manuscript to determine if Mr. Bolton would be a "relevant witness" to call in the trial. Mr. Lankford said he remained unconvinced Mr. Bolton would be relevant to the case, despite witness testimony that links Mr. Bolton to discussions over the Ukraine aid.

LAWYERS: PRESIDENT CAN SEEK HELP TO BE RE-ELECTED SENATORS SUBMIT QUESTIONS IN TRIAL

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The motivations behind President Donald Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son took center stage on Wednesday during nine hours of questioning by U.S. senators as Mr. Trump's impeachment trial entered a crucial phase.
And at least three moderate Republicans - key to passing any measure to call witnesses - appeared to be conflicted about whether Mr. Trump was driven only by personal political gain, as House Democrats have asserted, or the public interest, as White House lawyers have argued.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine - speaking on behalf Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah - rose to ask the first question of the day: How should the senators assess Mr. Trump's possibly competing motivations?
Part of the answer came a short time later, when Alan Dershowitz, an attorney for Mr. Trump, argued a public official could not be impeached for asking for a favor to get re-elected.
"Every public official that I know believes his election is in the public interest," Mr. Dershowitz said. "If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment."
Patrick Philbin, another attorney for Mr. Trump, answered Ms. Collins that if the president felt a "smidgeon" of public interest in his dealings with Ukraine, he cannot be impeached, even if he were also motivated by personal political gain.
Those responses, which were roundly criticized by Democrats, could contain logic used by Senate Republicans as the trial nears a vote, expected on Friday, on whether to call witnesses. The question of mixed motivations also arose in Mr. Romney's list of questions, which he posted to Twitter.
The question-and-answer session provided some insight into how senators have processed roughly 36 hours of arguments over six days. Senators asked roughly 100 questions, all written on off-white note cards and carried to Chief Justice John Roberts to be read aloud.
Many of the questions were pointed, with each party leading its side to restate or sharpen arguments that were already presented on the Senate floor over the past week.
Senate Republicans directed most of their questions to White House counsel, while Senate Democrats stuck to inquiries for the House Democrats. Answers were kept to five minutes, with Mr. Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, occasionally cutting off the speaker with a gentle "thank you."
"It's highly unlikely that you'll see either side asking questions of the other side," Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., told reporters during an afternoon break in the trial. "The truth of the matter is, you don't want to give someone an opportunity just to drone on forever without actually answering the question."
But it also led to some answers that were unconvincing to both sides. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said he heard "nothing new or revelatory" during the questioning period that would change his mind on voting to acquit Mr. Trump.
The most closely watched questions were submitted by the small group of moderate Republican senators, including Ms. Collins, who are at the center of a political tug-of-war over witnesses.
House Democrats seized on Ms. Collins' wondering about Mr. Trump's motivations to press the Senate to call John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, as a witness.
Mr. Bolton's upcoming book, titled "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," reportedly details direct conversations with Mr. Trump, according to a report in The New York Times on Sunday.
If senators have any question if Mr. Trump had a public interest motive, "there is a witness a subpoena away who can answer that question," said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.
"Don't wait for the book," Mr. Schiff said. "You can erase all doubt."
Ms. Collins has said she is "very likely" to call witnesses, while Mr. Romney has said Mr. Bolton's book "strengthens the case" for witnesses.
Few other senators who are considered to be on the fence have shared their thoughts - but some conveyed their thinking on Wednesday.
At about 9 p.m., Ms. Murkowski, the moderate Republican from Alaska, rose to ask why the House managers had not attempted to resolve legal disputes with the White House over their subpoenas before sending the articles to the Senate.
Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, responded Mr. Trump "invented the theory" that the House needed to vote to "authorize" an impeachment inquiry before subpoenas were legally enforceable.
Further, Ms. Garcia said, the Constitution vests the House of Representatives with the "sole power of impeachment" and contains "no requirements for how the House must carry out that responsibility."
Mr. Philbin, the White House lawyer, told Ms. Murkowski the House has "affirmatively avoided getting any litigation" done because "they had a timetable. . They had no time for the courts."
The debate over witnesses raged on Wednesday, and the two sides sparred over how much longer the trial could last with compelled testimony.
The White House portrayed witnesses as paralyzing the Senate's business for "months," in the estimation of Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that "we could get the whole thing done in a week."
Mr. Schumer said "at least some" Republican senators were still weighing whether to join the 47 Democrats and Independents in approving such a measure.
But he was not holding his breath. "Is it more likely than not" that a witness deal will get done? "No," he said.
Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., emphasized to reporters on Wednesday that he had not advocated for a deal on witnesses and still believed they were unnecessary. And Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. - considered a possible swing vote as he faces re-election this year in a battleground state - told reporters he would vote against calling witnesses.
Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said in a video posted to Twitter that all the questions "keep coming back to what we've been talking about these last seven or eight days, which is relevant witnesses and relevant documents."
"No manuscript, no book even, is a substitute for having a live witness in a chair," Mr. Casey said.
On Wednesday, Mr. Casey asked House Democrats to "speak broadly to the duties of being a public servant and how you believe the president's actions have violated this trust?" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., replied that the president had abused his power and betrayed public trust.
Mr. Casey also joined another question led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., about how Mr. Trump's freeze on aid to Ukraine differed from holds on aid to other countries.
"This is what it's all about," Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., responded. "The president abused his authority."

Texto completo: The series finale of "The Good Place" airs on NBC. And a wrestling comedy hits Amazon and Hulu.
What's on TV
THE GOOD PLACE 8:30 p.m. on NBC. "The second you conceive of any system of what happens after you die, you then realize, oh, there's a million flaws with this," Michael Schur, the creator of this sitcom, said in a recent interview with The New York Times. In 2016, "The Good Place" began its first season by introducing Eleanor (Kristen Bell), a saleswoman who dies and finds out that admission to the show's equivalent of heaven is determined by a point system. Much has changed since then: The show's fourth and final season, which comes to a close Thursday night, has focused largely on the idea that sorting humans into a "good place" and a "bad place" is a fool's errand. After the Thursday night finale, Seth Meyers will host a live panel discussion with Schur and the cast -- Bell, Ted Danson, William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, Manny Jacinto and D'Arcy Carden.
EVIL 10 p.m. on CBS. The first season of this supernatural thriller series has pitted an investigator (played by Mike Colter), his associate (Aasif Mandvi) and a forensic psychologist (Katja Herbers) against a villain who loves the occult (Michael Emerson). Thursday night's episode is the season finale.
GHOST IN THE SHELL (2017) 6:45 p.m. on Syfy. If you want to see Scarlett Johansson -- currently up for two Oscars for her performances in "Marriage Story" and "Jojo Rabbit" -- in a movie that's the polar opposite of "Marriage Story," one option is this turbulent adaptation of a famed Japanese manga. Johansson plays a cyborg soldier investigating her own past in a near-future world. (Her casting caused controversy: The original manga is set in Japan, and many questioned why the part didn't go to an Asian or Asian-American actress.) While this live-action version of the story is ambitious, curious audiences may be better off checking out the actual source material: In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called this film "visually cluttered yet often disappointingly drab," adding that it's "one of those future-shock stories that edges around the dystopian without going full-bore apocalyptic." For a full-bore apocalypse fix on TV Thursday night, see instead the Will Smith vehicle I AM LEGEND (2007), airing at 6 p.m. on AMC.
What's Streaming
FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY (2019) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Florence Pugh plays a young British woman who finds fame in the wrestling ring in this comedy. Pugh's character, Paige, comes from a family of wrestlers (Nick Frost and Lena Headey play the parents) who run a gym in Norwich, England. Paige's eventual stardom creates a fissure in her relationship with her older brother, Zak (Jack Lowden) -- a situation that adds some tension to this witty movie. The film was written and directed by Stephen Merchant, a creator of the British version of "The Office." Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times that he has here "a terrific cast (including Vince Vaughn as a coach), pinpoint timing and a gift for visual japes and physical comedy, for arranging bodies in funny formations and for underlining everyday absurdity."

Texto completo: Chiefs fans have relished doing the tomahawk chop since the early 1990s. But to many Native Americans and others, the gesture is an offensive mockery of the nation's first people.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The night was winding down at The Rieger, an upscale casual restaurant in Kansas City, and a couple of Denver Broncos fans in town for a game last month were standing at the bar, engaging in some friendly ribbing with supporters of the hometown Chiefs.
At some point, the Broncos fans walked through the dining room. That's when a Chiefs fan responded with a gesture as synonymous with the team as its red jerseys: He sliced his hand through the air in a chopping motion while bellowing a rhythmic chant.
Slowly but surely, most of the 50 or so diners dropped their silverware, turned toward the rivals and joined in, chopping the air in unison and chanting in a rising chorus that filled the restaurant.
This city's beloved football team has left an unmistakable imprint on the local culture, whether it be the tradition of wearing red on the Fridays before games or the custom of modifying the national anthem's final line to "and the home of the Chiefs" before kickoff at Arrowhead Stadium.
But perhaps the most indelible symbol of Chiefs fandom is one that unifies believers and divides others: the tomahawk chop.
Now that the Chiefs are on one of the biggest stages in sports, contending in the Super Bowl for the first time in 50 years, there is new scrutiny on the tradition.
For many fans, the chop and its accompanying chant -- a pantomimed tomahawk motion and made-up war cry, also employed by fans of the Atlanta Braves, the Florida State Seminoles and England's Exeter Chiefs rugby team -- are a way to show solidarity with their team and to intimidate the opposition. But to many Native Americans -- locally and afar -- and others, the act is a disrespectful gesture that perpetuates negative stereotypes of the nation's first people and embarrasses a city that fancies itself a hub of culture and innovation in the Midwest.
"It doesn't show K.C. pride," said Howard Hanna, the chef and owner of The Rieger, describing his dismay as the impromptu chop unfolded in his restaurant. "It makes us look stupid."
The Chiefs have largely escaped the hottest embers in the national debate over American Indian mascots and imagery in sports. Their name does not evoke a slur like the Washington Redskins, and their mascot is not a red-faced caricature like Chief Wahoo, the logo that the Cleveland Indians began phasing out two years ago.
The organization has worked with Native Americans over the past six years to reconsider and reform some of its traditions. That dialogue resulted in the team's discouraging fans from dressing in Indian regalia and asking broadcasters to refrain from panning to those who disregard the request. The team makes informative announcements about Native American history and tradition during some games, and a group of Natives hands out literature at the stadium. The team sometimes invites Native people to bless the drums that are ceremonially beaten before games.
The Chiefs have shown little appetite, however, for preventing their supporters from doing the chop.
"The Arrowhead Chop is part of the game-day experience that is really important to our fans," Mark Donovan, the team president, recently told The Kansas City Star.
Team officials did not respond to specific questions about the chop, but said in a statement to The New York Times that they were working with Native Americans "to create awareness and understanding, as well as celebrate the rich traditions of multiple tribes with a historic connection to our region."
In interviews this week, several players praised the tomahawk chop and chant for pumping them up.
"I love it," Jordan Lucas, a Chiefs safety, said. Asked about concerns that it is offensive, he said, "I can't even speak on that, because I have nothing to do with that and I don't know anything about that."
Chiefs fans started doing the chop in the early 1990s, encouraged by Marty Schottenheimer, then the head coach, who was inspired by a performance from the Northwest Missouri State band, which was led at the time by a Florida State alumnus. The gesture is often called the Arrowhead Chop, a nod to the Chiefs' stadium.
John Learned, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho united tribes, led a small group that in 2013 encouraged the Chiefs to break from traditions that involved non-Native people dressing like Indians. But the chop, Learned said, was not offensive because it had no real meaning to Native communities.
"We're not going to come after the chop, because it's unique," he said. "It's a rallying cry for our team."
While the team has pointed to its relationship with Learned as evidence of its outreach to indigenous communities, some more-established Native organizations say the Chiefs have ignored them. When the team started working with Native organizations, it did not include the Kansas City Indian Center, said Gaylene Crouser, the executive director of the 49-year-old nonprofit organization, which provides social services to roughly 6,000 Natives a year.
The local Indian community's views on the tomahawk chop run the gamut, Crouser said, from those who think it is fine to others who are offended.
"As an organization, part of our mission is to empower Indian people," said Crouser, who is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux. "And things like the tomahawk chop don't empower Indian people. It's still very stereotypical and mocking of an entire race of people."
A survey of Native Americans -- conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley, and set to publish next month -- found that around half of respondents were bothered or offended when sports fans did the tomahawk chop or wore Indian headdresses. Opposition was even greater among those who frequently engaged in Native traditions, with 65 percent saying the chop bothered them, according to the report, which will appear in the academic journal "Social Psychological and Personality Science."
Other research suggests that even when Natives see mascots or imagery as positive, they can still do psychological harm, damaging the self-esteem and ambitions of American Indian youth.
"There's no way that the use of Natives as mascots is honoring," said Stephanie Fryberg, a University of Michigan professor who is Tulalip and worked on the survey. "That's an illusion."
The tomahawk chop causes ambivalence among some Chiefs fans -- they understand why Native people might find it offensive, but say they do it to celebrate their team, not to demean Indians. Several fans said they would have no problem giving up the chant and replacing it with something else, but that the team would have to lead that effort.
Joyce Parker, 65, cringed as she admitted that she does the chop at games.
"It's just that caught-up-in-the-moment group joy," said Parker, a fan from Prairie Village, Kan., a suburb that is a 10-minute drive southwest of Kansas City. "Yes, I feel bad about it."
But Brian Shirley, a 46-year-old warehouse manager, thinks the chop should stay.
"I don't think they should take offense," Shirley said. "I enjoy going to the stadium and doing it."
Quinton Lucas, the Kansas City mayor, said it was not for him to tell fans how to cheer, but acknowledged that he does not chop because "I have different ways to celebrate my fandom."
Regardless of where people stand on the issue, Lucas said he hoped that the rest of the country did not negatively judge Kansas City because of how its fans celebrate.
"Anybody who knows Kansas City, anybody who's been to Arrowhead Stadium, knows us to be a good place," Lucas said.
Ken Belson and Ben Shpigel contributed reporting.

M.L.B.'s Feud With the Minors Hits a Boiling Point

Texto completo: Major league officials, dismayed by a public back-and-forth with the minor leagues over a proposal to significantly overhaul their joint system, delivered a pointed letter on Wednesday.
Ever since the news of Major League Baseball's plan to overhaul the minor leagues emerged in October, major league and minor league officials have carried out a public relations battle, volleying statements and letters back and forth amid contentious negotiations.
On Wednesday, M.L.B. issued a pointed and heated letter in response to a minor league message that cast doubt over whether the two sides could ever reach an agreement on the future of their relationship.
Dan Halem, the deputy commissioner and lead negotiator for M.L.B., wrote that the minor leagues, known as MiLB, and its president, Pat O'Conner, were "doing significant damage to your relationship with the 30 clubs by attacking M.L.B. publicly and in the political realm."
Halem added that M.L.B. teams were "united in our negotiating position and misinformation tactics you have employed have only made the 30 clubs more resolute."
The sharp missive came as the two sides were negotiating over an M.L.B. proposal that would, among other changes, cut off major league ties for as many as 42 minor league affiliates and replace them with independent teams in what it would call a "Dream League" -- which would not include any players under contract with major league teams.
Minor League Baseball has vehemently objected to the proposal, and the two sides have held several negotiation sessions to reach a new agreement. The current Professional Baseball Agreement, which governs the relationship between the majors and minors, expires in September.
But with another bargaining session scheduled for Feb. 20, each side is accusing the other of spreading falsehoods and misinformation, as the tenor of the discourse becomes increasingly acrimonious.
On Jan. 23, MiLB sent an unsigned letter to M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred, which was published by NBC Sports on Wednesday, outlining its opposition to contracting and reorganizing the 120-team minor-league system.
Halem's response on behalf of M.L.B. struck an exasperated tone: "Although we have fully explained our views on all issues both formally and informally to members of your negotiating committee, there continues to be a disconnect between MiLB's public messaging, government messaging and written communications on the one hand, and the views expressed by MiLB at the negotiating table on the other."
M.L.B. insists the restructuring can be done in a way that still preserves some form of minor league baseball in those communities. It also asserted that MiLB was hypocritical because of how frequently its owners moved teams around on their own.
"Minor league owners routinely leave communities because the team is not economically viable, or the owner receives a better offer elsewhere," Halem wrote. "And when they do leave, neither MiLB nor the owner, typically offers anything as a replacement to the community, such as the case in Pawtucket (2020), New Orleans (2019), Mobile (2019) and Helena (2018) in the last two years alone."
Representatives of minor league baseball did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and a spokesman for M.L.B. said Halem's letter spoke for itself.
M.L.B. has drawn widespread criticism for its proposal, including from federal lawmakers. Four members of the House of Representatives introduced a bipartisan resolution on Tuesday asking M.L.B. to abandon its restructuring proposal.
"Minor League Baseball teams have had a major impact on small communities," Representative David McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, said in a statement. "These teams provide an enormous cultural and economic benefit to the communities they call home. Doing away with 42 teams is not a reasonable solution."
Wednesday's letter underscored M.L.B. officials' belief that MiLB, instead of negotiating in good faith, had instead sought to build outside pressure to prevent any changes to the existing agreement. If a new deal is not reached by September, M.L.B. could choose to continue operating under the current P.B.A., or it could leave it to individual M.L.B. teams to act as they see fit. In that case, several major league clubs could cut their affiliations with their minor league teams on their own.
Major league teams generally pay for the minor league teams' players and coaching staffs, and the farm teams cover everything else, including travel and equipment.
In its letter last week, MiLB accused M.L.B. of false statements and outlined alternatives to M.L.B.'s proposals. Instead of eliminating teams that play in substandard facilities, it proposed that the owners of those identified teams should be given time to upgrade their stadiums. If they failed to do so, then MiLB would find other ownership groups or could even move the clubs.
It also dismissed M.L.B.'s description of the support it provided minor league teams: "It is simply not true that M.L.B. 'heavily subsidizes' MiLB," the letter said.
Halem, whose eight-page letter attempted to refute the MiLB letter point by point, asserted that the players were the subsidy: M.L.B. clubs pay the players and assign them to the teams. He said the players were the most valuable commodity, in an entertainment sense, to the minor league teams.
M.L.B. has all but abandoned the Dream League concept, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. It is instead floating a different league -- to be played in the cities of contracted teams -- consisting of players preparing for the M.L.B. draft, which is likely to be cut from 40 rounds to 20.
In the conclusion of his letter, Halem issued something of a plea to his minor league counterparts: "I personally do not believe that exchanging of letters of this type is productive or increases the likelihood that the parties will reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Texto completo: Dawn Dunning, one of two women who testified against Harvey Weinstein, said he sexually assaulted her in the early 2000s.
The women were young aspiring actresses waiting tables in New York in the mid 2000s when they met the producer Harvey Weinstein.
Dawn Dunning, a waitress from Ohio, met Mr. Weinstein at an upscale lounge in New York City's meatpacking district. Tarale Wulff was his waitress at another exclusive lounge in Lower Manhattan.
He offered to help both women with their acting careers, luring them to what they thought were business meetings. But each took the witness stand on Wednesday at Mr. Weinstein's rape trial to describe how, once they were alone with Mr. Weinstein, he sexually assaulted them.
Ms. Dunning testified that at one meeting, Mr. Weinstein suggested she agree to a threesome with him and one of his assistants to advance her career, telling her, "This is how the industry works." Ms. Wulff said she had met Mr. Weinstein to discuss a movie role when he raped her inside of his Manhattan loft.
Ms. Dunning and Ms. Wulff were the latest women to testify against Mr. Weinstein at his long awaited trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, which is widely seen as a watershed moment in the #MeToo era. In all, six women have agreed to testify for the prosecution about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them.
Choking back tears, Ms. Dunning said her encounters with the producer happened in 2004, and Ms. Wulff said Mr. Weinstein attacked her the following year.
Mr. Weinstein was once a powerful Hollywood producer, who won fame for reshaping the independent movie industry with Oscar winners like "Shakespeare in Love" and Pulp Fiction."
But since 2017, when The New York Times and The New Yorker published exposés, more than 90 women have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct, touching off a global reckoning over the harassment women have endured for centuries at the hands of men.
Mr. Weinstein has not been criminally charged in connection with the allegations from Ms. Dunning and Ms. Wulff, but Justice James A. Burke has ruled prosecutors can use their testimony to show what they allege is Mr. Weinstein's pattern of behavior.
On cross-examination, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers sought to undermine the women's credibility, pointing out, for instance, that Ms. Dunning had shared parts of her story in several television interviews but had never said Mr. Weinstein touched her genitals. The defense lawyers also raised questions about the reliability of Ms. Wulff's memory.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts, including rape and predatory sexual assault. Those charges stem from allegations made by two women: Miriam Haley, a production assistant on "Project Runway" who has said he forced oral sex on her in 2006, and Jessica Mann, a former actress who told authorities he raped her in 2013.
On Monday, Ms. Haley, who recently changed her name from Mimi Haleyi, told the jury that Mr. Weinstein had physically held her down and assaulted her in his Manhattan loft.
Last week, the actress Annabella Sciorra, best known for her role in "The Sopranos," testified that in the winter months of either 1993 or 1994, Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her apartment in New York and raped her.
The state's statute of limitations bars Ms. Sciorra's allegation from being charged as a separate crime, but prosecutors are using it to bolster a charge of predatory sexual assault, which requires the state to prove that Mr. Weinstein committed a serious sex crime against at least two women.
The trial has asked the jury of seven men and five women to consider complicated questions of consent and power dynamics in professional relationships. Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have argued all the sexual encounters were not only consensual but also transactional. The women, they have said, agreed to sex in the hope Mr. Weinstein might give them work.
Ms. Dunning, 40, who is now a costume designer, said that Mr. Weinstein struck up a conversation with her at the now defunct PM Lounge where she waited tables, expressing an interest in her as an actress. They met several times to discuss her career, she said.
Then Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Dunning to a boutique hotel in TriBeCa, on the pretense of meeting people in the film industry, she said. During a conversation in a bedroom, she said, he suddenly slipped his hand up her skirt and touched her genitals.
He quickly apologized, she recalled, and told her "not to make a big deal about it." She said she never reported the incident to the police, because she wanted "to pretend it didn't happen." Later, she agreed to a second meeting at a Manhattan hotel where they were supposed to talk about movie scripts.
But Mr. Weinstein answered the door wearing only a bathrobe, she said, and suggested that Ms. Dunning agree to a threesome with him and one of his assistants in exchange for roles in three movies, including "The Derail." Ms. Dunning said she laughed, thinking it was a joke.
"He got really angry and started screaming at me, 'You'll never make it in this business. This is how the industry works. This is how,' -- and he named three actresses -- 'got to where they are,"' she said.
Arthur Aidala, one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, asked on cross-examination why Ms. Dunning had not told anyone, even during a series of interviews with television reporters, about the alleged encounter where she said the producer touched her vagina.
Ms. Wulff, 43, who is now a model, said she met Mr. Weinstein at Cipriani's Upstairs SoHo, a members-only lounge. After learning that Ms. Wulff was an actress, Mr. Weinstein suggested she make an appointment with his office, she testified.
Later that night, she said, Mr. Weinstein grabbed her by the arm and led her up upstairs to a secluded area, where he started masturbating in front of her. She said she rushed away.
Still, Ms. Wulff said she later agreed to meet with Mr. Weinstein at his company's office to discuss a potential role in "Pulse," a movie that was being produced by Mr. Weinstein's brother, Robert Weinstein, in Los Angeles.
Mr. Weinstein had a driver bring her from the company office to his apartment, Ms. Wulff said. When she arrived, Mr. Weinstein chatted with her while walking back and forth in a bedroom. Ms. Wulff testified that Mr. Weinstein then forced her on the bed and lay on top of her.
She recalled telling him, "I can't," but he said, "Don't worry, I had a vasectomy." Ms. Wulff said, "I just froze."
"He put himself inside of me and he raped me," she said.
She said she did not tell anyone about what had happened, including the police. "It's easiest for me to pretend it didn't happen," Ms. Wulff said.
Donna Rotunno, a defense lawyer, elicited testimony from Ms. Wulff, suggesting she had trouble remembering important parts of the encounter. Ms. Wulff acknowledged, for instance, that she could not remember if she had explicitly told Mr. Weinstein she did not want to have sex, though she remembered saying, "I can't."
Ms. Wulff also said in response to Ms. Rotunno's questions that she had met with a trauma therapist 55 times, following a referral from prosecutors.
"Isn't it correct that after the first meeting, the district attorney's office told you your memories were too fragmented and they could not use you in this case?" Ms. Rotunno asked.
That was not accurate, Ms. Wulff replied. "They understood it has been a long time and there may be gaps in my memory and that was it," she said.

Texto completo: The dollars are adding up fast. So here are some tips for pruning the subscriptions you no longer use.
Online subscriptions sure sound cheap, but what do a few bucks a month to watch TV shows, store photos online and stream music add up to?
Quite a lot, it turns out.
In 2019, we each spent $ 640 on digital subscriptions like streaming video and music services, cloud storage, dating apps and online productivity tools, according to an analysis for The New York Times by Mint, the online budgeting tool owned by Intuit, using data from millions of its users. That was up about 7 percent from $ 598 in 2017.
We increased our spending the most last year on streaming TV services, paying $ 170 to subscribe to the likes of Netflix, Hulu and new entrants like Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus. While that was far cheaper than most traditional cable TV packages, which cost roughly $ 1,200 a year, it was up 30 percent from the $ 130 we spent on streaming TV services in 2017.
Our spending on digital subscriptions is likely to only rise as more of our possessions become connected to the internet, like our television sets, home security systems and cars. At the same time, it will become harder and harder to keep track of all of the services we pay for.
Just ask Josué Rojas, an artist who runs a nonprofit in San Francisco. He said he paid for Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify and Apple's iCloud storage service -- all told, his annual cost is roughly $ 410, which is below what the average consumer pays.
But Mr. Rojas occasionally loses track of his spending. Last year, he said, he and his wife subscribed to the CBS All Access streaming app to watch the Grammys. After the ceremony concluded, the couple forgot to cancel the $ 6 subscription for several months.
"Coming home from work and essentially needing a spreadsheet to keep track of all these different subscriptions can be pretty overbearing very quickly," Mr. Rojas said.
Kevin Westcott, a vice chairman for the research and consulting firm Deloitte, who led a study on digital media trends, said the No. 1 reason that people subscribed to a streaming service was to watch exclusive content -- like original TV shows, including HBO's "Watchmen" or "The Mandalorian" on Disney Plus.
"The question that arises is, once you've watched that series, do you continue to use it?" Mr. Westcott said. "Is there enough of a library that keeps you engaged? Otherwise, it becomes a subscription you have that you haven't used."
Plenty of us have fallen into this trap. It's wise to regularly audit our subscriptions and prune the ones we no longer need. Here are some tips.
Cancel ahead of time
Many of us wait until the last minute to cancel a subscription, but there is generally no drawback to ending payments ahead of time.
Let's say Netflix bills you on the 28th of each month. If you decided on Feb. 5 that it was time to cancel, you would still be able to use Netflix until Feb. 28. There is no benefit to waiting until Feb. 27 to end the subscription.
With some forethought, you can get savvy about managing your active subscriptions. For example, if there is a six-episode TV show on Disney Plus once a week, you can set a calendar reminder to cancel your subscription a few weeks before the show ends its run. If the calendar alert appears and you realize there is still something you want to watch on Disney Plus, you can continue paying and reschedule the calendar reminder to appear again a month later.
Audit your subscriptions
Using budget-tracking tools like Mint and regularly checking your credit card statement are obvious steps to watch your spending, but subscription charges can easily be overlooked when they carry generic labels like "Amazon" or "Google."
It can also be challenging to find out what services you are still subscribed to, let alone how to discontinue memberships. So here's a cheat sheet for finding the controls to cancel the most popular types of subscriptions:

- On Apple mobile devices, open the Settings app and tap on your first and last name at the top, then tap Subscriptions. You can see a list of the apps you have subscribed to, like Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, HBO Now and Hulu Plus, and cancel the ones you no longer use.
-
On Android devices, open the Google Play Store app. Tap the Menu icon (three horizontal lines) and then tap Subscriptions.
- Amazon subscriptions are the most confusing to manage because the company offers so many different types of subscriptions and the controls are scattered throughout different parts of the website. Here are the most important settings:
For canceling memberships like Amazon Prime and ComiXology, hover over "Accounts & Lists" and click on "Memberships & Subscriptions."
For Amazon app subscriptions, hover over "Accounts & Lists" and click on "Your Android Apps & Devices," and then select "Your Subscriptions."
For managing Amazon photo storage, hover over "Accounts & Lists," click on "Your Amazon Photos," then click "Manage Storage" and, finally, click "Cancel my plan."
For managing Kindle books subscriptions, hover over "Accounts & Lists," click "Your Kindle Unlimited" and, under "Manage Membership," select "Cancel Kindle Unlimited Membership."
For managing Amazon Music, hover over "Accounts & Lists," click "Your Music Library," then click "Your Amazon Music Settings" and select "Amazon Music Unlimited." Finally, click "Cancel" in the Subscription Renewal section.
For managing Audible audiobooks subscriptions, visit Audible.com, click "Account Details" and click "Cancel my membership."


On Apple mobile devices, open the Settings app and tap on your first and last name at the top, then tap Subscriptions. You can see a list of the apps you have subscribed to, like Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, HBO Now and Hulu Plus, and cancel the ones you no longer use.
On Android devices, open the Google Play Store app. Tap the Menu icon (three horizontal lines) and then tap Subscriptions.
Amazon subscriptions are the most confusing to manage because the company offers so many different types of subscriptions and the controls are scattered throughout different parts of the website. Here are the most important settings:

For managing Amazon photo storage, hover over "Accounts & Lists," click on "Your Amazon Photos," then click "Manage Storage" and, finally, click "Cancel my plan."
For managing Kindle books subscriptions, hover over "Accounts & Lists," click "Your Kindle Unlimited" and, under "Manage Membership," select "Cancel Kindle Unlimited Membership."
For managing Amazon Music, hover over "Accounts & Lists," click "Your Music Library," then click "Your Amazon Music Settings" and select "Amazon Music Unlimited." Finally, click "Cancel" in the Subscription Renewal section.
For managing Audible audiobooks subscriptions, visit Audible.com, click "Account Details" and click "Cancel my membership."
If keeping track of subscriptions sounds daunting, that's because it is -- and this is partly why many companies have shifted toward subscriptions. But a subscriptions audit is worth undertaking at least once every three months.
After thoroughly vetting my credit card bills and subscriptions dashboards, I noticed my wife was paying for Audible, the audiobook service, even though she no longer downloaded audiobooks. I confess I gave her something of a hard time -- only to realize later that I had neglected to cancel my subscription to Amazon's ComiXology Unlimited after starting a free trial to read one comic book.
I ended up canceling the ComiXology subscription, but only after paying an extra $ 18 over three months.

Texto completo: Readers variously see a gift to Israel and a missed opportunity for Palestinians. Also: The anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation; gay men and crystal meth addiction.
To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Unveils Plan on Mideast Peace" (front page, Jan. 29):
Anyone serious about achieving peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians knows that there are three main issues that will require compromise: the status of Jerusalem, the future of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the eventual borders of a Palestinian state.
President Trump's so-called peace plan bows entirely to Israel's demands on all three of those crucial issues. Jerusalem will remain largely unified and under Israel's control. Settlements will be kept intact and annexed as part of Israel. Palestine's borders will be a jumbled, indefensible mess.
This is not a serious plan. It is a blank check written by a president facing an impeachment trial and handed to an Israeli prime minister indicted on corruption charges.
Not only will this plan fail to achieve peace, but it will also set back American efforts in the Middle East for years to come.

To the Editor:
The Palestinians, who rejected the new peace plan before it was even announced, complain that they had no input. Seems that if you reject participating in the process, chances are you'll have no input.
As for there being nothing in it for the Palestinians, I would think that offering them a state, having part of Jerusalem as their capital, linking their cities in Judea and Samaria with Gaza, and supplying $ 50 billion for economic development is not exactly "nothing."
Seems like Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, now serving Year 14 of a four-year term, is hellbent on having his legacy be one of hatred, violence and rejection instead of bringing economic prosperity and peace to his people -- another blown opportunity!

The Lesson of Auschwitz
To the Editor:
Re "Auschwitz Survivors Warn Against Silence in Face of New Perils" (front page, Jan. 28):
With the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz bringing attention to the horrors of the Holocaust, we need to be reminded of what these brave survivors have said: that we need to call out hatred wherever we see it.
Even today, we see the demonization of marginalized populations, the twisting of history and the minimizing of others' suffering. This anniversary and the courage the survivors have demonstrated are a reminder that we should never turn a blind eye to others' suffering because we never know who will be the next target.

Gay Men and Crystal Meth Addiction
To the Editor:
Re "Gay Men Are Dying From Another Crisis" (Op-Ed, Jan. 23):
Thanks to Jim Mangia for shining a light on this growing problem within the gay community.
As a gay man who got caught in the web of crystal meth addiction, I know firsthand the devastation this drug can cause. My use not only resulted in long-term, irreversible health consequences, but it also drained my bank account, derailed my career, almost destroyed my relationship and took me to depths of darkness I never imagined.
That said, I consider myself incredibly lucky, as after multiple efforts I've managed to get some distance from the drug. Others are not so fortunate. I've heard more than my fair share of stories of men ending up in psych wards or losing everything (including their lives).
As a community, we need to rally to meet this ravaging wave of addiction and loss head-on. If there is one lesson that we should have learned from the AIDS epidemic, it's that delaying action can have devastating consequences. Another storm is coming, and we need to be ready.

Texto completo: Senators, who serve as jurors and judges in President Trump's impeachment trial, are also acting as tourists and historians of the rare proceeding.
WASHINGTON -- Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, first picked up the habit in grade school, scribbling notes in ink on 3-by-5-inch graph paper index cards as a mechanism to keep his handwriting small and his thoughts organized.
More than three decades later, seated in the back row of the Senate chamber during the third presidential impeachment trial in history, Mr. Sasse is still scrawling notes -- this time on the hours of arguments over whether President Trump should be removed from office for committing high crimes and misdemeanors.
To the 100 senators who are serving as jurors and judges in Mr. Trump's impeachment proceeding, the trial is both a complex and consequential constitutional case and a chance to witness history. So as they sit silently at their desks for hours on end, they are finding ways to document the trial in modern ways and age-old ones, working to keep track of evidence and arguments, to communicate with their constituents about the process and to preserve their memories for posterity.
Because of limitations on electronics during the trial, senators like Mr. Sasse have resorted to their own preferred methods of transcription and note-taking, arming themselves with felt-tip pens, legal pads, notepads purchased at Office Depot and at least one sparkly pink notebook. Those notes, coupled with the occasional constituent feedback, have helped provide the foundation for the questions senators are now asking of the seven House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a veteran of the Clinton impeachment trial, carefully noted on her Senate legal pad the date, the name of the person speaking, their main points and any direct quotes that struck her as significant. In the margins, she wrote down possible inconsistencies, what she wanted to review and questions to potentially ask the two legal teams.
"I am just trying to capture the information, and in some cases, my reaction to it, in real time," Ms. Collins wrote in an email. On Wednesday, she asked the first question of the trial -- on behalf of herself and two Republican colleagues, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- about what they should do if they concluded that Mr. Trump had both political and policy objectives in mind in his actions toward Ukraine.
In the chamber, the taste for the mechanics of note-taking is widespread. Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, brought a binder with color-coded tabs and background reading like the Senate Oath, the Constitution and the Federalist Papers. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, has carefully filled pages in a leather-bound book, sometimes while standing in the back of the room. And Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona, can be seen keeping a record in a sparkly pink journal.
Sometimes all the documentation gives way doodling; Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, sketched out a visage of the Capitol building, underneath a few observations.
There was plenty of senatorial scribbling when the chamber weighed whether to remove President Bill Clinton 21 years ago, but in the first presidential impeachment of the 21st Century, senators also have access to a number of digital tools to capture their real-time reactions and reflections. Many are producing video clips filmed in their Capitol Hill offices that are quickly posted to social media.
Those tools have also provided a way for senators to give the public a glimpse of what otherwise would be private moments, such as a photo of the cellular device cubby where they must store their electronics to comply with rules against having them inside the chamber. Senator Angus King, the independent senator from Maine, snapped a picture of the cabinet, which one colleague had also used to store an apple, and posted it on Instagram.
Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, said he wanted to figure out a way to show his constituents his impressions of the trial, so he decided to film a daily video -- no longer than seven minutes -- to circulate on social media.
"Hopefully people that I represent will see it, get the message, understand what I'm doing, how I'm approaching this, and we go from that," Mr. Jones said in an interview.
In Tuesday's installment, Mr. Jones, his sleeves rolled up and brandishing his legal note pad and blue felt-tip pen, read directly from his notes and discussed his takeaways from the arguments presented by Mr. Trump's legal team.
"I do think it was important to get that immediate reaction or as close to an immediate reaction as possible," he said.
In a similar vein, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, started a podcast -- "Verdict with Ted Cruz" -- an idea that had been kicked around before but came to fruition with the beginning of the trial, an aide said.
The podcast, hosted along with Michael Knowles, a conservative political commentator, has shot to the top of the iTunes charts, and offers Mr. Cruz an opportunity to expand upon his analysis of constitutional issues and the arguments with little interruption. Earlier this week, he asked subscribers to send suggestions for what to ask during the 16 hours allocated for Senate questions.
"If you turn on cable TV, you get people in five-, six-minute snippets," Mr. Cruz said in the podcast's first episode, which began recording around 2:40 a.m. last Wednesday after 12 hours of debate over the rules outlining the trial. "What I hope to do is have conversations really talking about issues that matter, and that's what this podcast is all about."
When not on the chamber floor, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, is maintaining his habit of carrying a camera wherever it's allowed -- whether by joining the news photographers capturing scenes of key trial figures maneuvering through the Capitol or stopping to take pictures of the photographers themselves, cordoned off behind red velvet ropes and stanchions.
"I take my camera just about everywhere," Mr. Leahy wrote in a caption for a photo of Jay Sekulow, the president's personal lawyer, speaking to reporters. The senator, who was born almost blind in one eye and found photography to be an outlet, now uses a digital Nikon camera, as opposed to the film cameras he used during Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial.
Having filled roughly 130 pages of notes during that trial, he is again among those taking copious notes, recording his observations in part to show his wife and in part to reflect on later.
"Not what people are saying -- we had a transcript for that," Mr. Leahy said, recalling that his notes on the Clinton trial often focused on his own impressions from the chamber. "Why did so-and-so ask this question? What was going on with that?"
Apart from curious spouses, there is also a recognition among many senators that history will crave a firsthand account from those who were there about what it was like when the Senate decided, for only the third time, whether to remove a sitting president from office.
"I'm glad to have those notes that I'm taking just for personal reference and, you know, for the trial and questioning, but then also because it is historical," said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa. "As much as we hate being here and going through this process, it is a point in history that we will want to reference in the future."

Texto completo: More than a year before the suspension of a Post reporter whose tweet referred to allegations against him, the paper's journalists complained about how the N.B.A. star was received.
The suspension of a Washington Post reporter who referred to a 2003 sexual assault charge against Kobe Bryant on Twitter in the hours after his death led to an uproar among the newspaper's staff members.
It wasn't the first time the N.B.A. star had been at the center of a debate at The Post.
On Monday, more than 300 newsroom employees signed a letter sharply critical of top editors who had placed the reporter, Felicia Sonmez, on administrative leave while they reviewed her social media activity. In an article that same day, Erik Wemple, a media columnist for The Post, called the suspension "misguided." On Tuesday, the newspaper announced that Ms. Sonmez had not violated The Post's social media guidelines and allowed her to go back to work.
The tension in the newsroom was partly about how the paper's journalists use social media. But it also concerned differing opinions of Mr. Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash Sunday along with eight others, including his daughter Gianna. Was the reputation of the man who led the Los Angeles Lakers to five championships irreparably tarnished by the 2003 allegations?
This week, journalists at The Post recalled an earlier time when a disagreement concerning Mr. Bryant had divided the newsroom. It happened in October 2018, when Mr. Bryant was given a welcome worthy of a V.I.P. at the paper's Franklin Square headquarters in downtown Washington.
He posed for photos with staff members. There were smiles and handshakes. Martin Baron, The Post's executive editor since 2013, chatted with him in the newsroom as a staff photographer captured the moment. Mr. Bryant was also granted an audience with the paper's White House reporters, who met with him in a conference room on the seventh floor. Journalists caught glimpses of the talk through the room's glass walls.
Mr. Bryant, who retired from basketball in 2016, also met with a sports reporter who had been working for months on a profile focused on his forays into new media ventures. He also sat for portrait photographs that illustrated the article when it was published the next month.
Before the story was assigned, Mr. Bryant called Mr. Baron and described his post-basketball career ambitions, according to a person with knowledge of the call. Mr. Baron later shared what they had discussed with a sports editor, the person said.
Shortly after Mr. Bryant's visit, Amy Brittain, one of The Post's investigative reporters who had broken the news of sexual misconduct allegations against the television anchor Charlie Rose, drafted a letter to Mr. Baron in Google Docs expressing her discomfort with what she described as the "spectacle" surrounding the N.B.A. star's newsroom appearance, according to an internal email that was reviewed by The New York Times.
Ms. Brittain, who did not reply to requests for comment, shared the Google Doc with others at the paper. More than 100 of her colleagues signed their names, according to two people with knowledge of the letter. But she ended up not sending it to Mr. Baron, opting to meet with him privately to share her concerns, a person with knowledge of the meeting said.
The Post declined to comment.
The contingent who was not pleased with the visit pointed to the 2003 case against Mr. Bryant, who was charged with felony sexual assault after an encounter with a 19-year-old front-desk clerk at a hotel near Vail, Colo. The criminal case was dropped in 2004. In a statement through his lawyer, Mr. Bryant said at the time that he believed the encounter was "consensual," but he added that he had come to understand that she did not see it the same way. The next year, Mr. Bryant reached a settlement with the accuser in a separate civil suit. The terms were not disclosed.
Mr. Bryant tried to rebuild his public image. But as his growing success on the court won him new fans, not everyone was ready to offer him the uncomplicated fan worship that attended star players like Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. When "Dear Basketball," an animated short produced by Mr. Bryant, was nominated for an Oscar in 2018, more than 17,000 people signed an online petition urging the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to rescind the nomination. The film went on to win an Oscar.
The activism against the film stemmed from the #MeToo movement, which was fueled, in part, by deeply reported articles from many publications, including The Post. A year before Mr. Bryant's newsroom visit, the paper had published an investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations against Roy Moore, the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice who was running for a United States Senate seat. Post reporters had also published articles on sexual misconduct allegations against other powerful men.
The tweet in the hours after Mr. Bryant's death from Ms. Sonmez, the Post reporter who was briefly suspended, included a link to a 2016 Daily Beast article on the 2003 case. Almost immediately, she found herself on the receiving end of online abuse, including death threats, at a time when tributes to Mr. Bryant poured in from President Trump, former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton and celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Whoopi Goldberg and Taylor Swift.
Hundreds of Ms. Sonmez's colleagues objected to the suspension the next day partly because, as stated in the letter to Mr. Baron and the managing editor, Tracy Grant, Ms. Sonmez's tweet was "a statement of fact." The Post's social media guidelines ask journalists to be informative and factual in their online posts.
Mr. Baron sent an email to Ms. Sonmez on Sunday telling her, "A real lack of judgment to tweet this. Please stop. You're hurting this institution by doing this." On Tuesday, the newspaper reversed course, saying in a statement that, after a review, it had concluded that Ms. Sonmez "was not in clear and direct violation of our social media policy."
The Post's statement also referred to her tweets as "ill-timed" and continued: "We consistently urge restraint, which is particularly important when there are tragic deaths."

Supporters Fear Gaps in Biden's Ground Game

Texto completo: Democratic officials and some activists for the candidate say Joe Biden's Iowa organization is weak in some areas, which could hurt him on caucus night. Biden aides say they have plenty of boots on the ground.
DUBUQUE, Iowa -- This city on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, which rose as a hub of furniture-making and brewing, ought to be a stronghold for Joseph R. Biden Jr. It is a blue-collar enclave with a Catholic heritage, aligning with his working class pitch to voters. Its 31-year-old, labor-connected congresswoman, Abby Finkenauer, has endorsed Mr. Biden.
But as Dan Corken, one of Mr. Biden's most fervent volunteers, knocks on doors here, he is dubious about the candidate's prospects just days out from Monday's caucuses.
"If you want to look at the Biden community in Dubuque, the average age is probably about 72," he said. "I'm having difficulties imagining some of the people I'm talking to door-knocking getting out on February 3 in the cold to go caucus."
As Mr. Corken approached the first house on a list of potential Biden backers on Tuesday, a volunteer for Bernie Sanders swooped in and planted two signs in the yard before Mr. Corken reached the door.
"We're all Bernie," a man at the door told Mr. Corken.
Caucuses are low-turnout affairs, making grass-roots organizing an essential factor for doing well in Iowa. Well-tooled campaigns depend on a paid field staff and armies of volunteers to identify supporters, ensure they turn out and provide leadership in the many school cafeterias and churches that serve as caucus rooms.
But according to nearly a dozen county Democratic chairs and Biden activists around the state, Mr. Biden's ground game has weak spots that threaten him with underperforming his polling in Iowa, where he has consistently been at or near the top.
With center-left Democrats increasingly alarmed about Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, becoming the nominee, an effort to coalesce around the strongest moderate alternative -- widely seen as Mr. Biden -- could suffer a blow if the former vice president finishes in third or fourth place, and emerges from Iowa in a weak position.
The age of many Biden supporters could also prove detrimental: In 2016 only 28 percent of caucusgoers were over 65, according to entrance polls. Close to four in 10 were under 45 and they strongly favored the insurgent outsider, Mr. Sanders.
Besides having supporters who skew older, the Biden campaign has fewer activists like Mr. Corken, according to Iowa Democrats. His campaign also appears to have recruited fewer precinct captains -- the team leaders in each of more than 1,600 caucus sites -- who play a key role wooing undecided voters.
Ann Fields, the Democratic chairwoman of Marion County, said that the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., had recruited caucus captains for all 17 precincts in her county southeast of Des Moines. Not so the Biden team. "I would say if they're half full they're lucky," she said last week.
In Des Moines County in eastern Iowa, Tom Courtney, the Democratic co-chairman, said last week he knew of "only a few" Biden precinct captains in his 16 precincts. Asked about the likelihood that a candidate's supporters would materialize on their own without an organizing staff, Mr. Courtney said, "I've not seen it before."
His wife, Nancy Courtney, who is a Biden activist, said there was a "slim chance" Mr. Biden wouldn't reach viability in some caucuses, meaning his support would fall below a 15 percent threshold needed to earn delegates.
"A lot of the campaigns have really good staffers and we only have one staffer in Des Moines County," she said. "That worries me."
Pete Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden's deputy campaign manager, said the candidate had plenty of staff members, both paid and volunteer, to turn out supporters.
"From the moment Vice President Biden announced his campaign, organizers and volunteers have been engaging Iowans in every corner of the state -- building a robust, grass-roots organization that will turn out our committed supporters on caucus night," he said. "We will have an Iowan as a precinct leader representing the campaign and making the case for Joe Biden in all of Iowa's 1,678 precincts."
Organizing is the secret sauce in a caucus election, though it usually gets little attention as each new poll is seized upon as a sign of who is winning the horse race. Experienced Iowa strategists say a good ground game lifts a candidate's support by two to three percentage points on caucus night.
While that may not sound like a lot, it helps explain some past caucus surprises, most recently in the 2016 race: Donald Trump, who led in Iowa polls by an average of 4.7 percentage points on caucus day, had a poor ground game and wound up second behind Ted Cruz, who had an extensive organizing effort.
A New York Times/Siena College poll last week showed Mr. Sanders at 25 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, with Mr. Buttigieg at 18, Mr. Biden at 17 and Ms. Warren at 15. Mr. Biden won among voters 65 and over, but Mr. Sanders was the favorite of those under 65.
A Monmouth University poll on Wednesday showed a different order for the same top four: Mr. Biden at 23 percent, followed by Mr. Sanders, 21; Mr. Buttigieg, 16; and Ms. Warren, 15. Senator Amy Klobuchar broke into double digits at 10 percent.
One of the crucial jobs of precinct captains is to win over backers of candidates who don't reach the 15 percent viability threshold, and who can realign for a second and final head-count behind candidates who are viable. That's a scenario that could be particularly crucial for Mr. Biden; if Ms. Klobuchar, for instance, doesn't reach 15 percent, Mr. Biden would seem to have a good chance to pick up caucusgoers looking for another centrist to support.
But if a candidate lacks a precinct captain in a given caucus, that process is immeasurably harder.
Mr. Corken, the Biden volunteer, will serve as a precinct captain in Dubuque, where he said 41 of the 45 precincts had Biden captains. A former high school and college basketball coach, Mr. Corken, 69, had never volunteered for a political campaign before Mr. Trump's election. His prod to activism was "born out of fear or maybe just anger," he said. He did not want to sit back and watch "what Trump was doing to the country, and now to the Constitution."
But as he walked between single-story houses on the city's west side, he confided his worry that candidates promising a revolution, like Mr. Sanders, are more likely to turn people out than a mainstream politician like Mr. Biden.
"The Biden supporters are like me," he said. "They believe we should turn the ship around, not scuttle the ship. Make the government work. Reach out to the Republicans."
At many doors, Democrats told him they were undecided, or didn't plan to caucus, or that they supported Mr. Trump. Bonnie Beacher, 62, was undecided.
"Is Biden a possibility?" Mr. Corken asked.
"Could be," Ms. Beacher said.
"May I just say, I think he can govern the country," Mr. Corken told her. "This is no time for amateurs. He'd walk in the first day and make the government work."
"All righty, thank you," said Ms. Beacher, who appeared eager to close the door.
Mr. Corken, who has canvassed Dubuque almost daily since the spring, said most Biden volunteers preferred to make phone calls, not trudge the city's hills. "I know we don't have as many door knockers as the other campaigns," he said. "Whatever the caucus results are, they're not going to be reflective of what the support for Biden is in this town."
Near the end of his route, he hit pay dirt. Tom Lange, who answered the door with his toddler son, said he was "pretty firmly entrenched with Biden" and would certainly attend his caucus.
Another Iowan, Sue Smith, a retiree, also said she was likely to support Mr. Biden. "He's been there, done some of it," she said.
Asked if she would caucus, Ms. Smith said, "Oh I don't know. When is it?"

Helicopter in Deadly Accident Lacked Terrain Safety System

Texto completo: The N.T.S.B. has long advised installing ground warning systems on helicopters, but the aircraft carrying Mr. Bryant did not have the voluntary system.
In 2004, a helicopter flying at night over the Gulf of Mexico plunged into the water, killing all 10 people on board. Had the aircraft been equipped with a system to warn the pilots of the impending impact, the crash could have been prevented, investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board determined.
The board urged federal regulators to require installation of the system on all helicopters. "It is well past time for the benefits from these standard safety devices to be made available to passengers on helicopter transports," the board's acting chairman said when announcing the recommendation in 2006.
Fourteen years later, use of the system is still voluntary. The helicopter that plowed into a fog-shrouded hillside near Calabasas, Calif., on Sunday, killing the retired basketball star Kobe Bryant and eight other people, was not outfitted with the system, known as a terrain awareness and warning system, or TAWS, said the N.T.S.B. board member Jennifer Homendy.
"Certainly, TAWS could have helped to provide information to the pilot on what terrain the pilot was flying in," Ms. Homendy said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The agency's investigator-in-charge, Bill English, cautioned that it was too early to know whether the lack of the warning system played any role in Sunday's crash.
TAWS can help prevent crashes, especially when pilots have limited visibility, by providing a detailed image of surrounding terrain and triggering auditory and visual warnings. The systems are required on many fixed-wing aircraft.
In a 2014 rule, the Federal Aviation Administration required air ambulance helicopters to install TAWS, but the mandate did not apply to commercial flights, such as the ones Mr. Bryant frequently took around the Los Angeles area. After the rule was issued, the N.T.S.B. closed its recommendation but said it considered the F.A.A. response "unacceptable."
Kurt Deetz, a pilot who said he flew Mr. Bryant during his previous job at Island Express Helicopters, which operated the helicopter involved in Sunday's crash, told The New York Times that the helicopter did have a less advanced collision-avoidance system embedded in its GPS. He said he did not think that the system recommended by the N.T.S.B. would have helped prevent the crash.
The terrain avoidance warning system cannot prevent a crash on its own. In March 2016, all four people aboard an air ambulance died when it crashed into trees near Enterprise, Ala., about one minute after picking up a patient from a car crash. The helicopter had been equipped with a terrain avoidance warning system, the N.T.S.B. found, but a series of other failures -- including pilot error, fog and mist -- led to the crash.
Gregory A. Feith, a former senior air safety investigator for the N.T.S.B., said that terrain warning systems can be helpful tools for pilots, but that they can also produce so many warnings that pilots stop paying attention.
"With what the pilot was doing with Kobe Bryant, it would be beneficial, but when you're following a highway with hills nearby, you get false warnings," said Mr. Feith, describing the scenario of Sunday's fatal flight. "And with false warnings, you tend to tune them out."
But Mr. Feith said pilots would always benefit from having a terrain warning system.
"This is a tool, one of many, that the pilot has to keep themselves out of harm's way," he said.
Kipp Lau, an air safety consultant who has worked with companies providing for-hire flights, said he had often encountered skepticism when suggesting installation of the N.T.S.B.-recommended system. Despite the safety advantages, he said, companies tend "to view it as a cost not required by regulation."
Mr. Lau said it was too early in the investigation to know whether the system could have helped avoid Sunday's crash.
Ms. Homendy also raised on Tuesday a second longstanding board recommendation that "the F.A.A. has failed to act on." After a 2005 crash, the N.T.S.B. recommended that all helicopters have a flight data recorder. Such a requirement, the board said, would not only help in determining causes of crashes but would also provide data that companies could use to proactively improve safety practices. As with the collision-warning system, the F.A.A. mandated use of recorders in a 2014 rule for air ambulances but left the devices optional for commercial flights.
The helicopter that crashed on Sunday with Mr. Bryant aboard, a Sikorsky S-76B, had neither a cockpit voice recorder nor a flight data recorder.
"That would have helped us significantly in this investigation and other investigations, and it's something we've recommended several times over a number of years," Ms. Homendy said.
Helicopters like the one in Sunday's crash are governed by a set of F.A.A. regulations that the N.T.S.B. has criticized as inadequate. Last year, the board listed the need to reform the rules covering so-called Part 135 aircraft -- a category covering many for-hire helicopter operations and some smaller airplanes -- on its "Most Wanted List" of proposed safety enhancements.
"Regardless of the purpose of the flight or the type of aircraft, all flights should be safe -- right now they may not be," notes a board fact sheet on the recommendation.
An F.A.A. spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday, and representatives for Island Express did not return voice mail messages.

Texto completo: A New York nonprofit called Childrens Community Services was raided by the authorities, officials said.
One company was supposedly based in a vacant house in New Jersey. Another company had no office; its address was a post office box inside a shipping store in Nassau County. A third operated out of a Harlem apartment.
The companies were all listed in paperwork as subcontractors for Childrens Community Services, a nonprofit that the city has paid about $ 500 million since 2017 to provide roughly 1,900 units for homeless people, including families with children.
Authorities believe that the nonprofit defrauded New York City through a network of at least six subcontractors that did not appear to provide the supplies and services listed on invoices, according to a lawsuit the city filed against the nonprofit on Wednesday. The fraud could be millions of dollars, but the lawsuit was not specific.
Two days earlier, federal prosecutors and investigators from the city Department of Investigation executed search warrants at the offices of Childrens Community Services and the addresses of the subcontractors.
Steven Banks, the city commissioner of social services, said the alleged fraud had no direct impact on the homeless served by the nonprofit.
Nonetheless, the city took the unusual step of asking a judge to place Childrens Community Services under receivership, seeking to take over the nonprofit's operations of 28 shelters, including 25 in commercial hotels.
The city would then seek other nonprofits to run the buildings and continue services. "We're seeking a remedy that the city has never sought before," Mr. Banks said.
One of the subcontractors, SASY Enterprises, is owned by Peter Weiser, and appeared to be connected to at least two other subcontractors.
"I have lots of comments about it. My lawyer told me not to speak to anyone," Mr. Weiser said.
SASY Enterprises, based in Lawrence, N.Y., was supposed to prepare so-called cluster apartments, which are private apartments used as shelters. The agreement between Childrens Community Services and SASY showed that SASY charged a fee for getting the apartments ready, and a 25 percent markup on gas and electric bills as well as on construction materials and furniture.
Another subcontractor, AZ Security Services, sold the nonprofit 301 computers for about $ 118,000, even though the company was only authorized to maintain computers, not supply them.
AZ Security Services listed an address at a post office box inside a Go Ship! store in Cedarhurst, a town bordering Lawrence.
"When DHS staff contacted AZ to inquire about computer purchases, the person answering the phone at AZ was unable to state where AZ's business operation was located," according to the lawsuit.
Mr. Weiser acknowledged to The New York Times that he was related to AZ Security. When asked if he was related to Ruth Mandelbaum, the chief operating officer of Childrens Community Services, he said he was not. Old court documents showed that Ms. Mandelbaum might have used the name Ricki Weiser.
Mr. Weiser called back twice to say he had misunderstood the questions and needed to retract his statements. "Everything I told you I take back. I'm sorry I didn't follow my lawyer's advice," he said.
Irregularities in the nonprofit's billing were first noticed by Department of Homeless Services staff in the spring of 2018; they saw that the nonprofit was hiring subcontractors without approval from the city, and were submitting questionable invoices.
Mr. Banks said the city had refused to pay the invoices connected to the dubious subcontractors and denied the nonprofit's application to run two new shelters.
The agency referred the matter to the Department of Investigation in May 2018, and put the nonprofit on a corrective action plan. But the homeless services agency could not simply terminate the contract and had to let the investigation play out, Mr. Banks said.
The lawsuit and search warrants come as Mayor Bill de Blasio and his administration are struggling to manage the city's homelessness crisis. Council members and advocates for homeless people have questioned why the mayor has not prioritized building low-income housing over opening new shelters and have chided the city for doing business with unscrupulous landlords and nonprofits.
Childrens Community Services is one of the city's newest and best-paid homeless services providers. The nonprofit began working for the city in 2014 by providing emergency operations of commercial hotels used as shelters and cluster housing.
By 2017, the city had awarded the nonprofit major contracts totaling nearly $ 700 million, fueling its growth: In 2017, the nonprofit listed assets of about $ 54 million; three years earlier, it listed $ 388,000 in its tax forms.
But less than a year into its new contract agreements, staff at the Homeless Services Department began noticing strange billing practices, as news reports swirled that questioned why the city would award a new nonprofit such large contracts.
In another example, AMX Distributors was supposed to supply appliances to cluster housing, but the invoices did not list the brand, make or model number of any of the items bought, according to the lawsuit.
In October 2019, the Department of Homeless Services asked for a price list from AMX, which was located inside a Harlem apartment and had no known warehouse. Instead, Childrens Community Services gave the city agency a price list created in an Excel spreadsheet "just minutes before CCS sent it to DHS."
"The price list contained numerous typographical errors, using words such as 'frezzer' and 'vynal,"' the city said in the lawsuit.
In another questionable billing practice, an invoice showed that Childrens Community Services had leased a 2018 Ford from a car dealership in Queens, but a check for about $ 38,000 was issued to Supreme Auto Leasing in Teaneck, which the city said had an address that belonged to a vacant house.
"I have no idea what you're talking about. This is a really strange phone call," said a man who answered the phone at a number listed for Supreme and identified himself as Steve Sherman.
Mr. Sherman said the address listed in the lawsuit is not a vacant building and "is a place of business."
A person answering the phone at the nonprofit's office in Jamaica, Queens, said she was directed to refer all questions to the Homeless Services Department. She said Thomas Bransky, the chief executive officer, and Ms. Mandelbaum were not in the office.

Texto completo: The review also found no "systemic ethics problem" in elite units like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy SEALs after allegations of sexual assault and unlawful killings.
America's special operations forces, like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy SEALs, have developed a problematic culture that overemphasizes combat "to the detriment of leadership, discipline and accountability," according to a sweeping review conducted by the military's Special Operations Command.
Time on the battlefield is seen as "the ultimate expression of competence," the review said, and those with combat experience "are held as almost an infallible standard bearer for the rest of the organization to emulate -- seemingly regardless if it is a positive or negative standard."
The review was ordered in response to a series of troubling episodes of misconduct involving special operations troops, including allegations of sexual assault and unlawful killings. It was begun in August, a month after the court-martial of a Navy SEAL platoon chief, Edward Gallagher, on charges of murdering a captive and other war crimes, a case that attracted national attention and ended in acquittal on all but a minor charge.
Mr. Gallagher, a decorated combat veteran, was reported to Navy investigators by members of his platoon, who described him as appearing obsessed with killing during a 2017 deployment in Iraq. He denied any wrongdoing. Now retired from the Navy, Mr. Gallagher lashed out at his accusers this week in a video posted on social media.
The Special Operations Command's review found no "systemic ethics problem" in its forces, which include elite units from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. But it found "remarkable similarity" in the cultural issues it uncovered across the command, from entry-level trainees to elite counterterror units like Delta Force and SEAL Team 6.
The American military has greatly expanded its special forces since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and has come to rely heavily on them in conflicts around the world; they were used in more than 90 countries last year. That may be too many, according to the report, which recommends a start-from-scratch review of all deployments.
Missions by special forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, the report says, often boil down to little more than "raids" -- assaulting targets and killing enemy fighters -- which some operators bluntly refer to as "kicking in doors and shooting people in the face."
Eighteen years of such missions, the report says, have diverted attention from the other specialized challenges the special forces are meant to tackle and the skills they require. And a tendency to split up units in the field to conduct missions leads to troops operating far from the commanders who supervise them.
The frequent deployments have also bred problems in the training and career pipeline, from raw recruits up through the leadership ranks, the report says: an overemphasis on physical fitness and workouts for trainees, and an overemphasis on weapons and tactics among field leaders, often to the detriment of training in leadership and ethical standards.
Trainees who enter the elite forces directly from civilian life, rather than transferring in, are most at risk for developing "an unhealthy sense of entitlement" that could lead to problems later on, the authors found. Instructors chosen for their combat prowess may lack the "appropriate balance of character and competence" needed for the job.
This review follows congressionally mandated studies of the Special Operations Command's culture and accountability in 2018, and its ethics in 2019 -- studies whose recommendations have not been fully implemented, the report says.
Mr. Gallagher, 40, retired from the Navy soon after President Trump blocked SEAL commanders from kicking him out of the elite commando force. Since then he has been endorsing products and has met with Mr. Trump. But media reports continued to focus on his case, including an episode of "The Weekly," produced by The New York Times, that was released in late December.
In response, a three-minute video posted on Monday on his Facebook and Instagram pages assails his accusers as liars and cowards, identifying five of them by name, rank and duty assignment and labeling them with insulting nicknames.
Mr. Gallagher's video includes photos of the SEALs, including one now assigned to SEAL Team 6. It also highlights the name and photo of the lead Naval Criminal Investigative Service agent on his case.
"Even though I went to trial and exposed all the lies that were said about me by certain cowards in my platoon and found not guilty, there are those to this day who refuse to accept that fact," Mr. Gallagher says in the video. "I wanted to put this all behind me and move on with my life. Unfortunately, the fight to clear my name is not over. The truth has never been truly exposed about what really happened. You may think you know, but you have no idea. For those who have, and continue to slander my name, the truth is coming."
Mr. Gallagher's video was not the first time his accusers were identified publicly; they were named in news reports during the trial and were seen in excerpts from Navy investigative videos published by The Times in December.
But the SEALs, reached by phone on Wednesday, said they were concerned that Mr. Gallagher had highlighted them in his video. They said they had received many messages from comrades expressing dismay that a former fellow SEAL would try to unmask them, potentially jeopardizing future missions.
Timothy Parlatore, Mr. Gallagher's lawyer, said the video was "a direct response to the New York Times video," and said his client was "not going to be silent" about news coverage he felt was "knowingly false."
In addition to posting the video, Mr. Gallagher also gave a three-hour interview to the podcast "Cleared Hot," hosted by another former SEAL, Andy Stumpf. In it, Mr. Gallagher spoke of feeling abandoned by his command when he was arrested, and said that SEALs in his platoon had made false accusations about him because they could not meet his standards.

Talk of Milk Industry Merger Draws Justice Dept. Scrutiny

Texto completo: Antitrust officials have been investigating a potential merger of the struggling milk giant Dean Foods with Dairy Farmers of America, a marketing cooperative.
When the struggling milk giant Dean Foods filed for bankruptcy protection in November, it also announced a possible path forward -- a takeover by Dairy Farmers of America, a marketing cooperative.
But the news that Dean Foods was in "advanced discussions" with the co-op did little to alleviate the concerns of dairy farmers. Many argued that a merger would reduce competition and suppress the price of raw milk, especially in regions where industry consolidation has made it difficult for farmers to stay in business.
Now, federal investigators are examining those concerns. Since at least December, antitrust officials at the Justice Department have been scrutinizing the potential Dean Foods merger, speaking with farmers and the lawyers who represent them about how a deal would affect milk pricing and competition, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with people familiar with the inquiry.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation. But this month, a department lawyer sent an email to farmers who sell raw milk to Dean Foods, asking to discuss the possible merger over the phone.
"We are investigating Dairy Farmers of America's potential acquisition of Dean Foods and the potential loss of competition for selling raw milk," the email said, according to a copy reviewed by The Times.
The lawyer, Nate Harris, planned to ask the dairy farmers how they came to work with Dean Foods and whether they would have options to sell their milk elsewhere if Dairy Farmers of America acquired the company, according to Dana A. Zakarian, a lawyer representing a group of dairy farmers in a lawsuit against the cooperative in Vermont. Mr. Zakarian said he had discussed the email with Mr. Harris after one of his clients received it.
The existence of the email was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States, was founded to help small farmers market their raw milk to dairy processing companies like Dean Foods, which prepare milk for distribution to retailers.
Over the years, however, the co-op has also invested heavily in processing, meaning it buys some of the raw milk that its marketing branch sells. Those investments have created a conflict of interest, some dairy farmers argue, because processors benefit from lower milk prices, while farmers benefit from higher ones. A deal to acquire Dean Foods would significantly expand the co-op's processing operations, heightening that conflict of interest, critics of the potential merger say.
Monica Massey, the executive vice president at Dairy Farmers of America, said the co-op had spoken with the Justice Department to "keep them apprised" of its thinking. A takeover deal with Dean Foods would require approval from the bankruptcy court as well as federal regulators.
"We have not reached an agreement with Dean Foods for its assets, so it may be premature, but the Justice Department has a job to do," Ms. Massey said. "If we reach a deal, we would fully cooperate with D.O.J. officials as we have with past transactions."
The Justice Department appears to have been monitoring the situation since the early stages of the Dean Foods bankruptcy proceeding, when department lawyers filed notices of appearance in the case, effectively declaring that the government had an interest in the outcome. A spokeswoman for Dean Foods declined to comment.
On Dec. 20, an antitrust official at the Justice Department, Karl Knutsen, called Mr. Zakarian and Joel G. Beckman, another lawyer working on the Dairy Farmers of America lawsuit in Vermont, asking them to waive a confidentiality provision to allow investigators to read depositions and other documents in the case.
The Vermont suit alleges that Dairy Farmers of America has engaged in a wide range of anticompetitive practices over the years, striking deals with other co-ops not to poach one another's members and sharing milk-pricing information to suppress payments to farmers.
Dairy Farmers of America has denied those allegations. But in September, the judge overseeing the case allowed it to move to a trial, writing in her decision that the plaintiffs had presented evidence from which a "rational jury could conclude that the D.F.A. management favored growth of its commercial operations and empire building over the interests of its farmer-members."
The Justice Department's apparent interest in the Vermont case might indicate that government lawyers are weighing a broader investigation into Dairy Farmers of America's practices that would go beyond the possible merger with Dean Foods, said Peter Carstensen, a former antitrust lawyer at the Justice Department.
"They're really focusing in on the impact on farmers and how this kind of transaction could greatly increase the capacity of D.F.A. to engage in anticompetitive practices," Mr. Carstensen said. And that line of inquiry could lead government investigators to "take a much more critical look at the way D.F.A. is using its existing market positions and think about whether there are workable remedies for that conduct."
Not all dairy farmers oppose the potential merger. Some argue that it would help farmers because it would guarantee a stable market for their milk at a time when milk consumption is declining nationwide.
"If markets are in trouble, any deal would be beneficial to our dairy farmers," said Ms. Massey, the co-op's vice president.
For now, however, there is still no official proposal for a deal. Dean Foods has said it would consider other buyers. And after the company's bankruptcy filing, bondholders raised concerns about a sale to Dairy Farmers of America, citing the possibility of a lengthy antitrust investigation.

Texto completo: Readers decry the secretary of state's outburst, and one says the president, "in celebrating and congratulating him for it," behaved even worse.
To the Editor:
Re "Pompeo Fumes at Reporter's Questions on Ukraine" (news article, Jan. 26):
So, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo does not like a question asked by a respected NPR reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, ends the interview, shouts and curses at Ms. Kelly, asks her to find Ukraine on an unlabeled world map (which she does) and subsequently calls the news media "unhinged." Really?
Given Mr. Pompeo's behavior, one has to wonder, Who is really unhinged? Mr. Pompeo, please look in the mirror and ask yourself, What has become of me, an evangelical Christian, serving and covering for an amoral and lying president and screaming and cursing at a well-respected reporter who is simply doing her job?
Michael Hadjiargyrou
Centerport, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Mike Pompeo should give his unlabeled map to President Trump (as he did to Mary Louise Kelly of NPR). Let's see if Mr. Trump knows where Ukraine is. Ms. Kelly did.
Barry Goldberg
White Plains, N.Y.
To the Editor:
In celebrating Mike Pompeo's shameful treatment of an NPR reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, Donald Trump has reached a new low. It seems that Mr. Trump has no sense of shame or decency. He sees himself in a world without rules, without right and wrong, where the strong oppress the weak as a matter of course, and where they celebrate it and feel good about it. Mr. Pompeo's behavior was that of a bully and a coward, but Mr. Trump's, in celebrating and congratulating him for it, is even worse.
How has it come to this? What have we done, as a people, as a country, in electing such a person? Republicans and supporters of the president should be ashamed. The remedy is, as everyone keeps saying, at the ballot box, but the remedy is also in decent people everywhere standing up and denouncing this behavior for what it is: thuggish, shameful and un-American.
Tim Shaw

To the Editor:
Re "Let the Press Do Its Job," by Mary Louise Kelly (Op-Ed, Jan. 29):
No surprise that Ms. Kelly works for NPR. Her opinion piece was so classy. No ugly put-downs, just the facts of what occurred during her interviews with Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, and Mike Pompeo. Thank you, Ms. Kelly.

Texto completo: Joe Biden will deliver a speech on Thursday forcefully rebuking the president, whose allies in Congress have increasingly set their sights on the former vice president.
DES MOINES -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., after coming under assault at the impeachment trial, plans on Thursday to offer a forceful rebuke of President Trump that will double as a closing message ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Monday.
Mr. Biden, who faces a close and fluid race in the leadoff caucus state, will deliver a speech in Waukee, a suburb of Des Moines, in an urgent late-stage effort to focus Democrats on the question of which candidate can defeat Mr. Trump. The speech will also serve as a pre-emptive rebuttal to a rally that Mr. Trump is holding in Des Moines later on Thursday, capping a week in which the president's legal team tried to train attention on Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, at the impeachment trial.
The Biden campaign will also start airing a new 60-second television ad in Iowa that begins with images of the White House and the Oval Office. "It's said," a narrator declares, "in here your character is revealed."
"We saw it with President Obama," the narrator says. "We're seeing it with President Trump."
The ad and Mr. Biden's speech -- which is not expected to discuss details of the impeachment trial, but will contrast the candidate with the president -- come against a backdrop of mounting tensions between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump's allies in Congress. On Monday, Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, suggested that the scrutiny of Mr. Biden and his son at the impeachment trial would hurt Mr. Biden at the caucuses.
And on Tuesday, Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, released a television ad to be aired in Iowa that baselessly accuses Mr. Biden of corruption, echoing Mr. Trump's unfounded attacks on the former vice president.
Mr. Biden has spent the past two days citing Ms. Ernst's remarks, fund-raising off them and releasing a digital ad on Tuesday. At a campaign event in Sioux City, Iowa, on Wednesday, Mr. Biden pointed to Mr. Scott's ad as further evidence that Republicans were trying to derail his candidacy.
"A senator from Florida, sitting in Washington, has decided to start running negative ads against Joe Biden just days before the Iowa caucus," Mr. Biden said. "What do you think that's about?"
He then laughed.
"Look, it's simple," he continued. "They're smearing me to try to stop me, and they know if I'm the nominee, I'm going to beat Donald Trump like a drum."
The Biden campaign has long hoped that, in the final days before the caucuses, Iowans will grow more intensely attuned to arguments about electability. In recent weeks, Mr. Biden's own argument on that front has been squeezed, especially by Senator Amy Klobuchar, a moderate Minnesota Democrat, as well as by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a democratic socialist who has gained traction in the race, as the Biden campaign has privately acknowledged to donors.
In the speech, his campaign said, Mr. Biden plans to remind voters that Mr. Trump must be defeated in order to make progress on issues like health care, gun violence, climate change and how America is viewed on the world stage. And he will speak about the nature of the country, as he has done on the campaign trail this week in Iowa, where he has repeatedly declared that "character is on the ballot."

Texto completo: Readers analyze the defense arguments and the debate over witnesses. One muses how senators might vote differently if it were a secret ballot.
To the Editor:
Re "G.O.P. Scrambling to Collect Votes to Bar Witnesses" (front page, Jan. 29):
I have listened to the presentations by both sides in the impeachment trial. As a lawyer, I am perplexed by President Trump's defense.
First, most legal scholars agree that impeachment does not require a crime, despite arguments otherwise by Mr. Trump's lawyers. Second, a Ukrainian investigation of Joe Biden and his son has already been conducted, with no finding of misconduct on the part of either of them. Third, how is the Mueller investigation relevant to the impeachment case against Mr. Trump?
Linda Sayler
Oakland, Calif.
To the Editor:
President Trump's attorneys have argued that it is inappropriate to impeach Mr. Trump so close to an election. Whether or not Mr. Trump remains in office is, so they say, a decision that should be reserved to the people and not to the Senate.
For the people to make an informed decision in November, we are entitled to hear all relevant information. If the president's team truly believes that this matter is best decided by the people, it should have no objection to the people hearing from all relevant witnesses and seeing all relevant documents.
I want to hear from Mike Pompeo, Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani under oath. They deserve their chance to explain why Mr. Trump did or did not engage in the actions of which he is accused.

To the Editor:
Re "The Method in John Bolton's Madness," by Jonathan Stevenson (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 28):
Let's not put lipstick on a pig. The reason for John Bolton's sudden "sense of patriotic duty" is revenge, pure and simple. He was ousted by President Trump and he never got over it. Who will trust him now?
Antonia Tamplin
Bronx
To the Editor:
One aspect of both the Nixon and Trump impeachment processes has become more and more obvious: the importance of a free press in the defense of democracy. The Times's revelation this weekend that John Bolton in his book corroborates the House charge of a quid pro quo may be redirecting the arc of the impeachment trial.
Without the pressure from our free press, Republican senators would easily have ended the trial without additional documents and witnesses. The recent disclosures in this newspaper force senators to rethink their position ... a potential game-changer.
Ellen Silverman Popper
Whitestone, Queens
To the Editor:
When I read about Derek Jeter's election to the Baseball Hall of Fame, amid controversy over the single anonymous vote against him and whether the ballot should remain secret, I was wondering about the upcoming vote at our president's trial.
What if the vote in the Senate were secret? Clearly having an open vote on all government matters creates a transparent environment critical for a healthy democracy. But who could have foreseen that senators would put self-interest (re-election) and party loyalty (re-election) ahead of the moral and ethical ideals they are supposed to uphold?
If President Trump's fate were being decided by a secret ballot, would we have the farcical event going on today?

Texto completo: Jim Sanborn, an artist who created Kryptos, a cryptographic puzzle that has stumped enthusiasts for three decades, emailed me this month with a hint.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The email arrived on Jan. 2. Three words: "Are you ready?"
I was.
The email was from Jim Sanborn, a sculptor whose work I have written about for more than 20 years.
Some names show up in your inbox and it feels as if you've gotten a jolt. That's how I feel whenever I hear from Jim. I'm not an art critic. But I have written about computer security and encryption at various stages of my career, and Mr. Sanborn created a cryptographic puzzle that has stumped enthusiasts for decades. It is a sculpture at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., called Kryptos. (The name, from the Greek, means "hidden.")
The sculpture, which contains four encoded passages cut into a tall sheet of wave-shaped copper, has been an obsession for thousands of people around the world. I've had a relationship of sorts with this work of art since I first wrote about it in 1999, when I was a tech reporter for The Washington Post. I joined The Times as a reporter in 2000, and these days I cover climate.
The first time I wrote about Kryptos, I reported that two people had said they had solved the mysteries of the first three encoded passages. (Later, the National Security Agency would reveal that its employees had cracked the code somewhat earlier, but didn't announce it because the N.S.A. doesn't talk about anything.)
For my Post article, I visited C.I.A. headquarters and saw the moving, oddly powerful work, which sits in a courtyard near the cafeteria in an area not open to the public. (I stopped in the gift shop on my way out, and bought a C.I.A. T-shirt. How could I not? But it turned out to be scratchy, so I don't wear it.)
In 1999, when I first reported on Kryptos, it seemed that with three of the passages from the sculpture decoded, the fourth would be cracked pretty quickly.
Ha.
Twenty years later, and 30 years after the sculpture first appeared at C.I.A. headquarters, the secret of those last 97 characters remains as solid as the log of petrified wood that makes up part of the work.
Over time, Mr. Sanborn has tried to provide clues that could move people along, since he has been hounded by people who believe, mistakenly, that they have cracked the last passage, known as K4. He was getting 200 inquiries a week, he told me, which "became overwhelming and some became threatening and even, believe it or not, racist." For $ 50, people could submit a proposed solution and get an answer, which "made things much more manageable," he said.
He provided a clue to me in 2010 that we published in The New York Times. And again in 2014. And now.
He called me in late 2019 to suggest he might be about to release another clue, to move things along. At a recent gathering of Kryptos fans, he had said he wanted me to take it on. I said yes, of course.
I love Mr. Sanborn's work. When I stumbled upon one of his unmistakable pieces on the campus of the University of Iowa, a metal cylinder with punched-through letters in many languages that is lit from within at night, casting text on the courtyard and walls around it, it seemed so instantly familiar that I felt as if I were encountering an old friend in a strange town.
But Kryptos, his decades-old piece, has become something of a millstone for him, he said. "My cryptography interest left me 25 years ago," he told me as I was finishing the latest article. "My art went in different directions." That's an understatement. While he has produced other cryptographic pieces, he has also produced astonishing installations that straddle art and science, and, most recently, "Without Provenance: The Making of Contemporary Antiquity," a collection of objects that explores the nature of looted antiquities and forgery in unsettling ways.
Perhaps the most interesting part of my call from Mr. Sanborn is his decision to arrange an auction to sell the solution to the mystery, whether after his death or before. If the amount of money raised is substantial -- and this, he admits, is unknown -- it will go to support climate science. He lives on an island in the Chesapeake Bay, so as he told me, it was a "no-brainer." Coincidentally, this put the Kryptos news within my current beat.
As I was worked on the story about the final clue, my editor, Hannah Fairfield, liked the graphics possibilities of portraying the coded and decoded passages; Jonathan Corum, the amazing science graphics editor, agreed to do his magic. And you can see the result.
Much of the time, journalism is jack rabbit quick, with the need to leap when news breaks.
Sometimes it's slow, and things can percolate. And sometimes it even helps us solve a puzzle.

Medicare for All is Superior to Public Option

Texto completo: I agree with Lanhee J. Chen ("The Myth of the 'Moderate' Public Option," op-ed, Jan. 24). The notion that a public option is a moderate and therefore less destructive approach to health-care reform than a universal health-care system is false. The only efficient reform would be Medicare for All.
A public option would increase premiums for those with major illnesses. Private insurers would siphon away healthier persons from the general insurance pool by offering inexpensive but noncomprehensive plans, plans designed to appeal to those with few medical needs.
In addition, multiple-payer systems with or without a public option would perpetuate exorbitant administrative costs. For example, in 2018 Canada's single-payer system spent $196 per person on hospital administrative costs; the U.S., $933. A single-payer system, unlike multiple-payer systems, has the power to negotiate volume discounts with the pharmaceutical and durable-medical-equipment industries.
A public option added to the current hodgepodge of private plans would be more likely to increase the overall cost of health care rather than to improve either its quality or its distribution. Only a single-payer system will truly save money. Do the math. Unexpected bills from out-of-network consultants? Gone. Exorbitant bills for generic drugs? Gone. Obviously, in a universal system added beneficiaries will bring added cost. However, in the long run these expenditures would be more than balanced by savings. This notion is confirmed by a comprehensive cost analysis of New York Health, the single-payer system now under consideration by the state's legislature.
I agree with Lahnee Chen's premise. We need a more universal resolution of the problem.

---
The myth pushed, most notably by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman during the debate over ObamaCare, citing the Veterans Affairs system as evidence that the federal government had a comparative advantage over the private sector in quality and cost of health-care services, was exposed by subsequent scandals. Yet politicians continue to push the myth of the government's comparative advantage in providing health insurance.
No U.S. government health-insurance entity has ever been run on an actuarially sound basis. Armed with opaque tax, regulatory and capital subsidies, politicians and their "mission" regulators direct them to underprice risk, particularly for infrequent catastrophic events, driving out private competitors. The government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac essentially provided insurance for catastrophic mortgage credit losses. When they failed in 2008, politicians and regulators argued that "nobody could have seen that coming," followed by a bailout because "there were no private competitors."
The pretense of public "insurance" makes the public cost of subsidies opaque: good politics but bad policy. Fifty-five years of political tinkering has produced a noxious Rube Goldberg contraption in desperate need of creative destruction.

New phase in Senate proceedings changes Roberts's role

Texto completo: Chief justice faces largely uncharted territory, even about his powers

After marathon days of mostly listening, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. finally spoke at length Wednesday during the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. Almost none of the words were his own.
Roberts spent hours reading questions " or statements disguised as questions " that came from senators and were directed to the House impeachment managers and members of Trump's defense team. Under Senate rules, inquiries must be written and passed through the chief justice.
He read them without any display of partiality or emotion, even when they were designed to make pointed attacks on the president or impugn the motives of House Democrats. He even read questions relating to his own powers, or Supreme Court precedent, without giving any indication of what he thought the answer should be.
Wednesday marked a new phase of the impeachment inquiry, one more likely to reveal what Roberts believes it means for the chief justice of the United States to 'preside' over an impeachment trial of the president. He displayed no inclination to play a more active role.
It is largely uncharted territory " only two chief justices in the nation's history have been put in such a position. There is disagreement among those who have studied impeachment over such basic questions as whether he can break a tie vote, much less call witnesses on his own volition.
Roberts has been 'less of a force than some people expected or hoped for,' said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who is an expert on impeachment and testified for congressional Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry.
Things could change. 'This is the part where Roberts the judge will come into play,' Gerhardt said.
So far, Roberts has been more like a substitute teacher. He leads the Senate in the Pledge of Allegiance, takes his cues from the body's leaders about schedule and somewhat reluctantly wields the small, hourglass shaped ivory gavel that comes with presiding over the Senate. (He doesn't use one when he's at the Supreme Court.)
'So far, I think he has failed to ensure an impartial, fair trial,' said Brian Fallon, executive director of the liberal organization Demand Justice. He said Roberts could have done more to maintain decorum in the chamber, where some senators folded paper airplanes and fussed with fidget-spinners as House managers took turns at a marathon presentation.
'There was no effort to enforce the Senate's own rules' on decorum, Fallon said.
Roberts's only substantive intervention came in the early morning hours of the first day, when he criticized both the House managers and Trump's lawyers for overheated rhetoric as the Senate debated how the process should proceed.
'I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and president's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body,' Roberts said. The rebuke was reportedly prompted by a complaint from Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has become a focus ahead of a vote on whether to call additional witnesses.
Some have criticized Roberts for not policing the presentations of the lawyers for inaccuracies or overblown statements. Some Democrats, for instance, have said Roberts should have challenged assertions from Trump's lawyers that the House managers have presented no 'evidence' of the president's wrongdoing.
Fallon alluded to Roberts's well-known metaphor for a judge's impartiality. 'To be an umpire, you have to call balls and strikes,' he said.
Fallon said a poll conducted for his organization showed 67-percent of respondents said Roberts has an obligation to ensure the rules of the impeachment trial are fair, rather than leaving it to the Senate. They also want witnesses to be called.
On Wednesday, Roberts continued to play it straight. He quietly turned down a question from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) that might have named the alleged whistleblower in the case, but he otherwise did not question premises or point out what might be inaccuracies.
One question he read, directed to the House managers, concerned his own power.
'Some have claimed that subpoenaing witnesses or documents would unnecessarily prolong this trial. Isn't it true that depositions of the three witnesses in the [President Bill] Clinton trial were completed in only one day each? And isn't it true that the chief justice, as presiding officer in this trial, has the authority to resolve any claims of privilege or other witness issues without any delay?'
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) replied: 'Mr. Chief Justice, the answer is yes.'
Actually, the answer is disputed, at least the part about the chief justice. One of Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said the idea that the presiding officer could on his own make such decisions would be 'quite a step.'
Other questions from senators seemed almost designed to put into the chief justice's mouth the most explosive charges about former vice president Joe Biden, his son Hunter or some of the most controversial comments from Trump.
Reading one question from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) meant that Roberts repeated a line from a 2005 tape in which Trump talked about grabbing women by the genitals. ' 'When you're a star, they let you do it,' ' said Roberts, by way of Harris, who was quoting Trump's remarks.
The liberals who have criticized Roberts also realize he might be their best hope of prolonging the impeachment trial " by subpoenaing documents and witnesses " in a Republican-majority Senate where many have said they have heard enough.
In an opinion piece in the New York Times, former Obama acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, Georgetown law professor Joshua Geltzer and former congressman Mickey Edwards argued that Roberts on his own could make such decisions.
'This isn't a matter of Democrats needing four 'moderate' Republicans to vote for subpoenas and witnesses, as the Trump lawyers have been claiming,' the trio wrote. 'Rather, the impeachment rules, like all trial systems, put a large thumb on the scale of issuing subpoenas and place that power within the authority of the judge, in this case the chief justice.'
That view is an outlier, though. If an agreement on subpoenas cannot be reached in negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Democratic leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y), there is an open question about Roberts's power if the issue comes to the floor in the form of a motion from Democrats.
The Constitution says that in presidential impeachment proceedings, the chief justice presides over the Senate, a role that usually is filled by the vice president. Walter Dellinger, a longtime Supreme Court advocate and official in the Clinton Justice Department, said that means the chief justice has the power to break ties, just as the vice president normally does.
'If the Senate was split 50-50, it would be incumbent on the presiding officer to decide,' Dellinger said.
Gerhardt and others disagree, saying the Senate would have to specifically give the chief justice such a power. The question never arose for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist during Clinton's impeachment trial.
Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase did break two ties during the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson. But Gerhardt said Senate rules were different, as was Chase's activist view of his role.
'Chase had the [Senate] rule, and Chase had the chutzpah,' Gerhardt said.
Most said Roberts's definition of impartiality means deferring to the Senate, even on a motion that would fail if the members are evenly divided.
'If there is a tie vote, I will bet the farm that Roberts will not vote,' Alan Frumin, the Senate's former parliamentarian, said on CNN.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said he will propose on Friday a new rule requiring the chief justice to subpoena documents and witnesses he determines relevant to impeachment, and to rule on all issues of evidence, including executive privilege. Trump's attorneys made clear they would not agree to such a move.
Caroline Fredrickson, former president of the liberal American Constitution Society, said it would make a difference if Roberts made decisions, and then left it to the Senate about whether to overrule him.
For some Republican senators, 'especially those facing difficult reelection campaigns, voting to overturn a decision by the chief justice might be a daunting prospect " and rightfully so,' Frederickson wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post.

Texto completo: The League of Women Voters of Santa Fe County lost a good friend and ally in former New Mexican Editor Rob Dean ("Rob Dean: A journalist, a friend, an inspiration," Commentary, Jan. 12). He shared our vision of educating and empowering voters, so he approved a partnership with us to produce and distribute nonpartisan voter guides to all New Mexican subscribers, to libraries and schools, and even to the people waiting in line at the polling places.Rob was a gentleman who believed in respectful dialogue and collaboration. He listened, he led with integrity, and he told truth to power with kindness and humor.
During Rob's tenure as editor, The New Mexican published an iconic editorial about the work of the League of Women Voters titled, "In league with the angels." And now Rob is one of them.

Forever tainted
The Democrats present evidence while the Republican defense team presents specious process arguments and feign high-minded indignation as to the impropriety of bringing impeachment proceedings against its dear leader ("Dems make their case against the president," Jan. 23).
Before holding high office, President Donald Trump had spent his adult life in the fast and loose, Wild West world of New York real estate, so naturally he believes he is above the law in all arenas where money and power can be used as a shield as well as a cudgel.
This Senate trial disabuses him of that notion. Even if the 53 Senate Republicans continue to look the other way - very much like those three monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil and, in this instance, speak no truth to power - Trump and his complicit enablers will be forever tainted and reviled in the court of history and justly so.

Stand up for birth control
Seeing all the photos and reading about all the anti-abortion activists recently ("Standing against abortion," Jan. 23), there doesn't seem to be one word about prevention, i.e., birth control. It seems to me that preventing conception is a better solution than marching (the majority of marchers being men!). It has been a number of years since there has been any discourse of any kind for birth control.

Earned entitlements
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the meaning of the word "entitlement" is, "Something that you have a right to do or have." That is why I strenuously object to the GOP's use of the word "entitlement" in regards to Social Security and Medicare and various newspapers' use of that word in the headline of a story that first ran in the New York Times ("President opens door to entitlement program cuts," Jan. 23).
We retired five years ago after 45 years of paying into Social Security. That money came from our hard work, taxes we paid and still pay, and the belief that the U.S. government would honor our contribution. Let's not perpetuate the myth that these programs are unearned handouts. They are ours. We have earned them.

World is watching
Our elected officials took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and I expect all of our U.S. senators to support and conduct a fair and transparent impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Truth should outweigh personal opinion and party loyalty, so knowledgeable witnesses should be called to testify. The world is watching, and no one is above the law of the land.

Serious trial requires witnesses Senate should hear testimony

Resumen: Throughout their defense of the president, Sekulow and other members of the White House legal team, have repeatedly referred to statements of witnesses from the House impeachment hearings as well as other venues to make their case that the complaints about the president’s actions in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amount to policy differences, not executive wrongdoing. [...]the Senate, the forum that Trump co-counsel Kenneth Starr said has "a special responsibility" as "the world’s greatest deliberative body" to act as "a court," has not heard from those witnesses, nor had the opportunity to question or challenge them. [...]in the Senate impeachment trial, the most glaring omission of all — the one that offers the best hope of determining whether the issue at stake is, as the president’s team would characterize it, a policy dispute or, as the House managers claim, presidential abuse of power — is the appearance of witnesses who were "in the room" when certain decisions were made.

Texto completo: In remarks bringing to a close the Republicans’ defense of President Donald Trump against impeachment, President Donald Trump’s attoreny Jay Sekulow offered this telling question: "Are you going to allow proceedings on impeachment to go from a New York Times report about someone that says what they hear is in a manuscript?"
Of course, no serious, consequential inquiry into the behavior of a president or any other person should be based on such a loose framework. That’s precisely why the Senate ought to be calling witnesses as part of its impeachment inquiry, beginning with former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book "The Room Where It Happened" was the subject of Sekulow’s question.
Nor is Bolton the only witness the Senate should be putting under oath and cross examining. Throughout their defense of the president, Sekulow and other members of the White House legal team, have repeatedly referred to statements of witnesses from the House impeachment hearings as well as other venues to make their case that the complaints about the president’s actions in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amount to policy differences, not executive wrongdoing. But the Senate, the forum that Trump co-counsel Kenneth Starr said has "a special responsibility" as "the world’s greatest deliberative body" to act as "a court," has not heard from those witnesses, nor had the opportunity to question or challenge them.
That is an unfortunate abdication of the body’s responsibilities.
No one can doubt that presidential impeachment, embedded though it is in the United States Constitution, is as much a political as a legal process. It has been so during each of the previous impeachments, including that of the openly abusive Andrew Johnson and the near-impeachment of Richard Nixon. But it is nonetheless a process with tremendous consequences. It ought to be taken seriously and cannot be taken seriously if the "evidence" on which it is based comes entirely from from documents — official or otherwise — social media posts, news reports and disputed interpretations of people’s words.
Indeed, in his remarks, Sekulow specifically described the role of the House managers as to present "selective" evidence supporting their claim. Then, he said, it is the defense team’s responsibility to present "a fuller view" to fill in "what we thought were the glaring omissions" in the House case. And yet, in the Senate impeachment trial, the most glaring omission of all — the one that offers the best hope of determining whether the issue at stake is, as the president’s team would characterize it, a policy dispute or, as the House managers claim, presidential abuse of power — is the appearance of witnesses who were "in the room" when certain decisions were made.
The president’s defenders have warned against the frivolous initiation of efforts to remove a president, and we share their concern. But it’s also true that once undertaken, an impeachment is serious business, and to dismiss it as otherwise threatens to assure that no future impeachment will ever be taken seriously, however justifiable, as long as the subject of the proceedings can build a strong and loyal coalition.
That, too, is an ominous consideration for our democracy. The Senate should not be dawdling over whether to call witnesses, but hastening to get them scheduled.

Resumen: Throughout their defense of the president, Sekulow and other members of the White House legal team, have repeatedly referred to statements of witnesses from the House impeachment hearings as well as other venues to make their case that the complaints about the president’s actions in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amount to policy differences, not executive wrongdoing. [...]the Senate, the forum that Trump co-counsel Kenneth Starr said has "a special responsibility" as "the world’s greatest deliberative body" to act as "a court," has not heard from those witnesses, nor had the opportunity to question or challenge them. [...]in the Senate impeachment trial, the most glaring omission of all — the one that offers the best hope of determining whether the issue at stake is, as the president’s team would characterize it, a policy dispute or, as the House managers claim, presidential abuse of power — is the appearance of witnesses who were "in the room" when certain decisions were made.

Texto completo: In remarks bringing to a close the Republicans’ defense of President Donald Trump against impeachment, President Donald Trump’s attoreny Jay Sekulow offered this telling question: "Are you going to allow proceedings on impeachment to go from a New York Times report about someone that says what they hear is in a manuscript?"
Of course, no serious, consequential inquiry into the behavior of a president or any other person should be based on such a loose framework. That’s precisely why the Senate ought to be calling witnesses as part of its impeachment inquiry, beginning with former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book "The Room Where It Happened" was the subject of Sekulow’s question.
Nor is Bolton the only witness the Senate should be putting under oath and cross examining. Throughout their defense of the president, Sekulow and other members of the White House legal team, have repeatedly referred to statements of witnesses from the House impeachment hearings as well as other venues to make their case that the complaints about the president’s actions in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amount to policy differences, not executive wrongdoing. But the Senate, the forum that Trump co-counsel Kenneth Starr said has "a special responsibility" as "the world’s greatest deliberative body" to act as "a court," has not heard from those witnesses, nor had the opportunity to question or challenge them.
That is an unfortunate abdication of the body’s responsibilities.
No one can doubt that presidential impeachment, embedded though it is in the United States Constitution, is as much a political as a legal process. It has been so during each of the previous impeachments, including that of the openly abusive Andrew Johnson and the near-impeachment of Richard Nixon. But it is nonetheless a process with tremendous consequences. It ought to be taken seriously and cannot be taken seriously if the "evidence" on which it is based comes entirely from from documents — official or otherwise — social media posts, news reports and disputed interpretations of people’s words.
Indeed, in his remarks, Sekulow specifically described the role of the House managers as to present "selective" evidence supporting their claim. Then, he said, it is the defense team’s responsibility to present "a fuller view" to fill in "what we thought were the glaring omissions" in the House case. And yet, in the Senate impeachment trial, the most glaring omission of all — the one that offers the best hope of determining whether the issue at stake is, as the president’s team would characterize it, a policy dispute or, as the House managers claim, presidential abuse of power — is the appearance of witnesses who were "in the room" when certain decisions were made.
The president’s defenders have warned against the frivolous initiation of efforts to remove a president, and we share their concern. But it’s also true that once undertaken, an impeachment is serious business, and to dismiss it as otherwise threatens to assure that no future impeachment will ever be taken seriously, however justifiable, as long as the subject of the proceedings can build a strong and loyal coalition.
That, too, is an ominous consideration for our democracy. The Senate should not be dawdling over whether to call witnesses, but hastening to get them scheduled.

Suit claims Mar-a-Lago member lied about Ukraine text messages

Texto completo: A Dutch businessman who now says his text messages about undercover surveillance of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine were a joke has filed a defamation lawsuit in Palm Beach County against the man who told a reporter that the businessman was his source for details of spy efforts.
Anthony De Caluwe’s lawsuit alleges Robert Hyde, a Connecticut congressional aspirant who claims to be a member of Mar-a-Lago, told an NBC reporter that it was De Caluwe who pushed Hyde to relay information
about then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch to Lev Parnas.
Parnas, once a devoted Trump supporter, is a Boca Raton businessman who aided Rudy Guiliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, in a shadow campaign to coerce Ukrainian officials to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. Parnas began talking about his involvement with Giuliani after he was indicted on campaign finance charges in October.
According to the lawsuit, when NBC reporter Kristen Johnson asked Hyde during an interview in mid-January why he was texting with Parnas about Yovanovitch, Hyde referred to De Caluwe, a Dutch businessman, as the source.
“Someone was asking me to do it and I had his contact info, and so I just did,” Hyde told the reporters, referring to De Caluwe.
Pressed again about the information he provided Parnas, Hyde told the reporter that he copied and pasted information about surveillance efforts from a text that De Caluwe had sent him, according to the lawsuit.
De Caluwe is being represented by Boca Raton attorney Peter Ticktin, a high school classmate of Trump at a military boarding school in New York. Ticktin did not return a call for comment.
According to the defamation lawsuit, “De Caluwe did not know who Lev Parnas” was and did not direct Hyde to contact Parnas. As a result of Hyde’s statements, De Caluwe “has become instantly notorious all over the world, and his reputation has been damaged beyond repair,” Ticktin wrote in the lawsuit.
A spokeswoman for De Caluwe told the New York Times that De Caluwe has no experience or contacts in intelligence or surveillance and that his exchanges with Parnas were intended to be a joke.
Hyde was thrust into the Ukraine inquiry when House Democrats on Jan. 20 released some of Parnas’ WhatsApp text messages. Those messages included exchanges with Hyde. In the messages, Hyde told Parnas he had contact with a “private security” team near the embassy in Kiev that was apparently monitoring Yovanovitch.
“She’s talked to three people. Her phone is off. Computer is off,” Hyde wrote in one message. “They will let me know when she’s on the move,” he said in another.
“They are willing to help if we/you would like a price,” Hyde wrote.
Earlier this month, Parnas told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow that he considered Hyde a “weird character” and that he, too, did not take Hyde seriously.
However, officials at Ukraine’s Interior Ministry have taken Hyde’s claims seriously and have opened an investigation into possible illegal surveillance of Yovanovitch based on Hyde’s messages.
Hyde has a reputation for erratic behavior and caustic tweets. He was taken into custody last year at Trump’s golf resort in Doral for mental health treatment and has claimed on social media to be a member of Mar-a-Lago.
Hyde donated more than $35,000 to Trump’s campaign, inaugural committee and other national GOP groups, according to Federal Election Commission campaign finance reports. Most of what is known about him comes from his social media accounts, which he loaded with selfies of himself posing with GOP notables and politicians, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and political operative Roger Stone.
Five posts show Hyde with the president at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and at Mar-a-Lago. After Hyde’s story grabbed headlines, his Instagram account was made private and his Twitter account has been closed.

Texto completo: ‘I'm with the Bush-Cheney team, and I'm here to stop the count."
Those words were bellowed by John Bolton in a Tallahassee library in December 2000, when he was part of a team of Republican lawyers trying to stop the Florida recount of votes cast in the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Until now, it was the most famous utterance President Trump's former national security adviser had ever made.
That's about to change with the looming publication of his book, due out in March, about serving in the Trump administration. It's even vaguely possible Bolton could make an appearance in Trump's impeachment trial this week.
Still, it's worth considering the irony of Bolton's earlier words. The Bush-Gore Florida recount wasn't the beginning of our divided times, but it was a major inflection point. It pushed the internal combustion engine of partisanship into a higher gear, and we've never really revved back down.
Now, Bolton is in the strange position of not fitting comfortably on either side of the partisan divide.
The gist of Bolton's story is that the president's story is not true. According to an account of the book's contents reported in the New York Times, Bolton heard Trump say he was withholding aid to the Ukrainians pending an investigation into Biden and other Democrats. (One wonders who these other Democrats were.)
The response from Trump World is predictable. Bolton is a disgruntled liar, bitter over being fired and desperate to sell books. I have no doubt Bolton, a former colleague of mine at the American Enterprise Institute, is disgruntled. I'm also sure he very much wants to sell books.
But I don't buy the lying part.
Bolton may be many of the things his detractors claim, but he's also an incredibly adept lawyer and bureaucratic infighter.
The notion that Bolton, a legendary note-taker, would volunteer to testify (if subpoenaed) only to perjure himself is absurd. That he would make false allegations in a book without contemporaneous corroboration seems far-fetched as well. There's only one way to know, though: Have Bolton tell his version under oath.
As of this writing, the ink on the official "Destroy Bolton" narrative hasn't dried yet, but an early contender is the charge that this is all just a replay of the tactics Democrats used to try to derail Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.
Except it's not at all.
Putting aside the hilarity of John "Stop the Count" Bolton being a willing pawn of the Democrats, there were no recorded telephone calls confirming elements of the allegations against Kavanaugh. None of the Kavanaugh accusations had the sort of corroboration and material evidence already in the public record in the impeachment case. And Trump's former national security adviser isn't relying on a decades-old unverifiable recollection, but on his memory of events from a few months ago.
The biggest difference between how the Senate handled the Kavanaugh smear campaign and how it's handling the impeachment case is this:
With Kavanaugh, Senate Republicans bent over backward to hear from witnesses; with Trump, they've gone into a defensive crouch to avoid it. And that may not be enough any longer.

Jill Stein accuses Democrats of 'stacking' DNC committees with 'Never-Bernie corporate Dem elites'

Texto completo: Another former presidential candidate criticized the Democratic Party for its handling of the presidential primary process.
Jill Stein, the Green Party's presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016, assailed Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez for his nominations to the standing committees at this year's convention, which also generated outrage from Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign.
"Tom Perez is stacking the DNC committees with Never-Bernie corporate Dem elites like John Podesta," Stein tweeted on Monday, referring to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman in 2016. "As in 2016, the DNC will do all it can to stop Sanders’ nomination — despite him being the most popular politician in the US. Why do you think they kept the superdelegates?"
Tweet
Perez nominated dozens of people to the committees charged with overseeing this year's convention and helping to create the party's platform. The organization's Executive Committee voted on Saturday to appoint Perez's nominations, including some Sanders supporters who make up only a small portion of the total number of people who will serve on each committee.
Still, liberals have voiced frustration with picks such as Podesta, who faces a petition that gathered thousands of signatures to remove him from the DNC convention committees, and former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a critic of Sanders who was tapped to be co-chairman of the Rules Committee, after a 2016 cycle they viewed as being skewed to favor Clinton.
"The DNC should be ashamed of itself because it really is a slap in the face to folks who were asking for reform, and if the DNC believes that it's going to get away in 2020 with what it did in 2016, it has another thing coming," Nina Turner, the national co-chairwoman of the Sanders campaign, said about the list during a Monday interview with Status Coup.
A DNC spokesman defended the appointments, saying they "reflect the rich diversity" of the Democratic Party.
“The remaining appointments will be made based on each state’s election results. 2016 presidential preference was not considered for this convention's appointments. We are grateful for these appointees’ commitment to the party and look forward to an energized convention where we will nominate the next president of the United States,” DNC national press secretary Brandon Gassaway said.
This year's Democratic National Convention, where the party will pick its presidential and vice presidential nominees, is set for July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
In the years that followed a bitterly divided 2016 primary contest, in which Sanders mounted a surprisingly competitive campaign against Clinton, the DNC has taken steps toward placating an increasingly liberal base, including adopting major reforms reducing the outsize influence of unpledged delegates, known as superdelegates, which Sanders supporters asserted gave Clinton an unfair advantage.
Stein, 69, got more than 1.4 million votes, or 1.1% of the electorate, during the 2016 election, running to the left of the Democratic Party. Her running mate was Ajamu Baraka, a human rights activist.
In an interview in the fall of 2019, Clinton appeared to place blame on Stein for her loss in the 2016 general election because some on the Left voted for the third-party candidate, snagging votes that could have potentially gone to the former secretary of state. It was during this same interview that Clinton dubbed Stein and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is a 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, "Russian asset[s]." Gabbard filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Clinton this month for the claim.
Clinton calling Stein a "Russian asset" prompted President Trump to tweet in defense of the Green Party figure.
“Crooked Hillary Clinton just called the respected environmentalist and Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, a ‘Russian Asset.’ They need a Green Party more than ever after looking at the Democrats disastrous environmental program!” Trump said.
Stein has not declared her candidacy for another run at the Green Party's nomination. She told the New York Times in 2018 that a third run would be "a lot" and voiced support for a new generation of leadership. The Green Party will pick its nominee at a convention to be held July 9-12 in Detroit, Michigan.

'Stunned': Tim Kaine confronts Trump impeachment lawyer over jab at 1619 Project

Texto completo: Sen. Tim Kaine came face-to-face with President Trump's impeachment defense lawyer, who took a swipe at a New York Times series on the history of slavery in America.
"What does that have to do with the articles of impeachment?" Kaine told USA Today on Tuesday. "I was stunned by it."
During closing arguments from Trump's defense team on Tuesday, attorney Robert Ray criticized the House impeachment managers' take on the impeachment of former President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Johnson, House Democrats said, was impeached as a result of "his illegitimate use of power to undermine Reconstruction and subordinate African Americans following the Civil War."
Ray said that comparing Johnson's impeachment to Trump's was an "ahistorical sleight of hand worthy only of the New York Times recent 1619 series."
The publication's series, the 1619 Project, is an examination of the history of slavery and the subsequent oppression of black people in America. The series makes the central point that American history should begin with the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in America, rather than with 1776. It was met with criticism, ranging from accusations of factual errors to charges of ideological bias.
Ray called the project "too politically correct" when confronted by Kaine, the Virginia Democrat said.
"To me, it seemed like an ad hominem attack on people trying to get at the roots of the effects of slavery in the United States," Kaine said.
Trump faces two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats allege Trump shook down the leader of Ukraine and withheld congressionally approved military aid to the country while seeking investigations into a domestic political rival, Joe Biden.
Both House impeachment managers and Trump's defense lawyers have concluded their arguments in the trial. Senators will submit questions to each side's representatives on Wednesday and Thursday. A vote on whether to call witnesses to testify in the trial is expected Friday.

Texto completo: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp has launched a news aggregation platform that offers readers “a range of perspectives” from more than 400 publishers.
The website was launched on Wednesday. The bright yellow- and black-colored website features top stories as well as sections that highlight individual news stories and link to several sources for each. For example, one of the sections on Wednesday was titled “Trump signs trade deal” and included links to stories about the topic from the Hill, Fox Business, the Washington Examiner, and the New York Times.
According to the website, Knewz “works by combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with experienced editors. The technology scans hundreds of news sources, and our editors highlight a selection of headlines that provide a broad perspective on stories of the day.”
Robert Thompson, CEO of News Corp, said that readers will be able to see news from “publishers large and small” located in all 50 states.
“Knewz is unique in that readers can, at a single glance, see multiple sources,” Thompson said. “There are mastheads from across the political and regional spectrum, and premium publishers will not be relegated in the rankings.”

Just because Trump's paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get him

Texto completo: Sometimes, writers tell more truth than they mean to.
“This is Mr. Trump’s era and Mr. Trump’s Washington,” the New York Times’s chief White House correspondent wrote on Monday. “And the old rules do not always apply anymore.”
Cynical conservatives on Twitter have a hashtag for that mentality: #newrules. When either trying to get someone fired for a bad tweet or defending President Trump’s rhetoric, the Twitter trolls will grant that such behavior violates old-fashioned norms. But since popular culture and the American Left have trashed those norms, the argument goes, we’re not going to play by the old rules either.
It’s a vicious circle. Norm breaking excuses norm breaking, which excuses more breaking of norms. Because the “grab 'em by the p----” guy won the election, the Resistance isn’t going to play nice.
And as a result of this arms race, Trump’s base is ready to excuse some of his more reckless or seemingly corrupt actions.
One reason it’s hard to believe that Trump had good motives when he pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens or election interference by the country is that he assigned the investigative work and some of the diplomatic work to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani rather than to federal law enforcement.
Running a diplomatic-investigative deal through his private lawyer looks a bit shady. It suggests Trump knew it was improper. It was also reckless to outsource U.S. diplomacy with Ukraine to Giuliani because he had as clients two Eastern European emigres, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were pursuing oil business with Ukraine’s government.
How could you defend this as anything other than a cover-up or at least reckless freelancing?
Jay Sekulow, Trump’s attorney, tried. “Let’s for a moment put ourselves in the shoes of the president of the United States right now," Sekulow told the Senate on Saturday. "Before he was sworn into office, he was subjected to an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation called Crossfire Hurricane.” It was unprecedented for our government to spy on a presidential candidate, and we have since learned that the FBI misled the spy court.
Maybe the FBI figured Trump was so bad or Carter Page so clearly crooked that they didn’t have to follow the rules.
Sekulow piled the FBI investigation onto this story. FBI Director James Comey certainly didn’t follow norms in his odd early conversations with Trump. FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page certainly seemed determined to undermine Trump.
Thus, Sekulow argued, it was reasonable that Trump decided to circumvent the intelligence community in his Ukraine efforts. Trump “decided that he would listen to people that he trusted, and he would inquire about the Ukraine issue himself,” Sekulow explained rather than “blindly trust some of the advice he was being given by the intelligence agencies.”
Similarly, Trump’s White House moved the transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to something of a secret server. This is held up as a cover-up, a sign of guilt. But recall how in 2017, intelligence community insiders leaked transcripts of Trump’s rocky calls with Australian and Mexican leaders — not to be whistleblowers but simply to embarrass Trump.
And now, it looks like someone at the National Security Council leaked excerpts of John Bolton’s book just to make Trump look bad.
It sure seems as though it wasn’t merely paranoia for Trump to believe that folks in the intelligence community are out to get him.
Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine look either reckless, corrupt, or both. But they’re also plausible reactions to rule-breaking by the FBI and the National Security Council.
The old rules have gone out the window in the Trump era. Now everyone, including intelligence officials and the president, is playing by new rules. And that's not good for the country.

New York police arrest six suspects in $7M drug ring, judge releases them without bail

Texto completo: A New York criminal court has released six suspected drug traffickers from jail without bail under the state’s new criminal justice law.
Suspects Livo Valdez, Jaslin Baldera, Frederick Baldera, Frandi Ledema, Diego Tejada, and Parfraimy Antonio walked out of Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday morning, according to the New York Post. Assistant District Attorney Michael Di Paolo said during the hearing that "none of the defendants are eligible for bail."
The New York Drug Enforcement Task Force raided an apartment on Monday and found all six suspects packing hundreds of thousands of glassine envelopes with powdered drugs valued at $7 million. Officers believe the suspects were preparing to distribute the drugs over New York and New England.
The suspects’ passports were taken, and each man is due back in court on Feb. 27.
The New York State Legislature passed a slew of criminal justice reforms in April that took effect on Jan. 1. The reforms have received harsh criticism from the law enforcement community in the state.
On Jan. 23, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote a New York Times opinion piece asserting the reforms "undermine" public safety.
"[The reforms eliminate] cash bail and the possibility of detention for a wide array of offenses, including weapons possession, trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs, many hate-crime assaults, the promotion of child prostitution, serial arson, and certain burglaries and robberies," Shea wrote.
Carl Heastie, a Democratic assembly speaker for the legislature, has defended the bail reform as creating a more fair justice system for low-income and impoverished people accused of a crime.
"We ended the use of cash bail for lower-level offenses because our criminal justice system must work for everyone — not just those who can afford it," Heastie said. "By implementing this system, everyone is treated the same."

Texto completo: Congressional investigators want access to an email sent by the alleged Ukraine whistleblower that is cited in special counsel Robert Mueller's report, according to Fox News host Laura Ingraham.
Ingraham reported on her show Tuesday evening that this May 2017 email could show the CIA analyst who is alleged to have lodged a complaint that sparked impeachment proceedings has a history of cooking up evidence to set up President Trump.
"Sources tell The Ingraham Angle that congressional investigators are asking the White House for a May 2017 email from the same alleged whistleblower," Ingraham said. "Sources say that this email may show that the person who kicked off the impeachment sham previously manufactured evidence against President Trump, and a footnote in the Mueller report tells the story."
The email appears as a footnote in Mueller's report, where it discusses Trump's May 10 meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office, one day after he fired FBI Director James Comey. It was at this meeting, according to a New York Times report on May 19, that Trump called Comey "crazy, a real nut job" and acknowledged he felt "great pressure" because of the investigation into Russia's attempted interference in the campaign. Two days earlier, Mueller was appointed as special counsel to take up the investigation into whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. His team ultimately found no criminal conspiracy.
The May 10 email was sent by "Ciaramella," which likely was CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella, the former National Security Council official who some Republicans and conservative media figures believe is the Ukraine whistleblower, to another agency.
According to Mueller's report, the email discussed the planning process for the "working visit" by Lavrov, including a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. "The meeting had been planned on May 2, 2017, during a telephone call between the President and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the meeting date was confirmed on May 5, 2017, the same day the President dictated ideas for the Comey termination letter to [White House adviser] Stephen Miller," the footnote said.
The letter was sent to "Kelly et al," which former colleagues told RealClearInvestigations was then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who later became Trump's chief of staff. That same October report talks of a research dossier circulating through Congress that alleges Ciaramella helped create the "Putin fired Comey" narrative and a former National Security Council colleague who accuses Ciaramella of going "outside his chain of command" in sending the May 10 email.
Ingraham's report Tuesday was part of a series on the alleged whistleblower. Last week, she reported a chain of State Department emails, which stemmed from a standard request for comment from New York Times journalist Ken Vogel, tying Ciaramella to a January 2016 meeting at the Obama White House with Ukrainian prosecutors that was predicated, in part, on discussing Hunter Biden's ties to Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where he held a $50,000-per-month position on the board.
Hunter Biden, 49, is the son of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trump and his allies believe the elder Biden orchestrated a scheme to protect his son in which he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of an investigation into Burisma.
However, Shokin was widely seen as corrupt, and the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and other allies sought his ouster. Biden, who, in pushing for Shokin to be fired, was repeating U.S. policy that had been set out by Washington’s ambassador to Kyiv in the preceding months, has dubbed the corruption allegations as “false, debunked conspiracy theories." Shokin was fired in March 2016.
Impeachment was spurred by the emergence of a whistleblower complaint, which the intelligence community inspector general determined to be urgent and credible, about a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the American leader pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Bidens and other Democrats.
Trump faces two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate trial is underway, and Democrats are pushing for witnesses. They particularly want to hear testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton after reports about his upcoming book containing fresh allegations of Trump leveraging nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to help with investigations into his political rivals.
With centrist Republican senators on the fence, Trump's staunchest allies warn that if they vote to call witnesses, Hunter Biden and the whistleblower will be among those they seek.
"The first witness I would want, if you're going to go down this road, is the whistleblower, the individual who started this whole thing. We have no idea who this individual is, who the people he talked to as the prime sources, because he wasn't on the phone call. He didn't have first-hand knowledge. So, that would be the one I would want to call," Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a member of Trump's impeachment team, told Fox News on Wednesday.
Democrats have argued that witness testimony and documents have moved the impeachment case beyond the whistleblower. Lawyers for the whistleblower have warned that identifying their client would put that person's life in danger.

Texto completo: More people in the United States turn to Facebook for their political fix than the nation’s biggest and most influential newspapers, including the New York Times and Washington Post.
But a just-released study of American news reading habits also found that Facebook is the most distrusted social media source of political news by both Democrats and Republicans.
PJ_2020.01.29_social-media-election-news_0-01.png
In a poll of 12,043, 25% said they go to Facebook for their news about politics. For the New York Times, it was 20%, and for the Washington Post 17%, the same as YouTube.
Still, cable and the Big Three networks are the nation’s dominant news sources.
While virtually every person is familiar with and uses Facebook, Pew Research Center’s survey found that just 15% of adults trust the news they read on the website. A huge 59% “distrust” the political news on the site. That is the highest for all top social media sites.
“Facebook, the most widely used of the six social media sites examined when it comes to getting political and election news, is distrusted by about six-in-ten U.S. adults (59%). That includes almost equal percentages of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic (59%) and Republicans and independents who lean Republican (62%). Close to half of all U.S. adults also say they distrust Twitter (48%), and about four-in-ten (42%) distrust Instagram,” said Pew in the survey that is part of its new “Election News Pathways” project.
But Pew found a caveat: Those who said they got “most” of their news from social media sites generally trusted what they saw.
And, said the Pew survey shared with Secrets, “The greater trust among this group in social media generally as a place for political news also plays out in less concern about made-up news and information during the 2020 election season — an issue that is often associated with social media.”

'I hope she finds peace': Pompeo details 'history' with NPR but doesn't apologize for fight with reporter

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed his fight with NPR, saying he hopes the reporter he berated "finds peace" without apologizing to her.
NPR's Mary Louise Kelly conducted an interview with Pompeo last week, after which she repeatedly asked questions about Ukraine and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. During a private moment that followed, which Pompeo claimed was off the record, he yelled at her and asked her if she could locate Ukraine on an unmarked map of the world.
The secretary of state spoke about the debacle on his plane to London Wednesday morning, saying there is "a lot of history with NPR and Mike Pompeo and Iran."
"[NPR] took money from Ploughshares and were part of the Ben Rhodes echo chamber, and they ultimately had to go on air and say, 'Yup, it's true. We took money from Ploughshares and didn't disclose [it] after enormous pressure from congressman Pompeo.' So there's a lot of history there," Pompeo stated, according to Los Angeles Times reporter Tracy Wilkinson.
As the secretary referenced, former President Obama's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes revealed in a 2016 New York Times Magazine profile that the administration used outside groups, including Ploughshares, to test out how best to sell the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, according to an explanatory piece by NPR.
Around the same time, NPR had scheduled an interview with then-Rep. Pompeo of Kansas, who opposed the Iran deal, but later canceled it. While NPR claimed it had not been in touch with the congressman, it later admitted the interview was nixed because "there were too many other interviews scheduled." The outlet also acknowledged that Ploughshares Fund had given grants to NPR for years.
After the interview last week, the State Department issued a blistering rebuke of NPR and Kelly personally, in which Pompeo accused her of "violat[ing] the basic rules of journalism and decency." The State Department went on to block a different NPR reporter from flying with the secretary on his upcoming trip to Europe and Central Asia. The State Department Correspondents' Association and NPR in turn accused Pompeo of "retaliating" against the outlet.
Pompeo concluded his Wednesday statement saying, "So I took a leap of faith with Mary Louise, invited her to the State Department back in December. We had a great conversation. She asked me if I'd do her the favor of granting her an interview. I said sure: There's a lot of history to fix. Let's talk about Iran. She agreed that we would talk about Iran, and we set up an interview. I hope she finds peace."

White House says Bolton book contains top-secret information

Texto completo: The White House told John Bolton, President Trump’s former national security adviser, that his tell-all book about his experience in the White House contains classified information.
The White House's National Security Council's Records Management Division sent a letter to Bolton's attorney last week that said his manuscript "appears to contain significant amounts of classified information."
"It also appears that some of this classified information is at the TOP SECRET level," the letter said. "Under federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed, as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information."
Early Wednesday, Trump attacked Bolton on Twitter and questioned his motives for detailing his alleged conduct toward Ukraine in his forthcoming book, The Room Where It Happened.
Contents of the book were reported by the New York Times after Bolton turned it over to the White House’s National Security Council for review. Bolton’s lawyer has accused the White House of corrupting the vetting process by sharing details of the book with those outside the National Security Council's Records Management Division.
Bolton alleged that Trump made security aid to Ukraine dependent on the country investigating his political rival Joe Biden, undermining the Trump defense team's claim that the freeze of security assistance was not linked to the pressure campaign.
The revelation came amid the Senate impeachment trial and has helped fuel calls for witnesses.

Texto completo: A half-hour before a Bernie Sanders rally Saturday night in Iowa, a line snaked around the nearly 900-seat Ames City Auditorium, but no one else was being let in: The theater was full.
Inside, the Grammy-winning indie rock band Portugal. The Man was playing. Rows of people were assembled on risers behind the musicians, waving Bernie signs. Sanders fans, most of them young, crowded the aisles; The Iowa State Daily reported that 1,400 people had crammed into the auditorium, with another 400 in an overflow room. The air buzzed with the intoxicating collective energy unique to social movements on the rise.
Sanders has a reputation for focusing on class to the exclusion of all else; as David Frum put it in The Atlantic, “'Left but not woke’ is the Bernie Sanders brand.” On the ground in Iowa, however, it is not the brand of his campaign. Sanders isn’t just running the most economically left campaign; he’s running the most unapologetically left campaign, period. And it’s surging, with Sanders leading in recent polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
It’s no longer far-fetched to think that he could be the Democratic nominee.
When the band was done, three indigenous women took the stage to pay respects to the Native Americans forced off the land that became Iowa. Filmmaker Michael Moore came on and described Donald Trump as the endpoint of a country founded “on genocide and built on the backs of slaves.” (The next day, at a campaign stop in Perry, Moore called women’s underrepresentation in Congress a form of “gender apartheid.”) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke, saying, “I’m here because Sen. Sanders has actually committed to breaking up ICE.”
There are no moral or intellectual comparisons between Sanders and Trump, but there are structural similarities between the Sanders campaign and the one Trump ran in 2016. Trump thrilled conservatives with his unembarrassed embrace of far-right figures disdained by mainstream Republicans. He inspired alienated men on the internet to mobilize behind him. Party elites wanted to stop him, but his solid core of support allowed him to romp through a fractured field.
The parallels with Sanders are obvious. He’s running a campaign steeped in the ethos of an anti-establishment left, and benefiting from elite Democrats’ failure to coalesce around someone else. He has an enormous online following, with legions of trolls intimidating Democrats who seem to stand in their way. An outsider who long refused to join the party whose nomination he’s seeking, he appeals to people who distrust most political institutions, the mainstream media very much included.
Obviously, Trump won, so there’s something to be said for aping some of his strategies. But the Sanders juggernaut still scares me. As Ezra Klein recently pointed out in The New York Times, the brute demographics of American politics make Democrats more electorally dependent on centrists than Republicans are.
Right now, several polls show Sanders beating Trump, and a few show him beating Trump in some swing states by more than anyone else. Still, I’m terrified that those numbers won’t survive endless attack ads about Sanders’ radical past.
There will most likely be spots showing the 1985 Sandinista rally Sanders attended in Nicaragua, with the crowd chanting, “Here There and Everywhere/ The Yankee Will Die.” The country will see Sanders, speaking after a trip to the Soviet Union, effusively praising its state-sponsored culture.
The economic inequities that Sanders rails against are very real, but most Americans — including most Democrats — say the economy is good, and a fortune would be spent to convince them that Sanders would crash it. Socialism may be newly current among the young, but polls suggest that it’s still anathema to the old.
But Sanders supporters have plenty of reasons to discount these anxieties. Polls are on their side. Their movement feels exhilarating, the fulfillment of their most fervent political hopes in view. Centrist predictions about which candidates are viable have failed over and over again.
“We keep hearing this argument about electability, or nominating safe candidates, and we keep losing,” said Derek Eadon, a 36-year-old former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party who endorsed Sanders this month.
Eadon, who was previously with Julián Castro’s campaign, didn’t take Sanders seriously in 2016. Two things changed since then. A painful nerve disease forced Eadon to become intimate with the absurdist horror of America’s health care system. And he said he saw Sanders expanding the electorate. “His ability to keep bringing in new people, and people that have not been involved before, is just such a strength electorally,” said Eadon.
This is the paradox helping to fuel Sanders’ rise: The more he attracts people who are heedless of traditional electability concerns, the more electable he looks.
Last week, Dalhi Myers, a conservative-leaning African American elected official in South Carolina, switched her support from Joe Biden to Sanders. Despite her affection for Biden, Myers, a member of the Richland County Council, had grown concerned by what she saw as an absence of grassroots enthusiasm for him. “I look at the Sanders campaign and what they’re doing to motivate people on the ground, and it’s working,” she told me.
No one knows if all this excitement will translate into the votes Democrats need. And no one knows if Democrats can win without it.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s reaction to the leak of incriminating details in John Bolton’s forthcoming book shocked me. Not the part where the president said that Bolton was making up a Ukraine quid pro quo in the service of the best-seller list — that he was lying for lucre. Trump sees that transaction everywhere he looks, because he sees it first and foremost in the mirror.
No, I was surprised that the president didn’t dispute knowing Bolton, or at least didn’t say that he was so slightly acquainted with his own former national security adviser that he couldn’t pick him — chinchilla-bushy mustache and all — out of a lineup. That’s Trump’s favorite ploy. Ask Michael Cohen, Anthony Scaramucci, Prince Andrew, Stormy Daniels, Gordon Sondland, Lev Parnas. Fall into disrepute, cross Trump or claim to have the goods on him and you’re wiped clean from his memory, no matter the existence of contradictory forensics. Ivanka, beware. You’re one bad manicure away from paternal amnesia.
Bolton is the impeachment star of the week, whether he winds up testifying or not, and I can’t shake the feeling that he plotted all of this out: keeping his head down during the hearings in the House; letting it be known only afterward that he’d be willing to testify in the Senate; the revelation this week — simultaneous with assertions by Trump’s defense team that there were no firsthand witnesses to the president’s wrongdoing — that his book indeed addresses Ukraine and fully backs up the charges in the articles of impeachment.
Bolton has always been vain, brilliant and ruthless, and this is the timeline that a vain, brilliant and ruthless operator would cinch. I’m not personally acquainted with the sound of his laughter, but I’m certain I hear it.
When Trump came down that escalator in June 2015, the laws of political gravity were suspended, and Bolton’s emergence as a darling of Democrats is the latest example. He was so far to the right and such a ferocious hawk that President George W. Bush bypassed the Senate to sneak him in as ambassador to the United Nations. He later feathered a nest at Fox News, also known as the Trump administration applicant pool.
And at a time when most self-respecting foreign-policy mavens had concluded that Trump was toxic, Bolton opened his lips wide to the poison, signing on to become the president’s third national security adviser. Of course, the president is now on his fourth.
Trump can’t dismiss Bolton’s account of events as partisan. Bolton’s conservative credentials prove otherwise. Trump can’t bellow “deep state,” not when he handpicked Bolton at a stage of his presidency when he’d already become sensitive to that supposedly pernicious force. All Trump can do is command his Republican minions in the Senate to fall in line. Sadly, most of them will.
Don’t be impressed by the possibility that now — and, I stress, only now — some Senate Republicans may press for witnesses, including Bolton, in the trial. This isn’t a stirring of conscience. It’s a cloaking of humiliation. If they ignore Bolton, their still-unshaken commitment to acquitting Trump becomes even more naked.
Besides, hearing from witnesses wouldn’t erase Republican senators’ awful behavior to this point in the trial: all the ugly gloating from the likes of Lindsey Graham that Adam Schiff’s undeniable eloquence was for naught; Marsha Blackburn’s pathologically exuberant attacks on the integrity of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman; Martha McSally’s disgraceful sniping at a perfectly polite television reporter (“liberal hack,” she spewed) and then her cynical use of that Trumpian outburst to raise money for her reelection campaign. This is sycophancy at its most shameful.
Scratch that superlative: I was forgetting Mike Pompeo. According to The New York Times’ scoop about Bolton’s book, he writes that Pompeo, too, was aware of the Ukraine pressure campaign — the same Pompeo who did nothing to stop the vilification of Marie Yovanovitch; the same Pompeo who promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election; the same Pompeo who once warned that Trump would be “an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution” and then, when Trump gave him a really neat job, decided that a little authoritarianism never hurt anyone.
Of late he seems to be having a meltdown. I attribute it to his realization that his reputation and belief in his own rectitude won’t survive Trump. He’s assessing the bargain he made and understanding how completely his ambition eclipsed his integrity. It’s hell when you’re revealed to yourself.
Bolton, meanwhile, is probably feeling pretty content. He knows how badly the Trump presidency will be judged and has positioned himself on the right side of history — this time around. Maybe bitterness brought him here, maybe ego, maybe this quaint old thing called patriotism. He survived Trump. I’d read that book.

Thomas L. Friedman: Is Trump Bibi’s chump?

Texto completo: Tel Aviv, Israel • Given the timing of the release Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, I have to begin by asking: Is this plan about two states for two peoples or is it about one diversion for two dirty leaders?
It sure feels like the latter. After all, both Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are, in effect, facing job-threatening charges — Trump for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and Bibi, who was literally indicted Tuesday , for fraud, bribery and breach of trust. They both had a huge need to change the subject and shore up their common base of right-wing Jews and evangelicals.
If I were Jared Kushner and had worked for three years on a peace plan — and was serious about it getting a fair and full hearing from all sides — there is no way I would have released it right now. This smells.
But then my long-held view has always been that the Middle East puts a smile on your face only if a change for the better starts with them . Camp David started with Israelis and Egyptians, and America was brought in only later. Oslo was started by Israelis and Palestinians, and America joined only later. Tunisia, the only Arab Spring country to make its way to democracy, is the one Arab country that America had virtually nothing to do with. For a peace initiative to be serious and sustainable, it should always start with them .
And yet, I also know that when America puts something this detailed on the table, it cannot be ignored, at least in the near term. Netanyahu already announced that with Trump’s blessings Israel will quickly move to apply its law (tantamount to annexation) to the West Bank’s Jordan Valley and all Jewish settlements in the occupied territory. It will be interesting to see how the European Union, which funds much of the Palestinian governing infrastructure in the West Bank, responds once it’s studied the plan, not to mention the reaction of everyday Palestinians and Arabs. (I don’t expect much. This conflict seems to have passed its fix-by date.)
OK, despite the obvious political motivation for the timing of the release of this plan, not to mention much of its substance, is there anything in it that would impress me that the Trump administration is actually serious about promoting a two-state solution — and actually has a strategy to achieve one?
Yes, if our president did something hard. What would that be? It would be his telling Netanyahu that before Bibi extends Israeli law to all these West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley, Trump wants one thing: an unequivocal public statement that Netanyahu accepts the fact that while Israel is getting East Jerusalem, more than 20% of the core West Bank, with all its settlements, plus the Jordan Valley, the remaining roughly 70% will become an independent Palestinian state, if Palestinians agree to all sorts of security requirements.
Trump needs to say to Netanyahu: “Bibi, you say that I am the most pro-Israel president to ever sit in the White House. This plan was written with your team. I have supported your maximum position — absorbing all the Jewish settlements into Israel and all of traditional Jerusalem, and with no return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. Now I need to know, the Palestinians need to know, and the world needs to know, that this is not your new starting position. Will you agree right now that the remaining land will be a Palestinian state if the Palestinians agree to demilitarization and recognize Israel as a Jewish state? Will you agree — right now — to make no further claims ever to the West Bank and not build another settlement ever outside the areas that the Trump plan assigns to Israel?”
If Trump were to spend just a little bit of political capital doing that, I might start to take this plan seriously. But if Netanyahu is allowed to evade that question or turns Trump down with no consequences, then this whole thing truly is a farce — it’s just the new baseline for Netanyahu’s next West Bank land grab.
Indeed, if Bibi says he still wants more than this plan gives him already — as ultranationalists in his coalition argue — then he is openly declaring before the president of the United States that his appetite is for all of the West Bank and that his vision for Israel is that it become a binational/apartheid state that will hold the 2.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank without full political rights.
This is the moment when we find out whether Bibi — who for decades has told American presidents, “Test me with a real plan and I will show you that I can be a great leader” — has any greatness in him whatsoever or is just a corrupt political hack looking to stay out of jail and will do any short-term maneuver necessary, regardless of its long-term effect on Israel, to do so.
Because if Bibi is serious that his ambitions stop at what he’s now gotten from Trump, then he needs a whole new domestic coalition — the ultra-zealots in his coalition will be up in arms — and a more moderate national unity government in Israel might even be possible.
At the same time, while I understand why Palestinian leaders are denouncing this plan, they should nevertheless try to make some lemonade out of these Trump lemons. It’s not as if they have a lot of great options, and their resistance to the Israeli occupation has gotten them nowhere. Palestinian leaders have been feckless and divided for some time; they boycotted the design of this plan. Still, if I were them, I’d tell Trump, “Yes, but we will use this plan as a floor in negotiations with Israelis, not a ceiling.” They would surely gain a lot of U.S., Arab and European goodwill for trying that approach. What do they have to lose?
But bottom line: Without Trump getting Netanyahu to definitively end his claims to all of the West Bank, and without Palestinian leaders able to reunite their disparate political factions in Gaza and the West Bank into a single body that can theoretically say “yes” to a fair outcome for their people while also recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, Trump’s Deal of the Century will join a century-old library of failed Middle East peace plans.

Mara Gay: Bloomberg rarely pays a price for breaking the rules

Texto completo: In 2008, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was barred by term limits from seeking four more years in office.
So he got rid of the law and then spent more than $100 million of his fortune to win a third term the next year.
New Yorkers were raving mad. But they reelected him anyway.
“I feel he bought himself the election,” Stav Birnbaum of Brooklyn told The Times in 2009, after voting for Bloomberg. But she added, “He’s doing a really good job.”
Bloomberg has rarely paid a political price for breaking the rules.
He is protected in part because of his reputation as one of New York’s most effective mayors.
And in part because of his enormous fortune.
Now, as Bloomberg campaigns for president, his disdain for convention is once again on display, most obviously in the more than $200 million in advertising that has helped him rise in the polls while participating in neither the Democratic debates nor early primary contests.
He has also asked for, and been granted, approval from the Federal Election Commission to delay release of his personal financial disclosures. The extension — Bloomberg’s second such reprieve — is particularly convenient because it means he won’t be required to make public his extensive financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest until after Super Tuesday, when Democrats in 14 states and American Samoa will hold primaries and caucuses.
Bloomberg has put his billions to good use, generously supporting public health and gun safety campaigns, as well as efforts to combat climate change. And money devoted to defeating President Donald Trump is money well spent. Bloomberg has said that if his own candidacy fails, he is willing to spend $1 billion to back the Democratic nominee, even if it is someone with whom he has substantial policy disagreements. All that is to be applauded.
But some other aspects of Bloomberg’s campaign need to change.
Most concerning, he has misstated his record on stop-and-frisk, the policing tactic that humiliated hundreds of thousands of innocent New Yorkers, overwhelmingly young black and Latino men.
“Now as all of you know, in my determination to reduce gun violence, we employed a common big-city police practice called stop-and-frisk, and that resulted in far too many innocent people being stopped,” Bloomberg said in a speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Jan. 19. “And when I realized that, we took action.”
Not quite. The number of stops rose for years under Bloomberg, peaking at 685,724 stops in 2011, according to police data published by the New York Civil Liberties Union. Though it was down slightly the next year to 532,911, it began to significantly decline only in 2013, the year a federal judge ruled the city’s use of the policing strategy unconstitutional.
Throughout his mayoralty, and for years afterward, Bloomberg fiercely defended the policy, insisting it was saving lives, even though nearly 90% of the stops resulted in no charges, and crime continued to fall even after the number of stops sharply declined. He apologized just before announcing his intention to run for the Democratic nomination, a contest nearly impossible to win without robust support from black voters.
This wasn’t the first time he’s mischaracterized his record on the issue. “Nobody asked me about it until I started running for president. So come on,” he said of stop-and-frisk in an interview with Gayle King of CBS in December, weeks after apologizing for the use of the practice in a speech at a predominantly black church in Brooklyn. That will be news to many New Yorkers, starting with the groups that sued the city over the policy, and the dozens of reporters in New York who pressed him on it for years.
Bloomberg has also declined to release from confidentiality agreements several women who brought accusations of a hostile work environment at his company, Bloomberg LP.
Bloomberg has much to offer. But some honesty and humility would go a long way. The last thing America needs is another rich guy who thinks the rules are for suckers.

ANTI-WAR SENTIMENT FUELS SANDERS SURGE

Texto completo: CEDAR FALLS, IOWA - A roar of approval filled the packed ballroom on the University of Northern Iowa campus when Wisconsin Congressman Mark Pocan told a crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters that he would be barnstorming across eastern Iowa to deliver the message that, "Yes! We must stop endless wars!"
The applause was just as loud when Black Hawk County (Iowa) Supervisor Chris Schwartz reminded Saturday's gathering that, almost two decades ago, "It was Bernie Sanders who stood up to George Bush and said no to war."
The national media has moved on from discussing the prospect that President Donald Trump's decision to kill a key Iranian general had brought the Middle East to "the brink of war." But concerns about issues of war and peace - which briefly upended the national debate in early January - continue to influence the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's benefiting Sanders, especially in Iowa.
There's little question that the senator from Vermont is surging in the state that will hold the first caucuses of the 2020 cycle on Feb. 3. A fresh New York Times/Siena College poll positions Sanders in a clear front-place position in the state, with the support of 25% of those polled, versus 18% for former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 17% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 15% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. That's a substantial improvement from the Des Moines Register/CNN poll in early January, which gave Sanders a narrow lead over the rest of the field.
You'll hear plenty of speculation about why Sanders is rising at the point when it matters most. But not enough attention has been paid by pundits at the national level to the resonance of the anti-war message that Sanders delivered in the first weeks of 2020. After the president ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, when many Americans feared the country was careering toward another Middle East war, Sanders delivered an immediate and aggressive anti-war message. Recalling his opposition to past wars, Sanders declared, "I was right about Vietnam. I was right about Iraq. I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran. I apologize to no one."
He kept reinforcing that message in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states, where he incorporated a more detailed critique of "endless wars" into his stump speech - to such an extent that The Atlantic noted, "Bernie Sanders Has Something New to Talk About: The Iran crisis is giving him a chance to differentiate himself - just in time for the Iowa caucuses." He did the same in Washington, where he and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, sponsored the "No War Against Iran Act."
"I firmly believe the reason Bernie has shot to the lead has everything to do with Iran. He was decisive on this. We co-introduced legislation the day after the strike to stop funding for the war. And then went across Iowa hitting the anti-war message," Khanna said. "Sanders hammered the anti-war message for weeks. He had the great line he started using: instead of spending $1.8 trillion on military budgets, why don't we use some of those resources to tackle climate change? People tuned in that he had blasted the defense budget."
Khanna, who has emerged as a leading anti-war voice in Congress and nationally, campaigned for Sanders in Iowa in early January. He says he was stopped by Democrats and independents who made a point of saying how important it was to them that Sanders was delivering a strong rebuke to endless wars.
"It's just shocking to me that what's so obvious to explain Bernie's rise is being missed by the media," Khanna said. "Of course for Bernie, taking that anti-war position was just pure principle. It was so instinctive for him that we needed to issue a statement opposing the assassination and reintroducing legislation to block the funding. He didn't need a committee. His bold action stemmed from a lifetime of commitment to these issues. And Iowa voters saw this."
That's not an uncommon assessment.
"His anti-war position is important to a lot of people. It's important to me," said Whitman Cler, a student who was volunteering for Sanders at the University of Northern Iowa event on Saturday.
Schwartz, who serves as Iowa's state director of Americans for Democratic Action in addition to his work as a local elected official, argued, "This country is sick of endless wars, and I think that's especially true in Iowa. So, yes, of course people are noticing that Bernie is talking about this. Iowa has always had an anti-war streak. There's a long history of peace activism - of voting for anti-war candidates."
The state's caucuses gave a significant boost to George McGovern's anti-war bid in 1972, and to a number of other anti-war candidates along the way. Perhaps most famously, Iowa was the place where Barack Obama gained traction as a Democratic contender in 2007 and 2008 by emphasizing the fact that he had spoken out against going to war with Iraq in 2002 - when other leading Democrats had backed the war.
Schwartz said he caucused for Obama in 2008 because of the fact that he had opposed the rush to war. And it is one of the reasons why he will caucus for Sanders this year.
"Sanders has credibility as an anti-war candidate. He opposed the Iraq War," Schwartz said. "People know that, and it matters to them, just as it matters that he is now speaking out against war with Iran."
Khanna thinks that's the key. "Anti-war is not just good substance," he said. "It's winning politics."

Texto completo: For many years, I've been seated behind the lectern at the Martin Luther King Day celebration in the State Capitol Rotunda.
Gov. Tony Evers and wife, Kathy, were there, as was Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and a few dozen Madison dignitaries, mostly African American. The Cap Times' philanthropic arm, the Evjue Foundation, financially supports the event.
The two-hour gathering is an uplifting celebration with lots of rhetorical flourish, gospel music and, at some point, everyone holding hands and singing "We Shall Overcome."
At the start, Jonathan Overby, who, with spouse, Amy, has organized the celebration for 40 years, spoke about today's "stench" of racism. I found that word jarring but, for these times, appropriate.
"I stand before you, as I did in 1980, to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King," Overby said. "Like many of you, I am also here to draw attention to the familiar stench of hatred, fear of others and the misguided conflation of nationalism as though it is a cornerstone of patriotism wedded of late to the ill-placed belief that if you complain about our country, you don't love it."
Looking back many years, I was among those reveling in the two-time election of Barack Obama as the dawn of a post-racial America, never dreaming of the backlash that would follow. African Americans I talk to regularly were not fooled. "You just wait," was their message.
These days, they set me straight as to why presidential candidate Joe Biden is more popular among African Americans than former candidates of color like Cory Booker or Kamala Harris. I am told that Biden is seen as the reassuring old white male politician most likely to win.
You see, more than any white group, African Americans say their children and grandchildren have the most to lose from more of Donald Trump, so they back who they think the largest swath of white people might support - someone non-threatening.
Author Michelle Alexander, who a decade ago gained acclaim for "The New Jim Crow," argued in a recent New York Times essay that the white nationalism encouraged by Trump is no aberration. "From mass incarceration to mass deportation," read the piece's headlines, "our nation remains in deep denial."
"We are now living in an era not of post-racialism but of unabashed racialism, a time when many white Americans feel free to speak openly of their nostalgia for an age when their cultural, political and economic dominance could be taken for granted - no apologies required," Alexander wrote. "Racial bigotry, fearmongering and scapegoating are no longer subterranean in our political discourse; the dog whistles have been replaced by bullhorns. White nationalist movements are operating openly online and in many of our communities; they're celebrating mass killings and recruiting thousands into their ranks."
Isn't it wonderful that, here in Madison, the mostly white power structure is not like that, but instead liberal and open-minded?
Or is it?
As I listened at the MLK event, I was asking myself what more I could do here in Madison in the coming year. And that starts with trying to look at things from an African American point of view.
Through my decades in town, but especially since my involvement in the Justified Anger movement born in the aftermath of the Rev. Alex Gee's essay by that title in the Cap Times in late 2013, I have come to realize that African American-led initiatives in this city face greater scrutiny than do projects and programs led by whites.
When I suggest that possibility in private conversation with black leaders, reactions are routinely affirmative, from a "no-kidding" scoff to a weary nod of resignation. They talk among themselves about how they regard one board they pitch for funding as the "firing squad."
Black leaders perceive that whites making similar pitches don't receive the same skepticism they encounter. Black leaders are quizzed on which other African American leaders are on board with what they propose, for example, as if the black community is homogeneous.
Like it or not, another reality for African American leaders is that they are never off stage. Yes, I can sit there on MLK Day for two hours with them and feel moved by the passion as well, but then I can step away into a much more private world. They remain on that proverbial stage, called away to the next police incident that has a racial component, or to comment on the next troubling report about racial progress in Madison.
Black leaders talk among themselves about whether they think it has been a mistake to raise families in a city where they are so outnumbered and at times disrespected.
It's a reasonable question. Many of those black leaders could easily leave to make more money in culturally friendlier cities with large concentrations of professional blacks, places like Washington, D.C., Chicago or Atlanta. They could be getting their "tickets punched," but they stay and struggle here, working on behalf of their people, especially their children.
For years, blacks here have also felt on the outside looking in when it comes to mainstream media in town. I've been told that our reputation is to show up in their communities not for celebrations of milestones, but only when there is yellow police tape at some crime scene.
These same black leaders are also working with the backdrop of in-your-face groups like Freedom Inc., whose mostly younger members have profanely interrupted Madison School Board meetings to demand police officers be removed from schools. (Ironically, police officers I know say the officers most committed to keeping young people out of "the system" are the very ones who want to work in the schools.)
Anyway, as the MLK event wound down with the governor reading a proclamation, I was mulling those themes.
Leaving the Capitol, it's easy to move on, to write columns about toxic politics, or to think about other stories or to deal with the financial challenges of the newspaper business.
But I recalled an admonition once directed at me after I had been vilified for something I said or didn't say on the subject of race - I can't even recall what it was.
"Paul," someone not involved in the dustup told me, "Stay in the room."
I haven't always, but that seems like pretty sound advice for us.

Texto completo: The double standards have become mind-boggling.
It wasn't all that long ago that we were treated to "exposés," mainly in the right-wing media, of the reckless spending by the Obama family for vacations and golfing trips.
Especially outrageous, we were constantly reminded, was the president's insistence on taking his entire family to Hawaii, his home state, for Christmas each of his eight years in office.
"It requires dozens of Secret Service agents, military personnel and other government employees to guarantee (the Obamas') safety and ease of travel around Oahu," complained the "Moonie" paper the Washington Times.
Thank goodness, the paper reported during the 2016 holidays, this is the last time.
"The Obamas are once again renting a multimillion-dollar oceanfront home in Kailua, a town on the northeast side of the island where houses in the neighborhood fetch around $10 million," it added. "It's near golf courses and a Marine Corps base where the president goes for morning workouts at the gym."
The paper wasn't alone. Most media outlets reported that the holiday trips to Hawaii cost more than $4.8 million and that, times eight, they pointed out, meant taxpayers paid in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the Hawaii getaways.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump himself blistered Obama's "free spending," especially for golfing excursions. Rest assured, Americans were promised, a President Trump would spend most of his time right where he should - in the White House taking care of business "because there's so much work to be done."
Well, maybe not.
According to estimates from the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan agency that keeps track of federal spending, Obama ran up travel expenses of about $97 million during his eight years in office. Trump has blown right past that number in less than three years, mostly on golf trips and vacation time at his own resorts.
In a one-month period in 2017, the GAO found, Trump spent $13.6 million on just four trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. That's $3.4 million per trip. To Florida for a few days. Not to Hawaii for three weeks.
The New York Times editorialized earlier this month that what's more egregious is the administration's attempts to keep the spending secret at least until after the 2020 election.
Democrats, of course, want a complete accounting of not just how much Trump is spending on travel, but how much taxpayers are shelling out for his family as well. And what they'd really like to know is how much of all that spending is winding up as profit for the family itself.
The issue came to a head in recent weeks when Trump's Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, informed Congress he wants to return the Secret Service to his department where it once was until the formation of the Department of Homeland Security several years ago.
Congressional Democrats informed Mnuchin that as part of the deal, they needed to know how much the Secret Service was spending to protect Trump and his family on their travels. Mnuchin said he wouldn't disclose that until after the 2020 election, apparently to prevent the size of the spending from becoming an issue in the campaign.
The same Republicans, though, who were quick to blister Obama for spending too much on travel, don't blink an eye when it comes to Trump.
Just like the size of the national debt - a scandal when Obama was in office - is no longer an issue even though we're adding a trillion dollars to it each year.
Oh, yes. The double standards are alive and well.

Divisiveness

Texto completo: Last week a liberal pundit criticized President Trump for speaking at the annual Right to Life March. That’s a little odd since it implies that while people who oppose abortion are dividing America, while those who favor abortion unite us. Well, that’s not so much odd as it is plain silly. “Divisive” is used as a political accusation because there appear to be lots of voters who have a vague, amiable yearning to see the American population working together for common goals. It doesn’t work in real life, because of a commonplace observation among the political pundits that America is sharply divided between Trumpophiliacs and Trumpophobes. There are many reasons for disagreement between these two factions about goals, but the one about which they can never agree is whether the man should be re-elected, or imprisoned.
So the “you’re divisive…no you’re divisive” charges and counter-charges are mostly meaningless rhetoric. The word, however, is applicable when divisions arise within a group, not between different groups. Last week the New York Times published “A Major Fear for Democrats: Will the Party Come Together by November?” The article reflects the findings from over 50 interviews with Democratic voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Conclusion? A number of those interviewed were seriously uncomfortable with the choices available at this stage of the race. There is a clear reluctance among some to vote for candidate whom they found too liberal, or too centrist.
The NYT reporter, Jonathan Martin, concluded that most Democrats hope that the incendiary loathing for Donald J. Trump will rally support behind the eventual nominee. He turns to Kathleen Sebelius, former Kansas governor, daughter of a former governor of Ohio, and Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2009 until 2014 to sum up the problem. “This primary is a reflection of the politics of the country at large,” she explained. “There are clearly differences among people who still feel incremental change is the best way of getting things done, and folks who say we need more to pursue more radical change.” She admits she would be worried if the Democrats didn’t have hatred for Trump as a rallying cry. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat issued this warning to all his party comrades: “Nobody can afford to get so angry because your first choice did not win. If you stay home in November, you are going to get Trump.”
There we have the paradox which we should spend a couple minutes to savor. Donald Trump, who the liberals have denounced and damned repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly for dividing our country is the man they rely on to unite the Democratic Party. And yes, that’s the same Donald Trump who cast a spell that has united the Republican party so decisively that he faces no serious primary opponent.
Some progressive opinion-makers clearly fear party unity if it gathers around Senator Bernie Sanders. Last week the NYT’s star columnist, the ever-venomous Paul Krugman, wrote a flaming denunciation of the ever-venomous Vermont socialist. I quote “There has always been an ugly edge to some of Sanders’s support, a faction of followers who denounce anyone raising questions about his positions — even Warren! — as a corrupt capitalist shill. Until now, however, you could argue that Sanders himself wasn’t responsible for the bad behavior of some of his supporters. You can’t make that argument now. The dishonest smears and the doubling down on those smears are coming from the top of the Sanders campaign; even if they aren’t coming directly out of Sanders’s mouth, he could and should have stopped them. The fact that Sanders isn’t apologizing to Biden and replacing the people responsible says uncomfortable things about his character.”
A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll seems to show Biden and Sanders in the lead nationally, with Warren, Buttigieg and others now clearly behind. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, Biden is favored by 32 percent with Sanders at 23 percent.
This is ominous news for Democrats who fear that a Sanders primary victory could lead to a general election disaster. Biden may have a temporary lead but his campaign fumbling must cause a great deal of anxiety.
Even as they hammer their competitors the candidates all swear that they will rally around the winner of the primary. I cannot speak for their sincerity, but I’m on solid ground in saying that they don’t wish to burn their bridges ahead of them. They will need party unity to win a general election and they know it.
A recent Emerson College poll found that only 53 percent of current Bernie voters said they would definitely support another Democratic nominee. This reflects the commitment of liberals (a.k.a. “progressives,” a.k.a. “socialists,” a.k.a., “social justice warriors”) to ideological goals, as opposed to a particular party. Readers don’t need to rely on newspapers reporters, or me, to find out about these fanatics. Check these three webpages:
JusticeDemocrats.com, founded after the 2016 defeat that they blamed on Hillary.
ourrevolution.com, this was created by people who ran Sanders 2016 campaign.
democracyforamerica.com, founded in 2004 by former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean.
All three of these organizations spend most of their energies attacking those they choose to call “corporate democrats.” Their preferred targets, in other words, are not Republicans but incumbent Democrats. They aim to reshape the Democratic Party in order to reshape America.

Texto completo: PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — Presidential contenders are flocking to California to appear at top-dollar fundraisers alongside celebrity supporters, hoping the star power will give them the wattage needed to shine bright come Super Tuesday. Everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Mark Ruffalo to Tom Ford has opened their wallets. So who's backing whom?
The Desert Sun. part of the USA TODAY Network, examined a list of individual donors from California who contributed $2,800 to presidential candidates from January to September 2019 — the last time candidates filed reports with the FEC. More than 4,800 Californians contributed $2,800 to presidential campaigns in the first nine months of 2019, the maximum contribution amount FEC rules allow donors to funnel to presidential campaign committees annually.
The crowded field of candidates has fragmented the liberal entertainment industry, most of whom lined up behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama in recent election cycles.
Before her withdrawal from the race, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , received almost 1,300 contributions in California at the $2,800 level, leading the field in her home state. Former South Bend, Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden amassed 991 and 973 contributions, respectively, at that amount, far more than Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. , (154), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , (131), entrepreneur Andrew Yang (54), businessman Tom Steyer (40) and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , (34).
Each of the candidates drew contributions from notable entertainment industry figures. Aside from Drew Carey, who contributed to former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and "The Simpsons" creator Matt Groening, who gave to author Marianne Williamson, most gave to the now-frontrunners with many lining up behind Warren and Buttigieg in particular. Many contributors also didn't exhibit clear preferences in their contributions, preferring instead to hand out $2,800 checks to multiple candidates.
Warren and Sanders have eschewed top-dollar fundraisers this election cycle. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has identified California as a key target, but since he's self-funding his campaign, he hasn't hosted celebrity-dense fundraisers like some of his opponents.
Although he counts few in the entertainment industry among his supporters — with the exceptions of Jon Voight and Kanye West — even President Donald Trump ventured to Los Angeles last year to raise funds for his reelection campaign.
Here's a guide to some of the celebrities and notable Californians financially backing presidential hopefuls ahead of the 2020 election.
Pete Buttigieg
Even before he mingled with Rob Reiner and Martin Sheen and maybe even tried some Goop products at Gwyneth Paltrow's Los Angeles home in May, the 38-year-old former mayor had attracted a wealth of celebrity supporters.
Lesbian power couple Ellen DeGeneres and Portia DeRossi each contributed $2,800 to Buttigieg. DeGeneres co-hosted a fundraiser him in July along with actor Sean Hayes. Talk show host Chelsea Handler and actor Jason Bateman also attended, according to NBC News.
DeGeneres, a veteran Democratic donor, isn't the only LGBTQ entertainment industry titan to throw support behind Buttigieg. George Takei, Matthew Bomer, Dustin Lance Black and Jane Lynch also maxxed out in contributions to Mayor Pete in 2019.
Buttigieg has also received max contributions from Kevin Bacon, Ted Danson, Michael J. Fox and Alyssa Milano.
Elizabeth Warren
Although Warren and Sanders' "hot mic" incident after the January debate could've been written in a Hollywood writers' room, the Los Angeles donor circuit hasn't figured largely in either of their campaigns. Scarlett Johansson has contributed to Warren's campaign and told the Hollywood Reporter the Massachusetts senator "was thoughtful and progressive but realistic. " Warren has received contributions from Trump foe Rosie O'Donnell as well as actresses Amy Schumer and Amber Tamblyn. She's also gotten cash from John Legend and Chrissy Teigen.
Joe Biden
Filmmaker Rob Reiner may have contributed to several candidates, but he's lined up squarely behind Biden. He told entertainment news site The Blast he believes the former vice president has the best chance at unseating Trump. Many of the notable Californians who've contributed to Biden have also funneled cash to other campaigns.
Former HP CEO Meg Whitman, a longtime Republican activist and 2010 gubernatorial candidate, worked for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, but broke with the Republican Party in 2016 to back former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton against Trump. She endorsed former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa against Gavin Newsom in California's 2018 governor's race and has contributed $2,800 to Biden's bid to be the Democratic Party's 2020 nominee.
Bernie Sanders
Sanders has received large contributions from several Hollywood progressives, including actress Shailene Woodley, who in 2016 was arrested while protesting the Keystone XL pipeline in North Dakota; "Dark Waters" actor Mark Ruffalo; and actress Susan Sarandon, who also supported Sanders' 2016 bid and faced criticism for spreading misinformation about voter registration.
'Equal opportunity' donors
Many campaign financiers with the resources spread the wealth rather than back one candidate.
Dreamworks' co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, philanthropist Marilyn Katzenberg, have contributed the maximum amount allowed to 14 candidates running in the Democratic presidential primary, including rBiden, Warren, Klobuchar and Buttigieg.
Venture capitalist and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has contributed the maximum amount to Warren and Buttigieg and, before their withdrawals, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J.
Television writer and producer Greg Berlanti has contributed to Buttigieg, Harris and Klobuchar. Berlanti, who directed the 2018 coming out film "Love Simon," told Variety it meant a "tremendous amount" to see LGBTQ representation in a presidential race.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has contributed $2,800 to Yang, Gabbard and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee before he exited the race. Vox Recode reported that Dorsey denied Gabbard's request that he host a fundraiser on her behalf.
Venture capitalist and LinkedIn founder Reed Hoffman has contributed to Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. , and Klobuchar, and before their withdrawals, Harris, Inslee, Booker, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N. Y.
POM Wonderful and Fiji Water's Lynda Resnick contributed to Bennet, Booker, Klobuchar, Biden and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Resnick and her husband, Stewart Resnick, own more water rights than any other party in California, including the city of Los Angeles.
Designer and filmmaker Tom Ford contributed to both Biden and Buttigieg, who declined Ford's offer to dress him on the campaign trail, according to the New York Times.
People who backed candidates who've dropped out
A lot of celebs lined up behind Harris, their home state senator, and Booker, a longtime Hollywood favorite who's dating Rosario Dawson, before the two dropped out of the race.
Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas, and Leonardo DiCaprio all contributed the maximum amount to both Harris and Booker before both withdrew from the race. Affleck joined up with Katzenberg to host a benefit for Booker in May.
Star Wars director J. J. Abrams, actress Elizabeth Banks and actor Michael Douglas contributed to Harris. DJ Steve Aoki contributed to Booker. Abrams, according to the Los Angeles Times, contributed more than $33,000 to Harris while she campaigned to be California attorney general and U. S. senator.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca ha emitido una amenaza formal al ex asesor de seguridad nacional John Bolton para evitar que publique su libro, “La habitación donde sucedió: una memoria de la Casa Blanca”, según le dijeron a CNN fuentes familiarizadas con el asunto.
Trump despidió a Bolton en septiembre porque estaba en desacuerdo con el consejo de Bolton. Bolton en ese momento discutió las circunstancias de su expulsión, diciendo públicamente que ofreció renunciar.
En una carta al abogado de Bolton que CNN publica, un alto funcionario del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional escribió que el manuscrito inédito del libro de Bolton “parece contener cantidades significativas de información clasificada” y no se puede publicar como está escrito.
La carta, fechada el 23 de enero, dice que parte de la información se clasificó en el nivel de “alto secreto”, lo que significa que “razonablemente podría esperarse que cause un daño excepcionalmente grave a la seguridad nacional”.
El manuscrito no puede publicarse ni divulgarse sin la eliminación de esta información clasificada”, dice la carta.
La Casa Blanca no hizo comentarios al respecto a CNN. Ni Bolton ni un portavoz de la editorial, Simon & Schuster, respondieron a una solicitud de comentarios tampoco.
La carta llega cuando el presidente Donald Trump ataca a Bolton en Twitter, y el abogado de Bolton acusa a la Casa Blanca de corromper el proceso de investigación del libro de Bolton al compartir el contenido del libro con aquellos que están fuera de la División de Administración de Registros del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.
Los tuits de Trump que atacaron a Bolton el miércoles por la mañana sugieren que conoce el contenido del manuscrito.
….many more mistakes of judgement, gets fired because frankly, if I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now, and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2020
Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this “nonsense” a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated. He said, not that it matters, NOTHING!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2020
Informes de The New York Times sugieren que el libro de Bolton detalla una época en agosto pasado cuando el presidente vinculó directamente $391 millones en ayuda de seguridad a Ucrania con que el gobierno de ese país realizara investigaciones sobre el ex vicepresidente Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter.
El presidente ha hecho reiteradamente afirmaciones infundadas y falsas sobre Joe Biden en relación con Ucrania.
Los abogados defensores del presidente en su juicio político en el Senado han criticado a los demócratas en el juicio político de la Cámara de Representantes, por no haber presentado testigos de primera mano que aleguen que cualquier quid pro quo vino del propio presidente.
Trump ha sugerido que podría intentar afirmar el privilegio ejecutivo y bloquear el testimonio de Bolton, si se permite que se presente ante el Senado, aunque los expertos legales dicen que los tweets del presidente que describen sus conversaciones con Bolton sobre Ucrania podrían socavar cualquier afirmación de Trump.

Muere Kobe Bryant: el sistema que podría haber alertado al piloto del helicóptero de que se acercaba a una colina

Texto completo: Las investigaciones sobre las causas del accidente que terminó con la muerte de la leyenda de la NBA, Kobe Bryant, de su hija y otras 7 personas, continúan desarrollándose.
Este martes, funcionarios de la Junta Nacional de Seguridad del Transporte de Estados Unidos (NTSB, por sus siglas en inglés) señalaron que el helicóptero en el que se estrelló el deportista no estaba equipado con un sistema de alerta de terreno que podría haber ayudado al piloto a advertir que se estaba acercando a una ladera.
* Qué dice el audio de los últimos momentos del vuelo en el que murió Kobe Bryant
Según la NTSB, la aeronave estaba a 2.300 pies cuando perdió la comunicación con los controladores de tráfico aéreo.
El helicóptero Sikorsky S-76 descendía a más de 2.000 pies por minuto en el momento del impacto (a una altura de 1.085 pies), lo que hace presumir a los investigadores que el choque fue intenso.
El sistema de alerta de terreno puede ayudar a prevenir accidentes, especialmente cuando los pilotos tienen visibilidad limitada , al proporcionar una imagen detallada del terreno circundante, y activar advertencias auditivas y visuales.
Aún así, no se ha determinado si este mecanismo habría podido evitado el choque del helicóptero por sí solo pues pueden haber existido otros problemas, como un error del piloto o fallas mecánicas.
* Quiénes son las otras 7 víctimas del accidente de helicóptero en el que murieron Kobe Bryant y su hija Gianna
Gregory A. Feith , ex investigador de seguridad aérea de la NTSB, le dijo al The New York Times que los sistemas de alerta de terreno pueden ser útiles para los pilotos, pero que también pueden generar tantas advertencias que fácilmente pueden dejar de ser atendidos.
Getty ImagesMiles de personas han rendido homenaje en Los Ángeles a la leyenda de la NBA.
“Con lo que el piloto estaba haciendo con Kobe Bryant, sería beneficioso, pero cuando sigues una carretera con colinas cercanas, obtienes advertencias falsas”, dijo Feith. “Y con advertencias falsas, tiendes a ignorarlas”, agregó.
El modelo Sikorsky S-76, que tiene motores gemelos de turboeje, ha estado volando desde la década de 1970 y es considerado como un medio de transporte altamente seguro.
* “Era un ícono entre los latinos”: las emotivas reacciones en Los Ángeles y en todo el mundo tras la muerte de Kobe Bryant
* Amor y telenovelas: así se forjó la estrecha relación del fallecido Kobe Bryant con el español y la comunidad latina
Por lo mismo, ha sido utilizado para servicios de ambulancia aérea y es una opción popular entre autoridades, empresarios y celebridades. La reina Isabel y su familia, por ejemplo, lo utilizan para trasladarse desde hace años.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca ha emitido una amenaza formal al ex asesor de seguridad nacional John Bolton para evitar que publique su libro, “La habitación donde sucedió: una memoria de la Casa Blanca”, según le dijeron a CNN fuentes familiarizadas con el asunto.
Trump despidió a Bolton en septiembre porque estaba en desacuerdo con el consejo de Bolton. Bolton en ese momento discutió las circunstancias de su expulsión, diciendo públicamente que ofreció renunciar.
En una carta al abogado de Bolton que CNN publica, un alto funcionario del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional escribió que el manuscrito inédito del libro de Bolton “parece contener cantidades significativas de información clasificada” y no se puede publicar como está escrito.
La carta, fechada el 23 de enero, dice que parte de la información se clasificó en el nivel de “alto secreto”, lo que significa que “razonablemente podría esperarse que cause un daño excepcionalmente grave a la seguridad nacional”.
El manuscrito no puede publicarse ni divulgarse sin la eliminación de esta información clasificada”, dice la carta.
La Casa Blanca no hizo comentarios al respecto a CNN. Ni Bolton ni un portavoz de la editorial, Simon & Schuster, respondieron a una solicitud de comentarios tampoco.
La carta llega cuando el presidente Donald Trump ataca a Bolton en Twitter, y el abogado de Bolton acusa a la Casa Blanca de corromper el proceso de investigación del libro de Bolton al compartir el contenido del libro con aquellos que están fuera de la División de Administración de Registros del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.
Los tuits de Trump que atacaron a Bolton el miércoles por la mañana sugieren que conoce el contenido del manuscrito.
….many more mistakes of judgement, gets fired because frankly, if I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now, and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2020
Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this “nonsense” a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated. He said, not that it matters, NOTHING!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2020
Informes de The New York Times sugieren que el libro de Bolton detalla una época en agosto pasado cuando el presidente vinculó directamente $391 millones en ayuda de seguridad a Ucrania con que el gobierno de ese país realizara investigaciones sobre el ex vicepresidente Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter.
El presidente ha hecho reiteradamente afirmaciones infundadas y falsas sobre Joe Biden en relación con Ucrania.
Los abogados defensores del presidente en su juicio político en el Senado han criticado a los demócratas en el juicio político de la Cámara de Representantes, por no haber presentado testigos de primera mano que aleguen que cualquier quid pro quo vino del propio presidente.
Trump ha sugerido que podría intentar afirmar el privilegio ejecutivo y bloquear el testimonio de Bolton, si se permite que se presente ante el Senado, aunque los expertos legales dicen que los tweets del presidente que describen sus conversaciones con Bolton sobre Ucrania podrían socavar cualquier afirmación de Trump.

Goldberg: Discrediting Bolton won’t be easy for Team Trump

Texto completo: “I’m with the Bush-Cheney team, and I’m here to stop the count.”
Those words were bellowed by John Bolton in a Tallahassee library in December 2000, when he was part of a team of Republican lawyers trying to stop the Florida recount of votes cast in the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Until now, it was the most famous utterance President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser had ever made. That’s about to change with the looming publication of his book, due out in March, about serving in the Trump administration. It’s even vaguely possible Bolton could make an appearance in Trump’s impeachment trial this week.
Still, it’s worth considering the irony of Bolton’s earlier words. The Bush-Gore Florida recount wasn’t the beginning of our divided times, but it was a major inflection point. It pushed the internal combustion engine of partisanship into a higher gear, and we’ve never really revved back down. Now, Bolton is in the strange position of not fitting comfortably on either side of the partisan divide.
The gist of Bolton’s story is that the president’s story is not true. According to an account of the book’s contents reported in the New York Times, Bolton heard Trump say he was withholding aid to the Ukrainians pending an investigation into Biden and other Democrats. (One wonders who these other Democrats were.)
The Times story says the book also contradicts statements about who knew what and when inside the administration, no doubt causing heartburn for acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, off-book fixer Rudy Giuliani and, of course, all of the GOP senators determined to avoid hearing from witnesses in the impeachment trial.
The response from Trump World is predictable. Bolton is a disgruntled liar, bitter over being fired and desperate to sell books. I have no doubt Bolton, a former colleague of mine at the American Enterprise Institute, is disgruntled. I’m also sure he very much wants to sell books. But I don’t buy the lying part.
Bolton may be many of the things his detractors claim, but he’s also an incredibly adept lawyer and bureaucratic infighter. On different occasions when National Security Council staffers Fiona Hill and Tim Morrison were dismayed by what the president was up to with Ukraine, Bolton’s advice was to “tell the lawyers” (in Morrison’s words). When Hill told Bolton that she’d heard Gordon Sondland — Trump’s EU ambassador and administration point person on the Ukrainian scheme — tell the Ukrainians that he and Mulvaney would arrange a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation of Biden, Bolton replied, “You go and tell (NSC counsel John Eisenberg) that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you’ve heard and what I’ve said.”
The notion that Bolton, a legendary note-taker, would volunteer to testify — if subpoenaed —only to perjure himself is absurd. That he would make false allegations in a book without contemporaneous corroboration seems far-fetched as well. There’s only one way to know, though: Have Bolton tell his version under oath.
As of this writing, the ink on the official “Destroy Bolton” narrative hasn’t dried yet, but an early contender is the charge that this is all just a replay of the tactics Democrats used to try to derail Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Promoting his new podcast, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted, “Last week we had Lev Parnas on Maddow & ‘secret tapes’; this week, the ‘Bolton revelations.’ It’s the same approach Dems & media followed during the Kavanaugh hearing.”
Except it’s not at all. The only thing similar about the two controversies is that new allegations kept inconveniencing politicians who wanted to move on. By that standard, nearly every unfolding Washington scandal is like the Kavanaugh hearings.
Putting aside the hilarity of John “Stop the Count” Bolton being a willing pawn of the Democrats, there were no recorded telephone calls confirming elements of the allegations against Kavanaugh. None of the Kavanaugh accusations had the sort of corroboration and material evidence already in the public record in the impeachment case. And Trump’s former national security adviser isn’t relying on a decades-old unverifiable recollection, but on his memory of events from a few months ago.
The biggest difference between how the Senate handled the Kavanaugh smear campaign and how it’s handling the impeachment case is this: With Kavanaugh, Senate Republicans bent over backward to hear from witnesses; with Trump, they’ve gone into a defensive crouch to avoid it. And that may not be enough any longer.

Texto completo: Democrats on Tuesday sharply criticized a plan suggested by Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) that would effectively involve a witness trade in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, giving each party the chance to call one witness.
Any such deal would likely lead to testimony from both John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, whom Democrats want to hear from, and Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, whom Republicans hope to question. Democrats quickly rejected the suggestion, though majority Republicans could push it forward on their own.
"What can Hunter Biden tell us about the president's conduct with Ukraine? What can Hunter Biden tell us about the president's obstruction of Congress? Nothing," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said at a news conference Tuesday morning. "Obviously, the bottom line is very simple. They are always looking for a shiny object to divert attention from the facts."
Schumer later added, "We're not bargaining with them. We want four witnesses and four sets of documents, then the truth will come out."
Appearing Tuesday morning on MSNBC and echoing a fellow Democratic senator who made the same argument, Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said: "Why on earth would we engage in that kind of a crazy quid-pro-quo where we trade a relevant witness for an irrelevant witness in the middle of a quid-pro-quo trial?"
The private maneuvering by Toomey and Democratic response comes as the Senate nears formal votes on witnesses, one of the only major remaining uncertainties in a trial that has largely played out as expected. After the White House concluded its opening arguments Tuesday, the Senate could vote on witnesses by the end of the week, deciding whether Bolton or others ever speak under oath about what they know.
The pressure on the GOP has ratcheted up since the New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton, for a forthcoming book, wrote that Trump personally told him he was withholding $391 million in military aid to Ukraine unless the country began an investigation into the Bidens, confirming the central accusation in the impeachment charges.
Bolton, who has said he would testify if subpoenaed, would be the first witness with firsthand information to directly link Trump to the plot. The report about his book has rocked the trial after weeks of Republican resistance to calling witnesses.
"We want the truth," Schumer said Tuesday, arguing that testimony from Bolton and other top White House officials is critical to understanding Trump's actions.
Toomey offered fellow Republicans one way out of the jam Monday, privately floating a plan, reported by the Washington Post, to allow one witness for each party. The idea would give wavering Republicans an opening to call Bolton while also putting a spotlight on Hunter Biden - aiding the White House defense.
Even if Democrats reject the plan, the GOP majority could have enough votes to subpoena them both, and many Republicans will face pressure from conservatives to put a Biden under questioning.
Toomey's office has not commented on the trade proposal.
Democrats cannot call Bolton without support from at least four Republican senators. But it's not clear how much support Toomey's idea has within the GOP. Some senators on Tuesday were looking at other options - such as making Bolton's book available to senators in a classified setting - and others suggested that they still opposed the idea of having anyone testify.
Democrats argue that Hunter Biden is not relevant to the central facts of the case: that Trump used his office to pressure a foreign country to harm Joe Biden's prospects in the 2020 election, and then blocked Congress' investigation of the matter.
The Trump team argues the president withheld aid because he was concerned about corruption in Ukraine, particularly Hunter Biden's high-paid role with an energy company, Burisma, that had previously come under investigation.
Joe Biden, as vice president, led a push to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor while his son sat on the company's board. Biden was carrying out the official policy of the United States and its European allies in trying to oust a prosecutor noted for being soft on corruption. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing, and the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time.
Toomey has been noncommittal when it comes to whether he will support calling witnesses. He hasn't closed the door, but has also raised concerns that issuing a subpoena could lead to a legal fight that drags out the trial.
On Monday, hours after the Bolton news broke, a spokesman said that "Sen. Toomey's position remains unchanged" and that he would decide about calling witnesses after Trump's attorneys conclude and senators ask their questions. Toomey did not answer reporters' questions Tuesday.

And he's said he sees a "high bar" for taking that step, arguing that any witness would have to have information so compelling it might change votes on the verdict .
"The criteria is not 'Does the witness have something interesting to say?'" Toomey said Friday in an interview with The Inquirer and the Allentown Morning Call. "The criteria is, 'Are they likely to be able to shed definitive light on a disputed issue that is so central to this case that the resolution of it could change my final conclusion?' So, that's a high bar."
He also argued that Hunter Biden is a relevant witness.
"The Democrats' argument ... largely rests on this notion that the only possible explanation for the president's wishing to have an investigation is the president's personal corruption, that there is no other possible explanation," Toomey said.
On Monday, hours after the Bolton news broke, a spokesman said that "Sen. Toomey's position remains unchanged" and that he would decide about calling witnesses after Trump's attorneys conclude and senators ask their questions. Toomey did not answer reporters' questions Tuesday.

nCoV-2019 isn’t novel, and we know what to do

Resumen: What people are saying about the coronavirus from Wuhan, China.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=nCoV-2019+isn%26rsquo%3Bt+novel%2C+and+we+know+what+to+do&amp;author=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2020-01-29&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: Laurie Garrett, CNN: “Seventeen years ago, I was covering the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus for several months as it spread across Asia, eventually reaching 37countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them. . . . By far, the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. . . . Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: One had just a single health care worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments. The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training. ”
OUR VIEW: Coronavirus offers reasons for concern but not for panic
David Quammen, The New York Times: “‘Novel coronavirus of 2019’ . . . isn’t as novel as you might think. . . . Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, (is) a senior author of the draft paper that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name. It was Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, showed that the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics. . . . When you’re done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one. Or do something about the current circumstances, (which) include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere. That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis, but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume — with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan, China. ”
Frank Sieren, Deutsche Welle, Germany: “The scale of Beijing’s measures so far is unprecedented. Only an authoritarian one-party state could have implemented them so rapidly: Some 56million people are under quarantine and air, rail and long-distance bus traffic has been suspended in at least 14 cities. What is incredible is that there have been no demonstrations, let alone riots, in the regions affected. . . . The situation was different with the 2002-03 SARS outbreak: The scale of the epidemic was played down for months. By the time it had been brought under control, 800 people had died. Now, Beijing is providing information about the number of cases and casualties almost every hour. Even the construction of the new hospital is . . . live-streamed. ”
Vin Gupta, NBC News: "As a pulmonologist in Seattle, near where the first case of the new coronavirus was confirmed in the United States last week, I relied heavily on the city’s hospitals, clinics and departments of health to protect our community. And they did so admirably, immediately acting decisively and shrewdly despite the fear and uncertainty that always arises with an invisible biological threat. . . . Just 0. 19% of the U. S. budget goes toward pandemic preparedness overseas. Yet any money that we do spend means we mitigate the risk of facing outbreaks at home. . . . It’s not just inadequate funding that keeps us behind. Two high-profile global health security experts departed the administration in 2018, diminishing the chances that leadership from within may change these dangerous realities. Which means that unless hospitals and providers are given the necessary financial resources, Americans may soon be more vulnerable to threats like Ebola and coronavirus that pay no attention to politics or budgetary cycles but which demand a health system ready and primed to respond.

Texto completo: I agree with Lanhee J. Chen (" The Myth of the 'Moderate' Public Option ," op-ed, Jan. 24). The notion that a public option is a moderate and therefore less destructive approach to health-care reform than a universal health-care system is false. The only efficient reform would be Medicare for All.
A public option would increase premiums for those with major illnesses. Private insurers would siphon away healthier persons from the general insurance pool by offering inexpensive but noncomprehensive plans, plans designed to appeal to those with few medical needs.
In addition, multiple-payer systems with or without a public option would perpetuate exorbitant administrative costs. For example, in 2018 Canada's single-payer system spent $196 per person on hospital administrative costs; the U.S., $933. A single-payer system, unlike multiple-payer systems, has the power to negotiate volume discounts with the pharmaceutical and durable-medical-equipment industries.
A public option added to the current hodgepodge of private plans would be more likely to increase the overall cost of health care rather than to improve either its quality or its distribution. Only a single-payer system will truly save money. Do the math. Unexpected bills from out-of-network consultants? Gone. Exorbitant bills for generic drugs? Gone. Obviously, in a universal system added beneficiaries will bring added cost. However, in the long run these expenditures would be more than balanced by savings. This notion is confirmed by a comprehensive cost analysis of New York Health, the single-payer system now under consideration by the state's legislature.
I agree with Lahnee Chen's premise. We need a more universal resolution of the problem.

The myth pushed, most notably by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman during the debate over ObamaCare, citing the Veterans Affairs system as evidence that the federal government had a comparative advantage over the private sector in quality and cost of health-care services, was exposed by subsequent scandals. Yet politicians continue to push the myth of the government's comparative advantage in providing health insurance.
No U.S. government health-insurance entity has ever been run on an actuarially sound basis. Armed with opaque tax, regulatory and capital subsidies, politicians and their "mission" regulators direct them to underprice risk, particularly for infrequent catastrophic events, driving out private competitors. The government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac essentially provided insurance for catastrophic mortgage credit losses. When they failed in 2008, politicians and regulators argued that "nobody could have seen that coming," followed by a bailout because "there were no private competitors."
The pretense of public "insurance" makes the public cost of subsidies opaque: good politics but bad policy. Fifty-five years of political tinkering has produced a noxious Rube Goldberg contraption in desperate need of creative destruction.

White House Says John Bolton's Manuscript Can't Be Published As Is; National Security Council says the former Trump adviser's book contains 'significant amounts' of classified information that must be cut

Texto completo: The National Security Council said the manuscript of former national security adviser John Bolton's forthcoming book contains "significant amounts" of classified information and can't be published in its current form, according to a letter the council sent to Mr. Bolton's lawyer.
"Under federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information," said the letter , dated Jan. 23, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The letter was signed by Ellen Knight, senior director for Records, Access and Information Security Management at the NSC.
Mr. Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," is expected to go on sale on March 17, and will be published by Simon & Schuster, a unit of ViacomCBS Inc.
On Sunday, the New York Times published details of the manuscript, including that Mr. Bolton alleges President Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Mr. Trump's top 2020 rivals, and Mr. Biden's son. Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, confirmed the report .
The claim goes to the heart of Democrats' case for impeachment and contradicts the White House's argument that the decision to hold up nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine wasn't related to the president's push for investigations there.
It isn't known whether any of the details that have been revealed about the book were among those the NSC deemed classified.
Mr. Trump said in a tweet Monday that he never told Mr. Bolton the aid was linked to the investigations, and in another tweet Wednesday described Mr. Bolton's book as "a nasty & untrue book," adding, "All Classified National Security. Who would do this?"
Mr. Cooper, the recipient of the NSC letter, later Wednesday released his email response to the NSC, dated Jan. 24, in which he sought urgent guidance from the NSC on what it deemed classified ahead of possible testimony by Mr. Bolton before the impeachment trial.
"As you are no doubt aware, the House Managers in the Senate impeachment trial have made clear their intention to seek Ambassador Bolton's testimony at trial," he wrote. "If he is called to testify, it seems certain that he will be asked questions that will elicit much of the information contained in the chapter of his manuscript dealing with his involvement in matters relating to Ukraine."
He said that while he did not believe that information "could reasonably be considered classified," he asked the NSC to turn over the results of its review of that chapter as soon as possible. Mr. Cooper said he didn't receive a response to his email.
Former administration officials who have held a security clearance are required to submit manuscripts to the agency that held their clearance—in Mr. Bolton's case, the NSC. Federal law prohibits the disclosure of classified information. As part of the process of obtaining a security clearance, Mr. Bolton had to agree to obtain signoff from the administration before disclosing information about his time at the White House, including by writing a book.
A spokesman for Simon & Schuster and a spokeswoman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment.
On Dec. 30, Mr. Cooper said Mr. Bolton's manuscript had been submitted to the NSC for "standard pre-publication security review for classified information."
Mr. Bolton's book became available for preorders on Sunday night, and has generated enough interest to rank at No. 10 on Amazon's Top 100 best seller list and No. 14 on the Barnes & Noble Top 100 list as of Wednesday afternoon.
A group of former U.S. intelligence and military officials in April filed suit against the Trump administration over rules requiring them to submit book manuscripts and other writings for review, arguing that the system of pre-publication review amounts to unconstitutional censorship .
In January 2018, a lawyer for Mr. Trump sought to block the publication of Michael Wolff's book "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House." Since Mr. Wolff didn't hold a security clearance and wasn't a White House official, he didn't have to run his book by the White House. The publisher, Henry Holt & Co., an imprint of Macmillan, instead moved up the release date. The book, which booksellers said benefited from Mr. Trump's response, became a national best seller.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO—Lyft Inc. said Wednesday that it cut 90 jobs, or 1.6% of its workforce, as it aims to turn a profit by the end of next year.
The layoffs affected employees in sales and marketing, according to company spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna. Lyft's sales team is "re-prioritising certain markets," she said, while the marketing department is consolidating city-by-city groups into regional teams.
"We've carefully evaluated the resources we need to achieve our 2020 business goals, and the restructuring of some of our teams reflects that," Ms. LaManna said in an emailed statement. "We are still growing rapidly and plan to hire more than 1,000 new employees this year." Lyft has about 5,500 employees.
The layoffs were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Lyft and its rival Uber Technologies Inc. are under pressure from investors to show a path to profitable growth. Both companies went public last year with heavy losses on their books, and each has said it expects to become profitable by the end of 2021.
Uber shed more than 1,100 jobs amid a broad restructuring last year.
This month, Uber sold its food-delivery business in India , which accounted for more than a quarter of Uber Eats' losses during the first nine months of 2019.
Electric scooter-rental startups, which burst onto the scene on the back of venture-capital money, are also refocusing in an effort to make money. Lime said this month it would lay off 14% of its workforce. Lyft pulled its e-scooters from some American cities late last year, in a move that resulted in 20 job cuts.
Lyft wouldn't say if more cuts are planned. Its shares closed down 2.8% Wednesday.

AS WHITE HOUSE WRAPS UP DEFENSE, SUPPORT GROWS FOR WITNESSES IN TRUMP'S SENATE TRIAL CRUCIAL VOTE MAY COME LATER THIS WEEK

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's defense team wrapped up arguments Tuesday by framing the Senate impeachment trial as a dangerously partisan exercise by House Democrats that failed to produce enough evidence to justify Mr. Trump's removal from office.
But requests to obtain that evidence, House Democrats shot back, have been blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate.
That opposition appeared to be weakening ahead of a critical vote on witnesses and documents scheduled later this week.
Multiple media outlets Tuesday evening reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated in a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans that he did not yet have enough votes to defeat the effort to call additional witnesses and evidence.
Support among Republicans for a deal to call a number of witnesses grew amid revelations this week that John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, detailed in his upcoming memoir the president's actions to pressure Ukraine.
Leaked details published by The New York Times revealed Mr. Bolton believed Mr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure the American ally to investigate a political rival. The motivations behind the freeze on aid, which the White House team has disputed, was at the core of the House Democrats' impeachment case.
Several moderate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, said Mr. Bolton's manuscript makes a stronger case for witnesses.
Some more conservative members have jumped on board. On Tuesday, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called on the White House to provide the Senate with a copy of Mr. Bolton's book draft.
"I am encouraging the White House, anybody that I can talk to, to say: That manuscript is pertinent, and we should get access to that manuscript to see what they're actually saying," Mr. Lankford said in a video posted to Facebook on Tuesday.
Even Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., floated a "one-for-one" deal in which the two parties would each call an equal number of witnesses, according to multiple sources. His office declined to comment.
At least four Senate Republicans would have to join all 45 Senate Democrats plus two Independent senators who vote with the Democrats, to approve a resolution to call witnesses. That decision is expected Friday.
The trial now turns to a two-day questioning period, in which senators will have up to eight hours each day to interrogate both sides, Mr. McConnell said.
Senators will submit their questions in writing to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial. Mr. McConnell told the senators their questions should be "thoughtful and brief."
Justice Roberts said he wants the answers from House Democrats and White House counsel to be no more than five minutes, adhering to the standard set in former President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used less than two hours Tuesday to drive home their final points. In total, the defense team used less than half of its allotted 24 hours, while House Democrats consumed nearly all of it.
House Democrats have asserted that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden is running in the Democratic primary for a chance to oppose Mr. Trump in this year's presidential election.
After a 12-week impeachment inquiry last fall, the House of Representatives voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The defense team has argued the president had legitimate concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the requests for a probe into Burisma and Hunter Biden were proper.
In their closing arguments, the lawyers warned of the dangerous precedent Mr. Trump's impeachment would set. White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone said the president's removal from office would inflict"serious and lasting damage" on the country.
"Why not trust the American people with this decision?" Mr. Cipollone said to all 100 senators before him. "Why tear up their ballots?"
In his final minutes, Mr. Cipollone rolled video of House Democrats condemning Mr. Clinton's impeachment using similar language Republicans are using today.
While Mr. Bolton's book consumed the hallway chatter off the Senate floor, the White House defense virtually ignored the revelations.
One mention came from famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who took the floor Monday to argue presidents cannot be impeached if they are not found to have committed a crime. That reasoning, questioned by impeachment scholars, has been adopted by some Republicans to shut down requests for witnesses.
"Nothing in the Bolton revelation, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power," Mr. Dershowitz said.
After the session ended Tuesday, House Democrats held a press conference to keep up the pressure.
"You simply can't have a fair trial without witnesses," said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has led the team of six House impeachment managers in the Senate trial.

Dietary supplements, largely unregulated, deserve the state's skepticism

Texto completo: BROOKLINE — Get Extreme Energy with Our Most Intense Formula! High Velocity Weight Loss. Promotes Vitality, Stamina and Sexual Health. Nighttime Free Testosterone Booster. Explosive Energy and Performance. New! Enhanced Mental Focus.
Welcome to the Wild West section of your local pharmacy, otherwise known as the dietary supplements aisle — a place so dangerous, and so unregulated, that it would try the most dedicated libertarian.
There, shelves are jammed with shiny, expensive boxes of pills and powders, their word-salad labels promising to shrink bellies, improve concentration, build muscle, and improve sexual prowess.
Americans embrace those spurious claims to the tune of some $50 billion a year. Who knows what's really in those boxes? Hardly anybody on the planet. The manufacturers literally do not have to tell us.
“If a company says its product is safe, the Food and Drug Administration has to take their word for it, unless somebody ends up in the hospital or dies," said Pieter Cohen, a doctor at Cambridge Health Alliance who is an expert on dietary supplements.
At best, these products are a waste of money, Cohen says. At worst — well, the worst can be very bad, indeed. Weight loss, energy, and other supplements send tens of thousands of people to emergency rooms each year, according to a CDC study. Some have led to liver failure and death.
This week, I took a spin with Cohen through a couple of stores to see what was on offer.
“See here?" he said, turning over a black box and peering at the tiny print. “Yohimbine. This shows up in a lot of male enhancement products."
It's a bark extract believed to be an aphrodisiac. It's also been linked to high blood pressure, panic attacks, headaches, and, at high doses, heart failure and death. High concentrations of caffeine, which is packed into every other product on these shelves, are similarly dangerous.
The stuff on some of these labels is troubling enough, but what they leave out worries Cohen just as much: Companies can hide ingredients by calling their blends proprietary. There's no way of knowing if a product is naturally derived, or even if it's laced with some amphetamine-like substance manufactured in a country with even worse oversight than ours. Nor do they have to back up their spurious health claims with reputable science.
We're on our own, thanks in large part to former senator Orrin Hatch who represented Utah, where a big share of the dietary supplement industry has made its home (and contributed generously to his campaigns). In 1994, Hatch shepherded through legislation effectively excluding those supplements from FDA oversight. Under his rules, the federal government must rely on supplement companies' own claims of safety and efficacy. The FDA can't demand testing before a diet pill hits the shelves, or stop companies from making bogus health claims. Essentially, the legislation prevents the government from protecting us until people start falling ill. And even then, toothless federal authorities have moved glacially.
It's bad enough that adults take their chances on this snake oil. But we currently allow kids to buy these products, too. That's right: Your 13-year-old can go into Walgreens or CVS, plonk down 30 or 40 bucks, and walk out with a box of “Sexual Peak Performance" or an “ultimate super fat-burning belly bulge kit."
Obviously, kids are particularly susceptible to these products' claims — especially when they're being sold in drug stores, which lend them a veneer of cred they don't deserve.
“We have young people growing up believing the way they appear physically is their defining feature," said Bryn Austin, a professor at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health who specializes in eating disorders. “That sets them up for escalating weight control methods, and for any kind of pill or potion they can find that will keep them from gaining weight."
Can we at least agree that kids deserve the protection withheld from the rest of us?
Representative Kay Khan sure hopes so. The Newton Democrat has been working with Austin on a measure to ban sales of these dietary supplements to minors altogether. Her bill would also move the supplements to a more inaccessible location — behind a counter or in a locked case, for example.
Both measures should be no-brainers. Kahn says she is hopeful the bill will make it out of the Joint Committee on Public Health by a Feb. 5 deadline, given “the growing awareness around toxic diet culture."
At a time when a large chunk of the federal government seems determined to dismantle itself to honor some distorted definition of liberty, the dietary supplement industry is a vivid reminder of the absolute necessity of oversight.
But Washington seems unlikely to step up any time soon. So it's up to Massachusetts legislators to step up and do some good here.
And more than good: They could actually save lives.

New England colleges suspend study abroad programs to China, call students back, in light of coronavirus outbreak

Texto completo: More than 10 colleges and universities in New England have suspended their spring study abroad programs in China and some are scrambling to bring back students already there, amid rising concern over the fast-spreading coronavirus that has sickened thousands and led to more than 130 deaths.
The decision by the schools comes amid similar reactions by companies that do business in China. A growing number of major airlines have halted or reduced flights to and from the country.
The international community is struggling with how to respond to the outbreak, particularly in China, which now has more cases of the mysterious illness than it had with SARS, a respiratory infection, that spread across that country in 2002 and 2003, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.
During the SARS outbreak, China reported 5,327 cases and 349 deaths. The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus increased to 6,065 worldwide Wednesday, with all but 68 of the infections taking place in mainland China, the organization said.
Five US cases have been reported, but no deaths.
In New England, Boston University's program in Shanghai, slated to begin in the middle of February, has been “indefinitely postponed," spokesman Colin Riley said. Twenty students had signed up for the program but had not left yet.
The University of Rhode Island suspended its three study abroad programs in China, and arranged to bring home seven students who had already been studying there, a spokesman said.
“We made a decision yesterday to get all seven students home," Dave Lavallee, assistant director of communications and marketing at URI, said Wednesday. “We called the parents and students by 2 p.m., and they're on their way back."
None of the students have had any symptoms of the virus, and they lived in relatively low-risk areas in China, Lavallee said.
Middlebury College in Vermont has canceled a program it operates in China for students from both the private school and other colleges. Thirty-seven students were signed up to attend. Ten of those students are currently in China and all will be out by Saturday, spokeswoman Sarah Ray said.
“This is not a decision we take lightly but there is too much at stake to risk any other course of action," dean of international programs Carlos Velez said in a statement.
Although the University of Maine Orono did not have any study abroad programs in China planned for the spring, two students from the university are in China with another exchange program, spokeswoman Margaret Nagle said. The university is working to return the students to the United States.
Harvard University did not immediately have information on how many students or faculty are currently in China or planning to go there soon, but officials sent the entire university community an e-mail discouraging anyone from traveling there and urging safety precautions for those who are there.
Simmons University canceled a study abroad program one student was scheduled to participate in, spokeswoman Laura Wareck said.
The University of Massachusetts Amherst also suspended its program. Seven students had planned to travel to Shanghai and Beijing next month, according to spokeswoman Mary Dettloff. Although the students on campus had not left, two graduate students and two faculty members are currently in China. They are in lower-risk areas and have not shown any symptoms of the virus, Dettloff said.
UMass Amherst will reevaluate the program in coming months, she said.
At nearby Amherst College, all three study abroad programs to China were canceled before students left, spokeswoman Caroline Hanna said.
Five students from Providence College in Rhode Island were scheduled to leave in March for China until the college suspended the program, spokeswoman Madeline Parmenter said.
In Boston, Suffolk University canceled its study abroad program to China, which two students were scheduled to participate in, according to spokesman Greg Gatlin. The university has two business seminars scheduled in China in May and and has yet to decide whether those will proceed.
Two students from Worcester's Clark University were supposed to study abroad in Beijing and Shanghai, but the program was suspended, spokeswoman Angela Bazydlo said.
The World Health Organization will reconvene its emergency committee Thursday to determine whether the coronavirus outbreak, which is believed to have started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, amounts to a public health emergency of international concern.
Outside China, other countries in the region also are reporting more people infected — nearly all of them tourists from China. No one outside China has died of the virus, however.
The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.
The first cases in the Middle East were confirmed Wednesday, a family of four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.
In China, the outbreak has affected international sporting events. The International Hockey Federation postponed Pro League games in China, and soccer, basketball, and boxing qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympics in February have been moved outside of the country.
McDonald's, KFC, and Apple have also announced closures in China. Walt Disney said it would temporarily close its Disneyland and Disneytown parks in Shanghai. Ikea said it would close nearly half of its 30 Chinese locations.
Some of Apple's Chinese suppliers now are scheduled to remain closed until Feb. 10, chief executive Tim Cook told investors Tuesday.
The Boston Symphony Orchestra's upcoming eight-concert tour to East Asia also appears to be in jeopardy. The orchestra is expected to make a decision about whether to go forward by Thursday.
In China's Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed.
Foreigners are being evacuated from Wuhan. Many countries are also curtailing flights to China, with British Airways suspending its two daily flights and India and Kazakhstan cutting back as well.
Screenings for the coronavirus started at Boston's Logan International Airport on Tuesday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – White House security officials threatened to block publication of John Bolton's book unless the former national security adviser deletes information they deemed classified.
In a letter to Bolton's attorney, the National Security Council said it determined that the book – news of which roiled President Donald Trump's impeachment trial – includes "top secret" items that could undermine national security. The NSC did not specify what those passages were.
Cooper disputed the assertion that Bolton included classified information in the book. "We do not believe that any of that information could reasonable be considered classified," Bolton's attorney said in an email to an NSC official and released to reporters Wednesday.
Under commitments Bolton made when he accepted the job as Trump's national security adviser, the letter says, "the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information. "
The NSC said it would work with Bolton on revisions to the book, which has prompted demands for his testimony in the Senate impeachment trial.

The real Bolton: John Bolton stirs GOP fury for Trump revelations, but friends say he's used to knife fights
Bolton's team submitted the manuscript to the NSC a month ago for a standard review to see whether the book contains information that should not be made public.
"The manuscript appears to contain significant amounts of classified information," states the White House reply, released Wednesday and signed by Ellen Knight, senior director for records, access and information security management.
Administration officials said Trump and his legal team have not seen the Bolton manuscript and did not participate in the review.
In the submission to the NSC, Cooper said he and associates did not believe the book contained any classified information.
According to a New York Times story published Sunday, Bolton wrote in the book that Trump demanded Ukraine investigate a political rival in exchange for foreign aid, an accusations that is central to the impeachment case against the president.
Trump's critics said the president is desperately trying to prevent Bolton's information from becoming public and wondered whether the NSC letter is part of that effort.
"Nobody works this hard to keep the truth from coming out unless the truth is devastating," said Walter Shaub, former director of the U. S. Office of Government Ethics.
Trump warned Senate Republicans on Wednesday not to let Democrats "play" them into calling witnesses for the impeachment trial.
Some Republicans said they might be interested in hearing from witnesses, including Bolton, perhaps enough to force subpoenas this week.
Cooper, in his Jan. 24 email to the NSC's Knight, wrote that "although no one yet knows whether the Senate will subpoena him to testify, (Bolton) is preparing for that possibility. " Cooper said it was "imperative" for the White House to alert him quickly about any issues with the Ukraine chapter of the book, since "it seems certain" he will be asked about that if he's called to testify.
Trump, White House aides and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are trying to lobby GOP senators to move for a quick dismissal of the case.
Some critics said they are concerned that the Trump administration is trying to intimidate Bolton. Bolton is a veteran national security official – and frequent author – and they said he would not include top secret information in a book as a matter of course.
"The idea that Bolton would draft a manuscript that contains 'significant amounts of classified information' is ridiculous," tweeted former Justice Department official Michael Bromwich. "He knows what’s classified and what’s not. This is tampering with the pre-publication process to intimidate and achieve political ends. "
Legal analysts said it's hard to gauge the seriousness of the NSC's challenge to Bolton's book and whether it could lead to delay of publication.
Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith said he wouldn't describe the NSC letter as "a threat. " He tweeted that "it says manuscript contains 'significant amount' of classified info, correctly says Bolton cannot publish classified info, and pledges to work w/ him to identify it. "
Goldsmith said he doesn't think the White House has much "legal leverage" and "cannot get prior restraint" against Bolton's book. In another tweet, he asked, "Will Bolton comply with requested cuts before publishing, or assume the risk, publish, and litigate later?"
Mark Zaid, an attorney who specializes in national security issues, said that if he was advising Bolton, "I would recommend filing a lawsuit now and seek expedited processing of his case given First Amendment interests. "
Zaid, who often handles lawsuits involving pre-publication review challenges, represents the whisteblower involved in the House impeachment investigation.
Bradley Moss, another national security lawyer, described the NSC letter to Bolton as "standard correspondence" on a book that deals with national security.
"It’s just an interim letter advising Bolton that they already found some allegedly classified information," he said, "and reminding him he has an obligation to wait for final approval before publishing. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Shortly after his ouster as President Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton told a top House Democrat to investigate the abrupt recall of former U. S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from her post in Ukraine, according to that lawmaker.
During a Sept. 23 phone call, "Ambassador Bolton suggested to me – unprompted – that the committee look into the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch," Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement Wednesday.
"He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal as our top diplomat in Kyiv," Engel said, D-N. Y.
Engel said he released the statement now because of a Trump tweet posted on Wednesday, suggesting Bolton never raised concerns about the Ukraine pressure campaign before the impeachment proceedings began.
"Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this 'nonsense' a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated," Trump tweeted on Wednesday. 'He said, not that it matters, NOTHING. "
Engel said that's not true, pointing to his Sept. 23 call with Bolton.
Engel's statement suggests Bolton played a behind-the-scenes role in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. It comes amid a fierce partisan clash over whether senators should call Bolton as a witness in Trump's Senate impeachment trial.
Bolton is now writing a book about his time in the Trump White House. The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton's book alleges Trump demanded Ukraine investigate a political rival in exchange for foreign aid, the key allegation in the impeachment case against the president. The White House is threatening to block publication of Bolton's book unless the former national security adviser deletes allegedly classified information from the draft manuscript.
The Bolton-Engel conversation came after allegations first emerged, in a Sept. 19 Washington Post story, that an unnamed whistleblower had filed a complaint about Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine for political favors.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announced the House impeachment proceedings against Trump on Sept. 24, the day after Bolton and Engel spoke on the phone.
Yovanovitch is a central figure in the scandal. Trump ousted her from her post in Kyiv amid a smear campaign by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Democrats say Trump and Giuliani saw Yovanovitch as an impediment to their efforts to get Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to open two investigations that would benefit Trump politically in his 2020 re-election campaign.
Engel said he sought to talk to Bolton after he left the White House – to ask Bolton if he would talk to the committee in a closed-door session about Trump's foreign policy.
"I’ve known Ambassador Bolton for years; we have a cordial and respectful relationship and I wanted to thank him for his service," Engel said. "I also wanted to ask if he would talk to the Foreign Affairs Committee, as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did, to aid our general oversight efforts of U. S. foreign policy. "

Trump's best impeachment defense

Texto completo: In the debate over whether Donald Trump deserves impeachment, a curious partisan reversal has taken place. Trump's opponents are suddenly constitutional originalists, seeking to ground their case for impeachment in 18th-century history and founding-era rhetoric. Meanwhile, his most persuasive defenders are more likely to invoke a kind of living constitutionalism, in which the limited, sporadic way that impeachment has been actually used over the centuries matters more than what the founders contemplated.
Thus the House Democrats' brief for impeachment is studded with 18th-century quotes to prove that "high crimes and misdemeanors" covers all manner of corrupt uses of official power, easily encompassing Trump's sordid behavior with Ukraine. And legal scholars have rushed to point out that in the English tradition the founders drew upon, the impeachment power was used for what legal historian Frank O. Bowman III calls "a striking array of abuses of office," not just a few specific crimes.
Skeptics of the impeachment push, meanwhile, have pointed to the striking absence of presidential impeachments across the Republic's subsequent history. Did James Madison favor an expansive understanding of the impeachment clause? Maybe so, but as an editor of his papers pointed out in The Washington Post, as president, Madison engaged in a dodgy, Trumpian scheme to use State Department money to buy documents purporting to prove his Federalist opponents were conniving with London; the Federalists cried foul, but there wasn't even the beginning of an impeachment proceeding.
As with Madison, the anti-impeachment argument goes, so with most presidencies since. Yes, impeachment in theory covers all manner of sins. But though presidents have hardly been shy about pushing the limits of their power, impeachment in practice requires supermajorities and national consensus, which is why only one president in all our history has been pressured into resignation, and none have been removed.
In a Times op-ed last week, Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law Houston argued that this narrowing of the impeachment power reflects the difficulty of defining when politicized machinations shade into the abuse of power. Allowing that Trump is particularly crude about it, all presidents conflate their own political self-interest with the national interest - and so deciding when a president crosses the line and betrays his office is almost always a task best left up to the voters.
Both the strengths and limits of Blackman's argument are distilled in one of his historical examples: Lyndon Johnson's appointment of Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark's son Ramsey Clark as attorney general, part of a maneuver to induce Clark's resignation so that Johnson could then appoint the first African American justice and consolidate African American support.
This is a useful example because it's been apparent for a while that Trump doesn't want to be an American Mussolini so much as he wants to be a less legislatively minded LBJ - meaning that his conception of the presidency belongs to the middle of the 20th century, when a casual corruption was more commonplace, and presidents routinely used their powers to spy on political opponents (as LBJ did to Barry Goldwater) or undermine them, enable their private appetites (cough, JFK) and cover up their scandals. In this sense, Trump's conduct is indeed more historically normal than the twilight-of-the-Republic rhetoric of his impeachers would suggest. But this defense weakens when you consider that post-Watergate America very clearly tried to establish rules against precisely the sort of behavior that was normal for JFK and LBJ.
How well those norms have held is a matter for debate, but there's a reasonable case that presidents have been constrained by them. Clinton's presidential priapism was less egregious than Kennedy's and he got impeached for it; no modern president has imitated the Kennedy seraglio. The FBI's misconduct in its investigation of the Trump campaign was still nothing like the FBI's misconduct under J. Edgar Hoover. And despite Trump's nepotistic impulses, even he hasn't yet imitated Kennedy's elevation of his own brother as attorney general.
So the more modest case for Trump's impeachment isn't that it upholds a standard that's been honored since the founding. It's that after Richard Nixon we made an effort to limit the space for presidents to abuse their power, such limits are good things, and letting Trump get away with his Ukraine maneuver would be a form of backsliding - one that would encourage further abuses from a presidency whose direct power over policy now arguably exceeds its powers in any era in the past.
And since Trump presumably will not be removed, in practice we're testing a more modest argument still: that whether it's perjury or a "perfect phone call" with Ukraine, impeachment-without-removal can function like an act of censure, a punishment that restrains misbehaving presidents without actually removing them.
As a system, this obviously pleases nobody. But in the debate I've just sketched it does offer something to both sides. The power to define and condemn an abuse of power rests with the Congress, as Madison and Hamilton imagined. But how severely to punish the offender will usually be - as it will be this November - for the voters to decide.

Texto completo: Brad Pitt is having a moment. Well, several moments, really.
He's raking in awards for his role as stunt double Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino's "One Upon a Time in Hollywood" and with that comes opportunities in front of a captive audience.
And, oh, has Pitt delivered.
He got us laughing with a decades-old "Titanic" joke and sent all of America frantically searching for his Tinder profile. The comedic genius of those speeches comes "from the heart," Pitt says.
“These people mean a lot to me. I want to say something meaningful … And I have some funny friends,” he told USA TODAY on the red carpet at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.
Pitt, 56, noted on the Screen Actors Guild Awards that he’s “been banging away at this thing for 30 years. ” He did, after all, play a sexy young thief in 1991’s “Thelma & Louise. ”
But his 50s are really bringing out the sass – and he admits it.
"I'm old. It's amazing how much more relaxed you get the older you get, right?" he told USA TODAY on the SAG red carpet when asked about his carefree vibe.
It's very likely that Pitt wins best supporting actor at the Oscars (ABC, Feb. 9, 8 p. m. EST/5 PST), so we can't wait for another one of his nonchalant, entertaining acceptance speeches.
Here’s a look back at his headline-grabbing moments this awards season (so far).
Pitt to Leonardo DiCaprio: 'Still, I would've shared the raft'
His succinct and hilarious aside had one fan calling Pitt an "absolute legend" while another said it "just made my life. " When he accepted his best supporting actor award for "Once Upon a Time" at the Golden Globes, he wanted to recognize his co-star DiCaprio.
"He's an all-star, he's a gent. … Still, I would've shared the raft," he joked. Yep, that's a reference to DiCaprio's 1997 film "Titanic" because there was absolutely room on that floating door for Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose.
Oscar nominees luncheon: Brad Pitt wore his name tag
Oh, Brad: Brad Pitt jokes he'll add his win 'to my Tinder profile'
Wait. Leo calls Brad lover?
Speaking of DiCaprio, the two appear to have a budding bromance. At the Globes, we learned that Pitt lovingly calls DiCaprio "LDC. " But LDC's nickname for Pitt is even more adorable.
" 'Lover. ' He calls me 'Lover,' " Pitt joked to People TV on the SAG Awards red carpet. "It's a bit confusing, but I roll with it. "
We would definitely swipe right on that Tinder profile
As far as we know, Pitt is single, but we highly doubt he is searching for love online. Still, that didn't stop him from joking about it.
"I'm going to add this to my Tinder profile," he riffed while accepting his SAG Award.
Plenty more Brad-isms came from that night, too. Apparently, he had come down with the flu and was "very contagious. "
"Make sure you guys Purell up," he joked to USA TODAY. "Why do you think I'm wearing this coat, man? I'm just trying to stay warm. "

His award-winning role wasn't a stretch
Swiping right? Hold the phone. Pitt also poked fun at himself – and perhaps his failed marriages to Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie – in his SAG speech.
"Let's be honest, it was a difficult part," Pitt joked about "Once Upon a Time. " "A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch. Big. "
The cameras panned to Aniston, who grinned and clapped. She won an award shortly after and Pitt stopped what he was doing to watch her speech backstage.
The pair caused a frenzy when they were pictured together celebrating their wins.
'I took the red pill'
Pitt received the Leonard Maltin Modern Master Award at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and dropped a hilarious bomb when he hesitantly acknowledged that he turned down a role in "The Matrix. " THE. MATRIX.
"I took the red pill," he said with a smile and without missing a beat.
In the film, Neo (the role ultimately went to Keanu Reeves), is offered a red pill or a blue pill. He chooses the red pill, which shows him "the truth," although it may be unpleasant. The blue pill represents the choice to remain in ignorance.
"If we were doing a show on the great movies I’ve passed on, we would need two nights," Pitt joked.

Exes embrace: Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt photographed celebrating SAG Award wins backstage
The biggest drama at the Oscars: Which one of these 5 movies will win best picture?
Bradley Cooper is a 'sweetheart' who helped Pitt get sober
It hasn't been all jokes for Pitt, though. His frankness also came out when he accepted best supporting actor at the National Board of Review awards gala. He dedicated part of his speech to Cooper.
"Bradley just put his daughter to bed and then rushed over to do this. He's a sweetheart. " Pitt said. "I got sober because of this guy, and every day’s been happier ever since. I love you, and I thank you. "
Pitt has been open about his struggle with sobriety before. In an interview with the New York Times last year, Pitt revealed he spent more than a year in Alcoholics Anonymous after splitting with Jolie.

The Senate impeachment trial headed into the question-and-answer period Wednesday, after six days of arguments from House impeachment managers and President Trump's defense team. Here is a look at where things stand and what comes next.
(Follow our live updates and analysis of the impeachment trial. »)
1. Debate Over Rules
After the House sent over the articles of impeachment, the Senate trial began in earnest with a debate over the rules of the trial. After hours of votes on Democratic amendments that were defeated, the Republican-led body passed the rules on a party-line vote. The rules don't guarantee new witnesses or documents but allow for a vote on them after opening arguments and the Q&A portion are complete.
2. Democrats Argue for Removing Trump
In their opening arguments, the Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress. Democrats also said the president obstructed the House impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony and argued Mr. Trump posed a national-security threat to the country and needed to be removed from office now. They also argued for more witnesses and documents.
3. Bolton Manuscript Emerges
On Sunday, Jan. 26, after the Democrats closed their arguments and just several hours into the defense presentation, the New York Times revealed that former national security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book , wrote that Mr. Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations. Democrats said this underscored the need to call Mr. Bolton as a witness.
4. Trump Team Rebuts Charges
Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. Mr. Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book and has denied any wrongdoing. The team argued that even if the conversation did take place as Mr. Bolton described, it wouldn't amount to an impeachable offense. Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election soon and the decision on his fate should be left to the voters . They also argued that it was the House probe's job to secure new witnesses, not the Senate's.
5. Question-and-Answer Period Begins
Starting Wednesday, senators have 16 hours over two days to submit questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, alternating from Republicans to Democrats. The questions will be handwritten on beige-colored cards that ask for the senator's name and who they want to direct the question to—Mr. Trump's team or the House managers.
The questions could come from a single senator or a group. Chief Justice Roberts urged the managers and defense lawyers to limit their answers to five minutes.
6. Vote on Witnesses and Documents
Later this week, after the Q&A session concludes, senators are expected to vote on whether to call new witnesses and documents. A yes vote means lawmakers could then hold subsequent votes on whether to hear from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses such as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Hunter Biden, son of former vice president Joe Biden. A no vote would set the trial on course for a quick conclusion with a final vote on convicting or acquitting Mr. Trump.
7. Final Vote
Barring any major developments, Mr. Trump is expected to be acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to remove him from office.

News Corp Launches News Aggregator to Compete With Google; Service features headlines from about 400 local and national news sources from across political spectrum

Texto completo: News Corp on Wednesday launched Knewz.com, a news-aggregation service aimed at competing with platforms like Alphabet Inc.'s Google News that the media company has complained doesn't adequately recompense publishers.
The service features headlines from about 400 local and national news sources, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, Newsmax and the Nation.
"There are mastheads from across the political and regional spectrum, and premium publishers will not be relegated in the rankings," Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp said in a statement.
News Corp is the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. The news-aggregation service also features headlines from across News Corp's portfolio including the New York Post, the Times of London and the Sun in the U.K., as well as many papers in Australia.
The articles on Knewz.com will link directly to publishers' sites, and News Corp will receive no remuneration. News Corp says it will share data with those publishers and prominently tag each link with the name of its source.
News Corp said it developed the site, in part, to give exposure to media outlets that the company felt were often demoted in Google's search results and Facebook Inc.'s social feed. Mr. Thomson has long been a vocal critic of how the algorithms used by big tech platforms affect publishers' ability to reach audiences.
Google and Facebook have said their algorithms don't rank or prioritize content based on the political leanings of news organizations.
News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch has argued that tech companies should pay licensing fees for the use of news stories published by other media companies.
Since the Journal first reported News Corp's development of the service in August, the company—along with other publishers—has reached a deal with Facebook to receive a licensing fee for the use of its story links inside a recently launched news tab on the social-media platform.
The company also reached a deal last year with Apple Inc. to take part in its subscription news bundle, Apple News +, in return for a share of the subscription revenue.
Google hasn't agreed to pay news companies directly but has argued that it plays a key role in helping news outlets monetize online content through the traffic its search engine sends to their sites and revenue generated through Google's ad platforms, which most publishers rely on.

Kobe Bryant was an original; there really wasn't anyone like him

Texto completo: He was Jelly's kid. For many of us, that was always the unfathomable aspect of the Kobe Bryant saga. He was Jelly's kid.
Kobe Bryant was the son of a professional basketball player, but not just any ol' professional basketball player. Joe “Jellybean" Bryant was a perplexing player, at the very least a benchwarmer on the All-Squandered Talent Team. He was a technically skilled 6-foot-9-inch forward, a standout at La Salle who had an eight-year career in the NBA, followed by eight additional years in Italy.
Jelly should have been better. Simply put, he was a knucklehead. He was indeed very skilled, but in the end he was a Double A Antoine Walker, a player whose whole was nowhere near the sum of his parts. He just didn't get it.
Exhibit A was his immortal line upon learning he had just been traded from the 76ers to the Clippers. Said Jelly, “I guess this means they don't want a Magic Johnson-type around here.“
So, how did his offspring emerge as such a dedicated, intelligent, and precise player? We'll never know. Perhaps Kobe figured, “I'll just do as Dad didn't do."
Kobe Bryant's precocity has been well-established. At 15, he could hold his own during summer scrimmages with established collegians and professionals in Philadelphia. When he entered the 1996 NBA Draft, he did so with extraordinary self-confidence.
Dan Shaughnessy: Where does Kobe Bryant rank among the NBA's greatest players?
With the exception of Bill Willoughby (488 NBA games, averaging 6 points back in the '70s), it had been big men such as Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins, and in 1995 Kevin Garnett who had jumped from high school to the NBA. Kobe was going to try it as a guard.
His predraft workouts are the stuff of NBA legend. Among those whose eyes were opened was new Nets coach John Calipari, in possession of the eighth overall pick in '96. But when the proverbial push came to shove, Calipari did not have the guts to pull that trigger in what would have been his first big decision as Nets mentor. He went for a safe pick in Villanova's Kerry Kittles.
Kittles wasn't bad. He had an eight-year NBA career. But Kerry Kittles was not Kobe Bryant.
No one was more dazzled than Jerry West. The sagacious Lakers general manager happily traded Vlade Divac to Charlotte on that fateful draft night. Thus did Kobe Bryant, the 13th pick of the 1996 NBA Draft, become a Los Angeles Laker.
From that day forward, Kobe Bryant had no bigger fan than Jerry West. I am telling you that if a billion Kobe fans were lined up, the person at the head of that line would have to be Jerry West.
Now, I must admit I was totally unprepared for the astonishing outpouring of grief and shock over Kobe's death. I didn't realize to what extent Kobe Bryant had become the Star of Stars for a generation of worldwide sports fans.
How did the media report Kobe Bryant's death? With confusion and misinformation, to start
I mean, Neymar scoring a goal for Paris Saint-Germain and holding up two fingers on one hand and four on the other in tribute to Kobe? The mercurial Nick Kyrgios sporting both 8 and 24 Kobe jerseys at the Australian Open, or a video tribute to Kobe at Rod Laver Stadium? Or the following headline on the Monday Arts section of the New York Times: “Grammys Tinged by Grief Over Kobe Bryant"?
I don't know exactly who came up with the idea to start last Sunday's NBA games with matching hold-the-ball 24-second violations, but let the record show that the first two to do it were Toronto's Fred VanVleet and San Antonio's Dejounte Murray. God love 'em. And Doc Rivers absolutely breaking down? Whoa.
What always struck me about Kobe Bryant was that he was completely different in sensibility than any American-born player. Kobe's formative years were spent not in this country, but in Italy, where poppa Jellybean had established a career. He spoke fluent Italian, and if I'm not mistaken, even did a commercial along the way utilizing his fluency in that language.
I'm playing armchair psychologist here, but I believe Kobe always had a world view and often found it hard to relate to his American peers. He has been described as “aloof" and a “loner," and I think his European upbringing helps explain it.
Actor and comic Robert Wuhl encountered the young, sophisticated Kobe Bryant early on.
“I first met Kobe in 1996 when he appeared on the HBO series 'Arli$$,' " Wuhl explains. “It was only our fifth episode. Kobe had just signed a $3.5 million contract with the Lakers less than a week before shooting.
“I was aware he had spent years in Italy and thought this was a good, fun way to introduce him to a national audience. On the first take, he was flawless. Spoiler Alert: Most cameo athletes are not. Kobe was incredibly poised, friendly, and very funny. And 17."
Another “problem" Kobe may have had getting along with his teammates was that he was, frankly, usually smarter than everyone else. Had he not entered that 1996 draft, he would have gone on to play for Coach K at Duke, and we are told he indeed had the grades to get into that school even if he couldn't take it hard to the hoop or drill a 15-footer.
Some people have mistakenly referred to Staples Center as “The House That Kobe Built." That is not true. Elgin, Jerry, Wilt, Gail, Kareem, Magic, James, and others got that place built. Kobe spent his first three years playing in the Fabulous Forum. What Kobe did was pay off the Staples Center mortgage (with, yes, a little help from Shaq). He took complete control of the household. An LA generation who never saw the Sports Arena or Forum associated Kobe with Staples Center. They cannot imagine an LA sports world without Kobe Bryant. Elgin, Jerry, Wilt, Gail, Kareem, Magic, and James were their grandfather's, father's, or big brother's guys. Kobe was theirs . For anyone else to be known as the Greatest Laker is an unthinkable thought for this generation of Lakers fans.
Related: Kobe Bryant didn't intend to coach basketball after retiring. His daughter changed his mind
You've seen all the numbers: Eleven first-team All-NBA. Nine first-team All-Defense. Four All-Star Game MVPs. And, of course, five championship rings. Etc., etc., etc. But my favorite factual tidbit about Kobe is that he is the all-time leader in but one category: most missed shots. He was, in fact, a volume scorer with a lifetime shooting percentage of .447. He was simply indefatigable. By the way, guess who's No. 2 in this fascinating category . . . John Havlicek.
All the truly great ones leave a special memory. Larry was Larry. Magic was Magic. And Kobe was Kobe. In terms of style and competitiveness, he was the closest thing to Michael, yes. No doubt. But he wasn't Michael, he was Kobe.
And how we got from Jelly to Kobe we'll never know.
Hey, Kobe, thanks for everything. Ciao.
For Kobe Bryant, basketball wasn't just a vocation, it was an outlet for his genius

After a bang-up end to 2019, with a fall slate that included Timothy Egan, Tom Mueller, Rene Denfeld and Ben Goldfarb, the Northwest Passages Book Club has taken a well-deserved rest.
The rest time is over. The Spokesman-Review's book club and community forum will ramp up toward a full spring beginning this month. Included is an event featuring one of the most-anticipated books of 2020.
"American Dirt," by Jeanine Cummins, tells the story of an Acapulco bookshop owner and her son who flee a drug cartel and begin a desperate migration to the United States and the sanctuary of a cousin's home in Colorado. "American Dirt" has made several lists of most-anticipated books of 2020. It was released Jan. 21 amid reviews both positive and not so nice.
The book has plenty of champions, including novelist Joe Hill and his dad, Stephen King, who tweeted out their praise of it this year. NPR book critic Maureen Corrigan praised "American Dirt," saying, "Of all the 'What if?' novels I've read in recent years - many of them dystopian - 'American Dirt' is the novel that, for me, nails what it's like to live in this age of anxiety, where it feels like anything can happen, at any moment."
Nicholas Mancusi, writing for Time magazine, said, "Some of the faintest praise that could be bestowed on a novel is to call it 'topical,' but while this book reflects the current real-world crisis at many of the world's borders, the story is masterfully composed of timeless elements: the nightmare logic of grief, the value of human kindness, the power of love to drive us to do the unimaginable."
But others have argued the book is a work of cultural appropriation because Cummins is not Mexican. Indeed, even though her grandmother is Puerto Rican, Cummins herself admits that she may not have been the best person to tell this story. In the afterward of "Amercian Dirt," Cummins, whose grandmother is Puerto Rican, writes, "dkfdskjsdkj."
Others simply don't like it. "The real failures of the book, however," writes Parul Sehgal in the New York Times, "have little to do with the writer's identity and everything to do with her abilities as a novelist," taking her to task for her "thin characters" and writing that is "lumpy and strange."

Texto completo: Other Voices
Search the transcript of Saturday's impeachment trial, as President Donald Trump's lawyers began their opening arguments, and you'll see there's a name nowhere to be found: John Bolton, the former national security adviser.
The president's lawyers made no mention of him. And now there's no need to speculate why. Because the news about what's in Bolton's forthcoming book is out - and it shows that his testimony would be devastating to Trump.
The New York Times reported Sunday night that Bolton submitted his manuscript to the White House for pre-publication review four weeks ago. Which means, in all likelihood, that at least some members of the president's defense team have known exactly what Bolton would say if called to the stand.
According to the Times, Bolton's manuscript states, among other things, that President Trump told Bolton "in August that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens." Trump reportedly said "he preferred sending no assistance to Ukraine until officials turned over all materials . . . that related to Mr. Biden and supporters of Mrs. Clinton in Ukraine."
Quid. Pro. Quo.
We knew that already. But Bolton's testimony would make that devastating conclusion inescapable, even to Republican senators who have striven mightily to blind themselves to the obvious.
Bolton, who has already announced that he would comply with a Senate trial subpoena, actually wants to testify, it seems. He wants to testify "for several reasons," says the Times. "He believes he has relevant information." (Gee, do you think?) He's also rightly worried he'll get trashed if he doesn't testify and his explosive account comes out only later for $32.50 on Amazon. (One hopes he'd like to do it for the sake of the country, too.)
No wonder Trump's lawyers so vehemently opposed Bolton's being subpoenaed last week. No wonder they've been plotting with Senate Republicans to make sure that, if Bolton does testify, he does so in secret. No wonder Trump himself expressed concern last week about the possibility of Bolton testifying. No wonder why, on Saturday, none of the president's lawyers dared even utter the word "Bolton."
And no wonder that, just after midnight Monday, a few hours after the Times story came out, Trump tweeted a flat (but unsworn) denial of Bolton's account: "I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. . . . If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
From Trump on down, they all know how damning Bolton's testimony would be to Trump's defense. Indeed, the leak of what's in Bolton's book shows how disingenuous the president's defense has been.
Before the Senate on Saturday, deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura laid out the elements of that defense. Key among them: "Not a single witness testified that the President himself said there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a Presidential meeting, or anything else."
He continued: "Most of the Democrats' witnesses have never spoken to the President at all, let alone about Ukraine security assistance." And: "The Democrats' entire quid pro quo theory is based on nothing more than the initial speculation of one person" - U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.
If Bolton testifies to what's in his manuscript, these arguments, weak as they are, will collapse. The words will come from Trump's mouth, because Bolton will have put them there. The direct witness whose absence Trump's lawyers trumpeted will have appeared.
And that witness would destroy the central defense Trump's lawyers have raised. Which is that the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was perfect - factually, legally, and constitutionally.
Or, as Purpura put it on Saturday: "The Democrats' allegation that the President engaged in a quid pro quo is unfounded and contrary to the facts. . . . The President was, at all times, acting in our national interest and pursuant to his oath of office." The president has "done nothing wrong"; "rightly, he had real concerns" about "burden-sharing" and "corruption," which was why he held back the aid.
Bolton begs to differ.
In light of Trump's own arguments, it would now be preposterous, if it ever wasn't, for the Senate not to call Bolton as a witness. To refuse to do so would ensure the trial would be recorded forever in history as a GOP-orchestrated farce. And if the president's defense is that Bolton is now peddling this tale of quid pro quo "only to sell a book," fine. Let's also have a look at the documents that could demonstrate who is telling the truth.
Trump's own lawyers have framed the removal question as turning on proof of the president's true motives. Well, here's a witness who can tell us what the president, in a face-to-face conversation, said he wanted.
Trump's lawyers complain that no witness talked to Trump about the linkage between the aid and the investigation. Well, here's Bolton, ready, willing, and able to testify.
Trump himself claims that Bolton is lying. Well, there's a tried-and-true way to find out if he is or is not.
Mr. Bolton, please raise your right hand.

Texto completo: The New York Times reported that in his forthcoming book former national security adviser John Bolton writes that Trump told him in August "that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens."

This is smoking gun evidence that directly contradicts what Trump lawyer Michael Purpura old the Senate on Saturday, and bizarrely repeated on Monday: "Not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting or anything else."

Bolton submitted his manuscript for White House review on Dec. 30, so there is every reason to expect that his version of events was already known to Trump and his senior aides. That could, in fact, explain their desire to rush the Senate to exonerate the president without hearing any witnesses.

Trump took to Twitter to contradict Bolton, but in a credibility contest, it's hard to imagine anyone taking the word of a president who has made more than 16,000 false or misleading statements since taking office. In any case, the disparity between their stories simply strengthens the case for putting both Trump and Bolton under oath.

The Times reported that some Republican senators "feel blindsided" and "had angrily called the White House trying to determine who at the administration knew about Bolton's manuscript."

Even Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., seemed to be conceding that there would now be witnesses while implying that uber-hawk Bolton is a "Democratic" witness. (As writer Windsor Mann quipped, a "Democratic" witness is any Republican who used to work for Trump.)

This is very limited progress. There is still no chance that a two-thirds majority would vote to convict Trump even if Bolton's sworn testimony confirms what we all know: that the president is guilty as charged.

Far from showing anger over the president's betrayal of his office, most Republican senators are eager to be accomplices in his coverup. On Monday, as Trump's lawyers simply ignored the news about Bolton, many Republican senators still argued there is no need for him to testify.

Roy Blunt of Missouri said Bolton's testimony would take too long. Perhaps Blunt's state should change its nickname to the "Don't Show Me State"?

The Republicans' lack of outrage over the president's egregious misconduct is truly outrageous.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – National Public Radio host Mary Louise Kelly addressed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling her a liar in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday night that reflected on the role of journalists in holding public figures to account.
Kelly said she is a journalist because "we get to put questions to powerful people and hold them to account. This is both a privilege and a responsibility. "
That was what Kelly was trying to do in an interview with Pompeo last week when she asked if he felt he owed former U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovtich an apology for not defending her before she was recalled from her post.
After the interview, Kelly said Pompeo berated her, questioned whether Americans care about Ukraine and challenged her to find Ukraine on a map. On Saturday, Pompeo issued a statement in which he claimed Kelly lied to him about the subject of the interview and about keeping his post-interview comments off the record.
Recording: Trump called for firing Ukraine ambassador after campaign donor complained
"It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this administration," Pompeo said after the interview. "It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity. "
He also implied Kelly failed to correctly identify Ukraine on the map.
Kelly said during their interview that she told Pompeo's staff that she intended to ask about both Ukraine and Iran, and she has denied ever agreeing to keep anything off the record.
NPR host: After interview, Pompeo cursed at reporter, yelled
"Journalists don’t sit down with senior government officials in the service of scoring political points. We do it in the service of asking tough questions, on behalf of our fellow citizens. And then sharing the answers – or lack thereof – with the world," Kelly wrote in the op-ed.
Much of the op-ed recounted the portion of her interview with Pompeo that focused on tensions with Iran, as well as an interview she did earlier this month with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.
"I write about all this now to refocus attention on the substance of the interviews, which has been overshadowed by Mr. Pompeo’s subsequently swearing at me, calling me a liar and challenging me to find Ukraine on an unmarked map," she wrote.
"For the record, I did. That’s not the point.
"The point is that recently the risk of miscalculation – of two old adversaries misreading each other and accidentally escalating into armed confrontation – has felt very real," she said. "It occurs to me that swapping insults through interviews with journalists such as me might, terrifyingly, be as close as the top diplomats of the United States and Iran came to communicating this month.
"There is a reason that freedom of the press is enshrined in the Constitution. There is a reason it matters that people in positions of power – people charged with steering the foreign policy of entire nations – be held to account. The stakes are too high for their impulses and decisions not to be examined in as thoughtful and rigorous an interview as is possible. "
Trump on Pompeo: “I think you did a good job on her. ” Trump praises Pompeo for blasting NPR host
This week the State Department barred NPR reporter Michele Kelemen from accompanying Pompeo on a scheduled trip that includes a visit to Ukraine.
The move was condemned by journalists as retaliation for the Kelly interview.
White House Correspondents' Association President Jonathan Karl said in a statement that the "apparent attempt to take punitive action against a news outlet for its reporting is outrageous and contrary to American values. "
"We can only conclude that the State Department is retaliating against National Public Radio as a result of this exchange," said Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents' Association. Tandon said it was "unacceptable to punish an individual member of our association. "
"The journalists who cover the State Department are dedicated to informing the public and holding this and every administration accountable by asking questions about the issues of the day," he said.
F-bombs and death threats: Kobe Bryant, Mike Pompeo and the abuse of female journalists
In response to Pompeo's statement that accused Kelly of lying, five Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote him a letter decrying "the corrosive effects of your behavior on American values and standing in the world. "
"At a time when journalists around the world are being jailed for their reporting – and as in the case of Jamal Khashoggi, killed – your insulting and contemptuous comments are beneath the office of the Secretary of State," they wrote.
President Donald Trump, who routinely attacks the news media, praised Pompeo on Tuesday for his treatment of Kelly, calling it "impressive. "
"I think you did a good job on her, actually," the president said.

Texto completo: Michael Strahan is opening up about his strained relationship with Kelly Ripa.
In an interview with The New York Times, the former "Live! with Kelly and Michael" co-host didn't deny that there was tension between him and Ripa about his departure from the show.
"When it was time to go, it was time to go. Certain things that were going on behind the scenes just caught up," he said, later clarifying that there is no hate from his side.
"If people think, 'Oh, he hates her' – I don’t hate her. I do respect her for what she can do at her job. I cannot say enough about how good she is at her job," he said.
Strahan said he tried to address the issues between them.
"One thing I tried to do is have a meeting every few weeks with her. We met a few times, and that was fine. But then eventually she said she didn’t need to meet," he said. "Can’t force somebody to do something they don’t want to do. "
Without naming a show directly, Strahan explained a selfish nature he felt from working in television.
"On television, I’ve had jobs where I got there and felt like: 'Wow, I didn’t know I was supposed to be a sidekick. I thought I was coming here to be a partner,'" he said. "I want us all to be successful. I’ve done things where I went in with team concepts, and I got there and realized it’s not about team. It’s selfish, and I don’t operate well under that. "

He also said his departure could have been handled better. Strahan announced he'd be leaving "Live! with Kelly and Michael" for "GMA" on April 19, 2016, with Ripa taking a previously unannounced week off from the show, prompting speculation that she was retaliating for Strahan's announcement. He officially departed the show May 13, three months earlier than originally announced.
"It was treated as if I was the guy who walked in and said, 'I’m leaving. ' That part was totally misconstrued, mishandled in every way," he said. "People who should have handled it better have all apologized, but a lot of the damage had already been done. For me, it was like: Move on. Success is the best thing. Just keep on moving. "
He says he still learned things from his time co-hosting with Ripa.
"You learn how to craft a story. “What did you do last night?” “Oh, I had a glass of water. ” But you learn to tell the story to make it seem like the most interesting glass of water. Those are things that I learned from her. She’s brilliant in that way. "

Texto completo: Don't get bogged down in the minutiae of Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial - the procedural maneuvers aimed at getting witness testimony and new documents that Republicans want to prevent at all costs. Stay focused on the big picture.
Here are the 10 big things you need to know.
*Did Mr. Trump commit an impeachable offense? Yes. His attempt to get a foreign power to help him win the 2020 election is precisely the sort of thing the framers of the Constitution worried about when they created the impeachment clause. If presidents could seek foreign help to win elections, there would be no end of foreign intrusions into American sovereignty and democracy.
*Will the Senate convict him and remove him from office? No. The impeachment clause requires that two-thirds of the Senate must vote to convict. Even if every one of the 45 Democratic and two independent senators vote to oust Mr. Trump, 20 Republican senators would need to join them in order for Mr. Trump to be removed from office. The odds that 20 Republican Senators will do so are exactly zero.
*Why won't they? There are not 20 Republican senators with the courage and integrity to protect the Constitution and the nation from the most dangerous and demagogic president in history. Led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican senators are engaged in a concerted cover-up of some of the most outrageous conduct ever committed by high-level government officials. Even so-called moderate Republicans such as Susan Collins and Mitt Romney can't be relied on to grow a spine and conduct a fair trial.
*Why are they so spineless? Because they want to keep their jobs, and they know that 88% of Republican voters approve of Mr. Trump. They fear Mr. Trump's sway over their voting base and his massive fundraising apparatus.
*Why do 88% of Republican voters support him? Because he has convinced them he's on their side and that he's the victim of a plot orchestrated by the establishment and "deep state" bureaucrats to oust him.
*How has Mr. Trump retained the support of 88% of Republicans? By lying constantly, casting the mainstream press as biased and untrustworthy, relying on his propaganda machine (Fox News and right-wing radio) to trumpet his lies, using Twitter and Facebook to deliver those lies directly to his followers, and fomenting the "culture war" - wielding deep divisions over race, guns, religion, abortion and immigrants - to fuel his base.
*Where's the money to finance all this coming from? Billionaires, CEOs, corporate executives and the denizens of Wall Street continue to fund the Republican Party and bankroll Mr. Trump and his propaganda machine. They're doing this because they're raking in billions thanks to the Trump-Republican tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Mr. Trump is already promising them more if he gets a second term. "The attitude of the business community toward the Trump administration appears quite positive," Stephen Schwarzman, who runs the huge private equity firm Blackstone, told the New York Times.
*Will the House impeachment and Senate trial change public opinion about Mr. Trump? No. Mr. Trump's overall job ratings haven't budged. In the most recent polls, 44% of Americans approve of the way he is handling his job as president, while 53% say they disapprove. These percentages are close to where they were in September, before the House launched its formal impeachment inquiry and voted to impeach Mr. Trump.
*What will Mr. Trump do now? He will claim that his upcoming acquittal by the Senate clears him of all charges, just as he claimed that Attorney General William Barr's whitewash of the Robert Mueller report absolved him of charges that he sought Russian help in the 2016 election. He'll use both as "proof" that Democrats fabricated a plot to remove him from office.
*What does this mean for the 2020 election? None of this is likely to sway the majority of Americans who don't want Mr. Trump reelected.
To be sure, the Republican Party will try to suppress the votes of likely Democrats, Russia will almost certainly try again to help Mr. Trump, billionaires and big corporations will spend vast sums seeking to get him reelected and the Electoral College will further handicap the Democratic candidate.
But Democrats and Independents are fired up. The 2018 midterm elections featured the highest turnout of any midterm election since 1914, handing House Republicans their most resounding defeat in decades. The "blue wave" in 2020 could be a tsunami.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A few years ago, I made the Russian baths a regular part of my New York life. The ritual of the shvitz - steaming, sweating and rinsing - is why I go (health!), but if I'm being honest, I also am very much there for the food (pleasure!).
I eat there not out of necessity, but because it's low-key and one of my favorite restaurants in town. My order changes every time - pickles, cabbage, soup, pickled cabbage soup - but I always get the pelmeni, tortellini-size dumplings filled with pork, served in a squat ramekin, coated in melted butter and a splash of the cooking liquid. Finished with caramelized onions, lots of dill and a generous portion of sour cream alongside, they are kind of the opposite of a healthy trip to the spa - unless you consider mental health a part of that journey. (I do.)
Every time I eat those little miracles, I can't stop thinking about how I could write a recipe that approximates them without asking someone to make dumplings. (I'd never do that to you.)
I thought about the chewiness of the dumpling wrapper, the delicately meaty taste of the filling and slight brothiness of the liquid they come in. I thought about how necessary the dill is, and about how I always wanted a squeeze of lemon but wouldn't dare ask.
And that's how I got here: creamy farro with crispy mushrooms, sour cream and lots of dill. Yes, there is also a side of lemon.
OK, so, no: A bowl of farro and mushrooms isn't exactly a plate of dumplings, but hear me out. The way the mushrooms are cooked and crisped alongside the thinly sliced, caramelizing leeks gives them such a delightfully meaty flavor that they're almost better than meat itself. The farro, toasted in the pot before it's cooked, reinforces that vague meatiness. (Chicken broth helps, but you can use vegetable broth or even water to keep it vegetarian.) In the end, the squeaky chew of each grain coupled with the porridge-y consistency reminds me of the dumplings swimming in that buttery broth.
Topped with sour cream and a sprinkle of a lemony dill mixture, made better with the addition of chives, it hits the spot, even without the shvitz.
Creamy farro with crispy mushrooms
and sour cream
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 1 hour
1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle,
torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley
4 cups vegetable broth, chicken broth or water
1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing
Sour cream, for serving
1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the leeks and half the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and crisped, 12 to 15 minutes. (They will start giving off moisture and steaming a little before this happens, so be patient.)
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a medium bowl leaving any olive oil behind. (They will have absorbed the oil as they cook, and released it back as they crisp.) Add a bit more olive oil so there's another 1/4 cup or so in the pot. Cook the remaining leeks and mushrooms, adding them to the bowl with the other mushrooms.
3. Without wiping the pot, add farro and season with salt and pepper. Cook over that same medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until farro is toasted on the outside (it will go from pale golden brown to a toastier golden brown), about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and 2 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring to a strong simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until farro is fully cooked and most (but not all) of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. It should still look a bit loose, like risotto or a porridge. Remove from heat and add half the chives.
5. Toss dill, remaining chives and lemon zest together in a small bowl. To serve, season farro with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls. Top with sour cream, mushrooms and leeks, and dill mixture. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing.

Questioning Phase of Trump's Impeachment Trial Begins; Senators seek answers from both sides as McConnell looks to block witnesses

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The deep partisan divide over the allegations against President Trump was on full display as the Senate impeachment trial moved into the questioning period and senators got their first chance to influence the trial.
The two-day questioning session comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) works to lock down enough support to defeat a vote to bring in new witnesses and information to the trial. Wednesday's session offered a window into what senators on the fence about the witness decision were considering ahead of the vote, which is expected Friday.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used their answers to portray Democrats' case for impeachment as politically motivated, rushed and lacking evidence, and as falling well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. Democratic managers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from interfering in the 2020 election and mounted a forceful defense of the articles of impeachment —on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—as they argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
GOP leaders gave the first question to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who submitted her query on behalf of herself as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah, all Republican senators who are debating on siding with Democrats on a motion to bring in witnesses. They asked the president's lawyers for their guidance on how the Senate should view a situation where the president might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine last summer.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What questions are you hoping get asked and to whom? Why? Join the conversation below.
White House Deputy Counsel Pat Philbin answered by saying that in a situation where there are mixed motives, some personal and some in the public interest, the act isn't impeachable.
"All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election," Mr. Philbin said. "It can't be a basis for removing a president from office."
The president's motivation for freezing aid to Ukraine, just as he was pressing the country to announce investigations that would benefit him politically, is at the heart of the impeachment case. Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong and called the impeachment a politically driven hoax.
In the Democratic senators' opening question, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York sought to underscore the importance of witnesses who could provide a firsthand account of the president's thinking. He asked the House managers if there could be a fair trial without calling former national security adviser John Bolton, who alleges in a coming book that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country helped with investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
The lead Democratic impeachment manager, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, responded: "The short answer to that question is no," and told lawmakers to not wait for the book. Democrats need to pick up at least four Republicans to win a vote later this week opening the door for witnesses.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book "nasty & untrue."
In the questioning session, the House Democrats and Mr. Trump's legal team differed sharply on questions of what sort of action is impeachable.
One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, offered a new argument: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
"Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest," Mr. Dershowitz said. "If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment."
The president's lawyers had previously argued that Mr. Trump's decision to freeze aid wasn't driven by political considerations and that his push for investigations in Ukraine was due to his concerns about corruption in the country. The aid was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Mr. Schiff, of California, shot back that if President Obama had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. "Are we ready to say the president can sacrifice the interest of that…country, because all quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?" Mr. Schiff said.
The hypothetical continued in a later question, from Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas to Mr. Schiff. If Mr. Obama had had evidence that Mr. Romney's son was being paid $1 million a year by a corrupt Russian company and Mr. Romney had acted to benefit that company, they asked, would Mr. Obama then have legal authority to ask for that to be investigated.
Mr. Trump and his allies have said it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
Mr. Schiff said that the hypothetical didn't have a direct correlation and said the U.S. had ways to investigate corruption that didn't involve the president seeking a foreign leader's help.
Senators were given 16 hours over two days to submit questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding, following six days of arguments by Democratic managers and Mr. Trump's legal team in which senators, acting as jurors, had to remain quiet.
Republican leaders, who on Tuesday said they didn't have enough votes to block witnesses, on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
"We will open Pandora's box if we move to talking about witnesses," said Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), a close ally of Mr. Trump who speaks to the president frequently.
Other GOP senators said they wanted to hear from witnesses. "I'd like to hear from John Bolton," Mr. Romney said. Ms. Collins reiterated her support for witnesses "to clarify some ambiguities."
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him, in Democrats' effort to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

Separately, the National Security Council disclosed Wednesday that it told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week that the manuscript of his book contained "significant amounts" of classified information, including some classified as top secret, and directed him to remove those materials before publishing, according to a copy of the letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, didn't respond to a request for comment. Three days after the letter was sent, the New York Times published details of the manuscript on Sunday.
Meanwhile, more revelations emerged about Mr. Bolton's concerns about the administration's dealings with Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said that in a Sept. 23 phone call weeks after Mr. Bolton left his post, Mr. Bolton urged him, unprompted, to have his committee look into the removal of the former ambassador to Ukraine. "He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal," Mr. Engel said.
Marie Yovanovitch's removal last spring is one of several key episodes in the impeachment inquiry. The former ambassador was for months targeted by Rudy Giuliani, who said he wanted to remove her because she was blocking his push for investigations in Ukraine. Mr. Trump, who has the right to replace ambassadors, ordered her removed after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani.

At 78, Sanders has survived a heart attack, and the loathing of the Democratic Party establishment and its compliant media wing.
He survived that recent vicious and shameful CNN takedown accusing him of sexism for allegedly saying a woman couldn't be elected president. Sanders denied it. CNN didn't much care.
Now his supporters are being shamed as dangerous and angry by other media and also as tools of President Donald Trump.
But guess what?
It's all backfiring. Sanders is surging, poised to take Iowa and New Hampshire, riding a populist wave of the left.
Establishment Democrats are worried, already arguing that Sanders would lose to Trump. But Sanders' base hasn't forgotten how the Democratic National Committee rigged the nomination for Hillary Clinton last time.
In response to Sanders, the Democratic establishment media is selling "Fear Bernie" stories. And this is their dilemma:
How can the Democratic establishment use free and paid media to kill off Sanders' candidacy while not alienating his base of young, committed voters?
Democrats need those young Sanders voters to win in 2020. Not only do they need those votes, they need that youthful passion. Without it, they're left with Joe Biden chewing on his teeth, telling stories like a lonely old man at the bar, casting himself as the hero again and again.
According to the RealClear Politics average of polls and other surveys, Sanders is leading in the Iowa Democratic caucuses and could take New Hampshire. His supporters, many of them young and idealistic, are sticking with him.
I'm certainly no Bernie Bro. As a lonely print conservative -- an endangered species stubbornly unwilling to be stuffed and put on display at a museum -- I disagree with Sanders' policies.
But he fascinates me. The growth of populist movements as the corrupt and tired American center collapses, the supporters shamed by unctuous establishment media, the anger simmering as those voters are mocked by the elites, is the political story of our time.
It happened on the Republican side in 2016. I could see then it would happen to the Democrats this cycle. And now it is happening.
I've never doubted Sanders' appeal to his base. His appeal is about consistency and authenticity, something the other Democratic candidates seem to lack.
And squeezing Sanders to protect old Joe Biden -- and then expecting Sanders voters to flock to Biden or Elizabeth Warren (Hillary 2.0) -- seems difficult at best.
As Sanders rises in the early polls, the Democratic media attacks against him increase.
Time is now reporting that Third Way, a left of center think tank, is sending memos to hundreds of prominent Iowa Democrats warning them that supporting Sanders in the Democratic primary is just what "Trump wants you to do."
Recently, there was that cynical attempted takedown by CNN in the Iowa debate, accusing him of telling Warren that a woman could not win the presidency, which he vehemently denied.
The denial didn't matter much to CNN, which had its marching orders. The talking heads derided Sanders and declared Warren to be his victim.
Then a hot mic clip was found, as if by coincidence, allowing Warren to complain Sanders had just called her a liar on national television. And they dined out on that for a few news cycles.
But that just made Sanders supporters even more determined.
Then Hillary weighed in, mocking Sanders while starring in a revisionist documentary glorifying (who else?), Hillary.
"Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician," she said. "It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."
Asked by reporters recently if that assessment of Sanders still held, she was quoted as saying: "Yes, it does."
If that wasn't enough, The New York Times is now after Sanders with a vengeance. The house organ of the Democratic establishment oddly endorsed Warren and Amy Klobuchar for the Democratic nomination.
The endorsement was so contrived that conservative pundit Ben Shapiro couldn't resist tweeting that the Times had just picked the Chiefs and the 49ers to win the Super Bowl.
The other day, the Times ominously speculated in a column headline, "Bernie Could Win the Nomination. Should we be afraid?"
I really can't say.
In a page one news story the other day, on "Bernie Sanders and His Internet Army," the Times portrayed Sanders supporters as a pack of haters.
It quoted Bakari Sellers, an African American former South Carolina state legislator and supporter of Sen. Kamala Harris' failed presidential bid.
"Politics is a contact sport," said Sellers. "But you have to be very cognizant when you say anything critical of Bernie online. You might have to put your phone down. There's going to be a blowback, and it could be sexist, racist and vile."
He said one person called him an "Uncle Tom" and wished that he be afflicted with brain cancer.
Jeb Bush and the Republican establishment used many of these same media techniques to try to herd Trump voters. It didn't work.
I don't think it will work with Sanders' supporters either. But we'll see.
The Iowa caucuses are a week away.

Texto completo: Bob Shane, the last surviving original member of the Kingston Trio, whose smooth close harmonies helped transform folk music from a dusty niche genre into a dominant brand of pop music in the 1950s and '60s, died on Sunday in Phoenix. He was 85.
Shane, whose whiskey baritone was the group's most identifiable voice on hits like "Tom Dooley" and "Scotch and Soda," sang lead on more than 80% of Kingston Trio songs.
He didn't just outlast the other original members: Dave Guard, who died in 1991, and Nick Reynolds, who died in 2008; he also eventually took ownership of the group's name and devoted his life to various incarnations of the trio, from its founding in 1957 to 2004.
Along the way, the trio spearheaded a reinvention of folk as a youthful, mass media phenomenon; at its peak, in 1959, the group put four albums in the Top 10 at the same time.
Shane was born Robert Castle Schoen on Feb. 1, 1934, in Hilo, Hawaii, to Arthur Castle Schoen and Margaret (Schaufelberger) Schoen.
In Hilo, Shane's father had planned for Bob to take over the family business. But at the private Punahou School in Honolulu, Bob learned the ukulele and songs of the Polynesian Islands and met Guard, with whom he formed a duet. After high school, Shane, Reynolds and Guard occasionally played together while attending college in Northern California.
After graduating in 1956, Shane returned to Hawaii to learn the family business, but he found himself more drawn to music.
More than any group of its time, the Kingston Trio captured the youthful optimism of the Kennedy years. The title song of a 1962 album was "The New Frontier," echoing President John F. Kennedy's own phrase and alluding to his inaugural address.
After retiring, Shane lived in Phoenix in a home full of gold records and Kingston Trio memorabilia. Fond of cars and dirt bikes, he also collected Martin guitars and art. His survivors include his wife, Bobbi (Childress) Shane. He had two children from an earlier marriage, to Louise Brandon.

The distinctive character of California syrah

Texto completo: Some wines confirm assumptions. Others shock the system.
Good syrah, especially when made using traditional methods like fermenting the grapes with their stems, can be one of those jarring wines. Depending on one's experience and expectations, it can delight or appall.
I adore syrah, and the more extreme, the better. Yet when I recently opened a bottle of Louis Sozet Cornas 2014, a traditionally made syrah wine from the Northern Rhône Valley of France, for dinner, a friend did a double take.
The Sozet Cornas, made in tiny quantities by an aging vigneron, epitomizes how unusual these wines can be. Its set of flavors -- peppery, meaty, herbal and earthy -- was one my friend had never encountered in a wine before. He was intrigued, but he was not sure whether he liked it. Or whether he didn't like it.
His reaction was a valuable experience. For him, it was an introduction to a radically different sort of wine, which, to his credit, he did not reject out of hand. For me, it was a reminder of how a wine that I have come to know well and love might be perceived from a fresh perspective.
Shock value can be intriguing, but it alone is not enough to make a wine worth drinking. I seek out wines that are distinctive -- a quality that in an exaggerated or unexpected form can be shocking. But something more is necessary as well.
Distinctive wines have identities derived from the inherent characters of the grapes, the places they were grown and the people who produced them. They must also be delicious, a subjective quality that varies like one's musical taste.
The aim is to develop our own sense of deliciousness, our own taste. Wine, though, occupies a fearsome pedestal that can intimidate drinkers into meek acceptance or provoke an equally unfortunate reaction of bullheadedness in an effort to prove oneself fearless.
Either way, the result is not a direct evaluation of the wine itself but a response to wine's generalized aura.
The hope is that we can try all manner of wines, eliminate those voices in our heads telling us what to think and focus entirely on our own reactions. In pursuit of that goal, each month I pick a particular type of wine and suggest three bottles for you to drink in a relaxed environment with friends or family.
Lately, we have been drinking California syrah, which is generally much less extreme than the bottle of Cornas I opened. Yet the wines still managed to surprise a few readers.
The three bottles I recommended were: Stolpman Vineyards Ballard Canyon Estate Grown Syrah 2016; the Ojai Vineyard Santa Barbara County Syrah 2016 and Arnot-Roberts Sonoma Coast Syrah 2015. They ranged in price from $28 for the Stolpman to $45 for the Arnot-Roberts.
"Whoa," said Dan Barron of Manhattan on taking a whiff of the Arnot-Roberts. "Never smelled anything like that before!"
A Princeton, New Jersey, reader, who tried the Stolpman and the Ojai, described the wines as "not sweetly fruity but feral fruity," which I thought was apt. "These were wines with character and I liked them, but I don't think everyone would," she said.
The Arnot-Roberts was snappy and savory, with an earthy, meaty set of aromas and flavors that included violets, herbs and olives. It was intense, yet light and full of energy. Its alcohol level was just 12.5%, partly because the grapes came from relatively cool areas of the Sonoma coast, and partly because that is the preferred style of the producers.
By comparison, the Ojai was less intensely savory and herbal. It was still floral, with syrah's characteristic meaty, peppery, olive aromas and flavors, but it had a spine of red fruit, perhaps because the syrah was blended with 22% grenache and 3% sangiovese.
I hadn't realized this in advance. Most syrahs are either 100% syrah or blended with a little viognier, as is traditional in Côte-Rôtie in the Northern Rhône. But all varietal wines in California may be blends, so long as the variety after which a bottle is named makes up at least 75% of the mix.
The Ojai was still an excellent wine, I thought, aromatic and lively, but less exotic than the Arnot-Roberts. Most of the grapes came from the eastern part of the Santa Rita Hills in western Santa Barbara County.
The Stolpman comes from Ballard Canyon in eastern Santa Barbara County, a warmer site compared with the Sonoma coast or Santa Rita Hills, and the wine tasted riper and lusher than the other two. It had some herbal qualities, more anise and menthol than leafy and brambly, but it was by far the most mainstream of the wines, in the sense that the primary flavor was fruit.
Though it was 100% syrah, and 50% whole bunch, it still was the least distinctive of the three, and harder to immediately identify as syrah. Nonetheless, it was balanced and energetic, not bad at all.
It was evidence, though, that the character of syrah is hugely dependent on where it's grown, as was pointed out by one reader Randall Grahm, the longtime proprietor of Bonny Doon Vineyard and a leading advocate for California syrah (who, by the way, recently sold the brand to WarRoom Ventures, a small wine company).
In California, it has often been planted in sites that were too warm, yielding generic red wines without the character that, in an extreme version like the Sozet Carnas, can make you sit up and take notice.
Regardless of how people feel about the grape, the quality of the syrahs from California is getting better and better, and the grape has spread far from its home in the Northern Rhône, with great examples coming from Washington state, Australia (where it is often known as shiraz) and South Africa.

Your next lesson: Rioja Gran Reserva
If ever a wine seemed out of step with the times, it would be Rioja Gran Reserva.
The rest of the wine world has adopted the Burgundian way of thinking, in which a wine is defined by the place in which the grapes were grown. The more distinctive the vineyard, and the more narrowly circumscribed, the more prized the wine.
But Rioja Gran Reserva is defined not by terroir -- as long as the grapes come from the confines of the Rioja appellation in northern Spain -- but by how long the wine has aged. The rules require gran reservas to have been aged at least two years in barrels and three in bottles before they can be released.
That means the youngest gran reserva on the market must be at least 5 years old. Practically speaking, most are older than that. R. López de Heredia, a Rioja producer that adheres to the oldest regional traditions, does not release its gran reservas until the producer believes the wine is ready to drink. Its current release is 1995.
I love old-school gran reservas. They have a unique softly burnished, mellow style, which seems both old and new at the same time. But even in Rioja, the style seems to be slipping away, except in the hands of committed traditionalists.

The three bottles I suggest are:
* Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva 2006 (Pacific Highway Wines and Spirits, Greensboro, North Carolina), $35
* Bodegas Riojanas Rioja Gran Reserva Monte Real 2010 (M.S. Walker, Norwood, Massachusetts), $39
* La Rioja Alta Rioja Gran Reserva 904 2009 (Skurnik Wines, New York), $53
These three are not as old as the López de Heredia, but they are not babies, either. If you cannot find these bottles, by all means try gran reservas from Remelluri, CVNE, Imperial and Viña Real (which are both owned by CVNE), Muga, Sierra Cantabria or Hermanos de Peciña. If you want to splurge on a López de Heredia, you would be in for a treat.

Characteristics to consider
* Age: Do these wines differ from young reds?
* Texture: How do they feel, and why?
* Forecast: Where do you think they are in their life span?

Quirk of British law pays for royals

Texto completo: Every six months or so, Alan Davis sets out from his seaside bungalow on a far-flung island off the southwestern coast of England carrying a rent check of about $16 for his landlord.
But this is no ordinary landlord, and no ordinary rent check.
Davis lives on a tiny corner of the Duchy of Cornwall, the property empire controlled by Prince Charles, the heir to Britain's throne, who has quietly turned an inheritance of rundown farmland into a billion-pound real estate conglomerate.
By a quirk of British law, Davis has to pay the prince for the privilege of living on his land, piddling as the checks may be.
"It's a feudal way of carrying on," Davis said. "They put their finger in and demand money. They're a law unto themselves."
Prince Charles' fortune, long shielded from scrutiny by parliamentary indifference and obscure accounting, spilled into public view in January when his younger son, Prince Harry, announced that he and his wife, Meghan, were quitting their royal duties. In trying to prove that they would renounce taxpayer money, Harry and Meghan gave Britons a peek at the shadowy world of ostensibly private finance that bankrolls the family and its mansions, gardens and considerable staff.
But what the royals call private contains, by any other measure, a generous mix of public giveaways: medieval landholdings passed from one male heir to the next, sweeping tax relief, indemnity from some laws and exemptions from others, ownership of long stretches of coastline and all the treasure buried in Cornwall.
Those perks have delivered Prince Charles substantial wealth. Income from the duchy has nearly tripled in two decades, to about $28.3 million, last year. But the uproar over Harry and Meghan's funding has raised uncomfortable questions for the prince and the royals about whether any of their income can truly be considered private.
Coming on the heels of Prince Charles' brother Andrew being kicked off the royal front lines for socializing with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, such scrutiny is another dent to the royal mystique.
"Harry has chucked a grenade into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace," said David McClure, author of a book about the royal family's wealth. "It's weakened the foundations of the royal family and their money, and it's raised issues that don't just apply to Harry but have been bubbling under the surface for at least a decade."
Among the biggest of those is the special treatment afforded Prince Charles' property empire, an estate that, among other things, pays for the upkeep of his country mansion and furnished 5 million pounds last year for the families of Harry and his older brother, Prince William.
The duchy has a vast footprint, stretching from the rocky shores of Cornwall to south London, and from medieval castles to a granite-walled men's prison. It recently bought a 400,000-square-foot supermarket warehouse north of London.
A spokeswoman for the duchy said in a statement that Parliament had "confirmed its status as a private estate" and that the Treasury had agreed that its tax status did not confer an unfair advantage.
"The prince has always ensured it is run with the interests of its communities as an equal priority," the statement said.
The duchy's holdings reflect how the royal family's wealth has become concentrated in the hands of Prince Charles and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, whose own estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, paid her 21.7 million pounds last year.
Together, the two duchies bankroll more than a dozen members of the family, supplementing a taxpayer grant of 82 million pounds last year reserved for official duties and the upkeep of several palaces.
Despite lawmakers once deeming its current income "an accident of history," the Duchy of Cornwall has mostly avoided harsh questions, in part by playing up its interest in traditional architecture and sustainable practices across its humbler holdings: scores of farms, much of Dartmoor National Park in Devon and rivers throughout Cornwall. But analysts say that obscures fierce commercial instincts.
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, you sort of assume it is a duck," a Labour lawmaker told duchy officials during a 2013 hearing. "The Duchy of Cornwall looks and behaves like a corporation."
But the duchy does not pay taxes like a corporation. Instead it sits in a legal limbo, using its royal status to skirt corporation and capital gains taxes even as it argues that, as a private estate, it has no obligation to open its books. The duchy said its capital gains were all reinvested in the business, obviating the need to tax them, and that only companies paid corporation tax.
Prince Charles pays tax on his duchy income only voluntarily and after deducting what analysts believe to be about 10 million pounds that he deems official and charitable spending. He has also written off tens of thousands of pounds that he pays for gardening at Highgrove, his country house, on the basis that members of the public were occasionally invited in.
The duchy's powers go even further.
Prince Charles inherits the possessions of anyone who dies in Cornwall without a will or next of kin, a power that in some years has yielded hundreds of thousands of pounds. He funnels the money into charities after deducting his costs.
A similar carve-out gives Prince Charles unusual power over some homeowners on the Isles of Scilly, a picturesque archipelago off the southwestern coast of England, and in Newton St. Loe, a village near Bath.
People like Davis own their homes, but the duchy owns the ground on which they are built. Such an arrangement is not uncommon in England, but homeowners would usually have the option to buy the land. Not on some duchy land.
That enables the duchy to charge small ground rents to homeowners grandfathered into long leases, like Davis. Once those leases lapse, it can also raise rents to thousands of pounds per year, making it difficult for people to sell or mortgage their homes.
In one case, a couple built a house on the Isles of Scilly, only to have the duchy force them to sign a lease bequeathing the property to Prince Charles' estate upon their death, said Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer in the House of Lords, who tried unsuccessfully to push through a bill in 2017 ending the duchy's special landlord status and removing its tax exemptions.

Texto completo: The CIA contractor who interrogated Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the man accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, testified that he threatened to kill one of Mohammed's sons if there was another attack on America.
James Mitchell, a psychologist who helped develop the CIA's interrogation program, said Monday that he made the threat after he had waterboarded Mohammed for the 183rd time. He said he did so after he consulted a lawyer at the agency's Counterterrorism Center about how to make the threat without violating "the Torture Convention."
He said he was advised to make the threat conditional.
So, before telling Mohammed, "I will cut your son's throat," Mitchell said, he added a series of caveats. They included "if there was another catastrophic attack in the United States," if Mohammed withheld "information that could have stopped it" and "if another American child was killed."
Mitchell was testifying in a pretrial hearing that has been focused in part on the torture of the defendants in the Sept. 11 case before they were sent to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay.
Mitchell said he made the threat in March 2003 as "an emotional flag" as he was transitioning from waterboarding and other violent "enhanced interrogation techniques" to more traditional questioning of Mohammed.
Pakistani security forces reportedly took Mohammed's sons, Abed, 7, and Yusuf, 9, into custody in September 2002 during a joint raid with U.S. forces that also seized Ramzi bin al-Shibh, another defendant in the 9/11 war crimes case. Mohammed would be captured in Pakistan six months later. He was at a CIA black site in Poland when Mitchell made the threat.
The boys were subsequently released and are believed to be living in Iran with their mother, but Mohammed apparently did not know the fate of the boys until many years later, after the CIA transferred him to the Pentagon-run prison complex at Guantanamo Bay.
It was one of the most emotional moments in five days of testimony by Mitchell on the question of torture before the trial of five men accused of conspiracy in the attacks is scheduled to start next year. He was unapologetic.
Mitchell said that eight children died in the 9/11 hijackings that killed 2,976 people in New York, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. Then he gestured toward Mohammed, who was sitting with his lawyers 25 feet away and declared, "He's smirking."
The smirk, or any emotion, was not visible from a spectator's gallery at the back of the court. Mohammed appeared impassive throughout the testimony, occasionally fingering his long beard, while his lawyer, David Nevin, questioned Mitchell.
"Do you think that telling someone that might instill fear in that person?" Nevin asked.
"Yes, I do," Mitchell replied. "That was the only time that I made that threat to him."
Mitchell identified the CIA lawyer he consulted by a code that prosecutors assigned him to avoid disclosure of his name, PJ1. In testimony last week, Mitchell said PJ1 was at a July 1, 2002, meeting where lawyers and others from the intelligence agency's Counterterrorism Center first discussed using "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques." PJ1 was also part of a delegation from CIA headquarters that visited a black site in Thailand in August 2002 and observed the waterboarding of a prisoner named Abu Zubaydah, a display that brought tears to the eyes of some in the delegation.
Zeke Johnson, a program director for Amnesty International who was watching the proceedings, said the threat to kill one of Mohammed's children no doubt broke the law.
"Threatening to kill a detainee's child would violate the Convention Against Torture and be illegal," Johnson said. "Anyone who broke the law must be held accountable."

Texto completo: French carmaker Renault named a former Volkswagen executive as its chief executive Tuesday, a crucial step as it tries to revive its troubled alliance with Japanese carmaker Nissan.
The executive, Luca de Meo, 52, recently stepped down as the president of SEAT, a Spanish car brand that has become one of Volkswagen's best-performing divisions since he took over in 2015.
De Meo will take office July 1, Renault said. Until then, Clotilde Delbos, Renault's chief financial officer, will continue to serve as interim chief executive.
De Meo, who has spent most of his career in marketing, is likely to be less imperious and more diplomatic than Carlos Ghosn, who was CEO of Renault before his arrest in Japan in November 2018 on charges of financial impropriety. Ghosn, who has denied the allegations, fled Japan on Dec. 29 and appeared before reporters Jan. 8 in Lebanon.
De Meo takes over after a tumultuous year at Renault that included an attempt to merge with Fiat Chrysler. The deal fell apart at the last minute. Fiat Chrysler has since agreed to merge with PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars.
De Meo replaces Thierry Bollore, who succeeded Ghosn but was pushed out in October by Jean-Dominique Senard, the Renault chairman. Bollore had clashed with top executives at Nissan.
One of his main tasks will be to help repair fissures in Renault's alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi, which were exposed by Ghosn's downfall.
The Japanese have chafed at French dominance of the partnership. Nissan sells more cars and, unlike Renault, has a strong presence in the U.S. But Renault is Nissan's largest shareholder, with a stake of more than 40%, giving it the upper hand.
Despite their uneasy relationship, the French and Japanese companies need each other to survive technological upheaval as the industry moves toward electric cars with autonomous driving capability.
Before becoming president of SEAT, de Meo was a member of the management board of Audi, Volkswagen's luxury car division.

Have search warrant for data? Google wants agencies to pay

Texto completo: Facing an increasing number of requests for its users' information, Google began charging law enforcement and other government agencies this month for legal demands seeking data such as emails, location-tracking information and search queries.
Google's fees range from $45 for a subpoena and $60 for a wiretap to $245 for a search warrant, according to a notice sent to law enforcement officials and reviewed by The New York Times. The notice also included fees for other legal requests.
A spokesman for Google said the fees were intended in part to help offset the costs of complying with warrants and subpoenas.
Federal law allows companies to charge the government reimbursement fees of this type, but Google's decision is a major change in how it deals with legal requests.
Some Silicon Valley companies have forgone such charges, which can be difficult to enforce at a large scale and could give the impression that a company aims to profit from legal searches. But privacy experts support such fees as a deterrent to overbroad surveillance.
Google has tremendous amounts of information on billions of users, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world routinely submit legal requests seeking that data. In the first half of 2019, the company received more than 75,000 requests for data on nearly 165,000 accounts worldwide; 1 in 3 of those requests came from the United States.
Google has previously charged for legal requests. A record from 2008 showed that the company sought reimbursement for a legal request for user data. But a spokesman said that for many years now, the tech firm had not systematically charged for standard legal processes.
The money brought in from the new fees would be inconsequential for Google. Just last week, the valuation of its parent company, Alphabet, topped $1 trillion for the first time. Alphabet is scheduled to report its latest financial results Monday.
The new fees could help recover some of the costs required to fill such a large volume of legal requests, said Al Gidari, a lawyer who for years represented Google and other technology and telecommunications companies. The requests have also grown more complicated as tech companies have acquired more data and law enforcement has become more technologically sophisticated.
"None of the services were designed with exfiltrating data for law enforcement in mind," said Gidari, who is the consulting privacy director at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.
Gidari said it was good that the fees might result in fewer legal requests.
"The actual costs of doing wiretaps and responding to search warrants is high, and when you pass those costs on to the government, it deters from excessive surveillance," he said.
In April, the Times reported that Google had been inundated with a new type of search warrant request, geofence searches.
Drawing on an enormous Google database called Sensorvault, they provide law enforcement with the opportunity to find suspects and witnesses using location data gleaned from user devices.
A Google spokesman said that there was no specific reason the fees were announced this month and that they had been under consideration for some time.
Reports put out by the company show a rise of more than 50% in the number of search warrants received in the first half of 2019 compared with a year earlier. The volume of subpoenas increased 15%. From last January through June, the company received nearly 13,000 subpoenas and more than 10,000 search warrants from U.S. law enforcement.
Google will not ask for reimbursement in some cases, including child safety investigations and life-threatening emergencies, the spokesman said.

What happened to journalism?

Texto completo: According to the American Press Institute, "News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing events, issues, and characters in the world outside.
Though it may be interesting or even entertaining, the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed. The purpose of journalism is thus to provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives, their communities, their societies, and their governments."
Unfortunately, journalism no longer exists in media today. For the most part, both print media and broadcast media are nothing more than purveyors of the propaganda that their partners in the Democrat Party want them to push. The media is nothing more than the most outspoken activist organization of the party that they have aligned themselves with.
The mainstream media outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, NBC and so many other outlets have earned and well deserve the title of "fake news," even though they detest that label.
There are so many blatant examples of media bias in the news that it has become commonplace now. In fact, a recent Monmouth University poll states "More than 3-in-4 of 803 American respondents, or 77 percent, said they believe that major traditional television and newspaper media outlets report 'fake news.'"
I can't help but conclude that the media outlets work with the Democrats to come up with daily talking points and then repeat those over and over with the exact same verbiage, thinking that if they all repeat those talking points enough they will be believed.
In the distant past, readers and viewers of news could expect that the reporting was factual, but based on results I can no longer trust anything that comes out of most news outlets. There used to be a profession called "investigative journalism," but that also has been abandoned.
Here is a perfect example. The New York Times finds out that Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden is being investigated by a prosecutor in Ukraine. Instead of investigating the validity and searching for facts, the paper contacts Joe Biden, who flies over to Ukraine at taxpayer expense and threatens the president of Ukraine that if that prosecutor is not fired Ukraine will not get the billion dollars in aid that was approved by Congress. Joe Biden is on camera bragging about this quid pro quo, but the media buries it to protect their ally.
Why is it that the media refuses to confront liars like Adam Schiff, Jim Comey, John Brennan, etc. instead of helping them cover up their lies and corruption? It is obvious that the agenda of the Democrats and the media supersedes facts and truthful reporting.
It has become so bad that libraries should file daily newspapers in the fiction section. Now we have this sham impeachment of President Trump that the media, along with their Democrat allies, are obsessed with. We have Nancy Pelosi going on camera with a long face stating that this is a sad and somber time for America, along with her phony "solemnity."
The media repeats this over and over to show their agreement with the Speaker. But then we see Ms. Pelosi celebrating with giddy excitement as she hands out souvenir pens after signing the articles of impeachment.
And the media is once again in alignment on all their broadcasts giddy with excitement as they report on the sham impeachment of the President. The media refuses to report all of the accomplishments of President Trump in the face of constant opposition, and is seen hoping for failure for America.
It is so disgusting to see media pundits express their hope for a recession just so that it will give them something to blame our President for. So it is obviously more important that Americans suffer than to hope for American success.
My hope is that journalists will soon return to the media and be honest with their reporting, but I will not hold my breath for that.

Kentucky bill targets sex reassignment of transgender youths

Texto completo: FRANKFORT – Doctors could be jailed for providing transgender youth with identity-related medical treatments under a new bill in the Kentucky Legislature, the latest in a series of conservative legislative efforts in several states aimed at transgender minors.
The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Savannah Maddox, would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe medications, including puberty-blocking or hormone treatments, or conduct surgeries, for anyone younger than 18 with the intent to alter their gender.
Ostensibly aimed at barring children who could still be grappling with their gender identity from undergoing body-changing treatments, the measure drew a sharp rebuke from LGBTQ advocates and families who say it would only heighten risks for transgender youth.
"These sorts of decisions need to be made by medical providers, not politicians," said Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ-rights organization in Louisville. He said it represents a "coordinated political attack" on transgender people "for election-year purposes."
Maddox did not respond to messages seeking comment. But last fall she wrote on her Facebook page her intention to draft the bill, saying, "I am a strong advocate for parent's (sic) rights — but it is not the right of a parent to permanently alter a child's gender or identity, even when based upon certain behaviors or the perceptions of a child's mind which has not yet had time to fully develop."
It's rare for transgender minors to get surgery, and most have undergone years of consultations with doctors, counselors and family, often first changing names or how they dress, before any medications are adopted, experts said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week issued a study that found access to puberty blockers helped reduced risks of mental health problems and suicide attempts, which some studies say are as high 40% among transgender youth.
"It's a horrible thing," Cassie Kasey said of the bill. Kasey said puberty blockers were important during a critical juncture for her transgender daughter, Maddie Dalton, who is now 20.
Dalton was among the first students at Louisville's Atherton High School to come out as transgender, and her subsequent push for a policy allowing her to use the women's restroom and locker room sparked a fiery public controversy in 2014 that made national headlines.
The measure joins several other proposed bills targeting transgender individuals in Kentucky's General Assembly this year.
That includes a resurrected "bathroom bill" that would ban transgender students from using public restrooms that align with their gender identities.
Another bill targets transgender individuals in sports, forcing student-athletes to compete in school sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.
Bills restricting access to hormone treatment and surgeries for young transgender people have been introduced in several states, including South Dakota, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
Such measures run counter to standards and guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, the group said.
The Kentucky Medical Association did not immediately provide a response to the legislation. Some transgender residents said it would make getting knowledgeable transgender medical care extremely difficult for families.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving youths access to "comprehensive gender-affirming and developmentally appropriate health care" while laying out risks and benefits.
Janet Vessels, a Kentucky clinical counselor who works with transgender youth in collaborations with doctors, said providers follow established medical guidance and families carefully weigh risks and benefits at every step.
"They don't do it haphazardly," she said.
"There are a lot of things about trans kids that a lot of people don't understand," said Jeri Stine Hahn, who raised a Lexington transgender stepdaughter and who runs a support group for parents.
Her stepdaughter, Crystal Hahn, 20, said she socially transitioned at age 10, began hormone blockers at age 11 and began estrogen treatment at age 15. If the proposed bill were law, she said, the struggles would have been monumental.
"I genuinely don't know if I'd even be alive," she said.
Hahn believes the bills were fueled in part after conservatives seized on a case in Texas last year, when two parents clashed in a highly publicized custody battle that included a clash over their 7-year-old and gender identity.
According to media reports, the father alleged that the mother, a doctor, had pushed their child into self-identifying as a girl and advocated for related medical care, a charge the mother flatly denied.
Nonetheless, the father drew support from conservative politicians. Donald Trump Jr. last fall tweeted, "This is child abuse. People need to start to stand up against this bullshit."
The New York Times reported that the South Dakota bill received input from groups including the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom. The Arizona-based group didn't comment on whether it had consulted on Kentucky's law but issued a statement.
"Our laws should protect every child's opportunity to have a natural childhood. While approaches may differ, we should all agree that there is nothing natural or healthy about pumping kids full of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones," said Matt Sharp, the alliance's senior counsel and director of state government relations. "Children should not be pushed to receive experimental treatments that can leave them permanently sterile and physically marred for life."
The proposed bill in Kentucky also would create protections for public employees who express opinions about gender identity.
And it says parents can withhold consent for "any activity designed and intended to form their child's conceptions of sex or to treat gender dysphoria," the mismatch between gender identity and a person's sex at birth.
Nearly three years ago Maddie Dalton became the first student at Louisville's Atherton High to come out as a transgender woman, and her push to use the women's bathroom sparked a public controversy.

Texto completo: A Republican power couple from Mount Vernon, Ohio, and the namesake grandson of Upper Arlington golf legend Jack Nicklaus were among those captured in a secret recording of a small dinner with President Donald Trump.
Jack Nicklaus III and Trump donors Karen Buchwald Wright, president and chief executive officer of Ariel Corp., and her husband, Thomas Rastin, a company executive vice president, were on hand for the April 30, 2018, private event.
Amid the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of Trump, the recording released by the lawyer for indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas made headlines for disclosing Trump's call to "take out" Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
The recording also shows interactions between the golf-loving president and Nicklaus, with The New York Times reporting Rastin was on the invitation list and accompanied by a "woman resembling his wife" to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.
People who know Buchwald Wright confirmed to the Dispatch that she appears in a portion of the video made by another indicted Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, before Trump entered the room, after which it only captures audio.
Male and female voices near the start of the video, apparently Rastin and Buchwald Wright, identify themselves as living in Mount Vernon, home to Ariel Corp., a major manufacturer of gas compressors.
The dinner was for donors to America First Action, a major Trump super PAC. Rastin and Buchwald Wright contributed a total of $1 million to the PAC across 2018 and 2019, according to Federal Election Commission records.
The couple has contributed $9.7 million to mostly Republican federal candidates and conservative causes since 2004, with Rastin alone giving $6 million since 2008, according to federal records. Rastin also has given $805,452 to state candidates and causes, including $613,720 to the Ohio Republican Party, since 2016, state records show. They did not respond Monday to a request for comment relayed through Ariel Corp.
At one point in the recording, a male voice, apparently Rastin due to a mention of gas compressor manufacturing, promotes increased use of natural gas to Trump, telling him manufacturers should make more compressed natural gas-powered vehicles.
A few months later, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, introduced the Light-Duty Natural Gas Vehicle Parity Act to require the U.S. EPA to regulate natural-gas vehicles the same as electric vehicles. The bill supported by Ariel could boost sales of light-duty trucks powered by natural gas and, potentially, Ariel compressors. U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Marietta, introduced a companion bill in the House.
Trump and Nicklaus III bantered about golf and his grandfather Jack Nicklaus, with his Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, home to the Memorial Tournament, mentioned a couple of times, including as host of the Presidents Cup in 2013.
The president said the older Nicklaus "made one of the best speeches I've ever heard ... (at) the congressional whatever it is, the freedom medal." Nicklaus received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2015 for his golf achievements and public service.
Trump also talked of telling the Golden Bear that it "was more incredible ... harder and more improbable to win 18 majors" (golf tournaments) than it was for him to win election as president in 2016. Jack Nicklaus disagreed with the assertion, Trump said.
One man at the dinner told Trump, ahead of his then-upcoming summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, to stage the event at Songdo, a South Korea "smart city" development featuring a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus.
Gale International, a company operated by Stanley Gale, is a partner in the project and attended the dinner, according to the Times. Nicklaus III is listed as an acquisitions and development executive with Gale. He did not respond Monday to a request for comment relayed through the company.

Texto completo: Comedian Louis C.K. will take the Broome County Forum Theatre stage in March, the Forum announced Tuesday morning.
Tickets for the 7:30 p.m. March 28 show went on sale Tuesday.
C.K. has won six Emmy Awards, released eight stand-up specials, and is the creator, writer and director of the Peabody Award-winning shows "Louie"(which also won two Emmy Awards) and "Horace and Pete." In 2015, he became the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden in New York three times during the same tour.
But his career went into a downward spiral after five women accused him of sexual misconduct in a New York Times article.
"Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy," the article stated.
In a statement issued to The New York Times, C.K. said the "stories are true," and apologized for his actions.
"I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want," the statement concluded. "I will now step back and take a long time to listen."
Attempts to revive his career began the following year, with C.K. making surprise appearances at comedy clubs. In December 2018, he came under fire again for delivering a 50-minute set at Governor's Comedy Club on Long Island that included jokes mocking survivors from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The material was made public after audio from his set was posted on YouTube.
But if you go to C.K.'s Broome County Forum performance, audio and video recording will not be permitted.
His tour mandates all phones and smart watches be secured in pouches made by the Yondr company.
What's a Yondr pouch? In the past, C.K. has utilized the Yondr pouches when testing out new material, before the sexual misconduct allegations against him were made public.
To use a Yondr pouch, audience members must place their device inside the case. While participants get to maintain possession of their devices, the case remains locked inside a certain area. They can be unlocked using an unlocking base outside the designated area.
The pouches have become increasingly popular in performance venues.
Comedians including Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock and Hannibal Buress have used the pouches, as well as musicians The Lumineers, Madonna and Alicia Keys. They've become a way for performers to protect their material from being recorded and distributed online, and also to limit the influx of distractions and disturbances caused by technology.
For The Lumineers, NPR reported, the pouches came in handy at "secret shows" where they played material from their album "Cleopatra" and didn't want it to be leaked before the album's release date.
It's also been used on Broadway, with improv troupe Freestyle Love Supreme (co-founded by "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda) utilizing the cases during its latest Broadway engagement.
According to Yondr's website, the pouches also can be used in schools, at special events such as weddings, and in court proceedings.
In a statement titled "Copyright notice," posted on the Broome County Forum's website, C.K. threatens legal action against anyone who reproduces any of his material from the performance.
The following note is listed on the Forum's website:
"Copyright Notice: Louis CK owns all rights in the content and materials, including any jokes and sketches (the "Materials"), delivered during his performance. The Materials may not be copied, translated, transmitted, displayed, distributed, or reproduced verbatim (the "Use"), in whole or in part, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, without the express prior written consent of Louis CK. Any Use of the Materials without the express prior written consent of Louis CK is strictly prohibited and shall be subject to all available legal remedies, whether in equity or at law at the cost of anyone who violates this prohibition.
It says anyone using a cellphone during the performance will be removed from the venue.
Louis C.K. 2020 tour dates As of Tuesday, C.K. had 30 tour dates listed on his website, and nearly half were sold out, including a performance March 10 at the Egg in Albany.
The international tour includes engagements in Romania and Denmark. He is also scheduled to perform March 29 in Syracuse, the day after the Binghamton show.
Tickets for the Binghamton performance can be purchased at the Arena Box Office at 1 Stuart St. or by visiting ticketmaster.com.
C.K.'s tour is unnamed, and his website doesn't mention the recent controversies that have surrounded his career.

Library picked for divisive book club promotion

Texto completo: "When you have a book like this and it's controversial, I think a lot of people want to read it" so they can "find out exactly what the book is about and then they can have their own judgment."
Norma Martinez
El Paso Public Library director
El Paso Public Library was one of a handful invited to participate in a pilot partnership between Oprah's Book Club and the American Library Association to promote "American Dirt," Oprah Winfrey's latest book pick that has faced backlash since its announcement last week.
The book club's partnership with local library book groups came to light after the director of another border city library took to Twitter to announce she was backing out.
"After two sleepless nights and numerous conversations with my predominantly Latinx staff, I decided that I cannot — will not — endorse this book at my library," McAllen Public Library Director Kate Horan wrote in a Jan. 23 Twitter post shared by more than 400 people.
Jeanine Cummins' novel tells the story of Lydia, a middle-class Mexican bookseller who flees to the United States with her young son after a drug cartel kills her journalist husband. Critics accuse Cummins of relying heavily on stereotypes about migration and Mexican culture and appropriating from Latino authors who have written extensively about Mexican and Central American migration.
El Paso's library has no plans to abandon its involvement with Oprah's Book Club, El Paso Public Library Director Norma Martinez said. The Westside Branch's book club is reading "American Dirt" and will discuss it at their February meeting, Martinez said. She chose that branch since it has an active and longstanding book club.
"When you have a book like this and it's controversial, I think a lot of people want to read it" so they can "find out exactly what the book is about and then they can have their own judgment," said Martinez, who has not yet read it. That's what a book club does, she said. Members may love a book while others tear it apart.
El Paso's book club has been asked to send Oprah's Book Club a photo of members with the book, Martinez said.
The American Library Association and Oprah's Book Club did not return multiple requests for comment as to which libraries were invited to participate in the pilot partnership.
Horan said she was told libraries in the American Southwest were invited and believes McAllen was picked for a reason.
"I can't help but feel that there was a deliberate assumption that libraries on the border, who were selected to receive the books, would be automatic endorsers, given the subject matter," she wrote on Twitter.
Horan, who has read "American Dirt," describes it as "every negative headline that was chain-stitched together," and worries it will "fulfill every bad fantasy someone has about Mexico and the border."
Partnering with Winfrey to endorse "American Dirt" would have been "very offensive to the community I serve and represent," she said. McAllen-area authors, teachers and professors expressed concern about Cummins' novel to her even before she learned it was Winfrey's latest book club selection, she said.
Neither library was told which book Winfrey would pick when asked to participate last month. Martinez learned the title when she tuned in to "CBS This Morning" on Jan. 21 to watch Winfrey make the announcement.
El Paso's library director said she has not been approached by anyone who feels negatively about the partnership, including members of the Westside Branch's book club, who last week received copies of "American Dirt" donated by Oprah's Book Club.
The El Paso library, however, has not publicized the partnership.
Author Sergio Troncoso, an El Paso native who has a local library branch named in his honor, said in an email the city's librarians should ask themselves, "Should we be part of this promotion of a book chosen by a New York publisher to push sales and interest in an Oprah pick?"
The New York publishing industry "has too often ignored Mexican and Mexican-American writers," Troncoso wrote. He has not read Cummins' book.
Of the 82 books Winfrey has selected since her club started in 1996, not one was written by a Mexican or Mexican-American, David Bowles, a writer and assistant professor of literatures and cultural studies at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece. Only four of her selections are by Latinx or Latin American authors, he said.
While McAllen's library is no longing promoting the title, several copies of "American Dirt" are available for checkout, Horan said.
After the Westside Branch's club discusses the book, the 12 donated copies will enter the library's circulation, Martinez said. Six additional copies will soon be available for checkout, according to the library's catalog.
Winfrey addressed the controversy surrounding her pick for the first time Monday, saying in a video posted to Instagram, "this selection has struck an emotional chord and created a need for a deeper, more substantive discussion." She said she will "bring people together from all sides to talk about this book" in March.

MSU student sent back to Iran

Texto completo: "... it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran."
Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University
An Iranian student traveling to East Lansing to start his first week at Michigan State University was forced by federal agents to return to his home country.
Alireza Yazdani Esfidajani, 27, was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at Detroit Metro Airport on Sunday afternoon. He was placed on a flight back to Tehran on Monday afternoon.
Esfidajani was accepted as a Michigan State graduate student and scheduled to start this week, university spokesperson Emily Guerrant said. He was to officially enroll when he arrived on campus.
He has a valid student visa and planned to pursue a Ph.D. at Michigan State, his attorney Ghazal Nicole Mehrani said. Sunday was his first time in the United States. He spent it in Customs and Border Protection custody, partially at Monroe County's jail, where he was held from about 1 a.m. to noon Monday.
A visa does not guarantee entry to the United States, according to an emailed statement from a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.
"On January 26, Alireza Yazdani Esfidajani applied for entry into the United States, and was later deemed inadmissible, at which time he withdrew his application for admission into the United States," the statement reads. "The traveler was not arrested, rather held until a return flight could be arranged to his place of departure."
The statement did not identify a reason agents denied Yazdani admission into the U.S.
Esfidajani told Mehrani and attorney Bradley Maze that federal agents pressured him to sign a form withdrawing his application. Customs agents "pushed him and they asked questions and questions," then recommended he sign the form, Mehrani said.
"If he has signed a withdrawal of application, there's pretty much no legal remedies," she said.
Immigration law professor: MSU student's removal part of trend toward restricted travel Yazdani's removal from the U.S. follows reports of other Iranian university students' deportations. The New York Times recently reported at least 16 Iranian students had been detained by customs officials at American airports despite securing visas from the State Department allowing them to study in the U.S.
Deporting or pressuring Iranian students to leave the U.S. is part of a trend restricting travel from the Middle East country, said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University.
He pointed to the 2017 travel ban limiting travel from Muslim-majority countries like Iran and the increasing tensions between United States and Iranian forces after the December assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.
"In the broader contexts, it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran," he said.
The State Department thoroughly screens applicants' backgrounds before they issue visas, a process that can take months, Yale-Loehr said.
"Obviously there can be new facts that come to light between the time a person is issued a visa overseas and when they arrive in the United States that may justify (why) they may not be able to enter, but many times it seems to be antagonism toward Iranians that prompts (Customs) officials to go overboard to try to find excuses to prevent them from entering," he said.
MSU leadership, graduate students advocate for detained international student The university has worked with the student's attorneys and contacted federal officials. Guerrant issued a statement Monday describing the university's commitment to international students.
"We want international students to know we value and welcome them to our campus, and we are committed to global engagement, educating international students and collaborating with partners across the world in higher education efforts," she said. "MSU's international students make tremendous contributions to fueling discoveries and scholarship. Global leadership can only be maintained if talented people from across the globe are encouraged to come here to study and work."
Leadership of the MSU Graduate Employees Union is spreading the word about Esfidajani's case and asking federal officials to intervene, Chief Information Officer Darren Incorvaia said.
"We see it as our job to stand up for graduate students at Michigan State specifically, but also across the country," he said.
BBC reporter Bahman Kalbasi reported the student's detention on Twitter on Sunday night.
"... it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran."

Texto completo: Tom Steyer said Monday that he would be open to a compromise between Senate Republicans and Democrats allows each side to call witnesses in the impeachment trial – including former Vice President Joe Biden – if it also secures testimony by Trump administration officials.
Asked by a reporter whether it would be fair for senators to trade testimony by Biden for testimony by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Steyer, who, like Biden, is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he's open to "anything that gets those administration people in front of those TV cameras under oath."
"I think it's absolutely critical that the administration officials who have the direct information about what went on testify in front of you – in front of that TV camera, with no editing, under oath, in front of the American people," he said. "I think that's critical, and I think that is the key thing. And anything we have to do to get that, I'm for."
But the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Need to Impeach founder also said he thinks Biden is a "red herring" and "not what this is about."
Biden said last week during an event in Osage, Iowa, that he would not offer to testify in the trial in exchange for securing Republican witnesses.
"They're trying to turn it into political theater but I want no part of being any part of that," he said.
Biden reiterated that stance on Monday, saying in a Iowa City Press-Citizen interview: "This is a classic Trump deal. It's the reason he is being impeached in the first place. He's trying to always focus on something else other than him."
Steyer's comments came as the team of lawyers representing President Donald Trump argued that the impeachment proceedings were partisan and unconstitutional.
Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that Bolton has written in an upcoming book that Trump said he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine until officials turned over documents related to the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump is on trial in the U.S. Senate after being impeached by the U.S. House on articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Steyer founded Need to Impeach, a group with the goal of impeaching Trump, in October 2017. He said Monday his goal throughout his Need to Impeach campaign has been to allow people to learn the truth through televised impeachment hearings.
"That's why I started Need to Impeach," he said. "Let the American people have the truth on TV under oath, and let us decide, because that's all I really care about."
Steyer made his comments to reporters following a town hall at Iowa State University's Scheman Building in Ames that drew more than 100 people. The event was the kickoff of Steyer's "Beat Trump" bus tour, which will take him around the state in the week leading up to the Feb. 3 Iowa Caucuses.

Texto completo: A Republican power couple from Mount Vernon, Ohio, and the namesake grandson of Upper Arlington golf legend Jack Nicklaus were among those captured in a secret recording of a small dinner with President Donald Trump.
Jack Nicklaus III and Trump donors Karen Buchwald Wright, president and chief executive officer of Ariel Corp., and her husband, Thomas Rastin, a company executive vice president, were on hand for the April 30, 2018, private event.
Amid the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of Trump, the recording released by the lawyer for indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas made headlines for disclosing Trump's call to "take out" Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
The recording also shows interactions between the golf-loving president and Nicklaus, with The New York Times reporting Rastin was on the invitation list and accompanied by a "woman resembling his wife" to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.
People who know Buchwald Wright confirmed to the Dispatch that she appears in a portion of the video made by another indicted Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, before Trump entered the room, after which it only captures audio.
Male and female voices near the start of the video, apparently Rastin and Buchwald Wright, identify themselves as living in Mount Vernon, home to Ariel Corp., a major manufacturer of gas compressors.
The dinner was for donors to America First Action, a major Trump super PAC. Rastin and Buchwald Wright contributed a total of $1 million to the PAC across 2018 and 2019, according to Federal Election Commission records.
The couple has contributed $9.7 million to mostly Republican federal candidates and conservative causes since 2004, with Rastin alone giving $6 million since 2008, according to federal records. Rastin also has given $805,452 to state candidates and causes, including $613,720 to the Ohio Republican Party, since 2016, state records show. They did not respond Monday to a request for comment relayed through Ariel Corp.
At one point in the recording, a male voice, apparently Rastin due to a mention of gas compressor manufacturing, promotes increased use of natural gas to Trump, telling him manufacturers should make more compressed natural gas-powered vehicles.
A few months later, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, introduced the Light-Duty Natural Gas Vehicle Parity Act to require the U.S. EPA to regulate natural-gas vehicles the same as electric vehicles. The bill supported by Ariel could boost sales of light-duty trucks powered by natural gas and, potentially, Ariel compressors. U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Marietta, introduced a companion bill in the House.
Trump and Nicklaus III bantered about golf and his grandfather Jack Nicklaus, with his Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, home to the Memorial Tournament, mentioned a couple of times, including as host of the Presidents Cup in 2013.
The president said the older Nicklaus "made one of the best speeches I've ever heard ... (at) the congressional whatever it is, the freedom medal." Nicklaus received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2015 for his golf achievements and public service.
Trump also talked of telling the Golden Bear that it "was more incredible ... harder and more improbable to win 18 majors" (golf tournaments) than it was for him to win election as president in 2016. Jack Nicklaus disagreed with the assertion, Trump said.
One man at the dinner told Trump, ahead of his then-upcoming summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, to stage the event at Songdo, a South Korea "smart city" development featuring a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus.
Gale International, a company operated by Stanley Gale, is a partner in the project and attended the dinner, according to the Times. Nicklaus III is listed as an acquisitions and development executive with Gale. He did not respond Monday to a request for comment relayed through the company.

Quirk of British law pays for royals Source of funding for Harry, Meghan is private. Sort of.

Texto completo: LONDON - Every six months or so, Alan Davis sets out from his seaside bungalow on a far-flung island off the southwestern coast of England carrying a rent check of about $16 for his landlord.
But this is no ordinary landlord, and no ordinary rent check.
Davis lives on a tiny corner of the Duchy of Cornwall, the property empire controlled by Prince Charles, the heir to Britain's throne, who has quietly turned an inheritance of rundown farmland into a billion-pound real estate conglomerate.
By a quirk of British law, Davis has to pay the prince for the privilege of living on his land, piddling as the checks may be.
"It's a feudal way of carrying on," Davis said. "They put their finger in and demand money. They're a law unto themselves."
Prince Charles' fortune, long shielded from scrutiny by parliamentary indifference and obscure accounting, spilled into public view in January when his younger son, Prince Harry, announced that he and his wife, Meghan, were quitting their royal duties. In trying to prove that they would renounce taxpayer money, Harry and Meghan gave Britons a peek at the shadowy world of ostensibly private finance that bankrolls the family and its mansions, gardens and considerable staff.
But what the royals call private contains, by any other measure, a generous mix of public giveaways: medieval landholdings passed from one male heir to the next, sweeping tax relief, indemnity from some laws and exemptions from others, ownership of long stretches of coastline and all the treasure buried in Cornwall.
Those perks have delivered Prince Charles substantial wealth. Income from the duchy has nearly tripled in two decades, to about $28.3 million, last year. But the uproar over Harry and Meghan's funding has raised uncomfortable questions for the prince and the royals about whether any of their income can truly be considered private.
Coming on the heels of Prince Charles' brother Andrew being kicked off the royal front lines for socializing with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, such scrutiny is another dent to the royal mystique.
"Harry has chucked a grenade into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace," said David McClure, author of a book about the royal family's wealth. "It's weakened the foundations of the royal family and their money, and it's raised issues that don't just apply to Harry but have been bubbling under the surface for at least a decade."
Among the biggest of those is the special treatment afforded Prince Charles' property empire, an estate that, among other things, pays for the upkeep of his country mansion and furnished 5 million pounds last year for the families of Harry and his older brother, Prince William.
The duchy has a vast footprint, stretching from the rocky shores of Cornwall to south London, and from medieval castles to a granite-walled men's prison. It recently bought a 400,000-square-foot supermarket warehouse north of London.
A spokeswoman for the duchy said in a statement that Parliament had "confirmed its status as a private estate" and that the Treasury had agreed that its tax status did not confer an unfair advantage.
"The prince has always ensured it is run with the interests of its communities as an equal priority," the statement said.
The duchy's holdings reflect how the royal family's wealth has become concentrated in the hands of Prince Charles and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, whose own estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, paid her 21.7 million pounds last year.
Together, the two duchies bankroll more than a dozen members of the family, supplementing a taxpayer grant of 82 million pounds last year reserved for official duties and the upkeep of several palaces.
Despite lawmakers once deeming its current income "an accident of history," the Duchy of Cornwall has mostly avoided harsh questions, in part by playing up its interest in traditional architecture and sustainable practices across its humbler holdings: scores of farms, much of Dartmoor National Park in Devon and rivers throughout Cornwall. But analysts say that obscures fierce commercial instincts.
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, you sort of assume it is a duck," a Labour lawmaker told duchy officials during a 2013 hearing. "The Duchy of Cornwall looks and behaves like a corporation."
But the duchy does not pay taxes like a corporation. Instead it sits in a legal limbo, using its royal status to skirt corporation and capital gains taxes even as it argues that, as a private estate, it has no obligation to open its books. The duchy said its capital gains were all reinvested in the business, obviating the need to tax them, and that only companies paid corporation tax.
Prince Charles pays tax on his duchy income only voluntarily and after deducting what analysts believe to be about 10 million pounds that he deems official and charitable spending. He has also written off tens of thousands of pounds that he pays for gardening at Highgrove, his country house, on the basis that members of the public were occasionally invited in.
The duchy's powers go even further.
Prince Charles inherits the possessions of anyone who dies in Cornwall without a will or next of kin, a power that in some years has yielded hundreds of thousands of pounds. He funnels the money into charities after deducting his costs.
A similar carve-out gives Prince Charles unusual power over some homeowners on the Isles of Scilly, a picturesque archipelago off the southwestern coast of England, and in Newton St. Loe, a village near Bath.
People like Davis own their homes, but the duchy owns the ground on which they are built. Such an arrangement is not uncommon in England, but homeowners would usually have the option to buy the land. Not on some duchy land.
That enables the duchy to charge small ground rents to homeowners grandfathered into long leases, like Davis. Once those leases lapse, it can also raise rents to thousands of pounds per year, making it difficult for people to sell or mortgage their homes.
In one case, a couple built a house on the Isles of Scilly, only to have the duchy force them to sign a lease bequeathing the property to Prince Charles' estate upon their death, said Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer in the House of Lords, who tried unsuccessfully to push through a bill in 2017 ending the duchy's special landlord status and removing its tax exemptions.

Resumen: Sanders has never won anything that really matters outside of Vermont, and all the available data shows his brand is a flop in red and purple states.

Texto completo: In 2018, a top adviser on the Bernie Sanders campaign published a book called “How Bernie Won. ” Its audacious title drove a story line about the 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton: Sanders hadn’t lost, not really. Rather, he had won in the states that mattered most, and his ideas were proven to be winners.
This is a fairy tale — and a dangerous one. If Democratic voters, hungry for a winner, buy into that myth and believe that Sanders is the most “electable” candidate, they will be making a grave mistake that could hand the presidency back to Donald Trump.
Let’s start with the actual results in the 2016 primary. It was not remotely close. Sanders lost by 3. 8 million votes, 57-43%. She won 34 states and territories to his 23.
Still, Sanders’ team contends that the 2016 results augur well for him, because he dominated in the Midwest, where the presidency is often decided. In particular, they claim that he is popular in the former “Blue Wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which turned red in 2016 and delivered Trump his victory.
Trump will rightly call Sanders socialist
In fact, Sanders lost to Clinton by more than 200,000 votes in the nine states of the Midwest. In the three onetime Blue Wall battleground states, she topped him by over 45,000 votes, though he beat her in Wisconsin and edged her by a point in Michigan. In Ohio, Clinton won by 14 points and nearly 166,000 votes. The best you can say about this Sanders argument is that he didn’t lose as badly in the Midwest as he did elsewhere.
Indeed, in the Sunbelt, the other area that Democrats hope to make a general election battleground in 2020, Sanders got absolutely crushed. He lost Florida 64-33%, Arizona 58-40%, North Carolina 55-41% and Texas 65-33%. Taken together, Clinton trounced Sanders in those four states by more than 1. 2 million votes.
And of course, those were only primary voters. What would the general electorate make of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ? We know that the Trump campaign will seek to label any Democratic nominee a “socialist” — a regular Republican tactic that usually goes nowhere because Democratic nominees have never really been socialists.
Sanders is different, though. As he said in a 1983 political debate: “I am a socialist; of course I’m a socialist. ”
The charge would stick, because this is an identity that he himself has proudly trumpeted. And most Americans view socialism negatively, by a margin of 42-55%. That would be quite a weight around a nominee’s neck in a general election.
The potency of this pending attack is also underscored by Sanders’ central policy proposal: "Medicare for All. " His plan would hand the government control over nearly a fifth of the American economy. It doesn’t take much Trumpian demagoguery to label that “socialized medicine. ”
Candidate Bernie Sanders: America must end high-stakes testing, finally invest in public education
When voters outside the liberal base learned more about this plan over the course of last year, initial curiosity, driven by its bumper-sticker name, collapsed. November polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report found that “large shares of swing voters in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin" say a national Medicare for All plan is a bad idea.
And we don’t have to speculate about the political impact of Medicare for All. It was tested in the 2018 midterms when, as a University of Virginia study recently found, it cost Democrats in swing districts who embraced it nearly 5 points.
Ideas that can't win outside blue zones
Worse, Sanders' overall record since 2016 guts his case. On the very day in 2017 that The New York Times published an op-ed he wrote entitled, “How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections,” his favored candidate in the Virginia gubernatorial primary got blown out by moderate Ralph Northam, who went on to trounce the Republican in the general election.
In 2018, Sanders waded into the Michigan governor's race and backed Abdul El-Sayed, a young, far-left candidate. El-Sayed lost every county in the state to the more mainstream Gretchen Whitmer. She went on to soundly beat the Republican by promising not a “revolution” but rather to “fix the damn roads. ”
Don't ignore reality: Democrats need to face facts about Bernie Sanders, his heart attack and his health
This pattern repeated itself throughout the country. Sanders and his political organization backed candidates at every level, to little or no avail. Their endorsees did not flip House seats from red to blue in 2018, proving that his ideas work only in safely Democratic places.
All of this means that “How Bernie Won” is basically a book of fiction. Sanders has never won anything that really matters outside of Vermont, and all the available data shows that his ideas are politically toxic. Yet a week before primary voting begins, he is surging in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
Democrats now face a monumental choice. Deciding which presidential candidate should go head to head with Donald Trump is the paramount political calculation of our lifetimes. In the past, when Bernie Sanders has declared himself and his ideas to be “winners” in red and purple areas, it has turned out to be demonstrably false. Democrats must not be fooled by him now.

Texto completo: Matthew Cherry, a former NFL player turned filmmaker, received an Oscar nomination for his animated short film "Hair Love," an incredibly charming, tear-jerking story about a black father doing his young daughter's hair for the first time.
"Hair Love," which has an accompanying picture book that became a New York Times bestseller, was released this past summer in theaters with "The Angry Birds Movie 2," and came out in December on social platforms. The film has received more than 10.8 million views on YouTube alone.
The academy receives a lot of (arguably, often deserved) flak for its many nomination snubs, but I'm glad it got this one right.
In the film, the little girl, whom we know as Zuri, has a palpable excitement for a marked day on her calendar. "Is it picture day?" I initially wondered, since a Thursday was the denoted day. Zuri slides on an outfit already laid out, then approaches her bathroom sink with a wide-tooth comb in hand, ready to tackle the full head of hair we soon see is hidden underneath her bonnet.
She pulls up her favorite hair influencer on a video streaming website and swipes through the looks until she finds one satisfying for the occasion. When she does, we're taken to a flashback of a woman, presumably Zuri's mother, doing the child's hair in the style she just eyed.
"It just took a little bit of work, and a whole lot of love," the mother, voiced by actress Issa Rae, says.
Zuri attempts and fails miserably, shocking her father to the point of having him drop a basket full of laundry to the ground. After his own multiple attempts and failures, Zuri's dad tries to resolve the issue by shoving a red beanie on top of her untamed curls. She runs out of the room in tears after she sees how she looks.
Hair is sacred for little black girls: It's a bonding experience laced with rites of passages typically passed down through our mothers; the memories we create in those bonds make the perfect content to easily connect with other black women and to swap stories with our girlfriends.
Black men - our fathers, brothers, uncles - don't usually get to partake in this experience by default, for they, too, have equally special rituals among themselves within the walls of the black barbershop.
Naturally, the roles of black mothers and fathers have been siloed when it comes to caring for their sons' and daughters' hair. In nuclear black families - mom, dad, son, daughter - rarely do these roles cross. In part for gender roles, but also in part for the sacredness to which each pertains.
In a society where there are many stereotypes about black men as fathers, Zuri's dad offers a refreshing take.
"Hair Love" is not a story about a little black girl falling in love with her natural hair - her mother has already fostered that - but of a black father displaying his love for his daughter through doing her hair in the midst of his own intimidation and ignorance.
Zuri's hair is special to her not for vanity's sake, but for the memories she and her mother created together while doing it. Her hair is not just hair then, but a tender extension of her heart.
By her father acknowledging this through taking the time to learn how to do her hair, it allowed him to enter a new chamber of Zuri's heart once solely occupied by her mother. The father has now earned a new level of trust that goes beyond the security of Zuri knowing her dad will make her look pretty; she knows her dad will take the time and make the effort to invest in her, even when he's out of his comfort zone.
The father conquers his own fear, but also the outdated gender roles that create a narrative of hair being solely the mother's responsibility.
Hair, in this instance, serves as a way to make the child feel loved, proud and confident. That will always be in the job description of both parents.

Texto completo: Mike Elias isn't saying much about the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal that rocked Major League Baseball, despite being a part of the organization when the incident occurred.
"I'm not going to give an in-depth comment on the topic, but we're going to do things the right way with the Orioles," he said.
Instead, Elias is focused on his second season as general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, acting as a guest speaker at the Delmarva Shorebirds' annual hot stove banquet on Thursday night.
The event serves as an opportunity for fans and officials to come together to talk baseball.
The Shorebirds are just four months removed from their historic 2019 season that saw the club win 90 games and advance to the postseason for the first time since 2005. The squad was led by a strong group of pitchers, highlighted by Grayson Rodriguez and Drew Rom, and solid position players, such as infielder Adam Hall and outfielder Robert Neustrom.
Delmarva also hosted 2019 No. 1 overall selection Adley Rutschman toward the end of the season. Elias said he would like to see the catcher start the upcoming season with the Frederick Keys, however it will depend on his performance in spring training.
But Thursday night was about 2020 and how the Shorebirds, and Orioles, would find ways to succeed.
Baltimore was the second worst team in the MLB last season, finishing the year with a 54-108 overall record. However, with a young core expected to make the big-league club, the Orioles' general manger is confident the organization's rebuild is going as planned.
"Some of the names we've been reading about are going to start to arrive in Camden Yards," Elias said. "It's still about player development and those individual performances and not necessarily the team's win and loss record. Those guys are taking steps forward, graduating to the big leagues and adjusting to big-league life."
Elias also expressed his satisfaction with Baltimore's minor-league system.
The Bowie Baysox — the Orioles' Double-A affiliate — also advanced to the postseason, while the Aberdeen Ironbirds — the short-season club — finished with some of their best numbers in history.
After leading the club in 2019, Shorebirds' manager Kyle Moore was promoted to Frederick, replacing longtime skipper Ryan Minor who was let go from the organization. Dave Anderson, who has been with the Orioles the last six years, most recently as a minor-league infield coordinator, will take over on Delmarva.
"It's exactly what you want to see, especially when you're in a rebuild," he said. "We're focused on that type of success. The success of teams like the Shorebirds is really going to dictate what we do the next couple of years in Baltimore."
In November, news broke that several minor-league teams throughout the country were on the chopping block as part of a new MLB plan to streamline its minor league system for efficiency and to improve conditions for players, according to a New York Times report. The Frederick Keys was one of 42 clubs on the list.
While nothing is official, minor-league officials have said they'll do everything in their power to prevent the loss of any team. Elias provided little information on the status of Frederick or how the Orioles will respond should they lose any club.
"All I know is that this is being handled at the league level," he said. "I think Major League Baseball wants to see a healthier player development environment, and minor-league baseball has a lot of interest as well, and I'm sure both sides will come up with a solution."
Though he couldn't say much, Elias did respond to questions about the recent situation regarding the Astros.
Recently, The Athletic reported the Astros had used technology to steal opposing teams' signs that allowed Houston batters to know what type of pitch was coming. The Astros would go on to win the 2017 World Series.
Once news of the scandal broke, Houston was fined $5 million by the MLB and forced to forfeit draft picks in the 2020 and 2021 MLB Draft. General manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A.J. Hinch were fired following a suspension sent down by the league.
Elias served as Houston's assistant general manager and oversaw player development and minor-league operations before coming to Baltimore in 2018.
Elias said his primary duties in Houston were dealing with the minor leagues and scouting, noting the scandal doesn't detract from the work he and his staff did in those areas.
"I think there's a history of things happening in our sport and other sports, and that's why we have good people in the sport to get it fixed and be better," Elias said.
While one general manager spoke of the future, the other highlighted the success of 2019 and discussed some notable events taking place at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium next season.
Coming off a 90-win season, Shorebirds' general manager Chris Bitters is excited to have fans back at the ballfield watching some of the Orioles' top prospects.
"We're kicking off baseball for bird land right here in Salisbury," he said. "Last year was the cherry on top. We had all these great things going on and then boom, we catapult to best team record in team history.
"We had exciting baseball every night."
The Shorebirds also unveiled their promotional schedule for 2020, which includes several giveaways and theme nights.
A Trey Mancini Jedi bobblehead will be given away on May 8, while a Hawaiian shirt giveaway will take place on June 26. Theme nights include Harry Potter (May 22) and Nickelodeon Night (July 17).
"There's going to be great opportunities throughout the year for the fans to come out and enjoy a giveaway, fireworks night or a value night," Bitters said.
Delmarva kicks off its season April 8 at home against the Asheville Tourists. Team rosters will be announced following spring training.

Texto completo: Lisa Pattman, who owns and operates the Midland Park-based Tablespoon Catering & Cooking Classes, became interested in cuisine when she was a flight attendant for Northwest Airlines and traveled frequently to Asia. After graduating from the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, she worked at the Food Network with Emeril Lagasse, Sara Moulton and Mario Batali and launched a children's cooking program that included adult demonstrations at Chef Central in Paramus. She opened her own catering and cooking company in 2002, when her daughter was a toddler.
"First, I was just catering and doing corporate events, and then it evolved into cooking classes," she says. The New York Times included her in a roundup of in-home chef instructors, which drove more clients her way, and the instructional aspect of her business took off.
"People call me for bachelorette parties, corporate team-building exercises and dinner parties," she says. "I'm hands on, and I'll give as much or as little instruction as they want from me." She offers a three-course cooking class and dinner service in a variety of themes, including Indian and Thai. The dining experience includes full recipe packets and Pattman's email address for culinary questions.
The home advantage: From a drinking point of view, you don't have to Uber in and out. And because we offer a full cleanup package, you don't have to worry about that afterwards. It's like a restaurant experience in your own home.
The clientele: For the most part, they're 35 to 55 years old and tend to live in more affluent towns.
What to know before coming to a client's home: Number one: Do you have a food allergy? Is there any kind of food I need to stay away from before I do a menu? How many people are coming, what time will it be and what kind of stove is there in the house?
Prep work: I bring my own knives everywhere I go. Most of these homes have large center islands that we gather around. If I want to do something like a long, slow short rib, I have to do the prep work at home, because it's a three to four hour process.
A typical session: I introduce myself, hand out recipe cards, give guests menus and say "This is what we're going to be doing." I take them through the techniques such as how to season food, tell them about a dish we're going to make — for example, "We're putting together a bruschetta" — and we'll do it then and there. Depending on how many things they want on the menu, we'll take breaks before the full meal to eat what we've cooked. A sous chef stays to plate the dessert and clean up, and I leave when everyone sits down for dinner. Since a majority of the desserts have to be done ahead of time, clients often add finishing flourishes like torching the tops of crème brûlées.
Memorable experience: I prepared a meal with an extended family who'd hired me several times before, and it was just one of those nights where I had a connection with them. They had the most amazing wines, and made us feel that we were part of the family in a way.
Biggest challenge: I had a catering job at a birthday party where there couldn't be open flames inside, so I had to cook 200 lobsters on propane tanks outside in the rain.
Bottom line: If clients love what they're eating, then I've done my job.

Expectations for GOP senators are so low it's astonishing Op-ED

Texto completo: For President Trump's impeachment hearings to be anything other than a show trial at this point, four brave Republican senators need to break ranks and vote to hear new evidence and witnesses.
After former national security adviser John Bolton's manuscript leaked, three GOP lawmakers now appear willing to do so: On Monday, Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) suggested their votes were in play. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said more definitively that he wants to hear from Bolton and that it's "increasingly likely" other colleagues will support calling witnesses as well.
That juicy prediction has every pundit asking who else might join these three martyrs. Maybe Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.), Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) or some other dark horse? Who could that elusive fourth Republican senator possibly be?
To be honest, I don't know the answer to that question. But I know what the answer should be: All of them.
Every. Single. One.
Every single one of the 53 GOP senators swore an oath to the Constitution. Every single one of them is supposed to be exercising oversight of the executive branch. Every single senator is receiving a taxpayer-funded salary to serve the public and ensure that the president, whatever his party, does the same.
The default assumption should therefore be that they all perform the jobs they were sent to Washington to do. The idea that we expect (or hope) just four Republicans to rise to the occasion - and that the burden is on Democrats to coax these four into doing so - is astonishing.
Truly, it's the soft bigotry of low expectations.
Perhaps it's understandable, though. Lately Congress has been shirking many of its most critical, constitutionally enshrined duties.
Legislators have surrendered their power of the purse. They allow Trump to spend tax dollars as he pleases, regardless of congressional appropriations for, say, aid to Ukraine or a border wall.
They have also ceded their obligation to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations," allowing Trump to slap tariffs on steel, aluminum and (possibly soon) cars, under the guise of "national security."
They've given up on providing "Advice and Consent" on key administration appointments, tolerating an executive branch riddled with "acting" officials in what should be Senate-confirmed posts. They've stood idly by as the White House has rewritten large sections of various laws wholesale, frequently contradicting legislative provisions or intent.
And of course long before this president took office, lawmakers of both parties abdicated their responsibility to declare war.
So why has Congress capitulated so readily? Maybe lawmakers are cowards. Or maybe they're simply too lazy to do the jobs Americans elected them to do.
After all, GOP legislators have declared strangely permissive work rules for themselves, inventing the equivalent of years-long smoke breaks. Apparently every fourth year, for instance, they excuse themselves from holding hearings for Supreme Court nominees, Constitution be damned. (Note: Excuse only applies when a Democrat is president.)
Executive branch oversight is more or less always optional with Republicans in unified control of government. But it, too, is now also explicitly forbidden in the second half of the first term of a presidency.
That sounds awfully specific, I know. But according to Republican lawmakers, this window is much too close to an election; they would much rather punt to voters on any tough decisions about presidential overreach or abuse of power.
Having dumped this responsibility upon their constituents, lawmakers should at least be willing to procure the information voters need to make informed decisions come Election Day. They could, for instance, demand that the Trump administration furnish subpoenaed documents related to the Ukraine aid holdup. Or ask witnesses in "The Room Where It Happened" to testify under oath about what Trump directed them to do.
Alas, for most GOP lawmakers, that also appears to be too much of a hassle. So they again have written themselves a sick note. This one cites the deep psychic injuries they supposedly sustained when a Democratic congressman quoted a news story saying Trump is trying to bully them into submission. A story they tried to disprove by immediately submitting to their bully.
Perhaps GOP lawmakers need a pep talk. They need to be told to get off their butts and to man (or woman) up. Act like the equal branch of government they are. At the very least someone should remind them - all of them, and not just some pitiful, begrudging foursome - to stop shirking.
Republican lawmakers should heed their own advice and remember the dignity of work.

Ross to give up No. 8 in Kobe's honor

Texto completo: Orlando Magic shooting guard Terrence Ross is among the NBA players who want to retire their numbers informally as a way to honor the late Kobe Bryant.
Reports began to emerge Tuesday afternoon that players were considering changing their numbers as a way to pay their respects to the former Lakers superstar, who died Sunday in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles.
The league is considering each request on a case-by-case basis, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times.
Ross will change his jersey number from No. 8 back to No. 31, beginning with Orlando's game Saturday night against Miami at Amway Center, according to the team. Ross had worn 31 throughout his career before switching to 8 prior to this season, in part because it's the number his son, Tristan, wore for his youth basketball team.
Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie also is among those who will change their number, according to multiple reports. He'll go from No. 8 to No. 26.
Ross and Dinwiddie are among the 22 NBA players who currently wear No. 8, according to basketballreference.com. Twelve players wear No. 24, according to the site.
Bryant wore No. 8 and No. 24 during his 20-year career with the Lakers.
Magic center Khem Birch wears No. 24 as a tribute to his late friend, Christian Williams. Bryant was the favorite player of Williams, who was killed in an automobile crash in 2010.

Texto completo: In 2018, a top adviser on the Bernie Sanders campaign published a book called "How Bernie Won." Its audacious title drove a story line about the 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton: Sanders hadn't lost, not really. Rather, he had won in the states that mattered most, and his ideas were proven to be winners.
This is a fairy tale -- and a dangerous one. If Democratic voters, hungry for a winner, buy into that myth and believe that Sanders is the most "electable" candidate, they will be making a grave mistake that could hand the presidency back to Donald Trump.
Let's start with the actual results in the 2016 primary. It was not remotely close. Sanders lost by 3.8 million votes, 57-43%. Clinton won 34 states and territories to his 23. Still, Sanders' team contends that the 2016 results augur well for him, because he dominated in the Midwest, where the presidency is often decided. In particular, they claim that he is popular in the former "Blue Wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which turned red in 2016 and delivered Trump his victory.
In fact, Sanders lost to Clinton by over 200,000 votes in the nine states of the Midwest. In the three onetime Blue Wall battleground states, she topped him by more than 45,000 votes, though he beat her in Wisconsin and edged her by a point in Michigan. In Ohio, Clinton won by 14 points and nearly 166,000 votes. The best you can say for Sanders is that he didn't lose as badly in the Midwest as he did elsewhere.
Indeed, in the Sunbelt, the other area that Democrats hope to make a battleground in 2020, Sanders got crushed. He lost Florida 64-33%, Arizona 58-40%, North Carolina 55-41% and Texas 65-33%. Taken together, Clinton trounced Sanders in those four states by more than 1.2 million votes.
Socialist charge would stick
And, of course, those were only primary voters. What would the general electorate make of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.? We know that the Trump campaign will seek to label any Democratic nominee a "socialist" -- a regular Republican tactic that usually goes nowhere because Democratic nominees have never really been socialists.
Sanders is different, though. As he said in a 1983 political debate: "I am a socialist; of course I'm a socialist."
The charge would stick, because this is an identity that he himself has proudly trumpeted. And 55% of Americans view socialism negatively. That would be quite a weight around a nominee's neck in a general election.
The potency of this pending attack is also underscored by Sanders' central policy proposal: "Medicare for All." His plan would hand the government control over nearly a fifth of the American economy. It doesn't take much Trumpian demagoguery to label that "socialized medicine."
When voters outside the liberal base learned more about this plan over the course of last year, initial curiosity, driven by its bumper-sticker name, collapsed. November polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report found that "large shares of swing voters in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin" say a national Medicare for All plan is a bad idea.
And we don't have to speculate about the political impact of Medicare for All. It was tested in the 2018 midterms when, as a University of Virginia study recently found, it cost Democrats in swing districts who embraced it nearly 5 points.
Worse, Sanders' overall record since 2016 guts his case. On the very day in 2017 that The New York Times published an op-ed he wrote entitled, "How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections," his favored candidate in the Virginia gubernatorial primary got blown out by moderate Ralph Northam, who went on to trounce the Republican in the general election.
A monumental choice
In 2018, Sanders waded into the Michigan governor's race and backed Abdul El-Sayed, a young, far-left candidate. He lost every county in the state to the more mainstream Gretchen Whitmer. She went on to soundly beat the Republican by promising not a "revolution" but rather to "fix the damn roads."
This pattern repeated itself across the country. Sanders and his political organization backed candidates at every level, to little or no avail. Their endorsees did not flip House seats from red to blue in 2018, proving his ideas work only in safely Democratic places.
All of this means that "How Bernie Won" is basically a book of fiction. Sanders has never won anything that really matters outside of Vermont, and all the available data shows that his ideas are politically toxic. Yet a week before primary voting begins, he is surging in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
Democrats now face a monumental choice. Deciding which presidential candidate should go head to head with Trump is the paramount political calculation of our lifetimes. In the past, when Bernie Sanders has declared himself and his ideas to be "winners" in red and purple areas, it has turned out to be demonstrably false. Democrats must not be fooled by him now.
Matt Bennett is executive vice president and Lanae Erickson is senior vice president of Third Way.

Texto completo: Our series "How I became a …" digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
Quick hits
What's your coffee order? Oat milk cortado, iced black, or a regular black.
What's your favorite book? I'm really bad at favorites, but I'm rereading "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" right now, which is so good.
What's your favorite song at the moment? I've been listening to a lot of King Princess.
Who have been your biggest mentors? I've been really lucky to have many mentors in the various stages of my career, but I have two chefs I worked for – Ron Mendoza and William Werner – who really helped shape a lot of my work ethic and basic understanding of pastry, cooking, and baking. As I moved more into editorial, I had a lot of really great champions. Christine Muhlke and Adam Rapoport were both so wonderful at championing me and pursuing my own thing.
What's the coolest thing you've ever done? My whole life is really cool. I feel very fortunate and happy to have done several cool things. I was actually just thinking that today while we were shooting videos for The New York Times. I find as much joy in that as if I'm recording [a podcast] with NPR or going on a vacation to Mexico. The coolest thing I've done is shape my life to be able to do a bunch of cool things.

From her beginnings working in the restaurant scene to becoming a cook with viral recipes such as #TheCookies and #TheStew, Alison Roman is quite the culinary jill-of-all-trades. As the bestselling author of cookbooks "Dining In" and "Nothing Fancy" as well as a columnist for New York Times Cooking and Bon App tit, Roman always has her hands on a keyboard or working on a stovetop.
USA TODAY caught up with the food writer and chef extraordinaire to talk about everything from Joan Didion and oat milk to learning to say no and consistently cultivating staying power in everything she does.
Question: How did you get your start?
Alison Roman: I started by working in kitchens, working in restaurants as a pastry cook. That looks very different than my life does now, but I was working in restaurants and doing service and coming up with dishes that went on menus, things like that.
It basically all relates to each other. I don't think that I would have been as strong of a writer about food had I not cooked professionally and had that background experience. It also teaches you a ridiculous work ethic that is challenging to find elsewhere.
Q: What does a typical day look like for you?
Roman: A typical day is super atypical. It really depends – if I'm shooting photos or videos or shopping for those things, or I'm doing neither and I'm writing or traveling or running errands and trying to stay on top of my general life administration. I feel like I do so many different things all the time that there truly is no typical day, which makes things very challenging.
Q: What's your favorite part about your job?
Roman: It's different all the time; it pushes me creatively and intellectually, and I get to have contact with people and teach them things and have an impact on their lives. It's a completely unique experience to be in people's homes and be a part of their lives, even if it feels one-sided because I don't actually know them. But, just to have a lasting impact that feels a bit different than, say, cooking for them in a restaurant (which can obviously have a really deep impact, but it's just a different style).
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Roman: Really hard work, and not letting things that I find challenging deter me. I think that I have come up against a lot of things that I struggled with, but I've never thought that meant I shouldn't be doing what I wanted to be doing.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule?
Roman: That's something I'm working on. I think that as I get more secure in my career and more successful, it's much easier for me to kind of say no to things and to make time for myself, my friends, and protect my space and personal life. I find that to be easier and easier, and I think I'm getting there. But, just understanding that I'm not going to be very good at my job or to anyone else if I am feeling run ragged because I haven't set aside any time for myself.
Q: What have been some career highlights?
Roman: I'll never forget the first time I was published in Bon Appetit, I'll never forget the first time I got a job as a pastry chef, I'll never forget being recognized for the things that I was putting on menus in restaurants, I'll never forget my first column in The New York Times or making The New York Times bestseller's list, or these milestones that I feel like only happen once that truly do feel so, so special.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Roman: Try different things. Always say yes. Push yourself. Just know that it's not going to be easy. Nothing just falls into your lap, and if it does it's not going to last for very long. You have to constantly be thinking about how to make something secure and stable. Things will come your way, and you may achieve a small amount of success by accident, but in order to really keep it and have staying power, you have to actually work at it, and work really hard. It's like a plant that you have to water and feed and take care of.

Have search warrant for data? Google wants agencies to pay

Texto completo: Facing an increasing number of requests for its users' information, Google began charging law enforcement and other government agencies this month for legal demands seeking data such as emails, location-tracking information and search queries.
Google's fees range from $45 for a subpoena and $60 for a wiretap to $245 for a search warrant, according to a notice sent to law enforcement officials and reviewed by The New York Times. The notice also included fees for other legal requests.
A spokesman for Google said the fees were intended in part to help offset the costs of complying with warrants and subpoenas.
Federal law allows companies to charge the government reimbursement fees of this type, but Google's decision is a major change in how it deals with legal requests.
Some Silicon Valley companies have forgone such charges, which can be difficult to enforce at a large scale and could give the impression that a company aims to profit from legal searches. But privacy experts support such fees as a deterrent to overbroad surveillance.
Google has tremendous amounts of information on billions of users, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world routinely submit legal requests seeking that data. In the first half of 2019, the company received more than 75,000 requests for data on nearly 165,000 accounts worldwide; 1 in 3 of those requests came from the United States.
Google has previously charged for legal requests. A record from 2008 showed that the company sought reimbursement for a legal request for user data. But a spokesman said that for many years now, the tech firm had not systematically charged for standard legal processes.
The money brought in from the new fees would be inconsequential for Google. Just last week, the valuation of its parent company, Alphabet, topped $1 trillion for the first time. Alphabet is scheduled to report its latest financial results Monday.
The new fees could help recover some of the costs required to fill such a large volume of legal requests, said Al Gidari, a lawyer who for years represented Google and other technology and telecommunications companies. The requests have also grown more complicated as tech companies have acquired more data and law enforcement has become more technologically sophisticated.
"None of the services were designed with exfiltrating data for law enforcement in mind," said Gidari, who is the consulting privacy director at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.
Gidari said it was good that the fees might result in fewer legal requests.
"The actual costs of doing wiretaps and responding to search warrants is high, and when you pass those costs on to the government, it deters from excessive surveillance," he said.
In April, the Times reported that Google had been inundated with a new type of search warrant request, geofence searches.
Drawing on an enormous Google database called Sensorvault, they provide law enforcement with the opportunity to find suspects and witnesses using location data gleaned from user devices.
A Google spokesman said that there was no specific reason the fees were announced this month and that they had been under consideration for some time.
Reports put out by the company show a rise of more than 50% in the number of search warrants received in the first half of 2019 compared with a year earlier. The volume of subpoenas increased 15%. From last January through June, the company received nearly 13,000 subpoenas and more than 10,000 search warrants from U.S. law enforcement.
Google will not ask for reimbursement in some cases, including child safety investigations and life-threatening emergencies, the spokesman said.

Federal law allows companies to charge the government reimbursement fees of this type, but Google's decision is a major change in how it deals with legal requests.
Some Silicon Valley companies have forgone such charges, which can be difficult to enforce at a large scale and could give the impression that a company aims to profit from legal searches. But privacy experts support such fees as a deterrent to overbroad surveillance.
Google has tremendous amounts of information on billions of users, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world routinely submit legal requests seeking that data. In the first half of 2019, the company received more than 75,000 requests for data on nearly 165,000 accounts worldwide; 1 in 3 of those requests came from the United States.
Google has previously charged for legal requests. A record from 2008 showed that the company sought reimbursement for a legal request for user data. But a spokesman said that for many years now, the tech firm had not systematically charged for standard legal processes.
The money brought in from the new fees would be inconsequential for Google. Just last week, the valuation of its parent company, Alphabet, topped $1 trillion for the first time. Alphabet is scheduled to report its latest financial results Monday.
The new fees could help recover some of the costs required to fill such a large volume of legal requests, said Al Gidari, a lawyer who for years represented Google and other technology and telecommunications companies. The requests have also grown more complicated as tech companies have acquired more data and law enforcement has become more technologically sophisticated.
"None of the services were designed with exfiltrating data for law enforcement in mind," said Gidari, who is the consulting privacy director at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.
Gidari said it was good that the fees might result in fewer legal requests.
"The actual costs of doing wiretaps and responding to search warrants is high, and when you pass those costs on to the government, it deters from excessive surveillance," he said.
In April, the Times reported that Google had been inundated with a new type of search warrant request, geofence searches.
Drawing on an enormous Google database called Sensorvault, they provide law enforcement with the opportunity to find suspects and witnesses using location data gleaned from user devices.
A Google spokesman said that there was no specific reason the fees were announced this month and that they had been under consideration for some time.
Reports put out by the company show a rise of more than 50% in the number of search warrants received in the first half of 2019 compared with a year earlier. The volume of subpoenas increased 15%. From last January through June, the company received nearly 13,000 subpoenas and more than 10,000 search warrants from U.S. law enforcement.
Google will not ask for reimbursement in some cases, including child safety investigations and life-threatening emergencies, the spokesman said.

Texto completo: RIB MOUNTAIN - The Wausau area is the latest region to join the igloo dining trend as it grows across the Midwest and nationally.
Two lighted igloo domes now sit on the patio of the Hilton Garden Inn, 2101 N. Mountain Road in Rib Mountain. They are filled with chairs and a small futon, decked out with soft coverings and pillows. There's a rug underfoot, tables and a space heater to keep everyone warm.
The igloo domes opened for the winter in late November, and will remain open until March. Within two days of opening, the hotel already had 80 reservations, said Sean Nugent, food and beverage manager at the hotel.
Reserving time in the igloos gets you access to the full food and drink menu from the restaurant and bar. That includes dishes like the pork chop with grilled cabbage and house-made pierogi on the side, Nugent said.
Part of what makes the igloo dining experience unique is the hotel's "from-scratch" restaurant, Nugent said. It sources produce and protein locally, working with farms even in the winter. The Friday fish fry is caught just days prior from Lake Superior, he said.
You don't have to be a guest at the hotel to enjoy an evening in the igloos, Nugent said. Just like the hotel's restaurant and bar, it's open to the public. Igloos comfortably seat six people, and there's a $100 minimum for food and drink.
Guests typically reserve the igloos for two-hour time slots, such as 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. or 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. The igloos are also open during Sunday brunch from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Times are generally flexible.
Food service is from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. The bar is open until 11 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends.
In Wisconsin, a hotel in Appleton also features the igloo domes. Milwaukee's Café Benelux has them on the rooftop.
They're surfacing in Michigan, too, including at a popular brewpub in the Upper Peninsula. Even the New York Times wrote that the igloos were "everywhere this winter" in the city.
What's different about the trend in the Wausau area, Nugent said, is that there's a dedicated server just for the patio.
The igloos are just one more way to appreciate the winter season and to have fun with what the cold brings, Nugent said.
"It's your own little pod of happiness," Nugent said.
For more information or to reserve time in an igloo, call the hotel's front desk at 715-298-5775.

You can now reserve a heated igloo dome on the patio of the Hilton Garden Inn in Rib Mountain. Around six people can order any food and beverage from the hotel's restaurant and bar. You don't have to be a hotel guest to book an igloo.

Votes not secured to block testimony

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not yet have the votes to block witnesses including former national security adviser John Bolton from being called to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial.
McConnell made the admission in a private Senate GOP meeting Tuesday after Trump's defense team wrapped up its arguments, according to The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources. A Republican familiar with the closed-door meeting who was granted anonymity to discuss it confirmed the matter to The Associated Press.
McConnell's spokespeople did not offer a comment when reached by The Courier Journal through email.
Sen. Rand Paul also told CNN on Tuesday evening there is an 80% chance that a majority of senators will vote to hear witnesses. When asked by Wolf Blitzer whether "there will be 51 votes for John Bolton to testify," Paul said there was "eight chances out of 10 that we have 51 votes. That's my estimate."
A spokeswoman for Paul did not reply to a phone call and an email Tuesday evening seeking elaboration on the senator's remarks.
The reports come two days after The New York Times published a story saying Bolton had penned a manuscript claiming Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine until its leaders publicly promised to investigate the son of political rival Joe Biden, the former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate. A copy of the manuscript was submitted to the White House on Dec. 30, according to The Times.
Paul, a Kentucky Republican like McConnell, has railed at the idea of Bolton testifying. He has suggested Bolton's manuscript was leaked to boost its sales.
To call witnesses, Democrats need at least four members of the 53-member Republican majority to vote with them.
One possible Republican defector, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, told reporters Monday that "it's important to be able to hear from John Bolton for us to be able to make an impartial judgment."
And another potential GOP swing vote, Susan Collins of Maine, said in a statement Monday that "the reports about John Bolton's book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues."
Two other Republican names who might vote with the Democrats are Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Sen. Lamar Alexander, of Alaska and Tennessee, respectively. Murkowski said Monday she is "curious" to hear what Bolton would have to say, and Alexander said he would decide on his vote after senators have asked their written questions.
Though McConnell told his fellow Republican colleagues to "take a deep breath" at a Monday luncheon, the Kentucky Republican was reportedly angry with the White House over the news of Bolton's manuscript.
A McConnell spokesman told The Courier Journal on Monday that the Senate majority leader "did not have any advance notice" that the National Security Council reportedly had a copy of Bolton's manuscript for weeks.
And just hours before the impeachment trial was set to resume Monday, McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., privately pressed the president's advisers to explain Bolton's account, according to The Times.
Before the trial began, McConnell successfully fought against Democratic colleagues to delay a vote on witnesses and additional evidence until after each side made its arguments and senators had the chance to ask questions.
With the White House counsel wrapping up its defense of Trump on Tuesday, each side will now answer written questions from senators for the next two days, with a vote on witnesses likely taking place Friday.

Quirk of British law pays for royals Source of funding for Harry, Meghan is private. Sort of.

Texto completo: LONDON - Every six months or so, Alan Davis sets out from his seaside bungalow on a far-flung island off the southwestern coast of England carrying a rent check of about $16 for his landlord.
But this is no ordinary landlord, and no ordinary rent check.
Davis lives on a tiny corner of the Duchy of Cornwall, the property empire controlled by Prince Charles, the heir to Britain's throne, who has quietly turned an inheritance of rundown farmland into a billion-pound real estate conglomerate.
By a quirk of British law, Davis has to pay the prince for the privilege of living on his land, piddling as the checks may be.
"It's a feudal way of carrying on," Davis said. "They put their finger in and demand money. They're a law unto themselves."
Prince Charles' fortune, long shielded from scrutiny by parliamentary indifference and obscure accounting, spilled into public view in January when his younger son, Prince Harry, announced that he and his wife, Meghan, were quitting their royal duties. In trying to prove that they would renounce taxpayer money, Harry and Meghan gave Britons a peek at the shadowy world of ostensibly private finance that bankrolls the family and its mansions, gardens and considerable staff.
But what the royals call private contains, by any other measure, a generous mix of public giveaways: medieval landholdings passed from one male heir to the next, sweeping tax relief, indemnity from some laws and exemptions from others, ownership of long stretches of coastline and all the treasure buried in Cornwall.
Those perks have delivered Prince Charles substantial wealth. Income from the duchy has nearly tripled in two decades, to about $28.3 million, last year. But the uproar over Harry and Meghan's funding has raised uncomfortable questions for the prince and the royals about whether any of their income can truly be considered private.
Coming on the heels of Prince Charles' brother Andrew being kicked off the royal front lines for socializing with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, such scrutiny is another dent to the royal mystique.
"Harry has chucked a grenade into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace," said David McClure, author of a book about the royal family's wealth. "It's weakened the foundations of the royal family and their money, and it's raised issues that don't just apply to Harry but have been bubbling under the surface for at least a decade."
Among the biggest of those is the special treatment afforded Prince Charles' property empire, an estate that, among other things, pays for the upkeep of his country mansion and furnished 5 million pounds last year for the families of Harry and his older brother, Prince William.
The duchy has a vast footprint, stretching from the rocky shores of Cornwall to south London, and from medieval castles to a granite-walled men's prison. It recently bought a 400,000-square-foot supermarket warehouse north of London.
A spokeswoman for the duchy said in a statement that Parliament had "confirmed its status as a private estate" and that the Treasury had agreed that its tax status did not confer an unfair advantage.
"The prince has always ensured it is run with the interests of its communities as an equal priority," the statement said.
The duchy's holdings reflect how the royal family's wealth has become concentrated in the hands of Prince Charles and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, whose own estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, paid her 21.7 million pounds last year.
Together, the two duchies bankroll more than a dozen members of the family, supplementing a taxpayer grant of 82 million pounds last year reserved for official duties and the upkeep of several palaces.
Despite lawmakers once deeming its current income "an accident of history," the Duchy of Cornwall has mostly avoided harsh questions, in part by playing up its interest in traditional architecture and sustainable practices across its humbler holdings: scores of farms, much of Dartmoor National Park in Devon and rivers throughout Cornwall. But analysts say that obscures fierce commercial instincts.
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, you sort of assume it is a duck," a Labour lawmaker told duchy officials during a 2013 hearing. "The Duchy of Cornwall looks and behaves like a corporation."
But the duchy does not pay taxes like a corporation. Instead it sits in a legal limbo, using its royal status to skirt corporation and capital gains taxes even as it argues that, as a private estate, it has no obligation to open its books. The duchy said its capital gains were all reinvested in the business, obviating the need to tax them, and that only companies paid corporation tax.
Prince Charles pays tax on his duchy income only voluntarily and after deducting what analysts believe to be about 10 million pounds that he deems official and charitable spending. He has also written off tens of thousands of pounds that he pays for gardening at Highgrove, his country house, on the basis that members of the public were occasionally invited in.
The duchy's powers go even further.
Prince Charles inherits the possessions of anyone who dies in Cornwall without a will or next of kin, a power that in some years has yielded hundreds of thousands of pounds. He funnels the money into charities after deducting his costs.
A similar carve-out gives Prince Charles unusual power over some homeowners on the Isles of Scilly, a picturesque archipelago off the southwestern coast of England, and in Newton St. Loe, a village near Bath.
People like Davis own their homes, but the duchy owns the ground on which they are built. Such an arrangement is not uncommon in England, but homeowners would usually have the option to buy the land. Not on some duchy land.
That enables the duchy to charge small ground rents to homeowners grandfathered into long leases, like Davis. Once those leases lapse, it can also raise rents to thousands of pounds per year, making it difficult for people to sell or mortgage their homes.
In one case, a couple built a house on the Isles of Scilly, only to have the duchy force them to sign a lease bequeathing the property to Prince Charles' estate upon their death, said Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer in the House of Lords, who tried unsuccessfully to push through a bill in 2017 ending the duchy's special landlord status and removing its tax exemptions.

Texto completo: A few years ago, I made the Russian baths a regular part of my New York life. The ritual of the shvitz - steaming, sweating and rinsing - is why I go (health!), but if I'm being honest, I also am very much there for the food (pleasure!).
I eat there not out of necessity, but because it's low-key and one of my favorite restaurants in town. My order changes every time - pickles, cabbage, soup, pickled cabbage soup - but I always get the pelmeni, tortellini-size dumplings filled with pork, served in a squat ramekin, coated in melted butter and a splash of the cooking liquid. Finished with caramelized onions, lots of dill and a generous portion of sour cream alongside, they are kind of the opposite of a healthy trip to the spa - unless you consider mental health a part of that journey. (I do.)
Every time I eat those little miracles, I can't stop thinking about how I could write a recipe that approximates them without asking someone to make dumplings. (I'd never do that to you.)
I thought about the chewiness of the dumpling wrapper, the delicately meaty taste of the filling and slight brothiness of the liquid they come in. I thought about how necessary the dill is, and about how I always wanted a squeeze of lemon but wouldn't dare ask.
And that's how I got here: creamy farro with crispy mushrooms, sour cream and lots of dill. Yes, there is also a side of lemon.
OK, so, no: A bowl of farro and mushrooms isn't exactly a plate of dumplings, but hear me out. The way the mushrooms are cooked and crisped alongside the thinly sliced, caramelizing leeks gives them such a delightfully meaty flavor that they're almost better than meat itself. The farro, toasted in the pot before it's cooked, reinforces that vague meatiness. (Chicken broth helps, but you can use vegetable broth or even water to keep it vegetarian.) In the end, the squeaky chew of each grain coupled with the porridge-y consistency reminds me of the dumplings swimming in that buttery broth.
Topped with sour cream and a sprinkle of a lemony dill mixture, made better with the addition of chives, it hits the spot, even without the shvitz.

Creamy farro with crispy mushrooms and sour cream
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 1 hour
1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle,
torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley
4 cups vegetable broth, chicken broth or water
1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing
Sour cream, for serving
1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the leeks and half the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and crisped, 12 to 15 minutes. (They will start giving off moisture and steaming a little before this happens, so be patient.)
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a medium bowl leaving any olive oil behind. (They will have absorbed the oil as they cook, and released it back as they crisp.) Add a bit more olive oil so there's another 1/4 cup or so in the pot. Cook the remaining leeks and mushrooms, adding them to the bowl with the other mushrooms.
3. Without wiping the pot, add farro and season with salt and pepper. Cook over that same medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until farro is toasted on the outside (it will go from pale golden brown to a toastier golden brown), about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and 2 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring to a strong simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until farro is fully cooked and most (but not all) of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. It should still look a bit loose, like risotto or a porridge. Remove from heat and add half the chives.
5. Toss dill, remaining chives and lemon zest together in a small bowl. To serve, season farro with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls. Top with sour cream, mushrooms and leeks, and dill mixture. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's legal team wrapped up its defense on Tuesday in a surprisingly short session after urging senators to reject the articles of impeachment and let the American people decide in the presidential election in November.
In a succinct closing, White House counsel Pat Cipollone rested his case.
"It is time for this to end, here and now," he said. "So we urge the Senate to reject these articles of impeachment for all of the reasons we have given you."
And now all eyes are on Friday, when the Senate debates and votes on whether to call witnesses.
That's a hot topic since the New York Times reported former national security adviser John Bolton's new book says Trump told him he wanted to withhold security aid until Ukraine announced investigations into his political rival Joe Biden and its role in the 2016 U.S. election.
But first, on Wednesday and Thursday, Republicans and Democrats will take turns asking questions through Chief Justice John G. Roberts to the Democratic House managers and the Trump legal defense team.
Here are highlights from Tuesday's Senate trial.
Bolton revelations "inadmissible"
Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow took aim repeatedly, in his summation of the defense team's argument, to diminish the importance and value to the impeachment trial of the reports about Bolton's book. "You cannot impeach a president on an unsourced allegation," he said. Sekulow read denials of Bolton's reported assertions, including Trump's: "I never told John that the aid to the Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens." Sekulow described the Times' report as being an "unpublished manuscript that maybe some reporters have an idea of what it says." And he added, "I don't know what you'd call that. I'd call it inadmissible."
Impeachment a policy disagreement
Sekulow also hammered away at what he called the source of the House Democrats' decision to impeach Trump - a policy disagreement. House managers said that the evidence they gathered showed that Trump withheld aid to benefit his personal political fortunes by coercing Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden. "They didn't like what they heard. They didn't like there was a pause on foreign aid," Sekulow said. "Those policy differences cannot be utilized to destroy the separation of powers" and to "remove a duly elected president" from office.
Witness wars heat up
Off the Senate floor, all the talk was about what to do about the Bolton unpublished manuscript. Republican senators met privately after the trial session ended, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he didn't have the votes to block witnesses. Democrats went to the microphones to turn up the heat. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded to Sekulow's arguments. "He said we don't have eyewitness accounts, that all we have is a newspaper article," Schumer said, then addressed Sekulow: "You can bring Bolton right into this chamber and he can be cross-examined by you." Republicans scrambled for a way out. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) floated the idea of putting the manuscript in a secure room and allowing senators to read it. Schumer laughed off that idea, saying that "it's going to be public - what are they hiding?" But Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), one of four Republicans who might vote to call witnesses, warmed to Lankford's idea. "I've said that I think that Mr. Bolton probably has some things that would be helpful for us," she said

Texto completo: A large, colorful quilt that illustrates the history of Spinney Hill will be revealed at the beginning of Black History Month in February at a Manhasset community center to celebrate African American heritage and pride.
The history of Spinney Hill, which was a tight-knit African American enclave with a large number of working families, is mostly forgotten, some residents say. 
Barbara Masry, a retired pre-K teacher and resident of Great Neck, wanted to change that.
"It's an underappreciated community," said Masry, who organized half a dozen women to create the quilt. "The goal was to create a quilt that would reflect the history of the area."
It took the group 18 months to research, design and sew 20 squares into a cotton quilt that is 65 inches wide and 85 inches long. Raisy Derzie, a Great Neck-based artist, painted the individual squares, and Karen Harry of Uniondale sewed them together into one piece.
The art on each square tells a part of the community's history, including the Matinecock Indians who lived on the land in the 1600s and the migration of freed slaves from the South who settled in the community in the 1900s.
Spinney Hill, nestled between Great Neck and Manhasset, is roughly bounded by Northern Boulevard, Community Drive and Pond Hill Road, according to Newsday articles and residents of the area.
Lloyd Means, who grew up on Pond Hill Road in the late 1970s and made a documentary about the area in 2012, recalled the closeness of the community.
Since 1939, Means said those who have lived in Spinney Hill have gathered at Manhasset Valley Park for an annual reunion the first Sunday after the Fourth of July.
"At this reunion, there were people who went to school together, whose parents dated each other and whose grandparents were best friends," said Means, who now lives in Baldwin. "That tells you how tight that community is."
The black population in Spinney Hill is now smaller in number, but the women who put the quilt together said they don't want the past to be forgotten.
"We want to acknowledge these people who came and lived a life for themselves," Derzie said. "We want to tell their history, how they lived and communicated with each other."
The Town of North Hempstead, which was awarded a $50,000 National Park Service grant in 2017 to document the civil rights movement in the town, gave the group $2,000 to make the quilt.
The unveiling is at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Manhasset Great Neck Equal Opportunity Center, 65 High St.
After the reception, the quilt will be displayed at the Great Neck Library and at Town Hall before going to its permanent home at the center, the former Manhasset Valley School that was built in 1929.
The building now hosts a Head Start program and after-school activities.
"As the children enter this building, they will be able look at this, see the history, learn it and feel proud," Masry said.
History of Spinney Hill In the 1830s, freed slaves were among the founders of the Lakeville AME Zion Church in Manhasset, bringing an influx of African Americans. Former North Hempstead Town historian Joan Kent told Newsday in 2009 that Spinney Hill was named after a farming family that lived there centuries ago, but an article published in The New York Times suggested the name came from Joseph Spinney, a "commission merchant" who bought land in 1872 that later became known as Spinney Hill. In the next century and beyond, more African Americans moved to the area, with many working for nearby estates. In the 1960s, the Manhasset school board resisted busing students to integrate schools. In 1971, Jim Brown, who grew up in Spinney Hill and went on to become a running back for the NFL's Cleveland Browns, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Source: Newsda

U.S. News: How Democrats, Trump Lawyers Made Case

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In six days of arguments on the Senate floor, Democrats and the White House defense team sparred over whether the president abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress -- and whether those actions would merit his removal from office.
In one major development after the Democrats finished their arguments, the New York Times revealed that former national security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book, wrote that President Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations.
Here is a breakdown of the arguments the House Democratic impeachment managers made on key points, and how the Trump team responded:
Ukraine Aid
Impeachment Managers: The Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released in September without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. President Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book.
July 25 Call
Impeachment Managers: Democrats said the White House sought to cover up a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president -- in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son and alleged election interference -- by moving the transcript to a classified server typically reserved for the nation's top secrets.
Trump Defense: Lawyers said the White House wasn't seeking to hide the transcript of the July 25 phone call because it was both preserved on a White House server and, in September, made public. The lawyers also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump didn't link aid to investigations on the call.
Articles of Impeachment
Impeachment Managers: Aside from blocking aid, Democrats said, the president obstructed the impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony sought by House investigators.
Trump's Defense: The president's team argued the articles of impeachment are constitutionally deficient and overly broad. The lawyers also argued that Democrats don't allege that the president committed a crime, which they said is necessary to warrant removal from office.
Removal From Office
Impeachment Managers: The president poses a national security threat to the country and, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), an "imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy" and therefore must be removed prior to the 2020 election.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election in less than 10 months and the choice should be left to the voters. The lawyers also countered Democrats' calls for urgency in removing the president from office by noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited a month to turn over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Senate Witnesses
Impeachment Managers: Democrats argued the Senate should call new witnesses who could offer first-hand accounts of the president's motivation for holding up aid to Ukraine.
Trump's Defense: The president's team said the House was responsible for collecting testimony and documents, and in voting for the articles of impeachment determined it had enough evidence to warrant the president's removal from office.

Texto completo: Ben Smith, the founding editor of BuzzFeed News, said on Tuesday he is leaving the company, where he helped turn a startup best known for whimsical online quizzes and listicles into a formidable news organization.
Mr. Smith, a veteran of Politico and the New York Daily News, was hired in 2012 to create a news division for BuzzFeed.
He said in a memo to staff that he would be joining the New York Times as a media columnist.
"The notion that BuzzFeed could play a major role in shaping global news, and the news business -- from tweets to streaming shows -- sounded crazy in 2012. Now it's just a fact, the product most of all of your hard work, creativity, aggressiveness, and judgement," he wrote.
Mr. Smith, 43 years old, built a newsroom of more than 200 journalists with bureaus across the world. In 2018, BuzzFeed News' staff was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for international reporting for stories on numerous assassinations of enemies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the U.K. and U.S.
BuzzFeed has sometimes found itself at the center of controversy, most notably for Mr. Smith's decision to publish an unsubstantiated dossier about President Trump in relation to his alleged activities in Russia.
Mr. Smith staunchly defended the decision, arguing that without the dossier, Americans would have found it difficult to understand the government probes that followed.
The BuzzFeed news division has faced the same pressures as all digital publishers in recent years, as making money via online advertising sales became more challenging.
The news unit is a financial drag on BuzzFeed, with growth primarily coming from areas such as e-commerce, entertainment and video programming.
In 2019, BuzzFeed ended the year slightly in the red, but news was the only unprofitable division.
BuzzFeed's news unit suffered deep staffing cuts in 2019 that also affected other parts of the company.
Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed's founder and chief executive, called Mr. Smith "a leader, a mentor, and an inspiration to countless journalists."
"BuzzFeed News has grown from a digital news startup to a world-class, global news organization in less than a decade" Mr. Peretti wrote in a note to staff.
The company said it would begin a search for a successor to Mr. Smith.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Republican leaders said on Tuesday they didn't yet have enough votes to block witnesses in President Trump's Senate impeachment trial, people familiar with the matter said, after his legal team concluded its efforts to counter Democrats' charges that the president abused power and obstructed Congress.
On the third and final day of presentations by the Trump legal team, lawyers tried to cast doubts on the importance and credibility of allegations by former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's motives for freezing aid to Ukraine. Republicans had hoped to wrap up the trial with an acquittal of the president by this week, but Democrats have said Mr. Bolton should appear under oath to offer a firsthand account of the president's motivations for freezing aid to Ukraine -- a matter at the heart of the impeachment case.
At a meeting of all Republican senators late Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the vote total wasn't where it needed to be on blocking witnesses or documents, the people familiar with the matter said. He had a card with "yes," "no," and "maybes" marked on it, apparently a whip count, but he didn't show it to senators.
Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who face competitive races in the fall, addressed their GOP colleagues in the meeting, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Gardner said a longer trial would lead to more Democratic attacks, according to a spokesman, and Mr. Tillis called impeachment a sham. Ms. McSally's office said she doesn't comment on what happens in private meetings.
An administration official said the White House was optimistic it would get the necessary votes by Friday. "We are still in the game," the official said.
During Tuesday's proceedings, the president's lawyers argued that House managers hadn't established their case that Mr. Trump abused power and obstructed Congress and said the accusations fell short of the threshold needed to remove a president from office, particularly in an election year.
"The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low," said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's personal attorneys, referring to the Democrats' impeachment case. Deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said the abuse-of-power article was "infinitely malleable" and allowed for too much subjectivity. "How are we supposed to get the proof of what's in the president's head?" he asked.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone, in closing, reminded senators that the presidential election was nine months away and said the choice should be left to voters. "Why tear up their ballots?" he asked.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, dismissed the Trump legal team's arguments following the conclusion of the session. "Their whole argument is diversion," he said.
"If you don't believe the newspaper report, call the witnesses," he said of the Bolton account, which was first reported Sunday in the New York Times. He reminded senators that the witnesses Democrats have wanted to call but that have been blocked by the White House -- who include Mr. Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney -- are Republicans appointed by the president.
Democrats, who control 47 seats, need four Republicans to join them to approve motions for new testimony or documents, which need a simple majority to pass. Starting Wednesday, the Senate will have two days to ask each side questions, followed by a vote later this week on new evidence.
In Tuesday's closing, the defense team was seeking to persuade senators not to support hearing testimony from further witnesses, among them Mr. Bolton. Mr. Bolton wrote in a draft of his forthcoming book that the president told him he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until Kyiv had aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Mr. Bolton's lawyer confirmed.
The president has denied Mr. Bolton's description of the conversation. He has repeatedly said there was no link between freezing the aid to Ukraine and his push for investigations.
The president's lawyers argued on Tuesday that too little is known about the Bolton claims for them to factor into the Senate trial.
Mr. Sekulow called the allegations "inadmissible" and pointed to the president's denials, while accusing the former adviser of seeking to boost his book sales. Impeachment, he said, "is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. That is politics, unfortunately."
As the president's allies attacked Mr. Bolton's credibility, former White House chief of staff John Kelly defended his former colleague. "If John Bolton says that in the book, I believe John Bolton," he told a crowd in Sarasota, Fla., according to local news reports.
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment when he declined to appear without a subpoena. The House declined to subpoena him in an effort to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.
But the reports of Mr. Bolton's account unsettled other Republican senators. Several who are on the fence about witnesses said Mr. Bolton's claims strengthened the case for further testimony, while the number of senators the White House believes may vote for more testimony ticked up.
One proposal by Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) to make the Bolton manuscript available to the Senate in a classified setting for review drew the support of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), an ally of the president.
Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of reading the manuscript behind closed doors. "What an absurd proposal," he said. "It is a book. There is no need for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something," referring to a secure facility. The book is to be published in March.
While no administration officials during the fall's House hearings testified that they were told directly by Mr. Trump that he was holding up the aid to pressure Kyiv, four current and former officials said they understood that to be the case.
Republicans have said this week that if the Senate votes for more testimony, they want to call witnesses including Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter.
Sens. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) and Susan Collins (R., Maine) indicated Monday that they were likely to favor witnesses. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) and Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) remained open to the idea. "I think that John Bolton probably has something to offer us," Ms. Murkowski said Tuesday.
Mr. Bolton has said he would testify during a Senate trial if subpoenaed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's defense team wrapped up arguments Tuesday by framing the Senate impeachment trial as a dangerously partisan exercise by House Democrats that failed to produce enough evidence to justify Mr. Trump's removal from office.
But requests to obtain that evidence, House Democrats shot back, have been blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate.
That opposition appeared to be weakening ahead of a critical vote on witnesses and documents scheduled later this week.
Multiple media outlets Tuesday evening reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated in a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans that he did not yet have enough votes to defeat the effort to call additional witnesses and evidence.
Support among Republicans for a deal to call a number of witnesses grew amid revelations this week that John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, detailed in his upcoming memoir the president's actions to pressure Ukraine.
Leaked details published by The New York Times revealed Mr. Bolton believed Mr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure the American ally to investigate a political rival. The motivations behind the freeze on aid, which the White House team has disputed, was at the core of the House Democrats' impeachment case.
Several moderate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, said Mr. Bolton's manuscript makes a stronger case for witnesses.
Some more conservative members have jumped on board. On Tuesday, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called on the White House to provide the Senate with a copy of Mr. Bolton's book draft.
"I am encouraging the White House, anybody that I can talk to, to say: That manuscript is pertinent, and we should get access to that manuscript to see what they're actually saying," Mr. Lankford said in a video posted to Facebook on Tuesday.
Even Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., floated a "one-for-one" deal in which the two parties would each call an equal number of witnesses, according to multiple sources. His office declined to comment.
At least four Senate Republicans would have to join all 45 Senate Democrats plus two Independent senators who vote with the Democrats, to approve a resolution to call witnesses. That decision is expected Friday.
The trial now turns to a two-day questioning period, in which senators will have up to eight hours each day to interrogate both sides, Mr. McConnell said.
Senators will submit their questions in writing to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial. Mr. McConnell told the senators their questions should be "thoughtful and brief."
Justice Roberts said he wants the answers from House Democrats and White House counsel to be no more than five minutes, adhering to the standard set in former President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used less than two hours Tuesday to drive home their final points. In total, the defense team used less than half of its allotted 24 hours, while House Democrats consumed nearly all of it.
House Democrats have asserted that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden is running in the Democratic primary for a chance to oppose Mr. Trump in this year's presidential election.
After a 12-week impeachment inquiry last fall, the House of Representatives voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The defense team has argued the president had legitimate concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the requests for a probe into Burisma and Hunter Biden were proper.
In their closing arguments, the lawyers warned of the dangerous precedent Mr. Trump's impeachment would set. White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone said the president's removal from office would inflict"serious and lasting damage" on the country.
"Why not trust the American people with this decision?" Mr. Cipollone said to all 100 senators before him. "Why tear up their ballots?"
In his final minutes, Mr. Cipollone rolled video of House Democrats condemning Mr. Clinton's impeachment using similar language Republicans are using today.
While Mr. Bolton's book consumed the hallway chatter off the Senate floor, the White House defense virtually ignored the revelations.
One mention came from famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who took the floor Monday to argue presidents cannot be impeached if they are not found to have committed a crime. That reasoning, questioned by impeachment scholars, has been adopted by some Republicans to shut down requests for witnesses.
"Nothing in the Bolton revelation, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power," Mr. Dershowitz said.
After the session ended Tuesday, House Democrats held a press conference to keep up the pressure.
"You simply can't have a fair trial without witnesses," said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has led the team of six House impeachment managers in the Senate trial.

Texto completo: NATIONAL BRIEFS
LOS ANGELES - The bodies of Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others who died in a helicopter crash have been recovered from a Calabasas hillside, coroner officials said Tuesday.
Authorities on Sunday removed the bodies of at least three victims from the wreckage. Remains of the six remaining victims were located Monday, and their bodies have been taken to the Los Angeles County coroner's forensic science center, where officials will work to identify them.
Authorities investigating Sunday's accident said the impact of the crash was intense, shattering the chopper and sending debris over a wide area.
"This was a pretty devastating accident," National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jennifer Homendy said.
The Calabasas hillside has become a pilgrimage point for thousands of tourists and fans of the NBA legend, prompting Los Angeles County sheriff's officials to urge the public to stay away. Sheriff Alex Villanueva warned onlookers that it is a misdemeanor to enter the crash site and that those found in the area would face arrest. Deputies are patrolling the site on horseback and ATVs, he said.
'PHARMA BRO' SUED
NEW YORK - State and federal authorities sued imprisoned entrepreneur Martin Shkreli over tactics that shielded a profitable drug from competition after a price hike made the so-called "Pharma Bro" infamous.
Shkreli was scorned as the bad-boy face of pharmaceuticals profiteering after he engineered a roughly 4,000% increase in the price of a decades-old medication for a sometimes life-threatening parasitic infection. The lawsuit, filed by the New York attorney general's office and the Federal Trade Commission, centers on subsequent actions by Shkreli and his former company.
They "held this critical drug hostage from patients and competitors as they illegally sought to maintain their monopoly," Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
At least four potential competitors have so far been kept from making cheaper generic versions of the medication, the suit says.
SUICIDE ATTEMPT PROBED
FARMINGTON, Conn. - A Connecticut man charged with murdering his estranged wife was hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday after being found unresponsive in a vehicle inside his garage, authorities said.
Fotis Dulos was found when officers went to his house in Farmington, a wealthy suburb of Hartford, because he was late for a bond hearing in the murder case. He is being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, according to Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie. The New York Times reported he apparently attempted suicide.
Mr. Dulos and his wife, Jennifer Dulos, were going through bitter divorce and child custody proceedings when she vanished months ago. He has denied any role in the disappearance of his wife, who hasn't been seen since she dropped their five children off at school in May. The children, who ranged in age from 8 to 13 when their mother vanished, have been staying with their maternal grandmother in New York City.

Kobe surely is among 10 greatest players ever

Texto completo: It's been more than 48 hours since we learned the tragic news about Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and the seven other souls on the doomed helicopter in Calabasas, Calif.
Hopefully it's not too early to take a stab at assessing Kobe's place in basketball history.
Kobe was not the greatest basketball player of all time. But he's in this observer's top 10, alongside Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Shaquille O'Neal, and Oscar Robertson.
Bryant was the best player of his generation, a perfectly sculpted bridge between Michael and LeBron. Today's young adults who grew up thinking Ken Griffey Jr. was better than Willie Mays — because they never saw Willie Mays — might tell you that Kobe was better than Michael or Magic. Maybe because they never saw Michael or Magic.
Here in Boston, we saw Kobe come through town once a year for 20 years. We also had two Kobe clashes in the Finals, with the Celtics beating LA in six games in 2008 (Paul Pierce was Finals MVP) and Kobe getting his revenge in LA in a seventh game in 2010.
So where does Kobe fit?
These discussions are perfectly arbitrary talk radio/barroom arguments. They are part of the fun of being a sports fan. You say Joe DiMaggio, I say Ted Williams. A kid in high school in 2020 says Mike Trout.
Some of it is quantifiable. Kobe is the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history. He is second in All-Star appearances (18), won five championships, was MVP once, and averaged 25 points per game. He also was named to the All-Defensive team 12 times, second-most in league history.
There is much about every player's game that cannot be measured. Kobe invented himself as the Black Mamba. We can't put a ranking on his sheer ruthlessness. He could put a dagger into your team like nobody else. He was the best NBA player when the sport truly became global, when professional basketball was uniquely popularized by social media.
In some circles, this made Kobe as big as Michael Jordan. And you can probably find folks who'd rank Kobe as the best basketball player of all time.
The magnitude of Kobe in star-driven Los Angeles is impossible for us to know, but his sudden death Sunday has shaken that community like nothing since the passing of Michael Jackson. Tuesday's New York Times correctly headlined Bryant “The Face of the NBA's Worldwide Popularity."
But what about Kobe's basketball skills? And his place in NBA lore?
I've been watching the NBA game since 1962 and am mindful that it's difficult to compare a point guard like Bob Cousy with a point guard like Kyrie Irving. The sport has dramatically changed.
Since the turn of the century, Jordan has been the closest thing to a consensus No. 1 in the “best ever" argument.
Not with me. I've always been a Chamberlain guy.
I had a conversation about this with Bird when Bird was at the height of his (three-time) MVP powers in the mid 1980s. I asked Bird about “best ever."
“I can answer that," said Larry. “That's easy. Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points. Bill Russell won 11 championships. It's right there in the record books."
Those records remain. Wilt still holds 72 NBA records. He forced rule changes. He never came out of a game. He was 7 feet 1 inch with the muscular build of LeBron. He was never surrounded by Hall of Famers the way Russell was. Wilt didn't have the rings of Russell or Michael, but on sheer size, strength, and skill, Chamberlain remains the greatest basketball player who ever lived.
Look it up. Do the math. When you average 50 points over a full season, it means you have to get 70 in the game after you are “held" to 30 in order to maintain your average.
Give Kobe this: Scoring 81 points, which Bryant did in a win over the Raptors in 2006, came with a far greater degree of difficulty than Wilt's low-post, free-throw-filled 100-point game in Hershey, Pa., during the Kennedy Administration. Different game, for sure.
In my book, LeBron is the second-best basketball player of all time, barely ahead of Jordan. LeBron is a 6-9 force who wins championships, MVPs, scoring titles, and this year will lead the league in assists. He is bigger and stronger than MJ. He's also a better rebounder and passer. He's already played 20 percent more games than Michael and he's still playing at an MVP level.
There is no “starting five" in my ranking, only a top five. This is positionless basketball. A disproportionate number of “best ever" players are centers. So after Wilt, LeBron, and Michael, I have to include Russell and Kareem in the pentagon of hoop prowess. Which gives us three centers in the top five.
Kobe makes it into my second five, alongside Magic, Bird, Shaq, and Robertson (who averaged a triple-double for a full season). Kobe makes this list at the difficult exclusion of Jerry West, Tim Duncan, Elgin Baylor, Hakeem Olajuwon, Bob Cousy, Julius Erving, Dirk Nowitzki, and several of the NBA greats currently playing.
Kobe scored 60 points in the last game of his career in 2016. That beats Williams hitting a home run in his final plate appearance in the big leagues.
While his sport grieves and his life is explored in a nonstop national narrative, Kobe Bryant's basketball skills need not be enlarged in death. He goes down in history as one of the 10 best players who ever lived.

Texto completo: A horror blockbuster is available to stream on HBO platforms. And a new Netflix nature series captures the outdoors at night.
What's Streaming
THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA (2019) Stream on HBO platforms. The threat is veiled (in the literal sense) in "The Curse of La Llorona," a horror movie about a killer spirit who takes the form of a weeping woman in a wedding dress. The movie casts Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow with two children, a job in social services and a problem audiences can probably extrapolate from the film's title: She's cursed. Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) "More efficient than ambitious, 'La Llorona' is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely." One of the movie's producers is James Wan, known for the "Saw" and "Conjuring" movies. Fans of either of those series should be well served here.
NIGHT ON EARTH Stream on Netflix. For a night with fewer terrors than "The Curse of La Llorona," consider this new Netflix nature documentary series, which uses high-tech cameras to capture the natural world after dark. Samira Wiley ("The Handmaid's Tale," "Orange Is the New Black") narrates.
VINCERE (2010) Stream on Hulu; rent on Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. The Italian director Marco Bellocchio is back in United States theaters this weekend with "The Traitor," a crime drama about the real-life Sicilian mob figure Tommaso Buscetta. Bellocchio also plumbed history in this biographical drama, which mixes fact and fiction to tell the story of the relationship between Benito Mussolini (played by Filippo Timi) and his reputed first wife, Ida Dalser (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), before and during Mussolini's rise to power. It's a movie that deals in matters of both personal (love and betrayal) and international (it's about Mussolini) scope; Manohla Dargis called it "a sustained, alternatingly exhausting and aesthetically exhilarating howl of a film" in her review for The Times.
What's on TV
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD (2017) 6 p.m. on FXX. It was an alley-oop heard around the film world: Weeks before this historical thriller was released, Ridley Scott enlisted Christopher Plummer to take over the role of J. Paul Getty, replacing Kevin Spacey after Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct. ("At my age, which is enormous, you get worried that your memory won't hold up," Plummer said in an interview with The Times in 2017, discussing how he felt when Scott approached him with the challenge. "But this was too damn good to pass up.") The movie offers plenty of drama in front of the camera, too: It focuses on the 1973 kidnapping of Getty's 16-year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III. The recovery involves the efforts of the younger Getty's mother (Michelle Williams) and a former C.I.A. operative (Mark Wahlberg).

Texto completo: Why did John Bolton, President Trump's former national security advisor, offer to become a witness against the president?
People who know the famously irascible war hawk say yes, he's selling his upcoming book. But there's a stronger impulse at work.
"He was publicly humiliated, and now he's settling scores," one former colleague said.

And, as an afterthought: "He's also telling the truth."
Senior Washington officials normally write memoirs to make sure their version of history gets a hearing. They usually wait until the president they served is out of office, especially if they plan to say anything critical.
Bolton has chosen the opposite strategy. His book is more like a hand grenade, ready to roll into the Senate's impeachment trial. It was scheduled for publication in March, but details leaked to the New York Times just as Trump's impeachment lawyers were arguing that no witnesses had firsthand knowledge of any alleged wrongdoing by Trump.
But Bolton does. In his manuscript, he reportedly writes that he asked Trump to release $391 million in military aid to Ukraine last August, but the president replied that he wanted Ukraine to start investigating Joe Biden and other Democrats first. In plain English, a quid pro quo.
So Bolton could become a key witness, if the Senate decides to call him. The debate will probably take place Friday, and Democrats need just four Republican votes. By all rights, they should get more.
Bolton's appearance would be a spectacle unseen since Watergate: a former senior White House official testifying under oath against the president for whom he worked.
And it would be an ordeal for Trump's defenders, even if it doesn't convince Republicans to vote to remove him from office. It won't. It would serve instead as the equivalent of a censure.
Bolton isn't a liberal Democrat or even a moderate "NeverTrump" Republican. His conservative credentials are impeccable.
He's been a Republican since he volunteered as a teenager for Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign -- which means he's been in the GOP far longer than the party-switching, ideologically mercurial president.
He's never been an "establishment Republican," either. Bolton has long been a right-wing outlier in his own party, a relentless hawk on foreign policy who criticized many of his colleagues as too soft.
"John sees everything in black and white," one former associate said. "That makes him hard for a lot of people to deal with."
Bolton wasn't an early Trump supporter in 2016. He wasn't sure Trump had enough foreign policy experience and publicly criticized his threats to weaken U.S. support for NATO.
But he endorsed the nominee, and later campaigned openly for top jobs, including secretary of State. He finally joined the White House as Trump's third national security advisor in April 2018, succeeding H.R. McMaster.
But Trump and Bolton didn't see eye to eye on major issues.
Trump views Russia's Vladimir Putin as a potential ally; Bolton sees Putin as an adversary. Trump believes he can make a nuclear disarmament deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un; Bolton thinks that's a fantasy. Trump wants to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria; Bolton thinks most of the troops need to stay.
Still, some of Bolton's associates thought he would adjust to the whims of his new boss.
"This is the job John has wanted his whole life," one said at the time. "He'll do anything to keep it."
That didn't happen.
Trump hailed his 2018 summit in Singapore with Kim as a diplomatic triumph; Bolton scarcely concealed his skepticism.
Trump wanted to negotiate with Iran; Bolton campaigned against the idea.
Trump wanted to sign a peace deal with Afghanistan's Taliban, and even invited the militants to Camp David for a ceremony; Bolton objected and helped spike the idea.
Trump's impatience grew. He left Bolton off the plane when he visited Kim in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea (he took Fox News host Tucker Carlson instead).
He publicly contradicted Bolton's promises that troops would stay in Syria and Iraq. He told visitors, in a comment that quickly leaked, that if Bolton had his way, "we'd be in four wars by now."
Finally, last September, Trump publicly fired Bolton in a tweet. Bolton, stung, fired back that he had offered to resign first.
With that humiliating exchange, Bolton was outside again, after only 17 months at the center of power. The title of his memoir, borrowed from a song in the musical "Hamilton," betrays his sense of loss: "The Room Where It Happened."
He promptly became a critic of the White House that had cast him out. He warned publicly against weakening the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He warned against negotiating with Iran. He said Trump's talks with North Korea had achieved "no visible progress."
Only this time he didn't get invited back onto Fox News, where he had made $569,423 before joining the White House.
That left one time-honored vehicle for seizing center stage: a score-settling book.
Ronald Reagan's former chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, did it in 1988 and revealed that Nancy Reagan ruled her husband's schedule with the advice of an astrologer. Barack Obama's former Defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, did it in 2014 and wrote that then-Vice President Joe Biden had been "wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."
But even they didn't get a chance in the middle of an impeachment trial and a reelection campaign.
Until now, Trump has escaped public criticism from most of the top officials he's fired, even those he treated with insults and contempt. McMaster, former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, and former Defense Secretary James N. Mattis have mostly observed a military code of silence, although Kelly said this week he believes Bolton's account.
In Bolton, Trump has tangled with a man who enjoys a public fight. This time, Trump may have chosen the wrong opponent. Humiliating Bolton wasn't a crime or an impeachable act. But it has definitely turned out to be a blunder.

Texto completo: Mr. Smith will leave the news organization where he has been editor in chief since 2012.
Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed, who built a hard-hitting news operation within a digital media organization better known for clickbait and listicles, will be The New York Times's next media columnist.
Mr. Smith will leave the digital news outlet to replace Jim Rutenberg, who recently became a writer at large at The Times, splitting duties between the politics desk and The Times Magazine. Before Mr. Rutenberg, the columnist position was held for years by David Carr, the prolific media columnist who died in 2015.
An announcement on Tuesday -- signed by Dean Baquet, the executive editor; Joe Kahn, the managing editor; and Ellen Pollock, the business editor -- called Mr. Smith "a relentless innovator who helped change the shape of modern journalism." He is expected to start on March 2.
"Ben not only understands the seismic changes remaking media, he has lived them -- and in some cases, led them," the editors said.
BuzzFeed hired Mr. Smith in 2012 as editor in chief to help start its news division, BuzzFeed News.
Some investors questioned the viability of a news operation, which might struggle to bring in enough revenue to outpace its costs. Last year, BuzzFeed laid off about 15 percent of its work force -- around 200 employees -- in several departments, including the news division.
It is not clear how Mr. Smith's imminent departure may affect the future of BuzzFeed News.
In a note sent to BuzzFeed's staff on Tuesday, Mr. Smith said, "this place is built to last."
"I fully expect you will keep on breaking news, telling the stories others won't in ways they haven't thought of, and doing the hard work that's made us who we are," he said.
He added, "I've been here for eight years and (as I'm sure many of you have picked up) am eager for a spell of writing and reporting and thinking."
Jonah Peretti, the chief executive of BuzzFeed who helped found it in 2006 and has championed the news operation, said in a note to its staff on Tuesday that Mr. Smith helped grow BuzzFeed from "a digital news start-up to a world-class, global news organization in less than a decade."
"With other news organizations existing for over a century, it is hard to express how incredible an accomplishment this is," Mr. Peretti said.
BuzzFeed News was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting in 2018 for its work investigating operatives with apparent ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia engaging in targeted killings in England and the United States. In 2017, Chris Hamby, a reporter at BuzzFeed News, was a finalist for the Pulitzer in international reporting for an article about how multinational corporations undermined environmental laws.
But in January 2017, Mr. Smith had to defend BuzzFeed News after he was the first editor to publish an unverified dossier containing salacious reports about President Trump compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mr. Smith argued that it was worthy of release in part because its contents had been shared with Mr. Trump and others "at the highest levels of the U.S. government." Providing that level of transparency, he argued, was "how we see the job of reporters in 2017."
Many of the dossier's more lurid claims proved false or unprovable.
Mr. Smith was hired by BuzzFeed from Politico, where he had been a senior political writer since 2007. He had previously been a reporter at The New York Sun and The New York Observer. He was also a political columnist at The New York Daily News.
Photograph Ben Smith joined BuzzFeed as editor in chief in 2012. The top editors at The Times called him "a relentless innovator."

CITY &amp; STATE; After war-crimes trial, ex-SEAL attacks critics

Texto completo: A retired Navy SEAL whose war-crimes trial made international news has launched a video attack on former SEAL teammates who accused him of murder and shooting civilians and who testified against him at his San Diego court-martial in June.
In a three-minute video posted to his Facebook page and Instagram account, retired Chief Special Operator Edward Gallagher, 40, referred to some members of his former platoon as "cowards" and highlighted names, photos and -- for those still on active duty -- their duty status and current units, something former SEALs say places those men -- and the Navy's mission -- in jeopardy.
Gallagher was accused of several war crimes by some of his platoon subordinates, including that he shot civilians and stabbed a wounded Islamic State fighter in the neck, killing him, while in Iraq in 2017. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted of most charges, but was convicted of posing for a photo with an Islamic State fighter's corpse, a crime for which the jury reduced his rank.

The case and its fallout received extensive media coverage, especially among conservative outlets such as Fox News, where network personalities lobbied President Trump for months to intervene on Gallagher's behalf.
Trump intervened in the case several times, including ordering Gallagher released from confinement before trial and restoring the SEAL's rank after his conviction.
Two former SEALs who served in Gallagher's platoon in Iraq during his 2017 deployment spoke to the San Diego Union-Tribune about the video. Neither testified at Gallagher's court-martial.
David Shaw, a former petty officer 1st class, said he questioned Gallagher's decision to publicize information that's normally kept quiet for operational security.
"Attempting to call attention to [those SEALs'] status in the way it's been done does not serve the mission or the interests of the Navy," Shaw said when reached by phone. "To attempt to out [their] status raises questions about the decision to do so."
Shaw also defended his former teammates and their decisions to testify against their chief.
"Each and every one of the guys who came forward were performers of the highest caliber and people of the highest reputations within the platoon," Shaw said. "[One] was selected to serve at the most premier institution at Naval Special Warfare, and that tells you everything you need to know about his performance and speaks volumes about his character."
Another former SEAL from the platoon said publicizing the faces of active-duty SEALs -- including one assigned to the elite Development Group, or SEAL Team 6 -- could put the lives of the men and their families in danger.
The former SEAL asked the Union-Tribune not to use his name. He said that because SEALs have been the targets of threats from terrorist organizations, exposing their names, faces and current units was an egregious breach of norms within the community.
The video appears to be a trailer for an unspecified future project. Tim Parlatore, one of Gallagher's attorneys, declined to say what that project is or when it will be published.
Navy Capt. Tamara Lawrence, a spokeswoman for Naval Special Warfare Command in San Diego, said in a statement that the Navy, as a practice, did not identify active-duty SEALs.
"As a matter of policy we do not identify our special operators," Lawrence said in an email. "We don't identify them by name, or by any other manner, due to the nature of their work, for the protection of their teammates and their families, and to protect ongoing and future missions."
The video includes clips from Naval Criminal Investigative Service interviews of Gallagher's SEAL teammates where the men tell investigators about the alleged actions of their chief. Portions of those interviews were published by the New York Times in December.

Texto completo: Readers react to Bret Stephens's argument that the Democrats' far-left candidates are as "reckless" as the president, leaving "none of the above" as a viable option.
To the Editor:
Re "Anyone but Trump? Not So Fast" (column, Jan. 25):
Bret Stephens argues that neither Bernie Sanders nor Elizabeth Warren would be sufficiently better than President Trump to deserve his vote. While acknowledging that President Trump is reckless and has repeatedly sought to do the wrong thing, he argues that Democrats must not nominate a reckless (i.e., too far left) candidate of their own, or "none of the above" will be a viable option.
But Mr. Stephens focuses on economic issues. Last week the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock to 100 seconds to midnight -- the closest it has ever been -- because of the twin existential threats of nuclear weapons and climate change.
When it comes to whose finger we want on the nuclear button, "Anyone but Trump" is a strategy much more likely to improve our chances of survival.
Thomas B. Newman
San Carlos, Calif.
To the Editor:
Bret Stephens's final two paragraphs should be required reading for Democrats. He advocates "attracting middle-of-the-road support," encouraging Democrats to "eschew polarization for persuasion and ideology for pragmatism."
As a Republican, I remember that my party faced exactly the same choice in 2016. But rather than nominating an experienced, pragmatic centrist such as John Kasich, the party went the route of the "reckless candidate," to use Mr. Stephens's term. I hope Democrats realize that a candidate like Senator Amy Klobuchar is very appealing to those of us stuck in the middle, between the red and blue extremes.
Jeff Kaylor
Mount Holly, N.C.
To the Editor:
What a stunningly tone-deaf line: "Yet for the overwhelming majority of Americans, life is pretty much the same under Trump as it was under Obama."
I am not a person of color, but I'm pretty sure life doesn't feel the same under a president who encourages white supremacists and speaks of people of color as criminals, gang members and invaders.
I no longer have to make reproductive choices, but I'm pretty sure women who do have to face these choices don't feel that life is the same under Donald Trump as under Barack Obama.
I'm not a Muslim, but I'm pretty sure life doesn't feel the same as it did before 2016 and the advent of travel bans and the demonization of that religion.
I am Jewish, so I know for sure that rising anti-Semitism does, in fact, feel like a change.
I can assure Bret Stephens that not losing a dollar from my 401(k) does not mean I have not lost something infinitely more valuable: my faith in my nation's moral compass. I find his statement a shameful shorthand for the absence of empathy.
Tama Zorn
Brookline, Mass.
To the Editor:
Bret Stephens makes an understandable plea for Democrats, if they really want to topple President Trump in the 2020 election, to choose a candidate who is center left, say Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar, rather than someone on the far left, like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.
What is not credible is Mr. Stephens's claim: "The truth of Trumpism is that it's a morally corrosive and corrupting force, not a politically or economically catastrophic one." This is a false and pernicious distinction. Corrosion and corruption of core values of a society inevitably lead toward catastrophe in social, political and economic spheres as well.
Adam Schiff is right: If truth no longer matters, we're lost.
Daniel L. Migliore
Princeton, N.J.
To the Editor:
Bret Stephens states that, as bad as President Trump is, he hasn't yet withdrawn from NATO, lifted sanctions on Russia or closed the border to all immigrants. Just the fact that Mr. Stephens mentions these ideas -- which would have been absurd under any other president -- indicates that these are real possibilities if Mr. Trump wins a second term.
In fact, these actions would only be the beginning of what he might do. No hypothetical economic dislocation under Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders could possibly be worse than that.

Texto completo: John Bolton's new memoir is titled "The Room Where It Happened," nearly the same as a song from Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway hit.
Wait a minute. A lyric from a Broadway show is part of the most heated political discourse of the moment? Something from a musical has actually been appended to a major national talking point?
It was revealed on Monday that the title of John Bolton's new memoir -- a book that could possibly change the direction of the Trump impeachment investigation -- is "The Room Where It Happened." On Sunday, in a television interview with ABC's "The Week," Senator Amy Klobuchar, discussing the need for calling witnesses in the Senate investigation, said the show should "talk about the people who were in the room where it happened."
The exact title of the song from "Hamilton," Lin-Manuel Miranda's blockbuster show, is "The Room Where It Happens." One of the many elements that make "Hamilton" so exciting is its urgency, a sense of past events occurring in the here and now. In any case, that number is sung with passion and fathomless envy by Aaron Burr, the archrival of the man for whom the musical is named, Alexander Hamilton.
And yes, that is also the man whom Burr subsequently killed in a duel, propelled by the same combustible competitiveness that informs this song. Burr (Leslie Odom Jr. won a Tony in the original Broadway production) delivers this number while Hamilton, Jefferson and James Madison reach a compromise over dinner that will determine both the location of the nation's capital and a federal tax system.
In other words, momentous events are happening, which will change the course of history, and the precise nature of them will forever be known only by those at the dinner table tonight. (This would have been more likely in the relatively surveillance-free United States of that era.) And it is killing Aaron Burr not to be there, and may well be in part what drives him to kill as well.
That the song title has now been appropriated by politicians suggests just how much "Hamilton" has become part of the American cultural oxygen supply. And it goes beyond not only the rarefied realm of musical theater obsessives, but also partisan use. (Don't forget that "Hamilton" was firmly associated with the Obama White House, so much so that the Off Broadway spoof of the musical called "Spamilton" began by drawing parallels between the Obamas' affection for "Hamilton" with that of the Kennedys' for "Camelot.")
In any case, it's refreshing to have a Broadway show being part of mainstream conversation again, a rarity during my tenure as theater critic. The last time I can recall anything similar happening? Well, that would have been just after Donald J. Trump had been elected president in 2016, and his vice president-elect, Mike Pence, showed up at a Broadway performance of -- yep, the same -- "Hamilton."
The actor Brandon Victor Dixon (who was playing Burr) stepped out at the curtain call to address Pence from the stage and asked him to keep his mind open to the breadth and value of American diversity. This in turn occasioned a tweet from the president that escalated into ... Well, it was among of the first of many such dramas played out on social media.
There is much in "Hamilton" that addresses contemporary concerns and values in flux. (Insert quote in Latin about unchanging human nature.) But such a perspective coexists without all-darkening cynicism. Yes, "Hamilton" (based on Ron Chernow's biography) understands that anyone who aspires to national office is going to require an immense ego and a hunger to rule. His heroes aren't pure.
But, a couple of centuries after the facts, Miranda is able to find the present-tense electricity in a candle-lighted world. Somehow, hearing lyrics of his quoted by Bolton, the former national security adviser, and Senator Klobuchar seems to put a romanticizing distance around events that usually have my stomach churning. It's a sensation that lasts about 30 seconds, but I'm grateful for it.

Texto completo: Apple found renewed growth with an increase in phone sales as well as younger products, like the Apple Watch, AirPods and its subscription services.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple's profit grew for the first time in a year with the help of an old friend: the iPhone.
Sales of Apple's flagship product had fallen sharply for the past year, but on Tuesday, Apple said iPhone revenue was growing again. The company said customers spent heavily on its latest models, increasing iPhone sales by 7.7 percent to nearly $ 56 billion in the latest quarter from a year ago.
That growth helped lift Apple's profit by 11.4 percent to $ 22.3 billion. The numbers easily beat Wall Street expectations and were welcome news to Apple investors, who had watched the company's typically strong growth suddenly evaporate over the past year.
Before Tuesday, Apple had posted four consecutive quarters of shrinking profit, the longest such streak since 2016.
Luca Maestri, Apple's finance chief, said in an interview that demand for Apple's newest iPhones -- the iPhone 11 series, released in September -- exceeded expectations. He attributed the strong sales to new features, like a better camera and longer battery life, as well as financing options to buy a new phone and a $ 50 price cut for the cheapest model.
Daniel Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, said there was pent-up demand for the new iPhones because many people had waited to upgrade their older devices. "This was a jaw-dropper in terms of how strong phone sales were," he said. "Even more than the bulls were hoping for."
Apple also was lifted by some of its newer products.
Apple's services revenue, or sales from its App Store and subscription products, rose by nearly 17 percent to $ 12.7 billion from the prior year. And sales in its so-called wearables division, which include the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones, grew by 37 percent to just over $ 10 billion.
The growth in services and wearables "attests to the fact that the company continues to reinvent itself," said Daniel Flax, an analyst at the investment firm Neuberger Berman.
Apple also showed continued improvement in China, its second-largest market after the United States. A year ago, Apple had to pre-empt its earnings report with news that its sales in China would come in much lower than forecast.
The news sent its stock sliding and raised fears that the slump was a precursor to global economic decline. Apple reported that its sales in the China region fell by nearly 27 percent that quarter, contributing to a slight decline in its overall profit.
But since then, Apple's business has rebounded, the global economy has remained largely stable, and the company's stock has roughly doubled. On Tuesday, Apple said its sales in the China region increased for the first time in five quarters, growing 3.1 percent. Mr. Maestri, the Apple executive, attributed the company's improving fortunes in China partly to the strengthening economy there.
Apple's revenue rose by almost 9 percent to $ 91.8 billion. The company forecast that its revenue would rise 9 percent to 15 percent in the current quarter.
Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said on a call with analysts that Apple's forecast was less precise than typical because the company was uncertain about the impact from the rapidly spreading coronavirus.
In addition to its large sales presence in China, Apple also assembles most of its products there. Mr. Cook said that some Apple suppliers would remain closed into February as a precaution from the virus, and that traffic into its retail stores in the country had also fallen off.
Apple shares rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading.
Apple's recent success on the stock market has reflected a number of good signs for its business, including easing trade tensions between China and the United States. Apple is among the companies with the most at risk in a trade war between the two countries, given its enormous manufacturing and sales presence in China.
In the latest quarter, Apple debuted one of its biggest efforts to expand its services business: Apple TV Plus, a package of exclusive TV shows produced by Apple that costs $ 5 a month, cheaper than most offerings from rivals.
Still, early market estimates suggest the service has not been a big draw for new paying subscribers over the first several months, in part because Apple is giving a free year subscription to the service to anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac computer.
Part of Apple's strategy to expand its services business is to continue to increase the number of people using its devices. On Tuesday, Apple said there were more than 1.5 billion active Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, up from about 1.4 billion a year ago.
Still, sales of some of Apple's older products fell in the quarter. Mac revenue decreased 3.5 percent and, on the week of the iPad's 10th anniversary, its sales declined 11.2 percent.

Texto completo: The attorney general levied federal hate-crime charges against a woman accused of anti-Semitic assaults, including one after she was released without bail.
In the month since New York enacted a sweeping series of changes to its bail laws that have set thousands of defendants free pending their trials, many law enforcement officials have urged lawmakers to reconsider the law.
The roster of prominent critics includes Dermot Shea, the New York City police commissioner, as well as Richard P. Donoghue, the top federal law enforcement official in Brooklyn.
Opponents have seized on defendants recently released under the new bail laws who were rearrested on suspicion of committing new crimes, including several anti-Semitic incidents.
The most prominent of those instances involved Tiffany Harris, a Brooklyn woman who allegedly slapped three Orthodox women in late December. Ms. Harris was released without bail, only to be arrested a day later for assaulting another person.
On Tuesday, Ms. Harris's legal woes intensified as Attorney General William P. Barr appeared in Brooklyn to announce federal hate-crime charges against her, promising "zero tolerance for this kind of violence."
"This will not be an isolated case," Mr. Barr said during a visit to the Boro Park Jewish Community Council. "We will move aggressively if we see this kind of activity."
Mr. Barr did not specifically mention bail reform, but his citation of Ms. Harris's case will undoubtedly give new ammunition to its opponents, and could increase pressure on lawmakers in Albany to make modifications.
Numerous lawmakers in the State Senate and the Assembly -- both ruled by Democrats -- have indicated that changes need to be made, but leaders in both chambers have said it is too soon to make broad judgments on the law, which went into effect on Jan. 1.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, indicated last week that while he anticipated some changes to the new law, any revisions needed to be carefully considered since the previous cash bail system was "repugnant to justice."
"You look at the consequences from the change and you address them -- which we are all open to doing," Mr. Cuomo said. "But let's do it intelligently and not politically or in some knee-jerk fashion."
The new law was passed by lawmakers last spring, as part of a raft of progressive legislation that aimed to modernize the state's long-stagnant criminal justice statutes. Under the new law, judges are not allowed to set bail for a long list of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, including many instances of burglary, robbery, drug offenses, assault and arson.
Bail originally was used as a way to guarantee that defendants returned to court for trial, but activists say the system had been corrupted and abused by law enforcement to unfairly jail poor defendants while releasing wealthy offenders.
That paradigm found a vivid, and tragic, example in 2010 when a Bronx teenager, Kalief Browder, spent three years on Rikers Island because his family could not raise $ 3,000 for bail. The charges against Mr. Browder, who had been accused of stealing a backpack, were dropped for lack of evidence in 2013; he later committed suicide.
But as soon as the new bail law took effect, critics began highlighting a parade of instances where recently released defendants allegedly committed more crimes once freed.
In one example, a man who had been charged with stealing or attempting to steal from four New York City banks was released without bail; hours later, the police said, he robbed a Chase bank in Brooklyn.
"No sound, rational and fair criminal justice system requires the pretrial release of criminal defendants who demonstrate such determination to continuously commit serious crimes," Mr. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said after the suspect was rearrested earlier this month.
Ms. Harris, 30, still faces a number of state charges, including assault, attempted assault, harassment and menacing. Police officials said at the time that Ms. Harris admitted to slapping the three women because she believed they were Jewish.
According to the federal complaint, Ms. Harris attacked all three women within a 10-minute period at around 12:40 a.m. on Dec. 27 in Crown Heights, a neighborhood in Brooklyn with a large Jewish population, "because of their actual or perceived religion."
Two of the victims were wearing clothing that made them identifiable as Jewish, an F.B.I. agent wrote in the complaint. In the second attack, Ms. Harris approached a woman who was walking with five other Jewish people, hit her on the back of the head and uttered a profane, anti-Semitic remark.
Ms. Harris's lawyers reacted angrily to the federal charges levied against her, which carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. They said she was "being used as a scapegoat for the fear-mongering surrounding bail reform," adding she was currently hospitalized and "not endangering anyone."
"Many members of the Jewish community have spoken out against the use of incarceration in her case, including one of the victims," said Lisa Schreibersdorf, the executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services. "I don't know how this can been seen as necessary or even humane."
The change to bail is seen as a signature accomplishment of the Democratic-led State Legislature, pushed by a passel of young progressives who have often challenged mainstream Democrats like Mr. Cuomo to move further to the left. They have urged their colleagues to resist rolling back any portion of the law.
Another measure adopted last year to fix what lawmakers considered flaws in the criminal justice system -- the creation of a Commission on Prosecutorial Misconduct -- suffered a setback on Tuesday when a state court judge ruled that the commission violated New York's Constitution because it "diminishes" the judiciary's role in disciplining attorneys.
It was unclear what impact the ruling would have on the future of the commission, which had not yet taken shape.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, who expressed concerns about whether the panel would withstand a legal challenge even as he signed the bill to create it, said that the governor's office was reviewing the decision. A spokesman for Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
As for the bail changes, many who have criticized them have asked lawmakers to give judges some discretion in seeking bail in cases where defendants pose a perceived risk to the public.
"The N.Y.P.D. believes significant bail reform can be achieved, as long as judges are granted the discretion to remand suspects whom they determine to be genuinely dangerous, including chronic repeat offenders," Commissioner Shea wrote in an Op-Ed for The New York Times.
The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, also has suggested that changes to the new law may be necessary, saying on Tuesday that he has spoken to Commissioner Shea.
"We're going to address the challenges we face," the mayor said.

Texto completo: Rhiannon Giddens, Jordi Savall, Yannick Nézet-Séguin and Andrew Norman are among the featured artists.
The classical music world has been changing, and some of those shifts will be felt at Carnegie Hall.
Carnegie announced Tuesday that next season would feature the Berlin Philharmonic's first concerts at the hall under its new chief conductor, Kirill Petrenko; the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra's first with its music director, Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla; and the Carnegie debut of Teodor Currentzis and the orchestra he founded, MusicAeterna.
"With the orchestras, there are a huge number of firsts," Clive Gillinson, the hall's executive and artistic director, said in an interview.
Rhiannon Giddens, the singer, songwriter, banjo player and musical polymath, will be featured in a Perspectives series in which she will trace the connections between popular and classical songs, team up with other banjo players to explore the experience of African-American women and delve into the complicated history of minstrelsy.
Jordi Savall, the early-music specialist and viola da gamba virtuoso, and Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera, will also be featured in series. A festival called "Voices of Hope: Artists in Times of Oppression" will explore musical responses to injustice, and Andrew Norman will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair.
Among dozens of offerings, what to hear? This is the best of the best: the performances we at The New York Times are most looking forward to.
Los Angeles Philharmonic, Oct. 7-9
There are three opportunities to hear Gustavo Dudamel conduct the West Coast's leading ensemble at Carnegie this fall, in the orchestra's first hall appearance in 30 years. The season-opening gala on Oct. 7 features a brief John Adams fanfare, Grieg (Lang Lang playing the Piano Concerto) and more Grieg (selections from "Peer Gynt"); Oct. 9 brings Mahler's Sixth Symphony. But in between is the most promising program, with two New York premieres: a curtain-raiser by the young composer Gabriella Smith and Andrew Norman's Violin Concerto (with the always-fascinating Leila Josefowicz), with the gentle chaser of Ginastera's "Estancia." JOSHUA BARONE
City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Oct. 23-24
Conducting sensation Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla and her orchestra, which is celebrating its centenary this year, give two concerts that perfectly showcase their tastes and flair for programming. One adeptly balances the familiar with the new and unusual, with Ravel's "La Valse" and Debussy's "La Mer" framing Mieczyslaw Weinberg's Violin Concerto and Thomas Adès's "Angel Symphony," which they will premiere this spring. The other focuses on British music, with Tippett's oratorio "A Child of Our Time" following Sheku Kanneh-Mason as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto. DAVID ALLEN
MusicAeterna, Nov. 4
One of the great stories in classical music over the past decade has been how the Greek-born, Russian-trained conductor Teodor Currentzis formed his own idiosyncratic orchestra in Siberia, garnering a Sony recording contract and triumphing around the world. Their American debut last year at the Shed was one of the major events of the cultural year, and now Currentzis and the orchestra will bring their blistering intensity to Carnegie, with Tchaikovsky's "Pathétique" Symphony and the Adagio from Mahler's Symphony No. 10. MICHAEL COOPER
American Composers Orchestra, Nov. 5
As part of Andrew Norman's composing residency, this ensemble presents the New York premiere of "Begin," a chamber-orchestra piece first heard in Los Angeles last year. The rest of the program is just as tantalizing, with world premieres by Ellen Reid, Jane Meenaghan and George Lewis. SETH COLTER WALLS
Jordi Savall, Nov. 5 and 9
Four days after Mr. Savall leads his period-instrument orchestra Le Concert des Nations and vocal ensemble La Capella Reial de Catalunya in Monteverdi's glorious Vespers in Carnegie's main auditorium, he'll bring those groups downstairs, to the more intimate Zankel Hall, for Monteverdi's complete "Madrigals of War and Love," a rare chance to hear a collection of genre-blurring pieces that altered music history. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Lise Davidsen, Nov. 12
In the wake of feverish hype in the opera world, the Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen made her Metropolitan Opera debut this fall in Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades" and, if anything, surpassed the high expectations. Her silvery voice had both thrilling power and nuanced expressivity. It will be fascinating to hear her in a recital setting; with the pianist James Baillieu, she sings works by Grieg, Mahler, Berg ("Seven Early Songs") and Wagner ("Wesendonck Lieder"). ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Berlin Philharmonic, Nov. 18-20
When I went to Berlin last year for Kirill Petrenko's debut concerts as the Philharmonic's chief conductor, I was struck by the excitement he generated among its players. Now New Yorkers will be able to judge for themselves. This program, featuring the great dramatic soprano Nina Stemme singing Brünnhilde's Immolation Scene from Wagner's "Götterdämmerung," gives him a chance to show off his operatic chops, which he honed during a memorable run at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. (In a rarity for Carnegie, this program is played twice, on Nov. 18 and 20; on the 19th, the Philharmonic performs Webern, Mendelssohn and Brahms.) MICHAEL COOPER
Ksenija Sidorova, Feb. 3
The Carnegie lineup is full of superb voices, violinists, pianists -- the meat and potatoes of classical music. So less conventional instruments pop out, like the accordion played by this Latvian virtuoso. "Revelatory," according to my colleague James R. Oestreich, Ms. Sidorova will perform arrangements of Bach, Mozart and Tchaikovsky alongside works tailor-made for accordion by Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke and others. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Louisville Orchestra, Feb. 20
Go ahead and call the Louisville Orchestra a "regional" (as opposed to "major") ensemble. That's a meaningless distinction for the many people excited by the adventurous programs the dynamic young conductor Teddy Abrams and his excellent players have been giving. For example, the concert they will present at Carnegie will offer Andrew Norman's "Sacred Geometry," Copland's "Appalachian Spring" (with dancers from Louisville Ballet) and Jim James's song cycle "The Order of Life," performed with its composer, a Louisville native and the leader of the rock band My Morning Jacket. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Boston Symphony Orchestra, April 14
For all my worries about the direction that the Boston Symphony has taken under its music director, Andris Nelsons, there have been two pluses during his tenure so far: his Shostakovich survey (steadily being released on record to considerable acclaim) and his opera. A Shostakovich opera, then, ought to come off well, especially this composer's best, "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk." The soprano Kristine Opolais is scheduled as Katerina, with Brandon Jovanovich as Sergey. DAVID ALLEN
Mark Padmore and Mitsuko Uchida, April 16
The tenor Mark Padmore once told me he was reminded of all the words for "rehearsal" when working with the pianist Mitsuko Uchida: "In French, 'répétition,' which speaks for itself; in German, 'probe' -- proving or trying. In English, it has nothing to do with hearing. Its etymology is to till the earth in preparation for seed. Working with Mitsuko, all three of those things, those attitudes to rehearsing, are absolutely present." Now imagine how they'll sound in "Dichterliebe" and other Schumann works. JOSHUA BARONE
Alexandre Tharaud, April 18
This is, as always, a good season for piano recitals at Carnegie, with Vikingur Olafsson, Daniil Trifonov, Igor Levit and Jean-Yves Thibaudet all making solo appearances worthy of anticipation. But Mr. Tharaud's program is particularly intriguing. It bridges the gap between the French Baroque -- Couperin, Rameau and the more obscure composers Jean-Henri d'Anglebert and Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer -- and the French early 20th century, with works by Ravel and Reynaldo Hahn that will benefit from this artist's sensual grace. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Met Orchestra, June 10
It's been many years since the great mezzo-soprano Waltraud Meier last sang at Carnegie, which makes her return with this superb ensemble -- freed from its Lincoln Center pit after the opera season ends -- a true event. Wagner's lush "Wesendonck Lieder" is on the agenda, conducted by Semyon Bychkov, who fills out the evening leading Shostakovich's "Leningrad" Symphony. ZACHARY WOOLFE

Texto completo: The Congressional Budget Office sees low interest rates, slow growth and big deficits through 2029.
WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Budget Office predicted on Tuesday that the United States deficit will top $ 1 trillion annually over the next 10 years, ultimately reaching $ 1.7 trillion in 2030.
The ballooning deficit is being fueled by increased borrowing by the federal government, which continues to spend more money than it takes in. By 2030, the C.B.O. projected, federal debt held by the public will surpass $ 31 trillion -- about 98 percent of the forecast size of the nation's economy.
The federal budget deficit already hit $ 1 trillion last year -- the first calendar year since 2012 that the gap between revenue and spending topped the trillion-dollar mark. The C.B.O.'s projections suggested that would become a permanent pattern over the next 10 years.
The somber news was tempered somewhat by the budget office's expectation that interest rates for the next decade would be substantially lower than what its August forecast indicated, saving the United States hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments on the federal debt.
The decline in interest rate projections reflects a shift in strategy by the Federal Reserve, which cut rates last year amid slowing growth and little sign of sustained price increases that could spiral into rapid inflation. The budget office now expects the interest paid by 10-year Treasury bills to remain below 3 percent through 2027.
President Trump has pushed Fed officials to reduce rates even further, toward zero or even into negative territory. On Tuesday, hours before the new forecast was issued, he suggested lower rates would allow the United States to "refinance" its debt and begin to pay it off.
Mr. Trump promised to pay off the national debt as president, but in three years in office, he has instead added to it with big tax cuts and increased federal spending.
Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers have claimed the tax cuts will pay for themselves through increased economic growth, which would ostensibly produce higher tax revenues. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that assertion in Davos, Switzerland, last week.
But while the 2017 tax cuts produced an uptick in growth in 2018, federal revenues declined. The latest C.B.O. forecast shows no indication that officials there expect rapid growth will return any time soon, as Mr. Trump and his team have projected.
The budget office estimates the economy grew more slowly last year than it predicted in August, and sees annual growth declining from 2.2 percent in 2020 to 1.5 percent by the middle of the decade.
The new forecast anticipates a sharper decline in overall tax receipts through 2029 than did the August projections.
Democrats, Republicans and independent fiscal hawks all found cause for concern.
The forecast "confirms that President Trump's economic policies did not create a sustained boost for the economy like he has claimed," said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the Democratic chairman of the House Budget Committee.
The committee's top Republican, Steve Womack of Arkansas, said the forecast "once again confirms what we already know: our nation's debt and deficits continue to grow, and we are on an unsustainable trajectory."
Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the latest numbers should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers.
"We're running trillion-dollar deficits while the economy is expanding -- when are lawmakers going to wake up?" she said. "Every year we set a new postwar record for debt as a share of the economy, every year the Congressional Budget Office warns that debt is rising unsustainably, and every year our largest trust funds get closer to depleting their reserves. Ignoring what is staring us right in the face is fiscal malfeasance."

Pro-Israel Super PAC Takes Aim at Sanders in Iowa

Texto completo: The group, the Democratic Majority for Israel, will begin airing a negative campaign spot on Wednesday, as worries mount among moderate Democrats that Mr. Sanders could win the Iowa caucuses.
DES MOINES -- A Democratic super PAC will begin airing attack ads in Iowa against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Wednesday, marking the first time a Democratic organization has run a negative campaign spot targeting Mr. Sanders by name in either of his two primary campaigns.
The ad, backed by Democratic Majority for Israel's political action arm, comes as concerns among moderate Democrats mount that Mr. Sanders could win Iowa, setting the avowed democratic socialist on a possible path to the nomination. With Mr. Sanders leading in some polls ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses, the spot is the first sign of a still-disjointed effort to stop his rise by the moderate wing of the party.
It also signals a new line of attack against Mr. Sanders. For much of the Democratic nomination race, his rivals have focused on his policy positions, arguing that his proposals for "Medicare for all" and free public college are too expensive and unfeasible.
While Democratic Majority for Israel is focused on raising support for Israel within the party, its spot targets the dominant concern among many Democrats in Iowa and elsewhere: beating President Trump.
Featuring six Iowa voters, the ad argues that Mr. Sanders would be unable to defeat Mr. Trump in the November general election, citing the senator's heart attack last year and his left-wing ideology as evidence that he would be too risky a choice for primary caucusgoers focused on winning back the White House.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"I like Bernie, I think he has great ideas, but in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa, they're just not going to vote for a socialist," a male voter says. "I just don't think Bernie can beat Trump."
Another voter adds: "I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders's health considering the fact that he did have a heart attack."
In recent weeks, some Democratic Party elected officials and strategists have grown increasingly anxious about the prospect that Mr. Sanders could capture the nomination. Many believe that they have a limited window to thwart any possible rise or streak of victories in the primaries, and that a wait-and-see approach -- such as taking action after the Super Tuesday contests in early March -- could end up being too late and too divisive for the party.
While there are informal discussions in Democratic circles about starting an organized effort to stop Mr. Sanders, so far no group of donors or organizations has stepped up to helm a broader campaign. On Tuesday, Third Way, a centrist think tank, sent an email to several hundred of its supporters in Iowa, encouraging them to highlight positions taken by Mr. Sanders that the group argues "will repel swing voters in battleground states."
Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel and a longtime Democratic pollster, said his group began developing an ad several weeks ago, as Mr. Sanders rebounded from a slide in the polls last fall. The group did not work in conjunction with any other organization.
The concerns about Mr. Sanders are two-pronged. The group and its allies worry that his questioning of the Democratic Party's longstanding support for Israel could damage the United States' historically strong relationship with the country.
If elected, Mr. Sanders would be the first Jewish president. Mr. Sanders, who doesn't often speak about his Jewish upbringing, has called for an American policy toward Israel that addresses both Israeli security and a "pro-Palestinian" perspective. He spent time working on a kibbutz in Israel as a young man and opposes the movement, supported by some liberals, to boycott, divest from and sanction the country.
Mr. Mellman said his organization was equally concerned about the ability of the liberal septuagenarian to beat Mr. Trump, saying Mr. Sanders was in a "uniquely bad position" to win a general election.
"For many months people were saying he really didn't have much of a chance, but you have to look at the data now and say he does have a realistic chance of winning Iowa and potentially the nomination," he said. "This is the point at which there could be room for someone else to make their case and have a better candidate emerge."
On Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders tweeted out a video in which he addressed the ads. "It is no secret that our campaign is taking on the political establishment and the big-money interests, who are now running negative ads against us in Iowa," he says. "The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should."
Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, sent an email to supporters on Tuesday warning them that Mr. Sanders was being targeted with the ads.
The email alluded to an "outside spending group" but did not name Democratic Majority for Israel by name. It also said the campaign was aware that a super PAC for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had placed $ 1 million worth of ads in Iowa this week as well.
"We have a small lead in Iowa heading into Monday's caucus," Mr. Shakir wrote. "But outside groups are on the attack and hoping to stop us. Bernie needs us all if we're going to fight back and win."
Past attacks have boomeranged to Mr. Sanders's advantage. When Hillary Clinton ripped into Mr. Sanders in an interview published last week, her comments led to a rallying of support for his candidacy online.
The group made its ad reservations on Monday, booking more than $ 680,000 to air only in Iowa starting on Wednesday morning and running just through the caucuses, a significant level of saturation over a short span just before the nominating contest. The buy is heavily weighted toward Cedar Rapids and Des Moines markets, and the group is also airing the ad on cable, including on CNN, MSNBC and ESPN.
News that the group had made reservations was swirling around Democratic circles on Tuesday morning, and the Sanders campaign sent a fund-raising text message to supporters warning that "an outside group is starting a $ 700,000 NEGATIVE AD CAMPAIGN against Bernie." The text asked for $ 2.70 to help push back.
The ads follow a weekend in which Mr. Sanders faced an onslaught of attacks from Democratic rivals. Pete Buttigieg sent a fund-raising email warning his supporters that "Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party," followed by another email casting doubt on his ability to defeat Mr. Trump. Michael R. Bloomberg, who is skipping the early states to focus on Super Tuesday and beyond, also took a jab at Mr. Sanders's political beliefs, saying that Mr. Bloomberg was the only Jewish candidate in the race who "doesn't want to turn America into a kibbutz."
One reason for Mr. Sanders's surge in Iowa is the inability of moderates to coalesce behind one candidate. It is unlikely that the negative attacks on Mr. Sanders will unite moderates at this point. But it could spur them to caucus out of fear that not doing so could lead to a victory for Mr. Sanders, who benefits from a loyal and unwavering bloc of supporters.
Any anti-Sanders effort, however, is also likely to galvanize his supporters, who often rush to his side at any sign of adversity.

Texto completo: Roughly 80 members of Congress, cabinet secretaries and administration officials will descend on the state to drive voter enthusiasm and make a show of force.
WASHINGTON -- The Iowa caucuses on Monday will be a competitive race for only one party, the Democrats, but President Trump's campaign does not see it that way.
Roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress will descend on the state that day to drive voter enthusiasm and make a show of force intended to jolt whoever emerges as the Democratic caucus winner.
The surrogates will include two former presidential candidates who once campaigned against Mr. Trump in Iowa: Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Rick Perry, the former energy secretary.
Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, as well as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will fan out to speak to Iowa voters at various caucus sites. A group of Trump loyalists from the House -- including Representatives Elise Stefanik of New York, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- will also be on the ground to make their case for Mr. Trump, the campaign announced Tuesday.
They will be joined by a host of loyal "formers," including Mr. Trump's former 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; the former White House communications director, Bill Shine; and Matthew Whitaker, an Iowa native who briefly served as the acting attorney general.
"Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come," said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign manager. "This will be the strongest, best funded and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice: good luck trying to keep up with this formidable re-election machine."
The idea is to show off a deep well of support for Mr. Trump even as Democrats are choosing their nominee in a nail-biter of a contest that will help whoever emerges as the winner and determine the shape of the rest of the party's primary fight.
Senator Bernie Sanders, the crowd-drawing independent from Vermont, has placed first in Iowa in a series of polls, and Mr. Trump has recently been seeking to elevate his candidacy. Mr. Trump has also been focused on Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who is running a parallel effort in the states that will vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and skip Iowa altogether.
Incumbents -- and party nominees -- often try to swamp early states where their opponents are campaigning by flying in government officials who volunteer their personal time for the campaign, along with lawmakers and aides. But Mr. Trump's show of force is still unusual.
"I'm even pleasantly taken aback by this over-the-top interest in Iowa," said Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. "This is about making a statement on the part of the president."
Mr. Trump placed second in Iowa in 2016, after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. This time around, two Republican challengers, Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support from Republican voters.
But the Trump campaign said their showing in Iowa was less about two opponents it has been studiously ignoring and more about recruiting volunteers and small-dollar donors, with whom they will continue to engage through November.
"Strategically, it's important for Trump surrogates to be in Iowa to consume some of the media coverage," said David Bossie, who was Mr. Trump's deputy campaign manager in 2016 and plans to participate in the Iowa offensive. "We want to plant the flag, because we are looking ahead to the general election."
Mr. Bossie said it would be a mistake to ignore a battleground state simply because there was no competitive primary on the Republican side.
"I don't think anybody on that plane is worried about Bill Weld," added Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. "This campaign is always on offense; it's on its front foot. It doesn't give Democrats a day to do their own thing."
Mr. Trump himself is expected in Des Moines for a rally on Thursday night, a move Mr. Kaufmann compared to President Ronald Reagan showing up in Iowa during his re-election campaign in 1984.
"Back then, he had no competition in the caucus, but he made it a statement that he's not taking Iowa for granted," Mr. Kaufmann said. "For all practical purposes, this is the beginning of the general election."

Texto completo: Amy Klobuchar's campaign signaled no interest in such a plan, under which each candidate would encourage supporters to back the other in certain precincts.
Aides to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are discussing the possibility of seeking an alliance with Senator Amy Klobuchar in next week's Iowa caucuses, a plan that would involve a pledge to help each other in precincts where one of them does not have enough support to win delegates.
Three staff members for Mr. Biden's Iowa campaign tentatively floated the idea to a top Klobuchar adviser at a meeting this week, according to Democrats briefed on the meeting.
People in both the Biden and Klobuchar camps played down the discussion, which took place at a Des Moines restaurant, and aides for Ms. Klobuchar said they did not regard it as a serious overture. But there is little doubt among Mr. Biden's allies in the state that his campaign is contemplating such steps, with an eye toward preventing a messy split among moderate candidates on Monday.
The Biden officials, led by the campaign's Iowa director, Jake Braun, asked the Klobuchar strategist, Pete Giangreco, about the prospect that the two campaigns could encourage their supporters in the state to back the other candidate in precincts where Mr. Biden or Ms. Klobuchar fall short of the 15 percent threshold required to reach the second round of balloting.
Mr. Giangreco, however, said Ms. Klobuchar was not interested in any such agreement at the moment, according to the Democrats familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.
Ms. Klobuchar's campaign reaffirmed its lack of interest in an alliance of any kind on Tuesday evening. Tim Hogan, Ms. Klobuchar's communications director, expressed confidence in her trajectory in the state.
"Our campaign is on the rise," Mr. Hogan said. "We've never made caucus deals with other campaigns and don't intend to."
Mr. Biden's campaign declined to comment on Tuesday night. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Braun was acting on instructions from more senior Biden aides or if he was acting on his own.
But the conversation illustrates the urgency Mr. Biden's campaign is feeling as polls show him dividing votes with the other moderate candidates in the race, and Senator Bernie Sanders taking a lead going into Monday's caucuses.
For weeks, supporters of Mr. Biden have expressed hope that they can win Iowa if the bulk of Ms. Klobuchar's supporters migrate to him on the second ballot. In an interview Sunday, former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, a top Biden supporter, made the case for why those supporters should rally to Mr. Biden, and even suggested Ms. Klobuchar might be considered as his running mate. She has gained strength in Iowa, but is still polling below 15 percent in most state polls.
The dinner suggests Mr. Biden's camp knows that movement from her backers may not happen without Ms. Klobuchar's blessing. In addition to Mr. Braun, two other Biden aides in Iowa, Bill Doerrer and Claudia Chavez, attended. The four political operatives know one another from their roots in Chicago politics.
It is not unusual for Democratic campaigns in Iowa to form alliances before the caucuses. In 2004, for example, John Edwards and Dennis Kucinich agreed to encourage their supporters to join forces behind whichever of the two had more strength in a given precinct. It helped Mr. Edwards, but not enough to defeat John Kerry, who won the caucuses that year.
One complication for Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar is that they are not the only candidates vying for the support of moderate Iowa Democrats. Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren are also polling in the teens there and could ensure that none of the four leading alternatives to Mr. Sanders can coalesce support.
So there may be more flirtations in the days leading up to the caucuses, as the campaigns seek an advantage in Iowa's complex system. But many political veterans in the state believe that in an era when voters are increasingly well-informed, it will be difficult to move them en masse to another candidate, even if their preferred choice asks them to do so.

Texto completo: As Mr. Biden campaigned in the state, residents appeared unmoved: "I don't think much about anything Joni Ernst says."
MUSCATINE, Iowa -- Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a Republican, wondered aloud about her Democratic constituents as they wrestled with a final decision before the looming Iowa caucuses, particularly those considering supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
After sitting through hours of arguments in the impeachment trial of President Trump on Monday, where his legal team focused on how Mr. Biden's son, Hunter, had nabbed a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Ms. Ernst addressed reporters in the basement of the Capitol.
"Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening," she said. "And I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucusgoers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point?"
At an event in Muscatine on Tuesday, a handmade sign on the wall seemed to answer her directly: "Joni -- We're w/ Joe."
Mr. Biden responded to Ms. Ernst's comments head-on, presenting them as proof that Mr. Trump's team was using the impeachment trial to try to hobble his candidacy.
"She spilled the beans," Mr. Biden told the crowd, speaking in a room overlooking the Mississippi River on a gray winter day. "She just came out and flat said it. You know, the whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to try to smear me, because he is scared to death to run against me, and he has good reason to be concerned."
By late afternoon Tuesday, his team had sent a fund-raising email from his campaign manager with the subject line "Hey Senator Joni Ernst, let me answer your question directly." The campaign also released a digital ad highlighting Ms. Ernst's comments and accusing Republicans of spreading "lies" about Mr. Biden.
The impeachment trial of Mr. Trump has paralyzed Washington and frozen much of the fluid 2020 Democratic field in amber, commanding nonstop news media attention and tethering the four senators in the race to Capitol Hill. But talk of impeachment has been largely absent from the campaign trail in Iowa in the final stretch before the state's caucuses, including at Mr. Biden's events.
Ms. Ernst was first elected to the Senate in 2014 in a victory that helped the Republicans take control of the chamber. As she gears up for her first re-election battle this year, she has the built-in advantage of running on the same ticket as Mr. Trump, who carried Iowa in 2016 by nearly 10 points, even after Barack Obama won the state twice.
So, could a shot from Iowa's junior senator, launched from a microphone in the bowels of the Capitol in Washington, put the polarizing impeachment process in the minds of Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa?
The answer, as Mr. Biden campaigned in Iowa on Tuesday, seemed clear.
"She's just mouthing everything that the president is saying," said Donna Cantrell, 70, who came to see Mr. Biden in Muscatine. She plans to support him next week and said the president's attacks would not persuade her otherwise.
"He's a good person," she said of Mr. Biden. "All the stuff that Trump keeps putting out there, investigating Burisma and all the stuff, it's just the same thing, the same playbook he did with Hillary Clinton to ruin her."
Michael Wehner, 66, was similarly unmoved. He said he had been leaning toward supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, but was impressed by Mr. Biden.
"I don't think much about anything Joni Ernst says," he said. The scrutiny of Hunter Biden did not give him any pause, he added.
"The fact that he took that job was ill thought out," Mr. Wehner said. Still, he said, "It's been investigated so deeply and there's nothing there. It's just a distraction away from what the president has done."
Interviews with a half dozen Democratic county chairs in Iowa similarly cast doubt on whether impeachment would be on the minds of caucusgoers as they decide among the Democratic candidates.
"It has zero effect on actual caucus voters," said Brian Bruening, the chair of the Clayton County Democrats in northeast Iowa. "I don't know any Joe Biden supporter whose support of Biden has lessened because of any of the impeachment issues."
Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, argued that Ms. Ernst's comments would hurt her in the election by energizing the Democratic base.
"She's calling out Democratic activists to look at her," Ms. Dvorsky said. "Like, oh, sister. Are you sure? Are you sure you want to be the face of this?"
As for Mr. Biden, she said that Mr. Trump's attacks had both accentuated the Biden campaign's argument that the president worries about facing him in a general election and offered a clear preview of how the president would attack him.
"One of his residential addresses is inside Trump's head," she said. "Does that help? Sure. Is it a double-edged sword? Yes, of course it is."
Ms. Ernst, who also sent a fund-raising appeal based on her Monday remarks, offered a different take on Twitter on Tuesday. She wrote that Mr. Biden "thinks my comments prove his point" regarding Mr. Trump.
"Wrong," she added. "Yesterday the president's counsel showcased that the Bidens were knee deep in corruption. Corruption isn't good politics nor is it good for the American people."
As the impeachment proceedings have ramped up, Mr. Biden has been hammering the argument that he is the candidate Mr. Trump fears most.
"You Iowa caucusgoers have a chance for a twofer here," Mr. Biden said in Muscatine. "You can ruin Donald Trump's night by caucusing for me, and you can ruin Joni Ernst's night as well."
Kevin Gleaves, who came out to see Mr. Biden, appeared eager to follow the former vice president's instructions -- at least in part.
"I will certainly support whoever the Democrats nominate for president," said Mr. Gleaves, 71, who backs Ms. Warren but rebuffed Ms. Ernst nonetheless. "I will actively support whoever's up against Joni Ernst. I will give that person my time, my money, my soul."
The Iowa Senate race is crucial to Democrats' hopes of retaking the Senate. Theresa Greenfield, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's preferred candidate in the primary, wasted no time capitalizing on Ms. Ernst's remarks.
"Sounds like you're focused on the wrong election, Senator," she tweeted Monday evening alongside a call for donations.

Texto completo: Facing an increasing number of requests for its users' information, Google began charging law enforcement and other government agencies this month for legal demands seeking data such as emails, location-tracking information and search queries.
Google's fees range from $45 for a subpoena and $60 for a wiretap to $245 for a search warrant, according to a notice sent to law enforcement officials and reviewed by The New York Times. The notice also included fees for other legal requests.
A spokesman for Google said the fees were intended in part to help offset the costs of complying with warrants and subpoenas.
Federal law allows companies to charge the government reimbursement fees of this type, but Google's decision is a major change in how it deals with legal requests.
Some Silicon Valley companies have forgone such charges, which can be difficult to enforce at a large scale and could give the impression that a company aims to profit from legal searches. But privacy experts support such fees as a deterrent to overbroad surveillance.
Google has tremendous amounts of information on billions of users, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world routinely submit legal requests seeking that data. In the first half of 2019, the company received more than 75,000 requests for data on nearly 165,000 accounts worldwide; 1 in 3 of those requests came from the United States.
Google has previously charged for legal requests. A record from 2008 showed that the company sought reimbursement for a legal request for user data. But a spokesman said that for many years now, the tech firm had not systematically charged for standard legal processes.
The money brought in from the new fees would be inconsequential for Google. Just last week, the valuation of its parent company, Alphabet, topped $1 trillion for the first time. Alphabet is scheduled to report its latest financial results Monday.
The new fees could help recover some of the costs required to fill such a large volume of legal requests, said Al Gidari, a lawyer who for years represented Google and other technology and telecommunications companies. The requests have also grown more complicated as tech companies have acquired more data and law enforcement has become more technologically sophisticated.
"None of the services were designed with exfiltrating data for law enforcement in mind," said Gidari, who is the consulting privacy director at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.
Gidari said it was good that the fees might result in fewer legal requests.
"The actual costs of doing wiretaps and responding to search warrants is high, and when you pass those costs on to the government, it deters from excessive surveillance," he said.
In April, the Times reported that Google had been inundated with a new type of search warrant request, geofence searches.
Drawing on an enormous Google database called Sensorvault, they provide law enforcement with the opportunity to find suspects and witnesses using location data gleaned from user devices.
A Google spokesman said that there was no specific reason the fees were announced this month and that they had been under consideration for some time.
Reports put out by the company show a rise of more than 50% in the number of search warrants received in the first half of 2019 compared with a year earlier. The volume of subpoenas increased 15%. From last January through June, the company received nearly 13,000 subpoenas and more than 10,000 search warrants from U.S. law enforcement.
Google will not ask for reimbursement in some cases, including child safety investigations and life-threatening emergencies, the spokesman said.

Quirk of British law pays for royals Source of funding for Harry, Meghan is private. Sort of.

Texto completo: LONDON - Every six months or so, Alan Davis sets out from his seaside bungalow on a far-flung island off the southwestern coast of England carrying a rent check of about $16 for his landlord.
But this is no ordinary landlord, and no ordinary rent check.
Davis lives on a tiny corner of the Duchy of Cornwall, the property empire controlled by Prince Charles, the heir to Britain's throne, who has quietly turned an inheritance of rundown farmland into a billion-pound real estate conglomerate.
By a quirk of British law, Davis has to pay the prince for the privilege of living on his land, piddling as the checks may be.
"It's a feudal way of carrying on," Davis said. "They put their finger in and demand money. They're a law unto themselves."
Prince Charles' fortune, long shielded from scrutiny by parliamentary indifference and obscure accounting, spilled into public view in January when his younger son, Prince Harry, announced that he and his wife, Meghan, were quitting their royal duties. In trying to prove that they would renounce taxpayer money, Harry and Meghan gave Britons a peek at the shadowy world of ostensibly private finance that bankrolls the family and its mansions, gardens and considerable staff.
But what the royals call private contains, by any other measure, a generous mix of public giveaways: medieval landholdings passed from one male heir to the next, sweeping tax relief, indemnity from some laws and exemptions from others, ownership of long stretches of coastline and all the treasure buried in Cornwall.
Those perks have delivered Prince Charles substantial wealth. Income from the duchy has nearly tripled in two decades, to about $28.3 million, last year. But the uproar over Harry and Meghan's funding has raised uncomfortable questions for the prince and the royals about whether any of their income can truly be considered private.
Coming on the heels of Prince Charles' brother Andrew being kicked off the royal front lines for socializing with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, such scrutiny is another dent to the royal mystique.
"Harry has chucked a grenade into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace," said David McClure, author of a book about the royal family's wealth. "It's weakened the foundations of the royal family and their money, and it's raised issues that don't just apply to Harry but have been bubbling under the surface for at least a decade."
Among the biggest of those is the special treatment afforded Prince Charles' property empire, an estate that, among other things, pays for the upkeep of his country mansion and furnished 5 million pounds last year for the families of Harry and his older brother, Prince William.
The duchy has a vast footprint, stretching from the rocky shores of Cornwall to south London, and from medieval castles to a granite-walled men's prison. It recently bought a 400,000-square-foot supermarket warehouse north of London.
A spokeswoman for the duchy said in a statement that Parliament had "confirmed its status as a private estate" and that the Treasury had agreed that its tax status did not confer an unfair advantage.
"The prince has always ensured it is run with the interests of its communities as an equal priority," the statement said.
The duchy's holdings reflect how the royal family's wealth has become concentrated in the hands of Prince Charles and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, whose own estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, paid her 21.7 million pounds last year.
Together, the two duchies bankroll more than a dozen members of the family, supplementing a taxpayer grant of 82 million pounds last year reserved for official duties and the upkeep of several palaces.
Despite lawmakers once deeming its current income "an accident of history," the Duchy of Cornwall has mostly avoided harsh questions, in part by playing up its interest in traditional architecture and sustainable practices across its humbler holdings: scores of farms, much of Dartmoor National Park in Devon and rivers throughout Cornwall. But analysts say that obscures fierce commercial instincts.
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, you sort of assume it is a duck," a Labour lawmaker told duchy officials during a 2013 hearing. "The Duchy of Cornwall looks and behaves like a corporation."
But the duchy does not pay taxes like a corporation. Instead it sits in a legal limbo, using its royal status to skirt corporation and capital gains taxes even as it argues that, as a private estate, it has no obligation to open its books. The duchy said its capital gains were all reinvested in the business, obviating the need to tax them, and that only companies paid corporation tax.
Prince Charles pays tax on his duchy income only voluntarily and after deducting what analysts believe to be about 10 million pounds that he deems official and charitable spending. He has also written off tens of thousands of pounds that he pays for gardening at Highgrove, his country house, on the basis that members of the public were occasionally invited in.
The duchy's powers go even further.
Prince Charles inherits the possessions of anyone who dies in Cornwall without a will or next of kin, a power that in some years has yielded hundreds of thousands of pounds. He funnels the money into charities after deducting his costs.
A similar carve-out gives Prince Charles unusual power over some homeowners on the Isles of Scilly, a picturesque archipelago off the southwestern coast of England, and in Newton St. Loe, a village near Bath.
People like Davis own their homes, but the duchy owns the ground on which they are built. Such an arrangement is not uncommon in England, but homeowners would usually have the option to buy the land. Not on some duchy land.
That enables the duchy to charge small ground rents to homeowners grandfathered into long leases, like Davis. Once those leases lapse, it can also raise rents to thousands of pounds per year, making it difficult for people to sell or mortgage their homes.
In one case, a couple built a house on the Isles of Scilly, only to have the duchy force them to sign a lease bequeathing the property to Prince Charles' estate upon their death, said Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer in the House of Lords, who tried unsuccessfully to push through a bill in 2017 ending the duchy's special landlord status and removing its tax exemptions.

Texto completo: A Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump that was moving along predictably - with Republican senators continuing to support their party's president - received a jolt from John Bolton, a sharp-tongued conservative and Baltimore native who has never seemed to mind rattling conventional wisdom. Here's a primer on who he is, why he's in the news, and how he's tied to the Baltimore area.
Why is Bolton in the news?
In explosive comments made in a book manuscript, the former national security adviser stoked debate over whether the impeachment trial should include witnesses. Bolton wrote, according to a New York Times report, that President Donald Trump tied a freeze of military aid to Ukraine to his request to see that nation announce political investigations into political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden.
Democrats immediately seized upon the leaked Bolton statements as bolstering the need to summon him - and other witnesses - to the trial. "This is stunning," Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer told reporters. "It boils down to one thing: We have a witness with firsthand evidence of the president's actions for which he is on trial. He is ready and willing to testify. How can Senate Republicans not vote to call that witness and request his documents?"
Democrats said Bolton's comments in the manuscript went to the heart of the impeachment allegations.
The first impeachment article alleges Trump abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine - and the prospect of a state visit to Washington by Ukraine's president - to pressure its government to announce an investigation into Biden, a presidential candidate. Biden's son, Hunter, was on the board of a gas company in Ukraine. The second article alleges the president defied the impeachment inquiry by directing officials not to cooperate with congressional subpoenas.
Trump counsel Alan Dershowitz argued during the trial Monday night that Bolton's disclosures about Trump - even if true - would not rise to an impeachable offense by the president.
What is Bolton's background?
Bolton has long made lawmakers of both parties uncomfortable. He has been criticized as hawkish and unpredictable by Democrats, and viewed warily by many in his own party. The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is known for an abrupt rhetoric that has often flared rather than eased tensions.
He once said the 39-story United Nations' Secretariat Building in New York could lose 10 floors and it "wouldn't make a bit of difference."
Like Trump, Bolton has been critical of the Iran nuclear agreement negotiated by the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. The president withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018.
But he differed sharply from the president on other foreign policy questions. Trump said frequently during the 2016 campaign that he opposed the Iraq war; Bolton was an architect of the 2003 U.S. invasion.
As he entered office, Trump sought another "reset" of U.S. relations with Russia; Bolton took a more confrontational approach with Moscow.
How is he tied to Baltimore?
The son of a Baltimore firefighter, Bolton grew up in a rowhouse in a working-class southwest neighborhood behind Mount Saint Joseph High School.
Even when he was a student at the McDonogh School, he had a flair for foreign policy and a propensity for being less than diplomatic. A lifelong conservative, Bolton had a nickname for a beloved liberal history teacher at the Owings Mills school he attended as U.S. involvement in Vietnam was escalating: "Mao."
From McDonogh, he went to Yale College and Yale Law School, where he was a classmate of Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham.
Bolton worked in the Nixon White House and served as general counsel for the U.S. Agency for International Development before joining the State Department.
President George W. Bush named Bolton under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, a post he held from 2001 until 2005. Bush then nominated him to be ambassador to the United Nations.

Resumen: American citizens are left footing the bill for megarich Hollywood filmmakers. 'Joker' is only the tip of the iceberg.

Texto completo: The good news continues to roll in for the box office record-breaking film “Joker. ” Earlier this month, star Joaquin Phoenix won a Golden Globe for his performance, and now the film has been nominated for an industry-leading 11 Oscars. This is on top of becoming the highest worldwide-grossing R-rated film, exceeding $1 billion in global box office sales.
If “Joker” wins, taxpayers deserve to share the Oscar, since they forked over 18% of the production costs — an estimated $9. 9 million in subsidies. Meanwhile, the movie is projected to earn its Hollywood investors more than $600 million in profit — making it one of the most profitable movies of all time.
New York, where most of the filming took place, and New Jersey, whose gritty areas stood in for 1980s New York City, are far from the only states to subsidize filming. In 2017, more than 30 states did it, totaling $1. 7 billion. The most recent data has California ($330 million), New York ($420 million) and Georgia ($870 million) as the biggest spenders.
What better things could they be doing with that money?
The costs extend beyond the sticker price. Instead of paying those hundreds of millions for film subsidies every year, New York could fund nearly 15,000 full-tuition scholarships to state universities, hire 2,700 New York City police officers or pay for a quarter of state annual road maintenance. Georgia could have instead cut its corporate income tax by 68% last year, which would have done more to create broad-based economic development.
Some argue that government film subsidies bring spending to local economies. But that’s true of any subsidy. As economist J. C. Bradbury said, “If taxpayers covered 30% of the cost of producing toilets, Georgia would be the toilet-making capital of the world. ” You could grow oranges in Alaska with enough subsidies, but that doesn’t make it a good idea.
Furthermore, film production is flighty, meaning studios can’t be depended on to stay if other states offer larger subsidies. Local economies should instead lean into their own unique strengths, rather than each trying to be the next Hollywood.
Maybe film subsidies will attract tourists to visit the iconic landscapes and city skylines they see on the big screen. But this only raises more questions in the case of “Joker”: Why should New York underwrite a movie that stars a seedy, crime-infested past version of New York City? Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie famously vetoed the “Snooki subsidy” for the MTV show “Jersey Shore,” saying, “I am duty-bound to ensure that taxpayers are not footing a $420,000 bill for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens. "
Hypocrisy personified at MDL Beast Fest: Why are celebrities spreading Saudi propaganda?
Most academic research finds that film subsidies do little to grow local economies. Similarly, recent studies from Georgia’s state auditor found that the economic impact attributed to film subsidies to be “inflated,” and that the state’s program has insufficient controls, leading to improper granting of subsidies.
Meanwhile, the private-sector wastes resources seeking subsidies by lobbying politicians and filming in more expensive places just to qualify. These programs undermine the public’s trust in both government and business leaders.
When one state gets the supposed benefit, others want it, too
Even worse, when one politician offers subsidies, it starts an arms race. As The New York Times reported in 2008, an increase in film subsidies in neighboring Connecticut led one producer to happily comment: “The good news is that Connecticut could spur the New York credit higher. ” That’s exactly what happened.
Not all the news is bad. From 2009 to 2018, 13 states ended their film subsidy programs. Last year, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and a group of state senators suggested the same to fix a budget shortfall. In the end they were unsuccessful, but now Georgia lawmakers are examining a similar idea. And interest is growing in an interstate compact against subsidies that would help all states to mutually disarm.
Movies accessible to everyone: It's time to create an Academy Award for best blockbuster
While politicians may enjoy rubbing elbows with red carpet celebrities, the research makes it clear that film subsidies don’t benefit communities. With or without subsidies, many filmmakers will flock to New York. The city’s iconic skyline and inimitable spirit should be the primary draw for filming decisions, not government handouts.
Until states agree to stop the arms race, the joke’s on taxpayers.

Smith hired as NYT media columnist

Texto completo: His name is so closely associated with BuzzFeed News that his Twitter handle is BuzzFeedBen.
But Ben Smith " who turned a website widely seen as a clickbait factory into an award-winning news operation " will soon leave the editor-in-chief role he has held for eight years to become the next New York Times media columnist.
'I'm eager to get back to reporting and writing, though I have loved editing,' Smith told me in a phone interview. He informed the BuzzFeed staff of his decision in an email Tuesday afternoon.
His departure inevitably raises questions about the financial well-being of BuzzFeed News, where there have been some troubling developments as the company " long a darling of the digital media world " has struggled to return to profitability in recent years.-
About a year ago, 15-percent of the staff was laid off.-And more recently, the departure of Smith's deputy, Shani Hilton, to a high-ranking editing position-at the Los Angeles Times, combined with other high-profile departures, created concern.
But Smith said that one of the reasons he feels comfortable leaving now is that the company and the newsroom are stable. He said he has reason to believe BuzzFeed will be profitable this year.-
'I think we really built this place to last, and it's in a strong position,' he said. BuzzFeed will conduct a wide search for its next top editor and will consider internal and external candidates.
I asked him if he would retain any financial interest in BuzzFeed. 'Not in the long term,' he responded but acknowledged that he is still working out the details of disentangling himself from his longtime employer.
The media columnist job at the Times was most famously occupied by David Carr, who earned many admirers for his swashbuckling, candid approach to a fast-changing arena.-
After Carr's sudden death in 2015, the job went to a first-rate reporter, Jim Rutenberg, who " the Times announced recently " will become a writer at large, allowing him the freedom to move among departments. He has been on leave recently, writing what sounds like an important book about the global growth of disinformation.
Smith is likely to bring, well, buzz to his new position. A Manhattan native, Yale graduate and Brooklyn resident, he is particularly well-connected and well-liked in media and political circles. And he never shies away from the big story. He likes to stir things up.-
He's had some memorable " and some controversial " moments both as reporter and editor.
In 2014, he wrote a shocking story about Uber's plans to go after its critics in the media by gathering disparaging information to smear them, particularly focused on the personal life of a female reporter. Smith had attended a dinner whose participants later said they believed it to be off the record; but Smith said no one told him it was, and he proceeded accordingly.
As editor, he decided to publish the Steele dossier, when traditional outlets " including The Washington Post and the New York Times " held back because they couldn't independently verify its contents. That opened him to plenty of praise for transparency, and criticism (including right here), but he always maintained that it was the right call and handled the criticism with grace.
'When Ben arrived in 2012, there was no news organization here,' Matt Mittenthal, BuzzFeed communications director, told me in an email. But during his tenure, the organization was twice a Pulitzer Prize finalist, an Emmy nominee and the winner of top awards, including the George Polk.
Among the highlights: an investigation into R. Kelly's alleged cult that eventually led to criminal charges; a series on Russian-backed assassinations in Britain; and a searing letter from a Stanford sexual assault victim, read to her attacker in court, which prompted a national conversation on campus sexual assault.
BuzzFeed came under more critical scrutiny (including from both Rutenberg and me) after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's office took the highly unusual step of challenging the accuracy of a BuzzFeed report. It said-that President Trump had directed his fixer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress in 2017 about negotiations the previous year to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, that Mueller possessed documentation of this, and that Cohen had acknowledged those instructions in interviews with Mueller's office.-
Smith continued to stand by the story. And he told me that he wouldn't change how he had handled either that story or the publication of the dossier.
More generally, Smith said that he's proudest of two accomplishments at BuzzFeed News: proving that 'tough, ambitious journalism' cannot only be done on the Internet but that 'it's a superior medium to print'; and fostering journalism about the Internet itself, telling the story of the spread of intentional disinformation, for example, with the viral story about Macedonian teenagers producing faked stories about the 2016 election for profit.
'In 2012, it would have been crazy to think that we'd be competing' with major legacy news organization to cover the biggest stories in the nation and world, he said.
It's going to be more than interesting to see what Smith does in this new role. He won't be boring, that's for certain, and the role is clearly a great fit for him and the Times.
Smith and I have been friendly for several years, and I want to welcome him as a fellow media columnist. We need sharp-eyed critics, daring truth-tellers and clear heads in this increasingly crazy sphere. I'm confident he has all that and more.
