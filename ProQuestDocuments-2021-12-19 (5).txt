Texto completo: Health club giant Planet Fitness has opened its first San Carlos Park gym just in time for those New Year's resolutions.
The franchisee behind the new location aims to continue expanding in south Lee County, with more gyms planned for 2016.
The San Carlos Park Planet Fitness opened Dec. 17 at 18011 U.S. 41 S., near the Constitution Boulevard intersection and in the same shopping plaza as Northern Tool + Equipment and Haney's Cafe. It is just south of an Anytime Fitness and an Around the Clock Fitness, which are also in malls along U.S. 41.
Franchisee Kris Glidden has been operating Planet Fitness locations in Maine since 2006, said Jenn Kamp, who has served as his director of operations for 10 years and is a co-owner of the local gym. Planet Fitness is based in New Hampshire and has more than 1,000 locations in 47 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and Canada.
"Where it's most densely developed is in New England," Kamp said of the brand. "So we really ran out of territory out there but still had a desire to grow, started to look at other options, and we found this area appealing."
Glidden and Kamp's gym is the fourth Planet Fitness in Collier and Lee counties, joining gyms in the Naples, Fort Myers and Cape Coral areas. Those gyms are owned by other franchisees, Kamp said.
Kamp, who has relocated to Florida while Glidden develops gyms in Maine, said they are looking to add another four or five clubs in their Southwest Florida territory in the coming years, with two more by the end of 2016.
The San Carlos Park gym is offering a grand opening rate of $1 down and $10 a month with no commitment through Jan. 14. After that, the startup fee will likely increase and there will be commitment requirements, Kamp said.
Planet Fitness keeps its monthly rate low by focusing on general fitness and eschewing other amenities — there are no basketball or racquetball courts, Jacuzzis, day care or group exercise classes, though they do offer small group instruction.
"We've carved away some of the things that some people need and focus on things that everyone needs," Kamp said. "The things that tend to make memberships more expensive, we've gotten rid of."
Danni Allen, the Season 14 winner of The Biggest Loser, will be in town Jan. 12 for a grand opening celebration and 4:30 p.m. ribbon-cutting. She'll be available to talk about fitness and her experience on the show.
During the grand opening, the gym also will be raffling a 50-inch television, a Planet Fitness cruiser bike, a variety of branded gear, and six-month memberships.

Texto completo:   This year, John Lindgren took a "walk" from Maine to California that included many of the historical sites of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with lessons and challenges.
"My walk changed my life, and my walk was analogous to life," said 65-year-old Lindgren of the Wasatch 2nd Ward, Salt Lake Wasatch Stake, in Cottonwood Heights.
His walk started April 14 at Old Orchard Beach, southwest of Portland, Maine. It ended Aug. 5, 114 days and 3,761 miles later, at Pacific Beach near San Francisco.
"I learned that the most important things in life are my family and friends and to serve and be kind to each other," Lindgren said. "Things came to my mind how I could better serve. I learned so much more about the strength and force of prayers and that there are angels of mercy."
John and Sharron Lindgren, who have been married for 44 years, returned in December 2014 from the Frankfurt Germany Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where they had served young single adults in Nuremberg. With Sharron Lindgren's encouragement and that of their eight children and 25 grandchildren, John Lindgren prepared to depart for his ambitious trek a few months later.
Throughout his life, he has sought challenge and adventure, having climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and Aconcagua, among others. He also is a retired Army Ranger captain.
Lindgren didn't walk for a cause or to raise money, but to fulfill a challenge, to see "America the beautiful, truly the promised land" and "to give his grandchildren courage to do hard things."
He pushed a jogging stroller packed with a tent, a sleeping bag, a pad, supplies, food and water. His smartphone (charged with solar power) provided navigation, communication with his wife and family, and connection to lds.org and Instagram, where he posted a daily selfie and brief comment.
When he started walking through the Northeastern states, the distance to his goal seemed overwhelming. He decided to just focus on that day's task and on what he was accomplishing that day, making the sojourn doable.
"For me, this experience was analogous to life: There are good days and there are bad days," he said. "You just take whatever is dealt and enjoy the moment."
He visited LDS Church history sites along the way, adding 300 miles to his cross-country walk, but they were a major reason for his trek. He went to Joseph Smith's birthplace in Sharon, Vermont, and to Palmyra, New York; Kirtland, Ohio; Nauvoo, Illinois; and Winter Quarters, Nebraska. From there, he followed the Mormon Pioneer Trail to Martin's Cove, Wyoming, where he felt "a very strong spirit," and then on to the Salt Lake Valley. He said he felt a real kinship with the pioneers.
Coming down Emigration Canyon to This Is the Place Monument in the Salt Lake Valley was the climax of his journey, he said. Adding to that joy was the surprise visit of his wife and two of his daughters, Kimberly and Melissa.
He said he found beauty in every area and especially enjoyed the wooded Erie Canal Trail. While walking daily from dawn to dusk, he listened to scriptures, all the LDS general conference talks from 2003 to 2015 and self-improvement books. He also listened to the sounds around him and meditated as well.
"I was grateful every day for little things, such as a cloudy sky, a smooth road, wide shoulders on a road, calm weather, food, water, solitude and silence," he said.
Eighty percent of his nights he slept in the woods or bushes, in a spot he always prayed about. Occasionally, he slept in someone's yard or farm or at a motel. A half-dozen people invited him to sleep in their homes, where he relished home-cooked meals. In one instance, a conversation about Lindgren's walk at a grandson's soccer game in Utah led to an invitation to stay at a man's aunt and uncle's home in Rome, New York.
At first, when people offered him money or food, Lindgren was reluctant to accept. Then he realized that many people back home were praying for his welfare and that these kindnesses were likely answers to those prayers. A 79-year-old widower in Castleton, Vermont, insisted on giving him $100, as did a nurse in Evanston, Wyoming. Others gave smaller amounts, food or drinks, or made encouraging signs. "There are so many good people out there," Lindgren said. His gifts to people were pass-along cards from the LDS Church.
"You're doing what?" was the usual response of the 100-plus people he met along the way. He said there were some days he wondered what he was doing, though he never doubted he could reach the Pacific Ocean.
There were difficulties that he faced along his walk, including weather, animals, equipment and health challenges.
"Wind hitting me in the face was the biggest challenge," he said. "I could easily take sun, rain or heat, but wind gusting in my face was difficult. Yet I was never sick one day. I never had a cold, nor ticks or insect bites. I would hear animals at night but was never bothered, though I had trouble with a few dogs."
Near Casper, Wyoming, an unfenced herd of Black Angus cattle followed him, and he wondered if they might charge him.
Severe blisters developed on his feet early in his walk. In July, he was hit by golf ball-sized hailstones in Nebraska and Nevada. His jogging stroller broke in the middle of Wyoming, necessitating him to haul all his equipment on his back for 15 miles. His daughter Kimberly Runnells arranged to have a new stroller delivered to him. His son Jeremy Lindgren came to his rescue in the Nevada desert with new tire tubes. Sometimes the navigation system misguided him, and at other times, he was in areas that had no service.
The Utah-Nevada desert was the "toughest part," he said, with its long, empty distances between towns for restocking food and water. His wife, children, grandchildren and a few friends met Lindgren at different spots to replenish supplies. (Earlier, he and Sharron had driven through Nevada to cache water every 25 miles.) Plus, seven summits across Nevada taxed a pretty exhausted body, he said. His main safety concern, however, was traffic, particularly in California.
"I do enjoy and treasure the hard things as well as the easy stuff," he said of these challenges.
Because he missed his family so much, he upped his daily mileage from 30-35 miles to 40-45 miles so that he could finish sooner. His family and a number of friends made up a very warm welcoming committee when he flew home the day after wading into the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Jeremy Lindgren asked to keep the jogging stroller as a memento to show his children and others that when they're having hard, difficult days, or when they're out on a mission far away from home and what's comfortable and familiar, that they, too, can do this because their 65-year-old grandfather went through hard, difficult days and never gave up.
Janet Peterson has been friends with the Lindgrens for more than 30 years.

Texto completo:   NO. 1 HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ADOPTS 5-CLASS SYSTEM
Portland schools in the North? Greenville and Forest Hills of Jackman in the South? A Class AA?
Even lifelong Mainers might find a study of the high school basketball Heal point standings confusing eight months after administrators made sweeping changes to the sport's landscape.
Hoping to address competitive balance issues brought on by the state's shifting population, the Maine Principals' Association approved the addition of a fifth class by a 67-29 vote of member schools in late April. Before that, Maine had held championships in four enrollment classes in boys basketball since the 1950s and girls basketball since 1975.
The addition of another class brought about other monumental changes, starting with the two regions who sent representatives to compete for the Gold Ball -- traditionally known as East and West -- being renamed North and South.
The schools with the highest enrollments (825 students and over) were moved to a 16-team Class AA. Enrollment ranges for the four remaining classes -- A, B, C and D -- were narrowed to, in theory, make tournament fields more balanced.
While the changes were in large part made to benefit the state's smallest schools, its affects were far-reaching and crossed over into the regular season. Schools and conferences scrambled to schedule different opponents based on classification and/or geographic proximity. That led to conferences such as the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference, Western Maine Conference and Southwestern Maine Activities Association to reach agreements that allowed for inter-conference games during the regular season (the Mountain Valley Conference, which consists of Class B and C schools from central and western Maine, decided to remain a closed conference). To encourage more inter-class competition, the MPA later reduced the Heal point differential between classes from five points to two.
Some old rivalries -- such as Cony-Gardiner and Lawrence-Winslow -- returned to the hardwood, while others went by the wayside. Potential new rivalries were born.
"That's good for central Maine basketball," said Lawrence boys coach Jason Pellerin. "That's what we grew up with, these rivalries."
When tournament time rolls around, fans who typically enjoy the February feast of high school hoops will have two more tournaments and two more championship games on the menu. The Augusta Civic Center, Bangor's Cross Insurance Center, the Portland Expo and Portland's Cross Insurance Arena will be busier than ever during vacation week. Whether the games are more competitive remains to be seen. But there's no denying one of Maine's great winter traditions will be changed forever.
NO. 2 OAK HILL FOOTBALL WINS THIRD STRAIGHT CLASS D TITLE
It was a dream season for senior Levi Buteau and the Oak Hill football team.
"I dreamed about it last night," Buteau said after the Raiders defeated Maine Central Institute 34-21 for the Class D championship. "I dreamed about it every night this year since ... whenever we started.
"...What made this group of seniors so special was growing up together our whole lives with rec and middle school and high school (football)."
The Raiders raised the Gold Ball for the third straight season this past fall, joining Orono (1979-81 Class C North) and Morse (1970-72 Class B) as the only schools to win three straight outright state football titles since 1970. For players like Buteau and his fellow seniors, though, this one proved to be the sweetest.
Throughout the season, Oak Hill (11-0) faced plenty of tough challenges, yet each time found a way to win and maintain its unblemished record.
In the Class D South semifinals, it was quarterback Dalton Therrien's 34-yard touchdown pass to Connor Nilsson on the opening play of the fourth quarter that helped secure a 13-10 over Winthrop/Monmouth.
The next weekend Oak Hill raced out to a 21-0 lead against Lisbon only to watch the rival Greyhounds come within an extra point kick of tying the contest. That point-after try was botched with 5:18 remaining in the fourth quarter, though, and the Raiders held on for a 21-20 win thanks to some tough running from Therrien late.
A two-year starter at quarterback, Therrien was nearly perfect for the Raiders. This past season he threw for 1,540 yards, 18 touchdowns and four interceptions while rushing for 1,049 yards, 18 touchdowns and one fumble lost. He finished his career as a starting quarterback 22-1 and 40-5 overall, starting at defensive back as a sophomore.
Most importantly, even when he had his missteps, he never lost his cool. He threw three interceptions in the first half against MCI but still found a way to lead his team to a win. He finished with 179 yards and four touchdowns rushing to go along with 243 yards and a score through the air.
"He has a diverse skill set," Oak Hill head coach Stacen Doucette said of Therrien. "He has leadership qualities, selflessness and he's a playmaker. He always has the ability for a home run hit with the pass or with the run."
Therrien was named the 2015 Kennebec Journal Football Player of the Year and a semifinalist for the 45th James J. Fitzpatrick Trophy for his efforts. Teammate Connor Elwell is a semifinalist 2015 Frank J. Gaziano Defensive Linemen Awards.
NO. 3 UNIFIED BASKETBALL DEBUTS IN MAINE
After nearly two years of planning, unified basketball made its debut in Maine on Jan. 24, 2015 when Cony hosted Oceanside.
The unified sport -- which had been available in New England states such as New Hampshire and Rhode Island for several years -- partners special education students (athletes) with regular education students (partners) and uses rules slightly different than the traditional version of the sport.
It was clear from the moment the players hit the court on that first night in Augusta that the sport was bound to be a success.
"It's a great thing that Special Olympics has put together and the MPA came on board," Cony athletic director and unified basketball coach Paul Vachon said after the game. "I think it's going to be something that goes on for a long time."
Those sentiments were not exclusive to Cony, though. Messalonskee, Waterville, Winthrop and Oak Hill were among the local schools that also participated in the sport's first season.
"We've just had a very positive time," Messalonskee athletic director and unified basketball coach Tommy Hill said after a playoff game against Winthrop. "I think both our athletes and our partners have really come together and it's been a positive experience for everyone.
"It's just seeing the faces of the kids when they score the first time and just how excited they are, whether it's a player on your team or the opposition. For some of these kids when they score it's the highlight of their day. It's just priceless."
The first season ended in fittingly thrilling fashion, as Hampden beat Lisbon in the first-ever championship game, 32-30, with a bucket at the buzzer in overtime at Lewiston High School.
NO. 4 RICHMOND SOFTBALL EXTENDS WIN STREAK TO 52 GAMES
As we enter a new year, Richmond softball's streak stands at one win for every week in the year.
The 52-game reign in Class D went on a 10-month hiatus while many of the Bobcats dabbled -- and dominated -- in other sports such as soccer and basketball. In the spring, the team will try to pick up where it left off after graduating just one senior starter, but it will be tough to top 2015.
The Bobcats scored 200 more runs than they gave up while steamrolling through the East-West Conference and Western Maine Class D. Pitcher Meranda Martin followed up a breakout freshman year with a strong sophomore campaign, augmented by freshman Sydney Tilton, who caught Martin when she wasn't pitching the second game of Saturday doubleheaders to give her batterymate a break.
Martin, Tilton, Kelsea Anair, Kelsie Obi and Kalah Patterson led a deep and deadly lineup that scored nearly 14 runs per game. In the playoffs, Richmond trounced Vinalhaven/New Haven, 14-2, and Searsport, 12-0, to win its sixth consecutive regional title.
The state championship had a few more tense moments early, but the Bobcats eventually overwhelmed the Minutemen.
Stearns jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the top of the first, but Martin settled in and the offense took care of the rest for a 9-4 title clincher. The Bobcats became just the second Class D team to win three straight titles, joining 1992-1994 Jonesport-Beals. It was the seventh state championship in coach Rick Coughlin's 29 years coaching the Bobcats.
"They've seen what the teams before have accomplished and they want to equal them or better them," Coughlin said. "The kids come in as freshmen and see this and want to be part of it."
NO. 5 RICHMOND GIRLS SOCCER GETS ITS PAYBACK
The Richmond Bobcats added more hardware to their trophy case this fall and got a little revenge in the process.
With most of their team returning after falling to a young Ashland team in overtime in the 2014 Class D state championship, the Bobcats figured to be in prime position for a rematch. They got it, and shut down the explosive Hornets, 1-0, after a long bus ride to Presque Isle.
The state title -- the 10th of coach Troy Kendrick's career -- featured one of his most complete teams. The defense -- with a new goalie in Sydney Tilton -- posted 13 shutouts and gave up six goals. The offense -- led by Kelsea Anair, Meranda Martin and Autumn Acord -- scored 98 goals.
The Bobcats finished 13-1 in the regular season, with their only loss a 3-2 decision at Class C powerhouse Sacopee Valley. They didn't allow a single goal in the tournament, blanking Searsport and Rangeley to win their sixth straight regional title,
Martin's goal 10 minutes into the second half was all the Bobcats needed to end Ashland's 35-game winning streak.
"At the beginning of the season Coach Kendrick harped on us: 'What's Ashland doing right now? They're practicing right now. They're probably running right now. Most of their players do cross country so we got to get running.'" Martin told the Kennebec Journal after the game. "Most of us sighed but it definitely paid off."
NO. 6 FORMER CONY TRACK COACH TAYLOR HARMON DIES
It was not all great in 2015, as the state lost a legend in former Cony indoor track and field coach and mentor to countless student-athletes Taylor Harmon in October. He was 70.
"Taylor gave a lot of himself. He is irreplaceable," Cony athletic director Paul Vachon told the Kennebec Journal's Bill Stewart shortly after Harmon's passing. "No one will be able to replace him and all that he did."
Many of Harmon's former athletes shared similar sentiments about the coach. Cony graduate Luke Fontaine, who went on to run at the University of Miami, recalled how initially he wanted to be a sprinter but switched to distance running at Harmon's urging.
"That's how I started off," said Fontaine, "but it's not how I finished. Taylor told me I was a distance runner. He said I should get into distance running, so I did. I'm glad I listened. He had such a huge influence on my life. I'll never forget Taylor."
When he wasn't coaching, Harmon often volunteered to run meets or races across central Maine, and beyond. Mt. Blue coach Kelley Cullenberg fondly remembers interacting with Harmon at these meets.
"I have known him for years and we always had a relationship in which he would tease the heck out of me," she said. "As soon as I got on site for whatever meet it was, he would be ready with some kind of sarcastic comment that he could get on my case about -- with a smile on his face, of course. I got to a point when I dished it right back to him. We had a lot of fun giving each other a hard time.
"At these meets, if you didn't know him, you could hear him and go 'Wow, who is that guy?' He's going to be missed. He touched the lives of so many people."
NO. 7 MESSALONSKEE SOFTBALL WINS STATE TITLE IN DRAMATIC FASHION
Memories of Messalonskee's first state softball title in 10 years will start with the sound of the ball leaving Kristy Prelgovisk's bat in the first inning of the championship game against Scarborough.
"I heard the noise, and I knew," Prelgovisk said. "I've hit a couple of those before, and you hear that same noise and you know it's going to go over."
The solo home run at Cony Family Field was the Eagles' only hit of the game. It was also the game's only run, as Kirsten Pelletier's mastery in the circle (two hits, three walks, 12 strikeouts) meant nothing but zeros in the run column for the Red Storm, who had won the state title in every odd-numbered year since 2007.
"You can load the bases with no outs and she'll find a way to get three outs for us," Messalonskee coach Leo Bouchard said of Pelletier. "She becomes more determined, more focused and more aggressive on the mound when there's a lot of pressure."
With Pelletier, Prelgovisk and MollyAn Killingbeck leading the way, Messalonskee had high hopes entering the 2015 season -- even though Prelgovisk and Killingbeck were the only seniors.
But the Eagles played with poise beyond their years and earned the top seed in Eastern A with a 13-3 mark. A shutout over Mt. Ararat and one-run wins over Edward Little and Bangor in the regional tournament stoked their confidence to pull off the upset over the previously unbeaten Red Storm, who averaged 10.5 runs per game.
NO. 8 MESSALONSKEE HOCKEY WINS BACK-TO-BACK STATE TITLES
New coach, no problem.
Joe Hague, a Messalonskee graduate in his own right, took over as head coach for Mike Latendresse and the Eagles did not miss a beat. Armed with a talented roster led by the high-scoring first line of Jake Dexter, Jared Cunningham and Brandon Nale, the Eagle's only loss of the season came in an early regular season contest against Class A Bangor.
More often than not, the Eagles had their way with the opposition when they stepped on the ice, yet that could not have been further from the case in the Class B championship against Gorham. Messalonskee found itself in unfamiliar territory in that game and faced a 2-1 deficit heading into the final period.
It was then, though, that the Eagles' top line was at its best. Dexter, Cunningham and Nale combined to score six goals in the final period and seal Messalonskee's second consecutive state championship with a resounding 7-2 victory.
"It means a lot. Coming off a 21-0 run (last season) and coming out here and repeating is a great feeling," Cunningham said after the game. "I was getting a little frustrated but you have to work through some problems and just keep going, keep grinding.
"...It's an amazing feeling and a great group of guys. We came together as a family, and we just wanted to come out here and we wanted to prove ourselves. Everyone said we were losing a lot and we wouldn't be as good, but we just came out here and proved everyone wrong."
No. 9 PETER DEL GALLO SHAKES OFF INJURY, WINS STATE TITLE
Peter Del Gallo was looking at as much as two years away from the mat if he had surgery on a torn left elbow.
Remarkably, the elbow, which he injured at a preseason clinic at Princeton University, healed on its own. And Del Gallo quickly set his sights on a third state wrestling title.
Despite returning to competition just three weeks before the regular season ended, the Gardiner junior accomplished his mission and then some. He wrestled just six matches prior to the Western B regional tournament, yet breezed through the regional and state championships at 126 pounds, even earning Most Outstanding Wrestler honors at the state tournament.
Gardiner coach Matt Hanley said the original plan was for Del Gallo to rest the elbow and call it a season after states. But the 2013 New England champion wanted to compete in the New England qualifier and return to New Englands. He was runner-up at both.
NO. 10 MESSALONSKEE GIRLS LACROSSE WINS EASTERN A TITLE
Girls lacrosse has crowned regional champions every year since 1998, but never had that title traveled further north of Topsham -- until this past spring.
When Messalonskee defeated Portland 11-8 at Thomas College in Waterville it became the northern most regional champion in the history of girls lacrosse in Maine.
Almost exclusively, regional and state champions in the sport have come from Portland or the surrounding area. The Brunswick boys and girls have broken through a few times, while the Mt. Ararat girls (2010) and Lewiston boys (2006) have won regional titles. Yet for the most part, school's like Scarborough, Cape Elizabeth, Cheverus, Waynflete, Yarmouth and North Yarmouth Academy have been dominant.

Texto completo:   NO. 1 HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ADOPTS 5-CLASS SYSTEM
Portland schools in the North? Greenville and Forest Hills of Jackman in the South? A Class AA?
Even lifelong Mainers might find a study of the high school basketball Heal point standings confusing eight months after administrators made sweeping changes to the sport's landscape.
Hoping to address competitive balance issues brought on by the state's shifting population, the Maine Principals' Association approved the addition of a fifth class by a 67-29 vote of member schools in late April. Before that, Maine had held championships in four enrollment classes in boys basketball since the 1950s and girls basketball since 1975.
The addition of another class brought about other monumental changes, starting with the two regions who sent representatives to compete for the Gold Ball -- traditionally known as East and West -- being renamed North and South.
The schools with the highest enrollments (825 students and over) were moved to a 16-team Class AA. Enrollment ranges for the four remaining classes -- A, B, C and D -- were narrowed to, in theory, make tournament fields more balanced.
While the changes were in large part made to benefit the state's smallest schools, its affects were far-reaching and crossed over into the regular season. Schools and conferences scrambled to schedule different opponents based on classification and/or geographic proximity. That led to conferences such as the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference, Western Maine Conference and Southwestern Maine Activities Association to reach agreements that allowed for inter-conference games during the regular season (the Mountain Valley Conference, which consists of Class B and C schools from central and western Maine, decided to remain a closed conference). To encourage more inter-class competition, the MPA later reduced the Heal point differential between classes from five points to two.
Some old rivalries -- such as Cony-Gardiner and Lawrence-Winslow -- returned to the hardwood, while others went by the wayside. Potential new rivalries were born.
"That's good for central Maine basketball," said Lawrence boys coach Jason Pellerin. "That's what we grew up with, these rivalries."
When tournament time rolls around, fans who typically enjoy the February feast of high school hoops will have two more tournaments and two more championship games on the menu. The Augusta Civic Center, Bangor's Cross Insurance Center, the Portland Expo and Portland's Cross Insurance Arena will be busier than ever during vacation week. Whether the games are more competitive remains to be seen. But there's no denying one of Maine's great winter traditions will be changed forever.
NO. 2 LAWRENCE GIRLS
BASKETBALL WINS
CLASS A CHAMPIONSHIP
Trailing Thornton Academy by six points at halftime of the Class A state championship game, the Lawrence High School girls basketball team played arguably their best half of the season for the 50-43 win and the team's first state title since 1994.
"We stuck to our game plan, and we didn't panic," Lawrence coach John Donato said after the game.
Nia Irving, who later in the year committed to play her college basketball at Boston University, led the Bulldogs with 27 points in the championship game, while Domi Lewis scored nine of her 12 points in the fourth quarter.
In the days following the title, the Bulldogs and the Gold Ball toured the school district's elementary schools, beginning with a stop in Albion.
"It's so nice we could bring this to the community," senior Paige Belanger said.
NO. 3 WINSLOW
FOOTBALL WINS 2ND
STRAIGHT STATE TITLE
In 2015, no high school football team in Maine was as dominant in its class as Winslow High School.
The Black Raiders capped a second consecutive undefeated season with a 24-10 win over Yarmouth to earn the Class C state title once again. Winslow's undefeated streak now sits at 22 games, the longest current win streak in the state.
Winslow scored 491 points while allowing just 64. The Black Raiders posted seven shutouts in 11 games. Winslow forced four Yarmouth turnovers in the second half of the state championship game, including a 34-yard interception return for a touchdown by senior defensive back Trenton Bouchard.
Senior guard Alec Clark was selected as a semifinalist for the Gaziano Trophy, awarded each year to the top senior offensive and defensive linemen in the state.
NO. 4 SKOWHEGAN
FIELD HOCKEY WINS
CLASS A TITLE
Wasn't this supposed to be the rare down year for the Skowhegan Area High School field hockey team?
Nope. Instead, the Indians continued their dominance of Maine high school field hockey, beating Thornton Academy 3-1 for their 13th title in the last 15 years.
With a roster full of inexperienced underclassmen, Skowhegan was expected to yield the Northern Maine Class A crown to a veteran Messalonskee team this season. Messalonskee beat Skowhegan twice in the regular season to cement its status as the regional favorite. In the regional final at Thomas College, however, Skowhegan pulled off a 2-1 overtime win over the Eagles, winning when freshman Lizzy York scored with 14.4 seconds left in the extra period.
Senior goalkeeper Leah Kruse was outstanding all season, but may have played her best in the postseason. Kruse made 11 saves in the regional final win over Messalonskee.
NO. 5 THE DEATHS OF
LOCAL SPORTS PIONEERS
DICK MCGEE AND
HAROLD "TANK" VIOLETTE
Central Maine lost two of the most influential men in its sports history in 2015 with the deaths of Dick McGee and Harold Violette. McGee died in February at age 84, while Violette died in August at age 77.
A longtime football coach and athletic director at Colby College, McGee was a founder of Fairfield's youth sports program, the Police Athletic League. McGee was involved with the group from its beginning in 1959 until 2013, when his health no longer permitted his participation. McGee oversaw the organization as it grew to include more and more sports and girls programs. PAL now serves more than 1,400 children.
"Dick could convince anybody about anything because he was very sincere and he was truthful and he did it all for the kids," longtime Fairfield businessman Harold Joseph said.
Violette coached football, ice hockey and wrestling at Winslow High School.
Violette coached football at Winslow from 1969 to 1984, winning 113 games and state championships in 1973, 1976 and 1982. He also won state titles coaching at Belfast in 1967 and 1968 before returning to Winslow.
Violette help found Winslow's ice hockey team and coached the Black Raiders to six state title.
"Coach Violette, he was my mentor. He was a father figure to not only myself, but to anyone who played for him," said Wes Littlefield, who played football for Violette at Winslow and is now an assistant coach with the team.
Both McGee and Violette are in the Maine Sports Hall of Fame.
NO. 6 UNIFIED
BASKETBALL DEBUTS
IN MAINE
After nearly two years of planning, unified basketball made its debut in Maine on Jan. 24, 2015 when Cony hosted Oceanside.
The unified sport -- which had been available in New England states such as New Hampshire and Rhode Island for several years -- partners special education students (athletes) with regular education students (partners) and uses rules slightly different than the traditional version of the sport.
It was clear from the moment the players hit the court on that first night in Augusta that the sport was bound to be a success.
"It's a great thing that Special Olympics has put together and the MPA came on board," Cony athletic director and unified basketball coach Paul Vachon said after the game. "I think it's going to be something that goes on for a long time."
Those sentiments were not exclusive to Cony, though. Messalonskee, Waterville, Winthrop and Oak Hill were among the local schools that also participated in the sport's first season.
"We've just had a very positive time," Messalonskee athletic director and unified basketball coach Tommy Hill said after a playoff game against Winthrop. "I think both our athletes and our partners have really come together and it's been a positive experience for everyone.
"It's just seeing the faces of the kids when they score the first time and just how excited they are, whether it's a player on your team or the opposition. For some of these kids when they score it's the highlight of their day. It's just priceless."
The first season ended in fittingly thrilling fashion, as Hampden beat Lisbon in the first-ever championship game, 32-30, with a bucket at the buzzer in overtime at Lewiston High School.
NO. 7 MESSALONSKEE
SOFTBALL WINS
STATE TITLE IN
DRAMATIC FASHION
Memories of Messalonskee's first state softball title in 10 years will start with the sound of the ball leaving Kristy Prelgovisk's bat in the first inning of the championship game against Scarborough.
"I heard the noise, and I knew," Prelgovisk said. "I've hit a couple of those before, and you hear that same noise and you know it's going to go over."
The solo home run at Cony Family Field was the Eagles' only hit of the game. It was also the game's only run, as Kirsten Pelletier's mastery in the circle (two hits, three walks, 12 strikeouts) meant nothing but zeros in the run column for the Red Storm, who had won the state title in every odd-numbered year since 2007.
"You can load the bases with no outs and she'll find a way to get three outs for us," Messalonskee coach Leo Bouchard said of Pelletier. "She becomes more determined, more focused and more aggressive on the mound when there's a lot of pressure."
With Pelletier, Prelgovisk and MollyAn Killingbeck leading the way, Messalonskee had high hopes entering the 2015 season -- even though Prelgovisk and Killingbeck were the only seniors.
But the Eagles played with poise beyond their years and earned the top seed in Eastern A with a 13-3 mark. A shutout over Mt. Ararat and one-run wins over Edward Little and Bangor in the regional tournament stoked their confidence to pull off the upset over the previously unbeaten Red Storm, who averaged 10.5 runs per game.
NO. 8 MESSALONSKEE
HOCKEY WINS
BACK-TO-BACK
STATE TITLES
New coach, no problem.
Joe Hague, a Messalonskee graduate in his own right, took over as head coach for Mike Latendresse and the Eagles did not miss a beat. Armed with a talented roster led by the high-scoring first line of Jake Dexter, Jared Cunningham and Brandon Nale, the Eagle's only loss of the season came in an early regular season contest against Class A Bangor.
More often than not, the Eagles had their way with the opposition when they stepped on the ice, yet that could not have been further from the case in the Class B championship against Gorham. Messalonskee found itself in unfamiliar territory in that game and faced a 2-1 deficit heading into the final period.
It was then, though, that the Eagles' top line was at its best. Dexter, Cunningham and Nale combined to score six goals in the final period and seal Messalonskee's second consecutive state championship with a resounding 7-2 victory.
"It means a lot. Coming off a 21-0 run (last season) and coming out here and repeating is a great feeling," Cunningham said after the game. "I was getting a little frustrated but you have to work through some problems and just keep going, keep grinding.
"...It's an amazing feeling and a great group of guys. We came together as a family, and we just wanted to come out here and we wanted to prove ourselves. Everyone said we were losing a lot and we wouldn't be as good, but we just came out here and proved everyone wrong."
NO. 9 WATERVILLE GIRLS TRACK AND FIELD
WINS INDOOR, OUTDOOR
STATE TITLES
The Waterville Senior High School girls track and field team continued to be one of the most dominant programs in the state, winning the indoor state title in February and the outdoor championship in June.
The indoor title was the fifth consecutive for the Purple Panthers, who scored 74.83 points to earn the championship. Senior Sarah Shoulta won championships in the pole vault and 55 hurdles, while Kellie Bolduc won the triple jump for the Panthers.
Waterville's outdoor title was its ninth straight championship. The Panthers scored 118.25 to comfortably beat second place York's 87 points.
Shoulta won the 100 and 300 hurdles, while Bolduc won the triple jump. Lauren Brown won the 3,200 for the Panthers and Alison Linscott was champion in the high jump.
NO. 10 MESSALONSKEE
GIRLS LACROSSE WINS
EASTERN A TITLE
Girls lacrosse has crowned regional champions every year since 1998, but never had that title traveled further north of Topsham -- until this past spring.
When Messalonskee defeated Portland 11-8 at Thomas College in Waterville it became the northern most regional champion in the history of girls lacrosse in Maine.
Almost exclusively, regional and state champions in the sport have come from Portland or the surrounding area. The Brunswick boys and girls have broken through a few times, while the Mt. Ararat girls (2010) and Lewiston boys (2006) have won regional titles. Yet for the most part, school's like Scarborough, Cape Elizabeth, Cheverus, Waynflete, Yarmouth and North Yarmouth Academy have been dominant.
In 2015 the Eagles showed lacrosse can thrive central Maine, though, and they did so in honorable fashion. Among the many ways they remembered their teammate, Cassidy Charette, who died in October of 2014, was by wearing a patch on their jerseys with her initials woven into an infinity symbol.
Though the Eagles ultimately fell short to Marshwood, 13-5, in the Class A championship, they continue to "play like it's your last," as coach Ashley Pullen often reminded her team and honored their fallen teammate's legacy.

Texto completo:   MANCHESTER At times, you would have sworn the University of New Hampshire was skating against a high school team Wednesday night. That's how easy UNH made things look during its 7-0 victory over the University of Maine at Verizon Wireless Arena.
The Wildcats scored three goals in each of the first two periods and breezed from there to extend their winning streak to four games. UNH is unbeaten in its last six outings (5-0-1).
Freshman right wing Ara Nazarian, freshman right wing Marcus Vela, senior left wing Dan Correale, senior right wing Maxim Gaudreault, sophomore center Michael McNicholas, senior center Kyle Smith and sophomore left wing Jason Salvaggio provided the UNH goals. The McNicholas goal was the first of his collegiate career.
Correale's goal came during a UNH power play and was his 13th goal of the season. He also scored two power-play goals in UNH's 5-4 triumph over Maine on Tuesday night in Portland. The Wildcats (8-6-4) entered the contest with the nation's No. 4 power play (27.2 percent). UNH scored two goals in its six power-play opportunities. Salvaggio also scored while Maine was short-handed.
Danny Tirone made 18 saves and recorded his first shutout of the season.
It was UNH's third victory in four games against Maine (4-11-4) this season. All four games were played in December.
UNH received a productive first shift from its third line, which scored twice in a 15-second span to hand the Wildcats a 2-0 lead. Nazarian opened the scoring 1:55 into the game, and Vela doubled the lead at 2:10.
Nazarian's goal was his fourth of the season, and his third in the last four games.
Correale's power-play goal came at 19:28 of the first, when he tipped Gaudreault's shot from the point past Matt Morris to make it 3-0.
The Wildcats received second-period goals from Gaudreault (1:56), McNicholas (7:10) and Smith (12:40) and led 6-0 entering the final 20 minutes. Sean Romeo replaced Morris in the Maine net following UNH's fifth goal. Morris saved 11 of 16 shots.
Salvaggio's power-play goal capped the scoring with 2:53 to play.
.
UNH will play a non-conference game at Vermont on Saturday night (7:05). ... UNH has scored at least one power-play goal in 16 of its 18 games this season. ... UNH center Andrew Poturalski entered the contest averaging two points per game (17 goals and 17 assists in 17 games), but didn't have a goal or an assist. ... Gaudreault collected two assists in the victory. ... Maine began the night averaging 1.94 goals per game (35 goals in 18 games) ... Wednesday's announced attendance was 5,734.

UNH has embarrassment of riches offensively in rout of Maine

While the offense was flying around, the UNH defense in front of goalie Danny Tirone shut down the Maine attack, allowing only 21 shots, all of which the sophomore stopped for his first shutout of the season.

Texto completo:   MANCHESTER - It'd be hard to imagine 2015 ending any better than it did for the University of New Hampshire men's hockey team.
Now it's up to the Wildcats to make 2016 look the same way.
UNH headed into the new year in stunningly sweet fashion, embarrassing archrival Maine, 7-0, at the Verizon Wireless Arena on Wednesday night.
It was the fourth straight win for the Wildcats (8-6-4), who also upped their undefeated streak to six games. It was also their third win in four contests against the Black Bears (4-11-4), marking the end of a season series that saw the teams play back-and-forth games until the final chapter.
"That doesn't happen too often, with UNH and Maine games," Coach Dick Umile said of Wednesday's result. "The team looked good. ... (Tuesday) night (a 5-4 win), four times we let them back in the game. We came out tonight and played a solid game, right from the start."
The Wildcats attacked the Black Bears with full force from the start, netting the game's first two goals only 15 seconds apart. The freshman-laden third line generated both, getting the first when Marcus Vela carried the puck into the right corner and zipped a pass along the goal line to Ara Nazarian, who knocked it home from the left side of the crease at 1:55 of the opening period.
UNH's next trip into the Maine end was just as successful, with Nazarian and Vela leading a 2-on-1 rush. Nazarian passed through the slot to Vela, who sniped a shot from the right circle that beat Matt Morris (11 saves) at 2:10.
The Wildcats had a final goal in store for the first period. UNH drew a penalty and Matias Cleland passed through the slot from the left point to the right side to Dan Correale, who deflected the puck in four seconds into the man advantage and with 32 seconds left in the first.
"That was huge," Umile said. "And the third goal was important, because we did that last night, going up by two, and we wanted to make sure we didn't let them back in.
"That was good to get the two quick ones, but the third one was 'Here we go.' "
UNH buried the Black Bears in the second. Outworking Maine down low, Kyle Smith and Jamie Hill both had shots from right in front of the crease, and Maxim Gaudreault eventually got his rebound try to go to make it 4-0 at 18:04.
UNH's fourth line got in on the action at 12:50 of the second, as the rebound of Frankie Cefalu's shot from in front of the net deflected right to Michael McNicholas, who had a tough angle but nevertheless beat Morris for his first career goal and a 5-0 lead.
Maine gave its embattled goalie a break after the fifth goal, but the onslaught continued against replacement Sean Romeo. Goal No. 6 came at 7:20 of the second, the chance starting when Gaudreault flipped the puck at Romeo while skating by. The sophomore netminder tried to cover it up, but couldn't smother it before Smith followed up to poke it by for yet another score.
UNH made it 7-0 when Jason Salvaggio knocked home a rebound on the power play at 17:07 of the third.
"We wanted to really bear down," Gaudreault said. "The forecheck, if we put pressure on their defense, we can play defense by playing offense."
The outcome could have been worse. UNH had four odd-man rushes, including a Tyler Kelleher breakaway, that didn't net goals.
"I thought our transition game was very, very good, right from the start," Umile said. "I really liked the way we played; this was the first time we played 60 minutes in a long time. And it's not just because of the score, I just thought that's how we played all night."
While the offense was flying around, the UNH defense in front of goalie Danny Tirone shut down the Maine attack, allowing only 21 shots, all of which the sophomore stopped for his first shutout of the season.
"It was important for us. Big game, non-conference. We've been struggling non-conference, so it's good to get some wins there," said Tirone, who made a pair of fine saves to preserve the shutout in the final minutes. "Just really big for momentum. We've been doing pretty well lately here."
The upcoming picture for UNH is a good news/bad news scenario. The good news is that Tirone is correct. The Wildcats are on their longest winning streak of the season, and they're averaging more than four goals per game over the past six games. With Tirone settling into a groove and the defense finally playing the fundamentally sound style Umile has craved since October, the Wildcats are succeeding in their own end, as well.
The bad news is that the Maine games are done for this season, and a UNH bunch that's feeling good about itself will have to find a way to stay hot against a looming slate littered with Hockey East powers UMass Lowell, Providence and Boston College.
"I think we've got a lot of confidence in ourselves right now," Gaudreault said. "We've got to continue to focus on the details. That's the biggest key for us. Defensively, we can't let up and cut corners.
"We've just got to carry that momentum going into the second half here. We know we've got a hard schedule ahead within Hockey East, so we've got to keep it going."

Texto completo:   Freshman guard Stephanie Watts' 3-pointer at the buzzer gave the University of North Carolina a 59-58 women's basketball victory over the University of Maine at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on Wednesday afternoon.
The Black Bears (9-6) had erased a 15-point first-half deficit and a 13-point second-half disadvantage to take a 58-56 lead with 5.7 seconds remaining on a Sigi Koizar basket.
Under a rule implemented by the NCAA this season, UNC (10-5) inbounded the ball from the frontcourt instead of the backcourt.
Maine's Chantel Charles forced a tie-up with 2.1 seconds remaining, but the possession arrow belonged to UNC. Watts inbounded along the end line near the Maine basket to Xylina McDaniel at the top of the key and McDaniel immediately gave her a return pass in the corner. Watts was wide open and buried her 3-pointer.
"We didn't execute very well," said Maine coach Richard Barron. "They do two things out of that set: One is a lob (into the post) and the other is going back to the inbounder. We had fouls to give so we were supposed to foul on the catch (from the inbounds pass).
"But (Watts) still had to make a difficult shot at the buzzer. She's awfully good," added Barron.
Watts said she noticed that, "they weren't guarding me on the out-of-bounds (pass) and that's a play we run a lot when they don't. I looked at coach (Sylvia) Hatchell and asked if that's what we should do. She was like 'Yeah, go for it' basically, so we ran it."
Hatchell explained that the Black Bears were double-teaming McDaniel and "whenever a team plays zone or (double-teams) like that, the most open person is the one throwing the ball in. (Watts) tapped it to (McDaniel), went behind the three and (McDaniel) threw it to her. We've done that five of six times this year."
It was UNC's fourth straight win.
Watts finished with 18 points for the winners. She also had six rebounds and three assists.
N'Dea Bryant and Hillary Summers scored 10 points apiece and Summers had a game-high 11 rebounds. Bryant grabbed six rebounds.
Destinee Walker contributed nine points and four assists and Jamie Cherry had five assists to go with five points.
Junior guard Koizar wound up with 21 points and seven assists, both game-highs, and she also hauled down eight rebounds to lead the Black Bears.
"(Koizar) was tough, she was really tough," said Hatchell, who called Maine a "very good team."
Sophie Weckstrom had 18 points on a career-high six 3-pointers.
Mikaela Gustafsson had 10 points and 10 rebounds for her first career double-double and added four assists. Liz Wood chipped in with seven points and six rebounds. Bella Swan corralled seven rebounds.
The Black Bears trailed 45-32 early in the second half but rallied behind Koizar and Weckstrom, who each had six points during a 15-2 run spanning the third and fourth quarters to tie it 47-47 with 5:26 left.
The teams swapped points until Koizar's conventional three-point play gave Maine a 54-53 lead with 49 seconds remaining. She then hit two free throws 30 seconds later to expand the lead to 56-53.
Watts' 3-pointer tied it with 15 seconds left but Koizar drove the lane to give Maine its 58-56 lead.
Barron and Weckstrom said Watts' buzzer-beater wasn't the only decisive moment in the game.
"We played well to get the lead but not well enough to have a bigger lead," said Barron. "We missed a lot of easy shots. We missed six uncontested layups."
"If we hadn't missed those layups early in the game, we wouldn't have been in that situation at the end," said Weckstrom.
Barron said his team didn't play well in the first and third quarters, managing just 18 points combined.
"We weren't aggressive. We didn't move the ball quick enough. When we stand around dribbling the ball and taking the air out of it, we're easy to guard," said Barron.
But Barron and Weckstrom noted that there were plenty of positives as they move into America East play on Wednesday night at Vermont.
"This will give us a lot of confidence going into our conference games," Weckstrom said.
"Maybe a heart-breaking loss like this will have a big impact on our team and they'll learn a lesson from it," said Barron. "Our kids are very good at analyzing a game so the next step for our program is to (play well) from the beginning of the game."

Resumen: Other popular options include a sensor that automatically corrects steering if the vehicle strays out of its travel lane, adaptive cruise control that brakes automatically to maintain a set distance between vehicles and a transparent display that appears on the driver-side windshield, as on a teleprompter, to keep track of travel directions, speed limits and other vital information without the driver having to glance at various instrumentation. According to Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles statistics, 950,580 people held a Maine Class C driving license in 2014.

Texto completo:   Especially in a rural state like Maine, a valid driver's licence is key to independent living and taking part in routine activities, such as getting to medical appointments and haircuts, shopping for groceries and visiting with friends and family. While older drivers and their families fret about losing that independence as driving skills diminish with age, car manufacturers are busy developing technologies that can make it safer for Mainers to stay on the road well into their 70s, 80s and even longer.
"Permanently giving up the keys can have severe consequences for the health and mental well-being of older adults," Peter Kissinger, president and CEO of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, said in a recent news release. "New technologies and a focus on safe driving can help seniors remain behind the wheel for years to come."
Based on recent research, the AAA Foundation identified six new safety technologies -- three aimed at improving parking -- as providing "high value for older adults" by reducing the risk of crashes and improving driver comfort.
-- Forward collision warning with mitigation. This feature detects an impending collision with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal or other object in the road and automatically applies the brakes.
-- Automatic crash notification. Emergency notification systems, such as OnStar, use built-in sensors and call-button features to connect with a live responder in the event of a collision, illness or other problem.
-- Navigation assistance. GPS technology provides a map display and voiced directions, boosting driver confidence and reducing anxiety and confusion.
-- Parking assistance with camera display. Cameras provide clear vision in every direction, lessening the chance of hitting an adjacent vehicle or other object while parking.
-- Cross-traffic warning. Sensors alert driver to oncoming traffic when backing out of a parking space.
-- Semi-autonomous parking assistance. This technology takes over steering and braking while moving the vehicle into a parallel or perpendicular parking space.
From padded dashboards, lap belts and power steering to airbags, cruise control and back-up beepers, car safety features have evolved steadily over the years, according to Jim Prescott, general sales manager at the Darling's Honda Nissan Volvo dealership in Bangor.
And, he noted, consumers have met many of those developments with skepticism. But with time and refinement, he said, these and other features have been widely accepted.
"Initially there were concerns that the car was somehow running itself. Now drivers expect these features. Cruise control is as standard these days as air conditioning and power steering," he said. And, he added, newer technologies already are attracting forward-looking buyers, including older drivers and their safety-minded families.
In addition to the AAA Foundation's list, Prescott said older drivers are very accepting of "blind spot" technology that detects another car approaching in a passing lane and flashes a small warning light on the side-view mirror.
Other popular options include a sensor that automatically corrects steering if the vehicle strays out of its travel lane, adaptive cruise control that brakes automatically to maintain a set distance between vehicles and a transparent display that appears on the driver-side windshield, as on a teleprompter, to keep track of travel directions, speed limits and other vital information without the driver having to glance at various instrumentation.
These new safety technologies are not inexpensive, Prescott acknowledged -- a fully loaded Volvo sport utility vehicle on his lot runs upward of $68,000. But similar features are available on many less pricey vehicle makes, he said, including Hondas, Subarus and Fords.
Changes you can make yourself
"Staying in your own home and living independently as you age is 100 percent tied to your ability to drive," said Susan Poole, a 73-year-old volunteer from Holden who teaches a one-day course in safe driving techniques for AARP Maine. In addition to brushing up their on-road skills, participants age 55 and older typically earn a discount off their car insurance. Poole's course costs $15 for AARP members, $20 for nonmembers and is offered through the Eastern Area Agency on Aging in Bangor.
According to Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles statistics, 950,580 people held a Maine Class C driving license in 2014. Of these, 125,705 were 70 years old or older -- 56,192 men and 69,513 women. Older drivers live in every part of the state, but rural areas are likely to have a higher percentage of older drivers than urban areas.
Maine law requires that drivers have a vision test on the first license renewal after turning 40 years of age, at every second renewal after 40 and at every renewal after turning 62. Other than that, older drivers are subject to a complex set of provisions related to specific medical, emotional and cognitive disorders that apply to drivers of all ages. Review of an individual driver's competency can be triggered by reporting from a medical professional, a law enforcement agency or a concerned citizen and is conducted by a medical advisory board within the bureau of motor vehicles.
Poole said there is no surefire way to predict at what age an individual's driving skills will begin to deteriorate. But older drivers often make voluntary changes in their driving behaviors, she said, such as avoiding driving at night, in bad weather, in unfamiliar areas, in heavy traffic and on the highway. Other practical strategies include keeping more distance between vehicles to allow for slower reaction times and being extra disciplined about using lights and turn signals.
Poole said new vehicle safety technologies can seem daunting to older drivers, but she reminds her students that they have adapted to many changes over time.
"When we were 16, there were no turn signals: You rolled down the window and signaled with your arm," she said. "There were no seat belts, no sideview mirrors, no pushbuttons to roll down a window, no little interior levers to open the gas cap or release the trunk latch.
"These [new safety features] will help you drive more safely and comfortably," she said. "The trick is to find the ones you want to pay for. And then, don't leave the dealership without learning to use them."

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Faced with living free or dying, New Hampshire has apparently overtaken Maine as the most populous state in northern New England after more than two centuries as the Pine Tree State's little sister.
The latest census figures estimated New Hampshire had about 1,280 more people than Maine, the first time in 215 years that New Hampshire topped the Pine Tree State, according to historical census figures.
Concord Monitor writer David Brooks noted the milestone in a blog post earlier this week.
Maine's population trend has for years been negative, with more deaths than births in recent years. A net gain of international immigrants has been the primary bulwark against that decline, as a net migration loss to other states has cut into Maine's population total, too.
Maine was one of seven states with an estimated drop in population from 2014 to 2015.
The latest estimates putting New Hampshire's population ahead of Maine's come with a margin of error, meaning Maine could still have the lead. But even if later revisions show Maine remaining the most populous state in northern New England, trends indicate it won't hold the title for long.
Since 1900, New Hampshire has recorded more steady increases in population than Maine (with the exceptions of 1910, 1920 and 1940).
Maine began to fall behind New Hampshire's population after the 1950s. From 1890 to 1950, both states grew at similar rates. But by 2015, Maine had grown just 45 percent from 1890 while New Hampshire logged a 150 percent increase since the end of the 19th century.
Measured against the rest of the country, New Hampshire and Maine's growth since then has been dwarfed by southern and western states.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Maine Legislature will return to Augusta on Wednesday for the 2016 session, and many of the battle lines have been drawn in headlines during the past three months.
Those major issues include legislative leaders' $4.8 million plan to fight Maine's drug crisis, whether to reauthorize voter-approved conservation bonds and an uphill effort to expand Medicaid over the objections of Gov. Paul LePage, who has vetoed proposals to do so five times.
However, some important issues to be considered in 2016 have flown under the radar of some Maine political observers. Legislators will consider axing Common Core educational standards, allowing a casino in southern Maine and making other structural governmental changes.
An interesting coalition of conservatives and educational interests want to kill Common Core, highlighting a priority shift since the start of the LePage era.
What a difference five years makes.
In 2011, LePage, a Republican, made Maine the 42nd state to adopt Common Core standards, a state-by-state initiative to establish consistent math and language arts standards, and his first education commissioner, Stephen Bowen, left in 2013 to work for a national group that helps state implement them.
But in 2013, LePage disavowed support for Common Core, a possible reflection of growing animosity toward it from conservative activists pushing a return to state and local standards. The National Education Association, a teachers union, has criticized its implementation.
A national movement between tea party-type activists and the liberal unions led to a bid in Maine Legislature to repeal the standards in 2015. It failed, but Rep. William Tuell, R-East Machias, got a similar bill past a panel of legislative leaders for consideration in 2016.
Tuell's bill would repeal and replace Common Core standards by 2017, and it's being supported by the Maine Education Association. While the demise of a similar bill in 2015 may not bode well, the Legislature dumped assessments developed by a consortium of states earlier in 2015, so the timing could be right.
Another bill would allow a casino in southern Maine, coinciding with a petition drive to hand the rights to a casino in York County to a controversial figure.
Legislators will again consider a bill sponsored by Rep. Wayne Parry, R-Arundel, last session that would allow for a casino in either Cumberland or York counties and use some of the revenue to lower income taxes.
Expanding gaming in Maine has been a hard sell in recent years: There are just two casinos -- in Bangor and Oxford -- and opponents of the bill in 2015, including LePage, said a new one could erode their business.
That bill passed a preliminary vote in the House, but it failed in the Senate and was sent back to a committee. Another bill that would have established a tribal casino in Aroostook County failed, so the climate may not be right for more gaming establishments in Maine.
Parry's bill coincides with a proposal asking voters to approve a York County casino on the 2016 ballot. However, that effectively would limit the license to one person, according to the Portland Press Herald: Controversial Las Vegas developer Shawn Scott.
He bought the Bangor Raceway, then bankrolled a 2003 referendum to allow slot machines there and at Scarborough Downs, then sold his operation to the developer of Hollywood Casino, after which Scarborough Downs sued him for allegedly undermining local support for slots there.
Even if it doesn't pass, that context makes Parry's bill all the more worth watching.
Creation of a public defender system and government contract reform will be considered.
Another proposed structural change -- this time from LePage -- would create a public defender system in Maine, which is the only state not to have one.
It would give a new public defender the authority to contract with lawyers throughout the state to defend indigent clients, replacing the current system, which pays lawyers an hourly rate to defend them.
LePage has said it could save money and serve clients better, but some lawyers have expressed concern about the changes.
Rep. Barry Hobbins, D-Saco, who co-chairs the Legislature's Judiciary Committee, told MPBN in September that while a defender system may be too bureaucratic, the state could use a hybrid system that contracts with certain lawyers, such as in Somerset County. His committee will consider it in 2016.
A bill from Sen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, would give preference for state contracts to Maine companies whose bids are within 5 percent of the lowest bid by a similarly qualified out-of-state company. It passed the panel of leaders in a 9-1 vote, indicating strong support.

Texto completo:   HAMPDEN, Maine -- You might not know Carolyn Hopkins' name or face, but if you've traveled almost anywhere by plane, train or subway, you have heard her cheerful, clear voice telling you what to do and where to go.
Hopkins, who lives in Hampden, has recorded public address announcements heard in travel hubs all over the world, including John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, the New York subway and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. She is the English-speaking voice of the Paris Metro, the Incheon International Airport in South Korea and Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
And the list goes on.
"It is not easy, either in subways or in airports," she said. "I'm trying to be a help to people while they're traveling. I'm trying to make it a little easier, and a little more friendly."
Her well-known voice has brought the 67-year-old Hopkins a fair amount of fame in recent years. She's been written about in The New York Times, heard on National Public Radio and was even named one of the 500 most important people in history in the December 2015 Mental Floss Magazine. Hopkins is No. 349.
"I think it's quite bizarre," the unassuming, quick-to-laugh woman, who originally was from Louisville, Kentucky, said. "I wonder who it was who picked me?"
By all appearances, fame has not gone to Hopkins' head. She and her husband, the Rev. Marion Hopkins, moved to Hampden in 2002. She does her audio work in her home studio, where she also is her own sound engineer. There, she records the announcements using her best nondescript Midwestern accent.
"That is the industry standard," Hopkins said. "Though I have been picking up some Maine here and there. I have to watch it!"
She first became interested in voices and radio as a little girl.
"I got into it because my father had a magnificent, deep voice," she said. "I loved to listen to it, so I liked doing that kind of thing. I would practice. I would create radio programs, with intros and segues. I did voices. It was a lot of fun."
Her childhood hobby eventually led her to radio work in Louisville, where she wrote jingles, did commercials and whatever else needed to get done.
"In radio in the 1970s, we tried anything," Hopkins said, laughing. "At least once."
Her voice ability and work ethic landed her a job at Allen-Martin Productions in Louisville, a full-service audio company. Hardy Martin, one of the owners, was an electronics whiz, she said, and in the early 1980s became a digital recording pioneer.
He tapped Hopkins, whose voice has tones in it that carry well, to record announcements for stadiums and amusement parks.
"They said, can you do a Disney-like voice -- very sexy and thoughtful and friendly," she recalled, adding she gave her best shot for a recording destined for Walt Disney's Typhoon Lagoon water park. "It worked."
As digital recording caught on, so did Hopkins' voice, which is now heard in 200 airports around the world -- more destinations, she said, than she will ever get to visit. She records snippets of information that advise travelers about connecting flights, about what to do in case of an emergency and more. Computers connect the audio takes into announcements that are broadcast to travelers.
"It's all a big jigsaw puzzle," Hopkins said of the process.
Being the English-speaking voice of transportation around the world definitely has its humorous moments, she said. Once, in Louisville, she was coming home late and found herself stuck on the moving walkway at the airport behind a fellow traveler who would not budge. Her voice came on the public address system, asking travelers to move over so others could pass. She started duplicating the announcement, so the man had Hopkins in stereo asking him to move over. It didn't work.
"I threw my hands up," she said, adding she figured the man was having a bad day.
She also gets calls periodically from friends who are happy to hear a familiar voice when far from home.
"'I heard you in Cleveland! I heard you in Detroit!'" Hopkins said. "I lead an interesting life."

Texto completo:   ROCKLAND, Maine -- An effort is underway to create a memorial for people lost at sea.
Jen Chapman of Thomaston has organized a gathering for Sunday for people interested in seeing such a project move forward.
"Recent events of the ship El Faro has brought to light that there is no Lost At Sea Memorial for the midcoast Maine community. There is nothing where family members can engrave a person's name who was lost at sea, to honor, immortalize and visit to remember their lost loved ones," Chapman said on a Facebook page she created for the memorial effort.
Four Maine residents, including two with Rockland ties, lost their lives when the cargo ship El Faro sank Oct. 1 near the Bahamas.
On Thursday, Chapman said she spoke with an artist who provided her with a sketch of the proposed memorial.
Chapman said she wants to show the city of Rockland that there is support for the effort. If the memorial were placed on city property, it would need the approval of the City Council.
"I need to show the city of Rockland that we as a community, we as a fishing community support this project. I need your help. I need a sea of faces to come and say you support this project," Chapman said.
The organizational meeting is scheduled for noon Sunday at the Trackside restaurant at the intersection of Union and Pleasant streets.
She said donations will not be solicited at the meeting, but she expects fundraising will start in the spring.
"I'm excited to be part of the generation who will get this monument created," Chapman said Thursday.
The memorial proposed by Chapman includes a 7-foot tall rough granite monument of a man, dressed in foul weather fishing gear, throwing a life ring.
Her plan includes placing large solid pieces of smooth, polished granite where the names of those lost at sea will be engraved.
She said the monument would be a gift to Rockland with the condition that it is placed at Buoy Park, overlooking the bay, the breakwater and the sunrise.

Texto completo:   What's next?
In regard to the Dec. 17 Bangor Daily News story, "Belfast council renames Columbus holiday Indigenous Peoples Day," having lived in Maine for 75 years, I am no longer surprised when the out-of-staters come to Maine to "give back" by running for office in order to change how we do things here. But I was shocked to learn that it only took 250 petitioners and four city councilors to abolish Columbus Day.
I am sure that Columbus and his men did terrible things to the natives, but you cannot compare the times then and now. You can't change history, folks. What is next for this band of do-gooders, abolish Presidents' Day because George Washington owned slaves? And the Fourth of July, shouldn't we all go back to the Old World and let the Native Americans have the whole country? After all, they were here first.

Ideology over common sense
I am writing because of my concern about the Maine Department of Transportation favoring an out-of-state private contractor over Maine government workers for maintenance of the Casco Bay Bridge.
As a retired government worker, who witnessed downsizing of the government workforce in favor of private contractors, my experience confirms that privatization does not necessarily save money or improve services.
Private contractors often have a stronger bargaining position than government workers and are subject to less rigorous oversight. In fact, in many areas there is evidence that privatization results in increased costs and decreased services.
As a Maine resident, I think there is sufficient evidence that this is one of many decisions by our current administration that are driven more by commitment to ideology than by concerns with well-being, safety, efficiency, fiscal responsibility or common sense.

Setting the record straight
In a letter to the editor published on Nov. 17, I incorrectly wrote that Rep. Lawrence Lockman broke his pledge to abide by the Maine Council of Churches' Covenant on Civil Discourse when he described a Lewiston mayoral candidate on social media as anti-Christian. In truth, the candidate is a well-respected and devout Episcopalian.
I erred by saying Lockman broke his pledge. Actually, he never signed the Covenant in 2014 when he was a candidate for the Legislature. I misread the list on the council's website of candidates who had signed the Covenant, which requires candidates, among other things, "to value honesty, truth and civility."
I recently discovered the mistake inadvertently and felt it was important to set the record straight.

Preservation of the world
There were two items in the BDN on Dec. 30 supporting the national park -- one a letter from Susan C. Jones and the other an OpEd. I would like to carry their thoughts one step further and quote Henry David Thoreau: "The west of which I speak is but another name for the Wild, and what I have been preparing to say is, that in Wildness is the preservation of the world. Every tree sends it fibers forth in search of the Wild. The cities import it at any price. Men plow and sail for it. From the forest and wilderness come the tonics and barks which brace mankind."

Safe connection
Staying connected on your cellphone, in the world we live in today, is a great thing.
However, staying connected while driving or walking could cause you serious injury or even
death.
I was prompted to write this letter because someone walked in front of my vehicle while I
was leaving my parking space, and that person was on her cellphone, unaware of her surroundings.
You may have a smartphone, but it is not very smart to make choices that put you or others in danger. So, please, stay connected in a safe way. It is not the end of the world if you can't talk on your cellphone while you're driving or walking, but it might just be the end of your world if you do.
Take control of your life and don't let your cellphone control you!

Moral compass in combat
The fact that women can successfully implement the duties associated with combat at the same level of expertise as men is understood, especially within the milieu of technological advances. Additionally, the legal tags attached to equal responsibility and military obligations is duly noted throughout.
However, despite these attachments to contemporary service, it seems sad and incongruous that the gender responsible for birth, raising populations from nursing to independence, and serving as the moral compass for our society is being asked to kill.
The spiritual and moral instruction of any killing notwithstanding, the role of women as purveyors for life being asked to join in the fray begs a disclaimer preceding the initiation of carnage.
If those entrusted with the very essence of life are being asked to take away from which they have given, then how do we answer our children who ask where their mothers have gone and what they are doing in their absence?
It speaks ominously for us on different levels within our society that all share in the obligation of carnage, not the least of which is the search for explanations regarding the future of all of our aspirations and what roads we select to pursue them on.

Texto completo:   Support our local police
I have a sign in my front yard that reads "I support local police."
I was listening to the news about the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, and I was impressed by the response of the local police there. This got me thinking about our local police in Bucksport and how they are our neighbors, their kids go to our local schools, they pay property taxes to our town and, quite often, we'll run into them at the local grocery, hardware or drug stores.
And if terrorists were to attack Bucksport, our local police would become our first line of defense and it could cost them their lives as they defend us.
Why wait for a tragedy to show our support? Support our local police now.

No workers or no jobs?
According to a Dec. 18 Bangor Daily News editorial, Maine lacks educated workers. Business owners claim that a "lack of qualified candidates" is the "most common reason" jobs go unfilled. We've heard this many times before. It may well be true.
On the other hand, we've been told over and over (sometimes in BDN editorials) that Maine graduates are leaving the state in droves because there are no jobs for educated people. I don't know which problem we have, but holding contradictory thoughts probably won't solve it.
Ron Logan
Orono
Stand with the Penobscot Nation
I am disheartened and frankly angry about federal Judge George Singal's ruling against the Penobscot Nation over its claim to the eponymous river. The ethic of preservation and mutual enjoyment of that waterway -- which the state argued it is protecting -- is central to the Penobscots' way of life.
Attorney General Janet Mills has pursued this classification change without clearly stating on whose behalf this territorial reduction is being pushed. If the question is which group would best preserve and protect the river, the Penobscot Nation, with its reservation including islands in the river, has the strongest interest in maintaining the Penobscot River's vitality and balance as its ancestral homeland and sustenance food source.
This ruling and Mills' actions betray the best interests of this watershed and its people. Removing territory from indigenous people is a practice that should be stopped. This action furthers a confrontational posture with the Penobscot Nation that is both inappropriate and oppressive.
Please join me and many others in holding Mills to account and supporting our friends and neighbors, in the spirit of peace and unity this holiday season and year-round.
I'll end with a few words from Dawnland Environmental Defense's Facebook page: "Citizens of the state need to pressure their government; Penobscots cannot be responsible for leading this charge after 195 years of territorial theft and losses at the hands of state government, we need your help. Do what you can, where you can."

Whither the new Chase Smith, Muskie?
The season of giving this year has been marked instead by fear mongering, blaming the victims, talk of wall building, closing borders, racism and religious prejudice.
I am not worrying about Syrian refugees or welfare recipients playing the lottery. Instead, I worry about climate change, mass shootings at malls, schools and Planned Parenthood clinics.
I worry about the proliferation of American hate groups, food insecurity and welfare cuts, inappropriate drug and mental health services.
I also worry about the attempt to gut the Land for Maine's Future and other environmental programs.
Where is this generation's Margaret Chase Smith or Ed Muskie?

Texto completo:   FORT KENT, Maine -- The University of Maine at Fort Kent said its biomass plant received 50 tons of wood pellets from Northeast Pellets of Ashland as of Dec. 31 via the university's contractor, days after the mill said it was cutting production in part because of a drop in orders for the UMFK boiler.
Northeast Pellets announced Dec. 28 it was reducing operations from five to three days a week along with hours for the 13 full-time employees, amid warmer weather, low heating oil prices and the favorable Canadian currency exchange rate.
"It's not the kind of trifecta you want," said Matt Bell, founder and president of Northeast, the state's first pellet manufacturer.
Pellet sales have been slow this heating season, and some pellet makers around the country may have an oversupply currently, Bell said. The University of Maine at Fort Kent, through its supplier Daigle Oil Company, accounted for 15 percent of Northeast Pellets' annual production last heating season, Bell said, adding that the mill recently expanded its storage system in anticipation of continuing demand.
UMFK's two-year fuel contract for a biomass plant shared with the local school district requires two sources of wood pellets, and since Northeast Pellets is the only manufacturer in Aroostook County, Daigle said it has an account with a Canadian company.
Bell said he thinks the biomass plant has been using Canadian pellets and capitalizing on the strong U.S. dollar, because it has not taken much from Northeast this season except for the recent 50 ton shipment.
UMFK interim President John Murphy said the biomass plant hasn't been used as much this season as it has in the past.
"Consumption of wood pellets at the University of Maine at Fort Kent is down considerably this heating season because of the warmer weather, some planned maintenance to our pellet storage at the sports center, and because of our contractual obligations for heating oil consumption," Murphy said.
Carter Vaillancourt, a manager with Daigle, said that the company isn't necessarily benefiting from the favorable Canadian exchange rate and that its purchasing processes haven't changed.
"The pellet supply pricing was fixed at the beginning of the contract period in 2014," Vaillancourt said in an email. "Therefore, no currency exchange rate fluctuations were involved over the period of time of the contract."
In June 2013, UMFK and the Maine School Administrative District 27 built a $4 million biomass plant with a $2.7 million federal grant at the site of the former Fort Kent Armory to provide heat and hot water to the UMFK and high school campuses.
"With this project, UMFK will complete the conversion of the entire campus from foreign oil to local biomass alternative" said then-UMFK President Wilson Hess.
Almost 10 years after Northeast Pellets started production, the business of the biomass fuel may be getting harder overall and growing more competitive, said William Strauss, the president of FutureMetrics, a pellet research firm.
Until recently, wood pellets have been cheaper than heating oil. But with oil at between $1.65 to $2 per gallon, wood pellets aren't really cost-effective at their current prices, Strauss said.
"It's a problem that hasn't occurred in Maine for a long-time," he said. "Most of those pellet producers haven't experienced a drop in demand."
Last winter, Mainers had trouble getting enough pellets, and this year, some may have stocked up early -- only to let them sit and instead heat with cheap oil, Strauss said.
"We've got all these garages with 4-to-6 tons of pellets in them," which people can save until oil prices rise, he said.
If Maine's four pellet makers "want to keep the wheels turning, they may have to lower their prices," Strauss said. The question is how much they lower their prices while still being sustainable as a business.
Strauss said he thinks that lower oil prices could be a benefit to pellet makers if they can get savings from the lower diesel prices, which can account for half the costs of wood.
"The cost of getting that wood should be less, so that means their input costs should be going down -- or maybe it's not and somebody else is getting a windfall," Strauss said.
Bell, who also serves as vice president of the Maine Pellet Fuels Association, said that wood fiber costs have not come down.
Strauss said he also sees consolidation coming for the U.S. pellet industry, which is made up of many small manufacturers serving local markets who all are experiencing pressure to lower prices.
In October, Geneva Wood Fuels of Strong was acquired by Idaho-based Lignetics Inc., the country's largest wood pellet maker and owned by Taglich Private Equity.
"I think come spring we may see more of this activity," Strauss said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- The terrible toll that drug addiction is taking on Maine was encapsulated on Oct. 16, the day two men -- both age 25 -- died of overdoses in Portland, adding their names to the growing list of drug deaths in 2015.
These deaths came two months after Maine Attorney General Janet Mills had already warned that overdoses during the first half of 2015 were tracking to surpass the state's record of 208 deaths, just set in 2014.
Then, this past Thursday, Mills announced "the state is on pace to reach between 230 and 250 overdose deaths this year" based on drug fatalities during the first nine months of 2015.
Heroin and fentanyl are increasingly named as a cause of death in drug overdoses, Tim Feeley, spokesman for the attorney general's office, said in a joint statement released with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Heroin is often diluted, or cut, with fentanyl, the most potent opioid available, which is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin.
Between January and September 2015, deaths attributable to drug overdoses stood at 174. Of those 71, or 41 percent, were caused by heroin and 54, or 31 percent, were caused by fentanyl or acetyl fentanyl, Feeley said. In 74 percent of all the cases, multiple drugs were listed as a cause of death, he said.
The numbers paint a dire picture of Maine's opioid crisis, officials said. Mills, in her statement, said, the drug problem "seems to have the attention of everyone but the users."
"In recent days the police have taken major actions to disrupt the supply of heroin and other opiates into our state and to protect our citizenry from those who would sell it," she said. "We can and must do more."
"We must also begin the long effort of curbing the demand for these deadly substances by educating people of the dangers and supporting people in recovery from addiction," she said.
Both Portland police Chief Michael Sauschuck and Bangor police Chief Mark Hathaway say a three-pronged approach -- education, enforcement and treatment -- is needed to tackle drug addiction in Maine.
"We need a solution," Hathaway told Bangor's Community Health Leadership Board earlier this week about the creation of a 10-bed social detox center. "And this is a very good solution."
Hathaway said most of Bangor's crime is related to drug abuse and addiction.
Bangor law enforcement and community partners are working to establish a law enforcement-assisted jail diversion program for people with substance abuse problems who also break the law. Portland started working on a similar diversion program in August.
The programs would allow law enforcement officers to divert people arrested for low-level drug-related offenses into community-based services, instead of sending them to jail. Hathaway said the program is designed to get people off drugs and put them on the path to recovery.
Diverted prescription pills are still a problem, Feeley said. A total of 113 of the 174 overdose deaths involved at least one pharmaceutical drug and 111 involved at least one illicit drug, with around 29 percent caused by a combination of prescription and illicit drugs, he said.
Painkilling opioids prescribed by doctors, sometimes in combination with other opioids, led to 70 deaths, Feeley said.
"This office is encouraging all departments to have Naloxone available, though it is more frequently employed by EMTs and hospital ER staff," Mills wrote in an email, referring to the drug that helps revive overdose victims. "We had figures from last year that showed EMT responses to apparent ODs tripled over the year before."
Mills also issued a letter to Maine doctors and the Maine Pharmacy Association asking them to be aware of narcotic drug abuse warnings, "and we are preparing some PSAs [public service announcement] on heroin and opioid abuse to go up on TV and hopefully social media in the near future," Mills said.

Resumen: Bill Stuart Gov. Paul LePage doesn't want to expand Medicaid medical coverage but then he refuses to implement screening and preventive programs to preclude or lessen the cost and suffering.

Texto completo:   Editorial, " LePage says Medicaid expansion will blow the budget: Here's how he's blurring the facts":
Many working Mainers who have paid taxes all their adult lives are falling through the cracks due to Gov. Paul LePage.
They do not qualify for MaineCare because of him and still do not qualify for a hardship exemption, leaving them without any health insurance. They work all their lives and this is how they're treated in Maine.
-- Eibhlihin
An astute governor would know that we cannot afford to not expand Medicaid, but Gov. Paul LePage is driven by resentment and negative perceptions of people.
-- Bill Stuart
Gov. Paul LePage doesn't want to expand Medicaid medical coverage but then he refuses to implement screening and preventive programs to preclude or lessen the cost and suffering. No wonder our emergency rooms are overwhelmed and our critical access hospitals are financially strapped.
I guess our governor doesn't believe that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." With inane policies such as that, Maine will continue to have fewer and fewer young families, see students leave as soon as possible after graduation and be unable to attract new industries.
-- seekpeak
Gov. Paul LePage is blurring the facts again? Geez, what's new?
-- highpeaksman
There is nothing insidious about proposing legislation. Gov. Paul LePage wasn't elected emperor -- he needs to work with the Legislature to get his agenda passed. That didn't work out so well last session, did it?
-- Ed Simmons
This is all the BDN has to bash Gov. Paul LePage at the end the year? The same old recycled trash from last winter, spring and summer. Pretty disappointing. I guess the made-up criminal charges and stories on House Speaker Mark Eves' rescinded employment offer at Good Will-Hinckley took the winds out of the sails. They can make up some more stuff, though, so look on the bright side.
-- Kaliss
We're sending our tax dollars to the federal government and it is dispensing them to other states. Wouldn't it be prudent to get some of those dollars to come back to Maine? We're paying into the system, and getting nothing back is the real waste.
-- mooselake
For the record, the federal dollars versus state dollars argument can best be described as coming from the left pocket instead of the right pocket. At the end of the day, it's my tax dollars that are being spent, not money from the good fairies in Washington, D.C., or Augusta. Wake up, people.
-- Robert Reed
The answer is easy -- raise taxes on the 1 percent. It's no longer a budget buster, but then there's the issue of our governor.
-- John_VoIP
Let's call Gov. Paul LePage's views what they really are -- lies.
-- vhiwater
The fact that Republican Sens. Roger Katz and Tom Saviello are sponsoring the bill sort of negates the whole premise that Medicaid expansion is a partisan move.
-- seamus37
Maybe it would be better if the federal government didn't dispense those dollars to prop up Obamacare because it's going to fall apart shortly anyway.
-- hophead3
Maine already receives $1.58 from the federal government for every dollar paid in. Not a very good investment for the U.S. government, even using the Democrats' math.
-- TheRightWay
Ah, so Maine is not a good investment? Thanks to LePage and Co., maybe so.
-- Gopher63
The BDN got this one right.

Texto completo:   UNITY, Maine -- Three years ago, Nancy Rosalie's dear friend was dying and was unsure of what she wanted to have happen to her body after she died.
The woman, a farmer, originally wanted to be cremated but did some research and decided that option ultimately wasn't for her.
"Some of us knew that home burials were possible, so I suggested it to her," Rosalie of Unity said. "'You know, you can be buried on your farm.' She said she would like that.'"
And so that is what happened. The woman died, and her friends made her a simple pine coffin and buried her in it in a patch of land on the farm.
"It was so meaningful and personal," Rosalie said of the burial. "One of the most meaningful parts was that after placing the coffin in the grave, we passed shovels around. There was something rather cathartic about that that I think helped people in the grieving process and also helped them gain better perspective on the cycle of death and life."
Green, or natural, burials such as that one simply make sense to the Unity homesteader and to a growing number of other people in Maine and elsewhere. In the Pine Tree State, there are two privately run "green" cemeteries: the Rainbow's End Natural Cemetery in Orrington, overlooking the Penobscot River, and Cedar Brook Burial Ground, set amid the forests of Limington.
Now a couple of Waldo County women are working to locate a place for a green cemetery in their area, and several people in Belfast are wondering whether their city would be a good place for the state's first municipally run green cemetery. Alison Rector of Monroe and Helen Sahadi of Thorndike said they want to make the option of green burials available to more people.
"Bury me the old fashioned way," Sahadi, who runs Heavenly Socks yarn in Belfast, said. "That's exactly what a lot of people would like."
According to the Green Burial Council, the California-based nonprofit organization working to encourage environmentally sustainable death care, green burials were common practice long ago but the modern green burial movement is relatively new. A green burial is one that incorporates environmentally sustainable practices, doesn't try to inhibit decomposition and doesn't introduce toxic elements into the environment.
Such burials would prohibit the use of an outer burial container or vault, prohibit toxic chemicals used in embalming and include any burial container made of a sustainable material, such as paper, fabric or wood. They also can be much less expensive than a traditional funeral, which has an average cost of $7,000, Rector said.
"It just seems like a much more respectful way of going about things," Rosalie, a member of the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Maine, said. "I like the idea of a green cemetery. It allows that important recycling of nutrients. It's also a place set aside for people to reflect on those cycles, whereas my friend's burial ground is not very accessible. I think that rather than having a lot of little home burial plots on every farm, [it would be better] to consolidate them into a cemetery that is set aside and can be a place for people to reflect on their loved ones and their life and their death and also a place that is beautiful and not detrimental to the earth, as other cemeteries are."
Sahadi did a survey of all the cemeteries in Waldo County that have available plots. She found that while several communities said there was no possibility of a green cemetery in their towns, officials in Belfast and Monroe said they would consider it.
"People brought the idea of green cemeteries to me right after I was elected to the Belfast City Council [in Nov. 2014]," Belfast Councilor Neal Harkness said. "There's all these [burial] alternatives now. I think the days of only traditional cemeteries may be coming to an end, and here's another alternative. I'm very supportive."
Councilors talked about the idea -- though took no action on it -- at a regular meeting in mid-December. Cemetery Superintendent Steve Boguen told city officials then that there is not adequate room for a green cemetery at any of Belfast's existing cemeteries. Several councilors wondered whether Belfast may be able to use a different piece of city-owned land for such a cemetery. Harkness also wondered whether a private landowner may decide to use his or her own property for a green cemetery as a commercial enterprise. Boguen also told the council that burial trends in Belfast have changed a lot in recent decades. The council has asked for more information and is expected to revisit the topic in the future.
"We're at approximately 90 percent cremations now," he said. "It used to be 90 percent the other way when I started in 1979, 1980."
Belfast City Councilor Mike Hurley told the BDN he expects the aging of the baby boomer generation to change funeral practices even more.
"People have a right to do what they want to do, and probably a significant portion of people would want to do something like this," he said. "I think for sure this is going to be something on our radar. We'll just keep working on it."
Rector, an active volunteer with the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Maine, said she has started to check out natural burial areas while traveling. Some look like meadows and others have a more traditional appearance, including simple stone markers. She feels a green cemetery would fit right in for Waldo County.
"In Waldo County, we have a fair number of back-to-the-landers and people who are growing their own food," she said. "For them, it's not such a weird thought. I think it would be wonderful for Waldo County to be a leader in this. If Belfast or one of the other towns decided to do this, it would be the first municipal green cemetery in the state."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A Winterport man pleaded guilty to escape from federal custody during a hearing Wednesday in U.S. District Court.
Brandon Caparotta, 24, of Winterport had six weeks left to serve when he was arrested Nov. 23 by federal marshals at a townhouse complex on Griffin Road in Bangor after he escaped from the Northern Maine Regional Re-Entry Center, a contracted correctional facility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, according to court records and published reports.
At that time, Caparotta was completing a 4 1/2 year prison sentence for two felony firearm offenses.
After arriving at the facility in late September 2015, Caparotta was told he could not leave the facility without permission, he had to keep the facility advised of his whereabouts while on a work pass, he could not leave a work site without permission and he had to return to the facility after work hours.
On Sept. 22, Caparotta received a work pass but failed to return. The investigation revealed Caparotta left his work site early that day and did not have permission to be at the Griffin Road complex.
Caparotta was one of four men convicted in connection with the theft of guns from a licensed firearms dealer in Orrington five years ago.
Caparotta was sentenced June 7, 2011, in federal court in Bangor to 4 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to one count each of theft of firearms and possession of stolen firearms, according to a previously published report. He began serving his sentence the following month.
On Sept. 30, Caparotta was transferred from the federal correction center in Pollock, Louisiana, to the Northern Maine Regional Re-entry Center in Bangor, located on the campus of the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center, according to court documents. He was due to be released Jan. 5, 2016.
Caparotta was working at a Dunkin' Donuts on Nov. 22 but failed to return by 7 p.m. as required. When a safety officer at the re-entry center spoke with Caparotta's supervisor at the coffee shop, he said Caparotta had walked off the job about 1 p.m. that day, court documents said.
The supervisor also said Caparotta had asked him to say Caparotta was at work when the U.S. Office of Probation and Pretrial Services called to verify whether he was at work. The supervisor refused to lie.
Caparotta was arrested the next day in the parking lot of an apartment complex on Griffin Road in Bangor, according to court documents.
If convicted of the new escape charge, Caparotta could be sent back to federal prison for up to five years and fined up to $250,000.
Caparotta faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He will be sentenced after completion of a presentence report by the U.S. Probation Office.
The investigation that led to Caparotta's guilty plea was conducted by the U.S. Marshals Service.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine's papermakers in 2015 received many of the biggest payments from a program that gives tax breaks for equipment and facilities.
The state has allowed businesses to recover property taxes paid on certain equipment and facilities put in service roughly between 1995 and 2007. About 1,400 companies tapped that reimbursement program in the last year. Among the top were papermakers such as Verso, Lincoln Paper and Tissue and Sappi.
The state makes the payments through the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement program, or BETR (pronounced "better"). Payments from BETR totalled about $33.3 million, or around 1 percent of the state's annual budget, during the state's fiscal year ended June 2015.
Those payments for the state's 2015 fiscal year went out to reimburse companies for equipment they had in operation during the 2013 calendar year, with some of the largest reimbursements going to paper companies, some of which stopped operating this year.
Of the total reimbursed against 2013 property taxes, about 10 percent went to companies owned by Verso Paper Corp., controlled by Apollo Global Management.
Other major recipients of reimbursements include the parent company of paper maker Sappi, Poland Spring owner Nestle, Hannaford owner Delhaize and National Semiconductor owner Texas Instruments and Bath Iron Works owner General Dynamics.
Those aren't the only tax breaks received from the state, but those under the BETR program are the only ones disclosed individually. For some companies, Bath Iron Works in particular, the state's annual report discloses other incentives, including the at least $3 million-per-year shipbuilding facility credit that the company can claim for 20 years. That credit started in 1997.
As a condition of that credit, the company has to report its annual investments, which it listed as $389 million through 2014, when it invested another $30.5 million in facility improvements.
A new model
In recent years, the state has shifted away from the reimbursement model for such business equipment incentives, preferring local exemptions for the equipment.
The difference is that a business benefits from the exemption immediately, rather than having to pay the local tax and then file for a reimbursement check from the state in a later year. The shift has contributed to a steady decline in major recipients for the BETR program.
The total going to companies receiving $1,000 or more in reimbursements has decreased in recent years.
The Legislature's reduction in reimbursement rates also contributed to that decline during the past two years, dropping to 90 percent and then 80 percent in 2014. The full reimbursement will be available to companies in the budget approved for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.
The shift away from a reimbursement model for those tax breaks has many implications, which came to the forefront in budget talks during the last legislative session, when Gov. Paul LePage's initial budget proposed transitioning companies using the BETR program to the exemption program, called BETE.
The change stood to lower tax revenue for municipalities, raising opposition from many communities, including Bangor, which has about 300 businesses with property that is reimbursed under the BETR program, according to legislative testimony earlier this year by Bangor assessor Philip Drew.
The city collects about $1.7 million in taxes from that property, which is then reimbursed in full or in part (the rate declines after 12 years of exemptions). Under the exemption program, the state reimburses municipalities for 50 percent of the revenue they don't collect, meaning the current revenue on any property in the BETR program would have been cut in half.
For disclosure, the shift to BETE means one other thing: property tax breaks will not need to be individually disclosed by business.
Since the BETR checks are cut by the state, the Department of Economic and Community Development and Maine Revenue Services discloses that all in one place. That will continue until all of qualifying property is out of commission.
But disclosures of exempt property under the BETE program likely won't be as detailed. New accounting rules that take effect in fiscal year 2017 require municipalities to report tax abatements with economic development goals by program, but don't require disclosure by recipient.

It looks like there are more homeless veterans in Maine. But the numbers don't tell the whole story

Resumen: [...]a closer look at the numbers actually shows a recent decline in the number of homeless veterans once service providers began trying more aggressively to identify them and connect them with programs and housing vouchers. "In Portland, we have two outreach workers in the community aggressively engaging veterans who might be camping out and not taking advantage of services," Allen said, adding that another outreach worker has been deployed to the Midcoast area, persistently posting fliers for homeless veterans at soup kitchens, post offices and libraries.

Texto completo:   At first glance, statistics on thenumber of veterans in Maine who are homeless seem to point to a troubling trend.
From 2008 to 2015, the number of homeless identified as veterans jumped 70 percent in Maine, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which annually organizes a census of the country's homeless populations on one night.
The actual numbers are low compared with bigger states:There were 89 homeless veterans in Maine in 2008, and 151 this year. But that spike still contrasts with asmaller overall veteran population here in Maine, as well as adrop in the number of homeless veterans across the country, as highlighted in a recent Pew Charitable Trusts report.
But those who work with homeless veterans in Greater Portland -- which has the largest share of the state's homeless population -- say it's likely their efforts to identify and help these people that are responsible for the increase. In other words, we've probably counted more homeless veterans over the longer term because we're doing a better job of finding them, they say.
And a closer look at the numbers actually shows a recent decline in the number of homeless veterans once service providers began trying more aggressively to identify them and connect them with programs and housing vouchers.
"What we have seen specifically in the last four years is more systematic and broad outreach taking place funded through programs like the VA's [Support Services for Veterans Families] program," said Phil Allen, who heads Veterans Housing Services for Portland homeless service provider Preble Street. "What that translates to is finding more veterans. ... Now we are getting more self-engaged veterans, veterans who are coming to us, either through providers or by their own [volition], saying 'I saw a flier.'"
Eighteen months ago, President Barack Obama set a deadline of the end of 2015 for local governments around the country to find a home for all homeless veterans who want one. The majority of states -- 33, by Pew's count -- have made significant statistical progress toward that goal. So against that backdrop, Maine's increase stands out.
[Want to end homelessness? Try giving the homeless homes]
But a closer look at the figures suggests there's some truth to what Allen is saying. Although veterans make up a higher percentage of the state's overall homeless population -- 6.4 percent -- than at any point in at least a decade, the overall number of homeless veterans in Maine is actually on a three-year decline.
Advocates counted 164 in 2013 -- which is around the time that more aggressive outreach efforts would likely have begun moving the needle -- and that number has fallen each year since. In 2014, the number fell to 152, then by a tiny increment to 151 this year.
"In Portland, we have two outreach workers in the community aggressively engaging veterans who might be camping out and not taking advantage of services," Allen said, adding that another outreach worker has been deployed to the Midcoast area, persistently posting fliers for homeless veterans at soup kitchens, post offices and libraries.
In contrast, states with bigger cities and larger populations have had more staff and resources to identify homeless veterans over the years and connect them with resources.
California, New York and Texas, for example, are among the states showing huge gains in getting homeless veterans off the streets, according to Pew.
Nationwide, the number of homeless veterans dropped by 27 percent, to 47,504, between 2011 and 2015, according to Pew. That roughly coincided with a ramp-up in federal funding for programs targeting homeless veterans, from $399 million in 2009 to $1.37 billion in 2014.
[Nearly $4 million awarded to aid veterans with housing needs in Maine]
Mike Merrill, who manages Volunteers of America Northern New England's veterans facilities in Saco and Biddeford, said even a recent change of phrasing being used on a questionnaire distributed in Maine during the annual Point In Time Survey has made a difference.
"We've happened to see an increase based on the wording of the surveys out there," Merrill said. "Some veterans don't think of themselves as vets because they never saw combat. But those who know the lingo know that there are peacetime vets as well as wartime vets. Now that they've changed the wording to say 'Have you served in the military?' instead of 'Are you a veteran?', there are more people who answer 'yes' to that question."
[Saco facility helps homeless veterans rebuild lives]
Roger Goodoak, the founder of the Portland-based Maine Homeless Veterans Alliance, regularly patrols the city with blankets, gloves and other supplies in search of veterans living on the streets.
"I haven't found a qualified veteran in weeks," said Goodoak, a Navy veteran who experienced homelessness himself in the past.
"It's very difficult right now to find homeless veterans on the streets. They're getting identified and processed very rapidly," he said. "If you come into Portland, you get into a shelter and they find out you're a qualified veteran, they take care of you. They have a 'Let's get veterans off the streets' mentality, and they're successful."
[Search and recovery: A story of hope for Portland's homeless veterans]
Megan Burgess, veteran's services case manager for Washington-Hancock Community Agency, said she has seen an uptick in homeless veterans over the last four months, from a steady number of one or two cases at any given time to a current case load of six in Hancock County, and four each in Washington and Aroostook.
She said her efforts to help homeless veterans can be hampered because federal HUD-VASH (Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing) benefits are allocated by location, and many of her clients are outside the limits of the Bangor service area outlined for the program.
"Homelessness in Washington County, whether it's veterans or not, looks a lot different here than in the urban areas," she said. "We've actually seen more homeless veterans over the last few months than we've seen in a long time. I'm not really sure where they're coming from."
But, echoing the sentiments of her southern Maine counterparts, Burgess said outreach efforts could help explain the uptick. She said two veterans recently approached the agency for help after seeing fliers posted in the area.
"I definitely think it's because of outreach that we've done," she said. "Because we have a presence in the community, they were able to hear about us and come in."

Texto completo:   The man charged with a double slaying on Christmas Day in Manchester is wanted in connection with a July hit-and-run in Rochester, New York, that left a pedestrian seriously injured, according to Rochester police.
David W. Marble Jr., 29, of Rochester and Augusta made his first court appearance Wednesday on two counts of murder in the shooting deaths of Eric Williams, 35, and Bonnie Royer, 26, both of Augusta, who were found inside their sport utility vehicle along Sanford Road in Manchester. Police said the shootings were drug-related.
"Marble is facing charges of second-degree assault, leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident with serious physical injury, third-degree aggravated unauthorized operation of a motor vehicle, and various other traffic citations," Jacqueline Shuman, the information officer for the Rochester police, said Thursday in a press release.
Marble was driving a 2000 Acura sedan without a license on July 18 when he allegedly struck Currie Clanton, 51, of Rochester on Upper Falls Boulevard, then left the scene, according to a police accident report filed with the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles.
Clanton suffered a cracked pelvis, a broken leg, damaged hips and brain damage, a Rochester newspaper reported in November.
Rochester police had been actively seeking to locate and arrest Marble since Oct. 30, Shuman said.
Marble's arrest on the New York charges is being coordinated between the Monroe County district attorney's office in New York and police in Maine, the press release said.
If convicted of the murders in Maine, Marble faces between 29 years, because of the alleged use of a firearm, and life in prison.

Resumen: By a 4-3 vote, Dover-Foxcroft selectmen opted not to put a community bill of rights ordinance on the ballot, favoring instead to set a series of meetings with supporters of the measure to prohibit corporations and governments from engaging in acquisition of land for, or the siting of, private and public-private transportation and distribution corridors.

Texto completo:   As the page on the calendar changes to the month of January and a new year, it marks the occasion where the newspaper staff reviews the past 52 editions and highlights the biggest news of 2015.
The review of January through June ran last week; here's the second half of the past year.
July
The Center Theatre reported a crowd of 8,000 attended the Maine Whoopie Pie Festival in Dover-Foxcroft which brought bakers from around the state together with artists, crafters, vendors and the public to celebrate the Pine Tree State's official treat.
Dexter entrepreneur Susan Nordman, owner of Erda Handbags, testified during a hearing hosted by the U.S. Senate Aging Committee to the value of older workers.
Police were seeking the public's help in their ongoing manhunt for murder suspect Robert Burton, who was believed to have killed his ex-girlfriend in Parkman several weeks earlier. Witness reports claimed to have spotted the subject on a snowmobile trail in Guilford and on Davis Pond in a stolen canoe/kayak.
A motorcycle procession in Monson kicked off the second annual 100-Mile Wilderness Walk for Warriors, an event that honors fallen members of the armed forces from Maine which in conjunction with the Summit Project raised money for various support programs for veterans and their families.
The tax rate in Milo was set at 28.7 mills, up from 21.3 in 2014.
In order for the Moosehead Lake region to attract new business and enhance its reputation as a prime tourist destination, Luke Muzzy, who chairs the MLR Economic Development Corporation, told county commissioners they should look "back to the future" and beyond county borders.
The Dover-Foxcroft Selectmen approved a tax rate of $18.60 per $1,000 of assessed property for the 2015-16 fiscal year. The rate was up from the previous year mark of 18.25 mills.
Meanwhile, Brownville officials set their mill rate at 19.30, a .40 mill increase from 2014-15.
August
Efforts to revitalize the former Moosehead Manufacturing plant on the Piscataquis River in Dover-Foxcroft were rewarded as officials gathered to celebrate the opening of the Mill Inn & Cafe -- part of a larger Riverfront Redevelopment Project encompassing apartments and retail space in the repurposed factory complex.
With help and encouragement from her schoolmates, 6-year-old Lilly Burgess of Guilford supassed her ambitious goal of raising $6,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
For the second time in as many months, residents of School Administrative District 4 voted down a proposed $7.2 million school budget. The vote was 259-216 to reject the spending package for Guilford area education.
The man who spurred the longest manhunt in modern state history surrendered peacefully at the Piscataquis County Jail after 68 days on the run. Robert Burton was charged with the June 5 murder of Stephanie Ginn Gebo, a single mother of two young children who lived in Parkman.
September
After being sent back to the drawing board two times and modestly trimmed from an original $7.2 million to $7.16 million, the 2015-16 SAD 4 education budget gained approval by just 23 votes.
Media/English teacher Mia Morrison, representing Foxcroft Academy, was named a finalist for Maine's Teacher of the Year and representing the best of Piscataquis County educators.
Hundreds of friends, family members, colleagues and complete strangers paid their final respects to a Dover-Foxcroft native and Dexter Regional High School graduate whose life-long passion for serving and protecting people was "part of his DNA." Corey Dodge, 40, was killed Aug. 22 in Kabul, Afghanistan, when a car bomb exploded during a terrorist attack on his convoy.
By a 4-3 vote, Dover-Foxcroft selectmen opted not to put a community bill of rights ordinance on the ballot, favoring instead to set a series of meetings with supporters of the measure to prohibit corporations and governments from engaging in acquisition of land for, or the siting of, private and public-private transportation and distribution corridors. The town had received a petition carrying over 300 signatures in favor of holding a secret ballot vote on the proposed ordinance.
Later in the month, the panel voted 4-2 to deny the request to put the CBR matter to a public vote.
October
The town of Dover-Foxcroft landed a $240,000 state grant on behalf of GLOBEco Maine, a manufacturer of wood fiber cleaning cloths under the brand DuraFresh.The manufacturing facility, located in the front end of the Save-A-Lot supermarket on West Main Street, was expected to grow from a five- to a 40-worker company over the next year, according to business partners Phil Pastore and Mark Snyder.
Two Appalachian Trail thru-hikers, who had been stranded on a flooded section of trail in Blanchard, were airlifted to safety by a Maine Army National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. Heavy rains had caused the east branch of the Piscataquis River to spill over its banks and make parts of the trail impassable.
During a presentation to the Greenville board of selectmen, a 43-point Moosehead Lake Region Branding, Development and Marketing Action Plan was outlined by Amanda Hunt, a member of the local economic development committee. The brand promise, she said, is "Moosehead Lake -- America's Crown Jewel."
Maine Alternative Solutions in Milo, operated by Ron and Amy Demarais, was honored by the Piscataquis Chamber of Commerce as the 2015 Business of the Year. The company sells and services heat pumps and is expanding into solar power.
November
Following up on an earlier meeting with Maine's Commissioner of Health and Human Services, proponents of improved access to DHHS services for Piscataquis County residents stepped up their efforts to reopen an office in Dover-Foxcroft that was closed almost 10 years earlier.
Piscataquis County voters narrowly rejected a referendum question asking for permission to spend up to $610,000 to construct a new Sheriff's Office building at the intersection of East Main and School streets in Dover-Foxcroft. The actual vote was 1,427-1,323 against the measure.
December
Representing the committee that has been working on a community bill of rights for Dover-Foxcroft, Dr. Lesley Fernow addressed members of the town's board of selectmen during a special meeting on the ongoing citizen-driven initiative to place a CBR ordinance question on the ballot. "Our goal is still to put an ordinance before the citizens for a vote, we look at it as a community rights issue," she said regarding ongoing private efforts to build a transportation/communications corridor through the region.
Ralph "Eddie" Lewis was selected as the 2015 Warren "Pete" Myrick Community Service Award recipient during the annual meeting of the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council in Dover-Foxcroft. The town resident was honored for his efforts on behalf of the Kiwanis Club, D-F Fire Department and Piscataquis Valley Fair Association, among others.
County commissioners approved both the 2016-17 county budget at $4,018,000 and the spending plan for the unorganized territories, at $1,471,870, as well.

Snowfall, lower temperatures warm up Maine's ski season

Resumen: Tuesday's snowstorm, which dumped six to 10 inches of the white stuff between Lewiston and the Canadian border, will help save Christmas vacation, one of the industry's busiest times, Whitcomb and other ski area owners said. "Last week we needed to make snow for Christmas week, and we couldn't," said Scott Shanaman, owner of Lost Valley ski area in Auburn, which opened Wednesday.

Texto completo:   Business was looking frighteningly bad to Hermon Mountain Ski Area owner Bill Whitcomb about a week ago.
Skiing in Maine, he said, usually begins in mid-December, with a good season starting on Dec. 1, offering plenty of time to groom trails for this week's Christmas school vacation. Only this year, two things were missing -- snow and, especially, cold weather.
"We had a trail half-done on Nov. 29. We started early thinking this was going to be a good year," Whitcomb said Tuesday, "but it just warmed up."
The unseasonably mild temperatures and lack of snowfall delayed the opening of Hermon Mountain until Dec. 26, its latest start in 30 years. Most of the 18 Alpine ski areas that are members of the Ski Maine Association reported similar delays.
Tuesday's snowstorm, which dumped six to 10 inches of the white stuff between Lewiston and the Canadian border, will help save Christmas vacation, one of the industry's busiest times, Whitcomb and other ski area owners said.
Still, most of them have only part of their trail systems online so far.
"Everybody, even the big places like Sugarloaf and Sunday River, is struggling this year," said Landon Fake, general manager of the municipally-owned Camden Snow Bowl.
"Last week we needed to make snow for Christmas week, and we couldn't," said Scott Shanaman, owner of Lost Valley ski area in Auburn, which opened Wednesday. "Missing half of Christmas week is not the start we wanted."
Being a week in which schools are closed, the time between Christmas and New Year's Day is important to the state's ski areas. Only the mid-February winter vacation for schools draws more skiers, owners said.
Tuesday's snowfall was important in a subtle way, said Bill Getman, general manager of Bigrock Mountain ski area of Mars Hill, which opened on Monday. It reminded people that ski season has arrived, he said.
"When people don't see snow in their yards, a lot of them don't think about winter sports at all. Snow piques their interests to go see what's out there," Whitcomb said.
Last year was similarly balmy in December through Christmas 2014, when it was 55 degrees and raining in much of Maine, Whitcomb said. This year, ski area owners hope for heavy snowfall right into March to make up for lost time.
"If we hadn't been through the same thing last year, we would have been panicking. Last year we were," Whitcomb admitted. "It turned out to be a good season because while it started late, people skied late, so we know it can turn out well."
Although a big blanket of snow, like what Tuesday's storm provided, is certainly welcomed by the state's smaller ski areas, the snow that really counts is the stuff they make themselves. There typically isn't enough natural snow to make good skiing trails, so manufacturing it allows mountains to create better trails and pack them down. Of the 18 Ski Maine Association members, only three -- Baker Mountain in Moscow, Mount Jefferson in Lee and Quoggy Jo in Presque Isle -- rely entirely on natural snow.
Manufactured snow allowed Sugarloaf, the state's largest ski area with 146 trails, to have 20 trails open on Wednesday, up from 11 the week before, workers there said. The state's second-largest, Sunday River, had 34 of its 129 trails open on Wednesday, with expectations to open 11 more by the weekend.
The need to make snow this year has been costly to Whitcomb, who estimated that he spent $15,000 making snow through Dec. 26 -- to little effect, given the warm temperatures.
"We are all struggling to make snow, we just don't have that many opportunities," said Fake, whose coastal location and weather allowed him to open last year on Jan. 1.
"If we are lucky, we will do half a week of business this week," Getman said.
Fake expects to have four trails open when his season starts on Friday. As of Wednesday, Fake's crews had been in snow production for 36 hours and were beginning to distribute it.
Manmade or natural, the lack of snow hurts the economies of the communities around ski areas, which are large part-time employers in wintertime. Most employ 60 to 70 ski instructors, snowmakers, mechanics, concessionaires, ski patrollers, medics, clerks and ticket takers -- once the mountain is open.
Good weather, or the lack of it, is something ski area workers learn to live with. Shanaman busied himself for most of the month repairing terrain and buildings at his ski area. Whitcomb endures the warm spells philosophically.
"I can't control the weather. I just have to worry about the things I can control," Whitcomb said. "I just tighten up the purse strings and I ride it out."
"If you get upset about the weather in this business," Shanaman said, "you can't be in this business."

Texto completo:   Everybody who knows me knows I have an incredible passion for keeping the world fit. And the people of Maine fit. And I've certainly enjoyed writing about it over the years.
No, I'm not going to stop writing about Les Mills group fitness programs and the benefits that they provide. Starting in 2016, I will be writing about that elsewhere, and this space will be dedicated to another passion of mine: Sports. And writing about them.
You see, I was a sportswriter for many years before I changed roles at the BDN and my Les Mills career began to take off. And after getting a chance to staff a UMaine-Stony Brook football game last fall for a New York media outlet, I realized I needed to get back into sportswriting in some degree.
While the name of this blog will not change, I will be writing about the local teams I have grown up cheering for and have a rooting interest in outside the newsroom and group fitness studio: University of Maine hockey, the New England Patriots, Boston Red Sox, Boston Celtics and Boston Bruins.
The blog will provide fans and readers alike perspectives from the outlook of a fan who also happens to be a journalist, and has had childhood dreams of covering some of these teams, with UMaine hockey and the Patriots being the top two. Some tidbits on Maine's passionate high school sports scene will be mixed in as well, especially come basketball tournament time in February.

Texto completo:   A roundup of new laws/policy changes taking effect on Jan. 1, including lower income tax rates and a larger estate tax exemption.
The income tax rates for most Maine residents will decline in the new year, thanks to a tax cut made possible by higher levies on lodging and some grocery items.
Those changes are among the dozens of new policies that take effect Jan. 1 as a result of legislation passed by Maine lawmakers during their 2015 session. While the shake-up of Maine's income tax brackets will have broad impacts across the state, other new laws cater to a smaller audience, such as turkey hunters wanting more time to bag a bird, and local residents seeking more input on the development of commercial wind power projects in their towns.
After weeks of intensive, closed-door negotiations that heightened political tensions in Augusta, state lawmakers passed a two-year budget in June that cuts income tax rates for most working Mainers.
The top tax rate will fall from 7.95 percent to 7.15 percent and will begin kicking in at a higher level, namely when an individual earns more than $37,500 rather than the current threshold of $20,900. Maine residents making between $21,050 and $37,500 will pay a rate of 6.75 percent - down from 7.95 percent for most of those earners presently - while those making less than $21,050 will be taxed at 5.8 percent.
Of course, many Mainers won't see or feel the difference until they file their 2016 income taxes in the winter or spring of 2017. But Michael Allen with Maine Revenue Services said working Mainers may want to adjust the amount that is withheld from their paychecks.
Additionally, some elderly or lower-income Mainers who don't earn enough to owe income taxes - and therefore don't even bother filing - could benefit this year from an expansion of the "Homestead" property tax exemption, a refundable sales tax credit and the newly refundable Earned Income Tax Credit.
"So even though they may not be required to file a tax return, there might be good reasons that they may want to file one," Allen said.
The heirs of wealthy or land-rich Mainers could pay less next year as well.
As of New Year's Day, estates valued at nearly $5.5 million will be exempt from Maine's so-called "death tax," more than doubling the current $2 million state exemption and bringing Maine's policy in line with the federal tax code. The estate tax had been a bargaining chip in negotiations between Republican and Democratic budget negotiators in recent years with only modest expansions, so Molly Liddell said she and others who specialize in estate planning were surprised with the sudden change during the last legislative session.
Liddell, a partner in Pierce Atwood LLP's trusts and estates group, called it "easily the most significant change in Maine estate tax policy in a decade."
"It is certainly going to reduce the number people paying the estate tax pretty significantly," Liddell said.
To help pay for those cuts, lawmakers made permanent the 5.5 percent sales tax rate in place since October 2013 - rather than allowing it to fall back to 5 percent on July 1, 2015, as originally planned - and increased the "lodging tax" on hotel rooms from 8 percent to 9 percent. Additionally, lawmakers broadened the sales tax by eliminating exemptions on hundreds of goods and services.
The mix of tax cuts and tax increases was a major sticking point in the two-year, $6.7 billion budget and nearly derailed negotiations on several occasions as Gov. Paul LePage and House Republicans pushed for greater tax cuts as well as welfare reforms. Lawmakers completed work on the spending bill just hours before the fiscal year began after narrowly overriding vetoes from LePage, who had proposed his own suite of tax cuts and tax increases.
Republican Rep. Kenneth Fredette of Newport, whose caucus was more closely aligned with LePage on the income tax issue, said he believes the income tax cuts will benefit the middle class as well as small-business owners who report their business income as part of their personal income tax filings.
"We obviously didn't get everything we wanted in the budget, but we think those are important pieces," Fredette said.
Most new laws in Maine become effective 90 days after the legislative session ends or, in the case of "emergency" measures, immediately upon the signature of the governor or the Legislature's override of a gubernatorial veto.
However, a handful of laws apart from those involving the tax code also take effect on New Year's Day, including ones that:
n Allow the residents of a township, plantation or municipality to petition the Land Use Planning Commission to remove the area from the "expedited permitting areas" where proposals for commercial wind power projects receive streamlined regulatory review.
n Eliminate the specific license for hunting wild turkeys (they will now be included in the state's general small-game hunting license) and add a week-long turkey hunting season in November.
n Allow children younger than 10 to receive a junior hunting license and hunt with an adult (the current age cutoff for a junior license is 10).
n Require individuals who collect young, post-larval sea scallops or blue mussels - known as "spat" - to receive a license from the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
n Require the commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to file an annual report to state lawmakers summarizing the use of restraints or seclusion at psychiatric institutions during the previous year.
n Prohibit the sale or furnishing of products containing liquid nicotine unless the packaging is child-resistant. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@mainetoday.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo:   While 2015 mergers and acquisitions in Maine didn't come close to the value of a $148.57 billion merger between Pfizer and Allergan, there were many notable deals.
Some of them involved smaller professional services firms. Bangor-based Cross Insurance continued its buying spree in 2015, acquiring Boston's Knapp Schenck & Co., Corcoran & Havlin Insurance Group of Wellesley, and Schonning Insurance Agency of Westerly, Rhode Island.
Likewise, Portland accounting and consulting firm Baker Newman Noyes acquired Massachusetts-based William Steele & Associates PC and then the external audit and tax practices of Shatswell, MacLeod & Co. P.C.
But there were big deals, ones that involved hundreds of workers and millions of dollars in investments. The biggest Maine deals in which the terms were disclosed include:
Plum Creek and Weyerhauser
Still in the works is the acquisition of the Plum Creek land management company by timberland giant Weyerhauser. The $87.4 billion deal would give Weyerhauser control over 860,000 acres in Maine near Moosehead Lake and some of the state's most pristine forests. Announced in November, Weyerhauser said it was seeking the deal to take advantage of an anticipated increase in demand for lumber and wood products as the construction industry rebounds post-recession.
ON Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor
ON Semiconductor of Phoenix, a competitor of South Portland's Fairchild Semiconductor, is buying the chipmaker for $2.4 billion. Fairchild has about 650 employees in Maine. ON's CEO said there was minimal overlap between the two companies and their product lines would complement one another. The deal, which is financed primarily with debt, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. For its most recent quarter, Fairchild reported a net loss of $8.2 million and sales of $342.1 million, down 10 percent from the same period in 2014.
Verso and NewPage
In January, a judge approved the merger of paper companies Verso and NewPage, a transaction that reverberated throughout Maine's paper industry. The $1.4 billion deal required NewPage to sell its mill in Rumford to Catalyst Paper in order to assuage anti-trust concerns. Verso had already shed its Bucksport mill the previous summer. The deals resulted in the loss of about 500 paper-making jobs in midcoast Maine. Since acquiring the Rumford mill, Catalyst has shut down one paper machine and laid off 50 people indefinitely. Verso laid off 300 from its Jay mill this fall.
Camden National Bank and The Bank of Maine
In March, Camden National Bank announced it intended to acquire The Bank of Maine for about $135 million in cash and stock. The merger, completed in October, makes Camden National the largest Maine-based bank by asset size, rising to $3.6 billion. About 5 percent of the banks' combined workforce - roughly 35 people - were laid off in the wake of the merger and four branches in overlapping locations were closed.
Kepware Technologies AND PTC Inc.
Kepware Technologies, a Portland software development firm, is being bought for $100 million by PTC Inc. of Needham, Massachusetts. The acquisition, scheduled to close in early 2016, is expected to maintain Kepware's Maine operations and workforce of 115. Kepware develops software that allows disparate industrial machinery to communicate with each other. It posted $20 million in revenue over the past year and has global customers in the manufacturing, oil and gas, and power and utilities industries.
Mid-Coast and Parkview hospitals
The two Brunswick hospitals had been locked in a battle to provide health care in the Brunswick region, with Mid Coast emerging the winner. A bankruptcy judge approved the merger, with Mid Coast paying Parkview $3.8 million and forgiving almost $560,000 in an advance the larger hospital made to the smaller one. Mid Coast also agreed to invest $1 million a year for three years in the Parkview campus. Parkview had entered into a bankruptcy proceeding in June; the merger was approved in August.

Texto completo:   overdose rates in state continue to rise
Overdose deaths from prescription drugs and illegal drugs such as heroin continue to rise in Maine, according to statistics released Wednesday by the state Medical Examiner's Office.
Maine had 174 accidental overdose deaths in the first nine months of 2015, with 71 caused at least in part by heroin. Such deaths are on pace to reach 230 to 250 for the year.
Last year, Maine had 208 accidental overdose deaths, with 57 attributed to heroin.
Heroin was a factor in 41 percent of the overdose deaths this year, and 31 percent of the deaths involved fentanyl or acetyl fentanyl, a synthetic opiate that is much stronger than heroin.
Pharmaceutical painkillers such as oxycodone were factors in 40 percent of the deaths.
Many overdose deaths are the result of a combination of drugs.
"Maine's opioid epidemic continues to rage," said Attorney General Janet Mills in a statement announcing the latest statistics.
"This problem seems to have the attention of everyone but the users.
"I am heartened by the response I have seen from leaders in our state who all want to solve this problem," she said.
"In recent days the police have taken major actions to disrupt the supply of heroin and other opiates into our state and to protect our citizenry from those who would sell it. ...We must also begin the long effort of curbing the demand for these deadly substances by educating people of the dangers and supporting people in recovery from addiction."
Kenny Miller, executive director of the Down East AIDS Network and the Health Equity Alliance, said important legislation was passed last year to expand access to Narcan, which can reverse the effects of an overdose.
"Part of what's feeding into these overdose deaths is, that law hasn't taken affect," he said.
Physicians can prescribe Narcan to patients who might need it, though there has been reluctance because of liability concerns, Miller said. Public health organizations also will be allowed to distribute Narcan kits to the users they interact with, but the Department of Health and Human Services is still writing the rules to cover when that is done.
Other legislative initiatives that might have helped reduce the number of overdose deaths did not pass or were watered down.
So-called good Samaritan laws protect people who call to report overdoses from prosecution.
Maine passed a law allowing a person who reports an overdose to use that as a defense against prosecution, but that falls short of the ideal, Miller said.
States such as Massachusetts and Vermont do not permit the arrest of a person who reports an overdose at the scene, though police can still do a criminal investigation.
Groups that work toward harm reduction advocate that people who use heroin and similar drugs do so in the company of others, so there is someone who can call if there is an overdose.
They also encourage people to do a test shot, to understand how strong the dose is. Police are finding some heroin combined with fentanyl to make it more powerful, or fentanyl substituted for heroin.
Both are more dangerous than heroin alone.
Miller said the key to reducing overdose deaths is to work on prevention through education and to expand access to treatment.
"When we come across people who are ready to access treatment, we don't have anywhere to send them," Miller said.
"We're facing a bottleneck as far as treatment is concerned."

Resumen: Dion - like Democratic leaders and two moderate Republicans in the state Senate - is advocating for Medicaid expansion as a way to pump millions into the state to fund health insurance for low-income residents, which also would help addicts who currently can't get into programs find viable treatment options for substance abuse.

Texto completo:   Short story on Rep. Mark Dion's police diversion pilot program, tying it to MaineCare expansion. Lawlor 20"
A bill that would create a pilot program to help a few police agencies start heroin diversion programs is only a promising first step, the bill's author says.
"I don't pretend my bill has the answer," said Rep. Mark Dion, D-Portland. "A crisis requires that we make meaningful budget decisions to meet the challenge."
Data released Wednesday shows that heroin overdose deaths in Maine through the first nine months of this year have eclipsed the number of deaths for all of 2014 - 71 through Sept. 30 compared with 57 in 2014, according to the state Attorney General's Office.
Dion's bill, which will be considered in January, would provide a total of $2 million for up to eight police departments to start diversion programs, similar to a program that Portland is creating to provide treatment options for users in lieu of arrests.
Dion said his proposal doesn't comprehensively address the state's heroin problem, and that he believes that a Medicaid expansion would provide a substantial infusion of new money into the state that would help thousands get into treatment programs.
Dion - like Democratic leaders and two moderate Republicans in the state Senate - is advocating for Medicaid expansion as a way to pump millions into the state to fund health insurance for low-income residents, which also would help addicts who currently can't get into programs find viable treatment options for substance abuse.
Medicaid clients have an easier time enrolling in treatment programs than the uninsured because substance abuse counselors can be reimbursed for patients who have Medicaid, while the uninsured typically rely on programs to take them for free.
Gov. Paul LePage - a staunch opponent of Medicaid expansion - lambasted efforts by moderate Republican Sens. Roger Katz of Augusta and Tom Saviello of Wilton to craft a compromise bill that would be more palatable to conservatives, calling it unaffordable. The two senators have been selling the measure as a way to alleviate the state's heroin epidemic.
"Two liberal politicians want to expand Medicaid again, shamelessly tying it to more treatment programs for addicts. We already spend $76 million a year on substance abuse programs, but only $3 million a year chasing drug traffickers from out-of-state gangs," LePage said Tuesday in his weekly radio address.
Saviello said Wednesday that despite the governor's criticism, he has been receiving "extremely positive reaction" to his bill to expand Medicaid to more than 60,000 Mainers, but he hasn't yet started lobbying his fellow Republican lawmakers.
"We are sitting on an opportunity, on a potential funding source," Saviello said. "I think the door is open to make this happen." The federal government pays 100 percent of Medicaid expansion through 2016, gradually decreasing the federal share to 90 percent by 2020.
Details of Saviello's bill have yet to be unveiled, but he has said it's similar to compromise plans in other states under Republican control or with divided government - including Montana, Arkansas, Iowa and New Hampshire. The state would seek a waiver from the Obama administration to offer Affordable Care Act insurance to people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.
LePage has said such an expansion is unaffordable, and he pointed to other states that have seen huge Medicaid enrollment increases after Medicaid was expanded, putting pressure on their budgets.
LePage said that in Maine, which has tightened Medicaid eligibility and seen an overall decrease in people receiving Medicaid, from 355,000 in 2011 to 287,000 this year, the Medicaid budget is under control.
"(The Maine Department of Health and Human Services) has done a tremendous job of containing the Medicaid shortfalls that used to blow holes in the budget every year. Medicaid spending is now essentially flat," LePage said.
LePage and other Republicans opposed to expansion also have doubted the Obama administration's pledge that funding would not fall below 90 percent in subsequent years.
Scarborough Police Officer John Gill, who coordinates Operation HOPE, a program that connects addicts seeking help who walk into the Police Department with treatment resources, said Medicaid expansion would go a long way toward removing hurdles his department is experiencing in placing people in treatment programs.
He said about two-thirds of the nearly 90 people who have been helped are uninsured, and they've been forced to go to out-of-state treatment programs, typically ones that have a few slots dedicated to free care.
"There's very little treatment capacity in the state of Maine," Gill said. "It's getting harder and harder for us to do these placements, and we don't have any competition right now."
But Gill said with Medicaid expansion, treatment programs would spring up within Maine because there would be a financial incentive. Nearly everyone seeking help through Operation HOPE would be able to get into programs because the substance abuse counselors would be reimbursed for providing care, he said.
Brendan Melican, public relations manager for Spectrum Health Systems, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that closed its clinic in Sanford this year because of funding problems caused by the state's Medicaid program, said it would consider returning to Maine if Medicaid expansion and a reasonable reimbursement model were approved.
"Absolutely, we would consider it. We would re-evaluate," Melican said. "The heroin problem is real in our region. It's going to get worse before it gets better." Joe Lawlor can be contacted at 791-6376 or at: jlawlor@pressherald.com Twitter: @joelawlorph

State heating oil prices drop to average of $1.83

Resumen: The federal Energy Information Administration is projecting that U.S. oil output will drop by a record 570,000 barrels a day in 2016, but Iranian oil officials announced this week that they expect to begin exporting about 500,000 barrels a day when the international embargo on that country's petroleum is lifted early next month.

Texto completo:   Heating oil prices continue to slide in Maine, following the downward trajectory of global prices.
The statewide average price of oil Monday was $1.83 a gallon, ranging from a low of $1.77 a gallon in the southwestern region of the state to a high of $1.99 a gallon in northern Maine, according to the Governor's Energy Office. Last week, the statewide average was $1.86 a gallon and it was $1.92 a gallon the week before.
Kerosene prices also dipped, down 2 cents a gallon from a week ago to $2.44 a gallon. Propane prices were flat from a week ago at $2.21 a gallon.
Crude oil prices have continued to decline, even as American producers have begun to cut back on drilling because the low prices don't justify the cost of continued or increased drilling. The federal Energy Information Administration is projecting that U.S. oil output will drop by a record 570,000 barrels a day in 2016, but Iranian oil officials announced this week that they expect to begin exporting about 500,000 barrels a day when the international embargo on that country's petroleum is lifted early next month.
With about two-thirds of Maine homes heated by oil, the savings from lower prices are expected to be significant. The EIA said the cost of oil for homes will average about $1,400 nationwide from October to March, down more than $450 from last winter.
Jamie Py, president of the Maine Energy Marketers Association, which represents fuel dealers in the state, said prices are at a decade low and most experts predict that the worldwide oil glut probably will last at least a couple of years. Barring any significant change, he said, prices should stay low.
He said a decision by Congress this week to lift a ban on exporting U.S.-produced oil might provide a small boost to oil prices in the next few months, but it's not expected to have a significant effect.
Py said the low prices could cause some homeowners to put off plans to shift from oil burners to some other heat sources because the economics no longer justify the change. However, he suggested that homeowners continue to put money into weatherizing their homes because the benefits will pay off regardless of how the home is heated.

Overdose deaths in state continue to increase

Texto completo:   Overdose deaths from prescription drugs and illegal drugs such as heroin continue to rise in Maine, according to statistics released by the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
Maine had 174 accidental overdose deaths in the first nine months of 2015, with 71 caused at least in part by heroin. Such deaths are on pace to reach 230 to 250 for the year.
Pharmaceutical painkillers such as oxycodone were factors in 70 of the deaths, or 40 percent.
In addition to the 41 percent of overdose deaths in which heroin was a factor, 31 percent -- 54 cases -- involved fentanyl or acetyl fentanyl, a synthetic opiate that is much stronger than heroin.
That compares with 208 accidental overdoses in all of 2014, with 57 attributed to heroin.
Many of the overdose deaths are the result of a combination of drugs.
"Maine's opioid epidemic continues to rage," Attorney General Janet Mills said in a statement Wednesday announcing the latest statistics. "This problem seems to have the attention of everyone but the users."
"I am heartened by the response I have seen from leaders in our state who all want to solve this problem," she said.
"In recent days the police have taken major actions to disrupt the supply of heroin and other opiates into our state and to protect our citizenry from those who would sell it. ... We must also begin the long effort of curbing the demand for these deadly substances by educating people of the dangers and supporting people in recovery from addiction."

Texto completo:   Overdose deaths from prescription drugs and illegal drugs such as heroin continue to rise in Maine, according to statistics released by the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
Maine had 174 accidental overdose deaths in the first nine months of 2015, with 71 caused at least in part by heroin. Such deaths are on pace to reach 230 to 250 for the year.
Pharmaceutical painkillers such as oxycodone were factors in 70 of the deaths, or 40 percent.
In addition to the 41 percent of overdose deaths in which heroin was a factor, 31 percent -- 54 cases -- involved fentanyl or acetyl fentanyl, a synthetic opiate that is much stronger than heroin.
That compares with 208 accidental overdoses in all of 2014, with 57 attributed to heroin.
Many of the overdose deaths are the result of a combination of drugs.
"Maine's opioid epidemic continues to rage," Attorney General Janet Mills said in a statement Wednesday announcing the latest statistics. "This problem seems to have the attention of everyone but the users."
"I am heartened by the response I have seen from leaders in our state who all want to solve this problem," she said. "In recent days the police have taken major actions to disrupt the supply of heroin and other opiates into our state and to protect our citizenry from those who would sell it. ... We must also begin the long effort of curbing the demand for these deadly substances by educating people of the dangers and supporting people in recovery from addiction."

Bill joins calls for treatment funding, Medicaid

Resumen: Dion -- like Democratic leaders and two moderate Republicans in the state Senate -- is advocating for Medicaid expansion as a way to pump millions into the state for health insurance for low-income residents, which also would help addicts who currently can't get into programs find viable substance abuse treatment options.

Texto completo:   A bill that would create a pilot program to help a few police agencies start heroin diversion programs is a promising first step, the bill's author says, but it does not come close to making a dent in the state's heroin crisis.
But Medicaid expansion would make a big difference in addressing the heroin epidemic, advocates say.
Data released Wednesday shows heroin overdose deaths in Maine through the first nine months of this year have eclipsed the number of deaths for all of 2014 -- 71 through Sept. 30 compared to 57 for 2014, according to the attorney general's office.
"I don't pretend my bill has the answer," said Rep. Mark Dion, D-Portland. "A crisis requires that we make meaningful budget decisions to meet the challenge."
Dion's bill to be considered in January would provide $2 million total for up to eight police departments to start up diversion programs, similar to a program that Portland is creating that provides treatment options for users in lieu of arrests.
Dion said he realizes the proposal does not address the state's heroin problem comprehensively.
In contrast, Medicaid expansion would be a substantial infusion of new money into the state that would help thousands get into treatment programs, he said.
Dion -- like Democratic leaders and two moderate Republicans in the state Senate -- is advocating for Medicaid expansion as a way to pump millions into the state for health insurance for low-income residents, which also would help addicts who currently can't get into programs find viable substance abuse treatment options.
That's because those who have Medicaid have an easier time enrolling in treatment programs than the uninsured, because substance abuse counselors can be reimbursed for patients who have Medicaid, while the uninsured typically rely on programs to take them for free.
Gov. Paul LePage -- a staunch opponent of Medicaid expansion -- lambasted efforts by moderate Republican senators Roger Katz, of Augusta, and Tom Saviello, of Wilton, to craft a compromise bill that would be more palatable to conservatives, calling it unaffordable. The two senators have been selling the measure as a way to alleviate the state's heroin epidemic.
"Two liberal politicians want to expand Medicaid again, shamelessly tying it to more treatment programs for addicts. We already spend $76 million a year on substance abuse programs, but only $3 million a year chasing drug traffickers from out-of-state gangs," LePage said in his weekly radio address on Tuesday.
Saviello said on Wednesday that despite the governor's criticism, he has been receiving "extremely positive reaction" to his bill to expand Medicaid to more than 60,000 Mainers, but he hasn't yet started lobbying his fellow Republican lawmakers.
"We are sitting on an opportunity, on a potential funding source," Saviello said. "I think the door is open to make this happen." The federal government pays 100 percent of Medicaid expansion through 2016, gradually declining the federal share to 90 percent by 2020.
Details of Saviello's bill have yet to be unveiled, but he has said it's similar to compromise plans in other states under Republican control or with divided government -- including Montana, Arkansas, Iowa and New Hampshire. The state would seek a waiver from the Obama administration to offer Affordable Care Act insurance to people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty limit.
LePage has said such an expansion is unaffordable, and he pointed to other states that have seen huge Medicaid enrollment increases after Medicaid was expanded, putting pressure on their budgets.
Meanwhile, LePage said in Maine, which has tightened Medicaid eligibility and seen an overall decrease in people receiving Medicaid, from 355,000 in 2011 to 287,000 this year, the Medicaid budget is under control.
"(The Maine Department of Health and Human Services) has done a tremendous job of containing the Medicaid shortfalls that used to blow holes in the budget every year. Medicaid spending is now essentially flat," LePage said.
LePage and other Republicans opposed to expansion also have doubted the Obama administration's pledge that funding would not fall below 90 percent in subsequent years.
Scarborough police Officer John Gill, who coordinates Operation HOPE, a program that connects addicts seeking help who walk into the police station with treatment resources, said Medicaid expansion would go a long way toward removing hurdles they are experiencing in placing people in treatment programs.
He said that about two-thirds of the nearly 90 people they have helped are uninsured, and they have had to go to treatment programs out of state, typically to programs that have a few slots dedicated to free care.
"There's very little treatment capacity in the state of Maine," Gill said. "It's getting harder and harder for us to do these placements, and we don't have any competition right now."
But Gill said with Medicaid expansion, treatment programs would spring up within Maine because there would be a financial incentive to do so.
Nearly everyone seeking help through Operation HOPE would be able to get into programs because the substance abuse counselors would be reimbursed for providing care, he said.
Brendan Melican, public relations manager for Spectrum Health Systems, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that closed its Sanford offices earlier this year because of funding problems caused by the state's Medicaid program, said they would consider returning to Maine if Medicaid expansion and a reasonable reimbursement model were approved.
"Absolutely, we would consider it. We would re-evaluate," Melican said. "The heroin problem is real in our region. It's going to get worse before it gets better."

Texto completo:   Lukas Pool listened hard to the instrument tucked tight under his right arm. He plucked at it, twisting the pegs, cajoling it into tune for the first time.
A month earlier, it was just a slab of mahogany, a box of hardware and a bundle of ideas. Now, after hours of work he didn't count, it was a banjo.
Without ceremony or magic words, Pool brushed his right index finger down over the strings, bringing the creation of wood and metal to life.
He played the instrument's first tune, seated on a chair in the tiny basement workshop he shares with his partner, Eden Forman, in Saco. She stood a few feet away, pounding frets into another banjo neck with a wooden mallet. She listened for a moment, pausing the blows. Their rescue dog, Charlie, lay curled in an armchair they salvaged from the roadside.
Then, Pool stopped the music. He held the banjo at arm's length, inspecting their work. I asked him the name of the tune.
"I don't know," he said and grinned.
Forman restarted her hammering. Charlie didn't move. Pool set the banjo down on the workbench and started cleaning up.
And that, kids, is where banjos come from -- at least, that's how Ozark Banjo Company instruments are born.Beginnings
Pool, 26, is a two-time national champion old-time banjo player who grew up making instruments with his dad, Scott Pool, at the family music store in Mountain View, Arkansas. Forman, 25, is from Massachusetts. She won a national Scottish fiddling title while still a teeneager. They met at Berklee College of Music.
"We met in Old-Time Ensemble," Forman said.
They hatched their banjo-making plans while still in school. Pool graduated while Forman had a few classes to finish. He took off for Arkansas to work with his dad, refining his techniques and plans. She told him to come back to Boston when she finished school and she'd be waiting for him. He drove back north a few months later.
"My car was just full to the top with saws and hand tools," he said.
The pair came to Maine from Boston this past spring, finding an apartment in Portland and shop space just off Route 1 in Saco.
"It wasn't happening in Massachusetts," she said.
"There's just not enough space," he said. "It's very pricey."
"So, we came up here and got ourselves a shop and just kind of dove into the deep end and went full time," she said.
"It was kind of scary," he said. "But we did it."
Although Pool enjoys performing and teaching banjo, it doesn't compare to the satisfaction of having something to show for his hard work.
With music itself, he said, "you play it and it dies. It just kind of fades off unless you record it. It's a lot of fun and I love playing music, but I really missed being hands on and having a workshop."How it's done
"You start with a piece of wood," Eden Forman said, stating the obvious with a laugh. "We go to the store and pick out a piece of wood."
They buy one 5-foot slab of mahogany, maple or walnut to make one whole banjo. The wood depends on what the buyer wants. Fingerboards are made of ebony or rosewood. All of their banjos are custom made from scratch. The buyer gets to decide almost everything, from wood choice to inlays to pot size to neck profile to headstock design.
Pool said Forman has a great eye for picking out the wood. "Then we rip it up and we clean it up," he said.
It's a team effort.
Forman glues together three layers of 12 angled blocks of wood, forming a rough circle that will become the pot -- the distinctively round part of a banjo. Later, it will be turned smooth with a lathe and a router table. It's a bit of a newfangled idea. The traditional method calls for steam-bending strips of wood around a mold and laminating them together with glue.
"We like them both but they sound a little different," Pool said.
Their method allows for more glue to be squeezed out of the seams, making a pot with a greater wood-to-glue ratio than the laminate style.
"If you tap them once they're done, they actually ring a little longer," he said. "They have a really bell-like sound. I like them."
While Forman sands and glues the pots, Pool sketches out the shape of the neck and headstock. Once it's roughed-out, he glues a fretboard on top and cuts the slots for the wire frets. Then, using a vertical drum sander, he shapes elegant neck curves to fit comfortably into the crook of a banjo player's hand.
Forman also handles the delicate inlays that will adorn almost all their banjo's necks. She works with buyers via email, sketching designs and translating ideas into shapes that will work as inlays. Then she makes patterns, gluing them to thin pieces of abalone.
"Then I plunk down and start working on it," she said.
Using a tiny saw and blade, she cuts them out wearing a mask with a vacuum strapped to the bench to protect her from the toxic dust. It's precise work.
The partners can't remember how many instruments they've made since coming to Maine. I watched them make four banjos in late October and early November.
"I mean, we spend more time in the shop than we do at home. So we're there all day and sometimes all night -- pretty much every day," Forman said.
"It's a labor of love," Pool said.
"There's a lot of standing there, scratching our heads, going, 'What are we going to do with this one?'" she said, laughing.
"That, too," he said.Staying for a while
I asked them if people sometimes wonder why instruments from the Ozark Banjo Company are made in Maine, of all places. Yes, they told me, pretty much every day. They explain it's in homage to Pool's home state of Arkansas and his father, who got them started. It makes perfect sense to them.
"Well, that's where we learned," he said.
"That's where you're from," she added.
But they see themselves staying in Portland.
"This was a good move for us," she said.
"I like to say it's the Arkansas of the north because it's just really relaxed here," he said. "The people are really friendly and talkative. We like it here."
"Yeah," she said.
"I just want to keep diving further into the process and building, because it's really changed everything about my life and the people I've met," he said, looking at Forman.

Texto completo:   Plow crews and police departments in central Maine saw few major problems Tuesday as they dealt with the region's first significant snowfall of the season, which slowed traffic, caused some minor car accidents and led some businesses to close early.
Four to 8 inches of snow fell in Kennebec County, according to estimates from the National Weather Service, while areas of Franklin and Somerset counties were expected to get greater accumulations before the snow tapered off and turned to freezing rain later Tuesday.
"There were some minor equipment breakdowns, but we always expect to have to work those things out during the first storm of the season," Waterville Public Works Director Mark Turner said. "For the most part things went as well as we could have expected."
For today, the National Weather Service is predicting a chance of snow and freezing drizzle before noon, with some snow and sleet until about 3 p.m.
Shoppers hit the stores Monday in preparation for the storm, buying shovels and rock salt to get ready. Local plow crews said they were ready for the storm, which arrived during school vacation week and just days after a warm stretch of weather that brought temperatures into the 50s on Christmas.
By mid-morning Tuesday, the National Weather Service had received just two reports of snowfall totals in Kennebec County, said Mike Kistner, a meteorologist. In Winslow, 1.7 inches was reported around 7 a.m.; and in Wayne, 3 inches was reported at 7:30 a.m. Total snowfall accumulations were not available later in the day and were not expected until Wednesday morning, Kistner said.
Early reports in Franklin County indicated snowfall of 2.5 inches just north of Rangeley at 6 a.m.; and in Somerset County, 3.5 inches was reported in Harmony around 7 a.m.
Meanwhile, few weather-related accidents were reported early Tuesday morning; and in many parts of the region, ski areas and outdoor recreation centers were celebrating the winter's first significant snowfall.
At the Sugarloaf ski resort in Carrabassett Valley, several inches of snow had fallen by mid-morning Tuesday, adding to a base of about 5 inches that fell on Sunday, said Director of Marketing Ethan Austin. Twenty trails are open at Sugarloaf, out of the mountain's 160 trails and glades, but additional lifts and trails are expected to open by the end of the week, Austin said.
"It was a slow start, just like it was for everyone in New England. It was just unseasonably warm for the first part of December, but this week has been great," Austin said. "The long-term forecast is looking good too, so we're very optimistic that winter is here to stay."
At the Quarry Road Recreation Area in Waterville, all 6 miles of the area's cross-country ski trails were groomed for the first time this winter on Tuesday morning, said Waterville Parks and Recreation Director Matt Skehan.
"This is the latest snow we've had in six years," Skehan said. "We've been taking a lot of calls from kids on vacation looking to come up. We're very happy (the trails) are going to get the use that we want them to get now that we have full coverage."
Friends Melanie Kazenel, Jennie Hatch and Emily Estes were among the first skiers and snowshoers on the Waterville trails Tuesday, after the weather forced them to cancel plans to visit Baxter State Park in Millinocket.
"It's fantastic," said Kazenel, 27, of Canton, Massachusetts. "It's great to get outside."
The speed limit on the Maine Turnpike from the New Hampshire line to Gardiner was reduced to 45 mph for much of the day Tuesday because of the snow, according to the turnpike authority.
Lt. Mark Brooks, of Maine State Police Troop C in Skowhegan, which patrols Interstate 95, said it was "near white-out conditions" on the interstate Tuesday morning. Brooks said traffic was light, with only a few traffic accidents, none involving injuries. He said the Maine Department of Transportation "has been staying up with the snow so far, and the interstate has been safe as long as motorists go slow, as the 45 mph signs are on."
Several municipal buildings and court offices closed Tuesday, including the Somerset County Courthouse and county business offices in Skowhegan.
"I went in and got there about 5:45, and it was a scary drive in," said Somerset County Administrator Dawn DiBlasi, of Fairfield, in an email. "And when the court closed, we closed."
The Skowhegan Municipal Building remained open Tuesday, with town officials and others braving the storm to attend a memorial service at the high school for longtime teacher and sports coach Donald Finley, said Town Manager Christine Almand said.
Around 9:30 a.m. there were just four reports of traffic accidents in Somerset County, and relatively few accidents were reported later in the day, said Somerset County Emergency Management Director Michael Smith. The accidents that were reported were "slip and slide" accidents with no injuries reported, Smith said.
"It's been relatively quiet," Smith said. "Of course, with schools being closed (because of vacation week) and everything else, there aren't a lot of people out on the roads."
Augusta police Sgt. Christian Behr also said officers were busy responding to cars disabled in the snow and minor fender-benders but that no major accidents were reported in the city.
"That's all we've really had," he said. "Minor crashes and disabled motor vehicle-type calls."
In the foothills of western Maine, Farmington Public Works Director Denis Castonguay said Tuesday afternoon that the road conditions there were "not too bad" to deal with, in part because of the snowfall's light texture.
"It's a lot easier when the snow tends to blow off the roads," Castonguay said.
Farmington Public Works had 10 plow trucks out since 4:30 a.m. Tuesday working eight plow routes, while also sanding and salting the roads as needed. Two sidewalk plows also were out clearing public walkways.
Because of Farmington's location in the foothills, some parts of town in higher elevations have received more snow fall than others and therefore have been plowed more than areas in lower elevations.
"It was a little treacherous for a few hours when we were getting 3 inches an hour," Castonguay said. "It seemed like the higher elevations got a little more and had to be plowed more than others."
Skowhegan Road Commissioner Greg Dore said he managed to fill two vacant spots on the Highway Department roster Tuesday, with former employees Matt Quinn and Mike McKenney offering to take up the slack. Dore said earlier this week that two seasonal hires quit the 12-man department.
"It's very slippery underneath," Dore said of road conditions. "The snow is light, so it doesn't take much to get it stirred up and make the visibility difficult. Right now it's coming down pretty good."
Dore said the snow started about 4 a.m. in Skowhegan. The temperature hovered around 12 degrees for most of the day. He said the cold temperature made the snow easier to plow for what is the first real snow event of the winter.
"It's a nice break into the season," he said. "It's cold enough that it's not packing and icing up. The snow is light. Heavy, wet snow can create a lot of problems."
In Waterville, public works crews were expected to work until around 10 p.m. Tuesday clearing roads and then continue downtown cleanup after midnight, said Turner, the public works director.
"Right now a lot of the road surfaces aren't (cleared) down to the pavement, but we're hoping to be able to break most of this stuff up," Turner said late Tuesday afternoon. "We are continuing to advise folks to drive slowly and, if possible, stay off the roads."
A winter weather advisory was expected to stay in effect through midnight Tuesday in Kennebec and interior Waldo counties while winter storm warnings were expected to stay in effect in Franklin and Somerset counties through 3 a.m. today, according to the National Weather Service.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- A Penobscot County grand jury on Wednesday indicted two New York City men charged in connection with last month's shootings at a Center Street apartment.
Robert "Rocco" Hansley, 27, and Thomas "Ferg" Ferguson, 37, were arrested on the night of Nov. 27. Earlier that morning, police say they shot and killed Robert Mark Kennedy, 38, and wounded another man, whom police have yet to identify.
Both men are charged with murder and elevated aggravated assault. Ferguson also is charged with tampering with a victim.
All court records tied to the case were sealed and unavailable Wednesday afternoon.
Timothy Feeley, spokesman for the attorney general's office, declined to offer further information about the second victim, the crime or the investigation prior to the grand jury's decision. He also declined to say what prompted the tampering charge against Ferguson.
Bangor police have declined to release further information, saying the case is in the hands of the attorney general.
An attorney representing one of the two defendants has said the people involved knew each other.
While officials haven't released the name of the second victim, they have said he was able to speak with detectives after undergoing surgery at a local hospital and was expected to recover.
The defendants have extensive criminal histories in New York. Ferguson has been convicted of attempted murder, robbery and lesser charges since 1995, according to a criminal history record search obtained from the New York State Unified Court System. He was released from prison on parole in 2010.
Hansley has been convicted of drug and sex charges. He pleaded guilty in 2011 and 2012 in separate cases to criminal possession of marijuana. In each case, he was sentenced to time served. In February 2014, Hansley pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct and was later sentenced to one year in prison. He is listed on the New York sex offender registry.
Kennedy was born in Connecticut and has a criminal record in Maine that includes a felony burglary and misdemeanor convictions, according to his criminal history record obtained from the Maine State Bureau of Identification.
Kennedy was charged with possession of methamphetamine on Sept. 25 after being stopped by Brewer police for speeding, according to the Penobscot County district attorney's office. He had not yet been indicted by the Penobscot County grand jury on the charge but was scheduled to appear at the Penobscot Judicial Center on Jan. 12.
If convicted of murder, each man faces between 25 years and life in prison.

Texto completo:   CARMEL - Floyd "Skip" Roy Lenfest, 86, of Carmel, Maine died peacefully Sunday evening, December 27, 2015 at home after a brief illness. He was born March 21, 1929 in Old Town, the son of Floyd Roosevelt Lenfest and Viola H. Smith.
From the time he was born Floyd answered to the name of Skip, a pet name given to him by his mother and father. After the death of his father when Skip was only 5 years old, the family moved to Bangor to live with his mother's parents. After four years they were able to buy their own home which happened to be only a few houses down the street from his grandparent's house. Skip often joked that he would eat a meal at home and then go down the street and eat a second meal at his grandparents' house. Skip was a hard worker. At about the age of 10 he obtained a part time job delivering the Bangor Daily News. At the age of 14 he was working after school loading trucks for the Coca Cola Company. Once he had his driver's license he began making deliveries for the company during the summer. He worked for Coke all through High School (graduating in 1947 from Bangor High) as well as the following year. He often said that it was his job at Coke which kept him out of trouble. In 1948 he joined the Army and was stationed at Augusta, Georgia. He received his discharge papers in February of 1950 and he and his first wife Agnes returned to Bangor. His first daughter, Pamela, was born that same year. Skip worked in sales for a variety of companies until he obtained the position of bookkeeper at Wirthmore Feeds in early 1951. He divorced soon thereafter. In the latter part of 1952, he met the love of his life Kathleen (Kay) Sutton and they were married on December 5th, 1952. They lived happily in an apartment in Hampden for the first few years of their marriage where their son, Skip Jr. was born. With great excitement they bought their first house on Dexter Street in Bangor where their next two children, Carol and Chris were born. During this time, Skip became manager of Wirthmore Feeds and remained in that position until the closing of the store in 1965. In 1962, they purchased land on Eastern Avenue in Brewer and built their family home where they resided for 26 years. Their youngest daughter Lisa was born there. During their time on the avenue, Skip worked for Soule Glass briefly, then Bird & Son as a Sales Rep for the Northern part of the State of Maine and eventually co-founded his own company, American Nameplate, with wife Kay in 1978. The company specialized in various types of engraving and signage for local businesses. They were very successful and at age 65, Skip retired, Kay had retired the year before, selling the business to his oldest daughter Pamela. In their retirement, they purchased 70+ acres of land in Carmel, Maine and set about building their dream retirement home. Once the home was completed, Skip spent most of his time down in the woods clearing the back part of the property. Their property in Carmel was beautiful and many visitors declared it to be like heaven on earth. The sunrises and sunsets were unparalleled and the beauty of the grounds including a pond, fields and forests was magnificent. Skip was truly at peace here and nothing pleased him more than to spend time puttering around his property. Skip was the ultimate entrepreneur and always had a scheme or idea up his sleeve on how to add to his income and tried his hand at many different business ventures over the years. He and his wife Kathleen (Kay) were married for over 55 years. After her death in 2008, he was devastated and heartbroken. He had lost his lifelong friend and companion. He often said that she saved him and could never figure out what she saw in him as he had virtually nothing when they met. While in grief counseling he met his friend Charlotte Steeves and they formed a special friendship built on their mutual losses. They were able to find companionship with each other, reminisce about their spouses and enjoy new adventures. Skip was a lifetime member of the Blue Lodge Masons and the Anah Temple Shrine Club of Bangor, Maine. He will be missed greatly by his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Floyd is survived by his sons Floyd Roy Lenfest Jr. of Phoenix, Arizona and Christopher J. Lenfest and his wife Jody (Theriault) of Hebron, Ohio. His daughters Carol Ann Somers of Deltona, Florida and Lisa Janine Mayo and her husband Eric of South Portland, Maine. Twelve grandchildren: Jeffrey Lee, Jeremy, Michael, Robert, Floyd Roy III, Samuel, Aaron, Melissa, Shannon, Cody, Casey and Madeline. Nine great grandchildren: Jeffrey Aiden, Dashel, Lincoln, Chance, Kaleb, Ian, Isabella, Bryce and Izayiah. And his special friend Charlotte Steeves.
He was preceded in death by his parents Floyd Roosevelt Lenfest and Viola H. Smith, his brother Eugene Leslie Lenfest, his sister Anne Marie Lenfest (Thibodeau), his first wife Agnes Tuttle, his second wife, the love of his life, Kathleen Jean Sutton, his son Herbert Gove and his daughter Pamela Jo Lenfest Martin Clune.

Texto completo:   MACHIAS - Christine Augusta Holcombe, age 97, died peacefully December 30 at her home in Machias, Maine, surrounded by family. She was born August 28, 1918 in Trenton, NJ. She was the youngest child of George L. Thompson and Olivia Payran Thompson and was married to the late E. Fred Holcombe.
She was a 1936 graduate of Trenton Central High School and a 1941 graduate of Trenton State Teachers' College with a bachelor's degree in Music Education. Christine began piano lessons at age 5. Through her school years she played xylophone, violin and timpani, studied organ and attended a summer high school program at Julliard. She had a short career in teaching classroom music and was involved in church music all her life. She was assistant choir director/rehearsal accompanist at Grace Lutheran Church, Trenton, substitute organist at various churches, participated in church handbell choirs in Trenton and Machias and was the organist for Whitneyville Congregational Church.
She was employed by Educational Testing Service, Princeton, for 20 years. After retirement, she and her husband, Fred, enjoyed travel and time at Fulton Lake, Northfield, Maine, and later became residents of Machias, Maine. She was a longtime member of St. Paul United Methodist Church, Trenton, and in Maine had attended Center Street and Whitneyville Congregational Churches.
During her college years she was selected as the music counselor at Camp Mesacosa in Corinth, NY. The experience of those summers fostered her love of nature and living in the outdoors. Skills learned at Mesacosa helped her establish family camping routines at Fulton Lake. Her daughters spent summers at Camp Mesacosa and the songs and traditions became part of family lore. She was still singing the camp songs until she died.
Christine had a sharp mind and a quick wit. She entertained those around her with amusing tales and humor. She was an early adopter of the personal computer, acquiring a Radio Shack model in the 1980's, and enjoyed creating personal greeting cards, genealogy and address databases as well as playing games and reading obituaries online.
Christine will be sorely missed and lovingly remembered by family, friends and caregivers. She was preceded in death by her husband of 65 years, E. Fred Holcombe, and her siblings. She is survived by children, Ann H. Sharp and husband Phillip of Newton, MA, Judith H. Smith of Somerville, NJ, Linda J. Holcombe of Littleton, MA, Spencer Keith Holcombe of Ewing, NJ, Jon N. Holcombe of Machias, ME and Marion E. Holcombe of Ewing, NJ., 12 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. There will be a memorial service at Whitneyville Congregational Church and interment in Holcombe Riverview Cemetery, Lambertville, NJ, at the convenience of the family. Memorial contributions may be made to Whitneyville Congregational Church in Whitneyville, ME.

Resumen: Tuesday's snowstorm, which dumped six to 10 inches of the white stuff between Lewiston and the Canadian border, will help save Christmas vacation, one of the industry's busiest times, Whitcomb and other ski area owners said. "Last week we needed to make snow for Christmas week, and we couldn't," said Scott Shanaman, owner of Lost Valley ski area in Auburn, which opened Wednesday.

Texto completo:   Business was looking frighteningly bad to Hermon Mountain Ski Area owner Bill Whitcomb about a week ago.
Skiing in Maine, he said, usually begins in mid-December, with a good season starting on Dec. 1, offering plenty of time to groom trails for this week's Christmas school vacation. Only this year, two things were missing -- snow and, especially, cold weather.
"We had a trail half-done on Nov. 29. We started early thinking this was going to be a good year," Whitcomb said Tuesday, "but it just warmed up."
The unseasonably mild temperatures and lack of snowfall delayed the opening of Hermon Mountain until Dec. 26, its latest start in 30 years. Most of the 18 Alpine ski areas that are members of the Ski Maine Association reported similar delays.
Tuesday's snowstorm, which dumped six to 10 inches of the white stuff between Lewiston and the Canadian border, will help save Christmas vacation, one of the industry's busiest times, Whitcomb and other ski area owners said.
Still, most of them have only part of their trail systems online so far.
"Everybody, even the big places like Sugarloaf and Sunday River, is struggling this year," said Landon Fake, general manager of the municipally-owned Camden Snow Bowl.
"Last week we needed to make snow for Christmas week, and we couldn't," said Scott Shanaman, owner of Lost Valley ski area in Auburn, which opened Wednesday. "Missing half of Christmas week is not the start we wanted."
Being a week in which schools are closed, the time between Christmas and New Year's Day is important to the state's ski areas. Only the mid-February winter vacation for schools draws more skiers, owners said.
Tuesday's snowfall was important in a subtle way, said Bill Getman, general manager of Bigrock Mountain ski area of Mars Hill, which opened on Monday. It reminded people that ski season has arrived, he said.
"When people don't see snow in their yards, a lot of them don't think about winter sports at all. Snow piques their interests to go see what's out there," Whitcomb said.
Last year was similarly balmy in December through Christmas 2014, when it was 55 degrees and raining in much of Maine, Whitcomb said. This year, ski area owners hope for heavy snowfall right into March to make up for lost time.
"If we hadn't been through the same thing last year, we would have been panicking. Last year we were," Whitcomb admitted. "It turned out to be a good season because while it started late, people skied late, so we know it can turn out well."
Although a big blanket of snow, like what Tuesday's storm provided, is certainly welcomed by the state's smaller ski areas, the snow that really counts is the stuff they make themselves. There typically isn't enough natural snow to make good skiing trails, so manufacturing it allows mountains to create better trails and pack them down. Of the 18 Ski Maine Association members, only three -- Baker Mountain in Moscow, Mount Jefferson in Lee and Quoggy Jo in Presque Isle -- rely entirely on natural snow.
Manufactured snow allowed Sugarloaf, the state's largest ski area with 146 trails, to have 20 trails open on Wednesday, up from 11 the week before, workers there said. The state's second-largest, Sunday River, had 34 of its 129 trails open on Wednesday, with expectations to open 11 more by the weekend.
The need to make snow this year has been costly to Whitcomb, who estimated that he spent $15,000 making snow through Dec. 26 -- to little effect, given the warm temperatures.
"We are all struggling to make snow, we just don't have that many opportunities," said Fake, whose coastal location and weather allowed him to open last year on Jan. 1.
"If we are lucky, we will do half a week of business this week," Getman said.
Fake expects to have four trails open when his season starts on Friday. As of Wednesday, Fake's crews had been in snow production for 36 hours and were beginning to distribute it.
Manmade or natural, the lack of snow hurts the economies of the communities around ski areas, which are large part-time employers in wintertime. Most employ 60 to 70 ski instructors, snowmakers, mechanics, concessionaires, ski patrollers, medics, clerks and ticket takers -- once the mountain is open.
Good weather, or the lack of it, is something ski area workers learn to live with. Shanaman busied himself for most of the month repairing terrain and buildings at his ski area. Whitcomb endures the warm spells philosophically.
"I can't control the weather. I just have to worry about the things I can control," Whitcomb said. "I just tighten up the purse strings and I ride it out."
"If you get upset about the weather in this business," Shanaman said, "you can't be in this business."

It looks like there are more homeless veterans in Maine. But the numbers don't tell the whole story

Resumen: [...]a closer look at the numbers actually shows a recent decline in the number of homeless veterans once service providers began more aggressively trying to identify them and connect them with programs and housing vouchers. "In Portland, we have two outreach workers in the community aggressively engaging veterans who might be camping out and not taking advantage of services," Allen said, adding that another outreach worker has been deployed to the Midcoast area, persistently posting fliers for homeless veterans at soup kitchens, post offices and libraries.

Texto completo:   At first glance, statistics on thenumber of veterans in Maine who are homeless seem to point to a troubling trend.
From 2008 to 2015, the number of homeless identified as veterans jumped 70 percent in Maine, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which annually organizes a census of the country's homeless populations on one night.
The actual numbers are low compared with bigger states:There were 89 homeless veterans in Maine in 2008, and 151 this year. But that spike still contrasts with asmaller overall veteran population here in Maine, as well as adrop in the number of homeless veterans across the country, as highlighted in a recent Pew Charitable Trusts report.
But those who work with homeless veterans in Greater Portland -- which has the largest share of the state's homeless population -- say it's likely their efforts to identify and help these people that are responsible for the increase. In other words, we've probably counted more homeless veterans over the longer term because we're doing a better job of finding them, they say.
And a closer look at the numbers actually shows a recent decline in the number of homeless veterans once service providers began more aggressively trying to identify them and connect them with programs and housing vouchers.
"What we have seen specifically in the last four years is more systematic and broad outreach taking place funded through programs like the VA's [Support Services for Veterans Families] program," said Phil Allen, who heads Veterans Housing Services for Portland homeless service provider Preble Street. "What that translates to is finding more veterans. ... Now we are getting more self-engaged veterans, veterans who are coming to us, either through providers or by their own [volition], saying 'I saw a flier.'"
Eighteen months ago, President Barack Obama set a deadline of the end of 2015 for local governments around the country to find a home for all homeless veterans who want one. The majority of states -- 33, by Pew's count -- have made significant statistical progress toward that goal. So against that backdrop, Maine's increase stands out.
[Want to end homelessness? Try giving the homeless homes]
But a closer look at the figures suggests there's some truth to what Allen is saying. Although veterans make up a higher percentage of the state's overall homeless population -- 6.4 percent -- than at any point in at least a decade, the overall number of homeless veterans in Maine is actually on a three-year decline.
Advocates counted 164 in 2013 -- which is around the time that more aggressive outreach efforts would likely have begun moving the needle -- and that number has fallen each year since. In 2014, the number fell to 152, then by a tiny increment to 151 this year.
"In Portland, we have two outreach workers in the community aggressively engaging veterans who might be camping out and not taking advantage of services," Allen said, adding that another outreach worker has been deployed to the Midcoast area, persistently posting fliers for homeless veterans at soup kitchens, post offices and libraries.
In contrast, states with bigger cities and larger populations have had more staff and resources to identify homeless veterans over the years and connect them with resources.
California, New York and Texas, for example, are among the states showing huge gains in getting homeless veterans off the streets, according to Pew.
Nationwide, the number of homeless veterans dropped by 27 percent, to 47,504, between 2011 and 2015, according to Pew. That roughly coincided with a ramp-up in federal funding for programs targeting homeless veterans, from $399 million in 2009 to $1.37 billion in 2014.

Mike Merrill, who manages Volunteers of America Northern New England's veterans facilities in Saco and Biddeford, said even a recent change of phrasing being used on a questionnaire distributed in Maine during the aforementioned Point In Time Survey has made a difference.
"We've happened to see an increase based on the wording of the surveys out there," Merrill said. "Some veterans don't think of themselves as vets because they never saw combat. But those who know the lingo know that there are peacetime vets as well as wartime vets. Now that they've changed the wording to say 'Have you served in the military?' instead of 'Are you a veteran?', there are more people who answer 'yes' to that question."

Roger Goodoak, the founder of the Portland-based Maine Homeless Veterans Alliance, regularly patrols the city with blankets, gloves and other supplies in search of veterans living on the streets.
"I haven't found a qualified veteran in weeks," said Goodoak, a Navy veteran who experienced homelessness himself in the past.
"It's very difficult right now to find homeless veterans on the streets. They're getting identified and processed very rapidly," he said. "If you come into Portland, you get into a shelter and they find out you're a qualified veteran, they take care of you. They have a 'Let's get veterans off the streets' mentality, and they're successful."

Texto completo:   ROCKLAND, Maine -- The First Universalist Church in Rockland recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Rev. Mark Glovin's calling to the congregation. Nearly 200 members of the congregation, friends, relatives and colleagues gathered on Dec. 5 to present a multigenerational celebration of his decade at First Universalist.
The Rev. Kate Braestrup, chaplain of the Maine Warden Service and the First Universalist Community Minister since 2004, led the celebration. The evening was filled with music and children, two themes that pay tribute to both the First Universalist Church in Rockland and to Rev. Glovin himself.
The choir, led by Music Director Sojourner Hodges, sang "Eyes of the World" by the Grateful Dead while a procession of children presented Rev. Glovin with a chain of prayer flags made by church families.
Older children from the "Building Bridges" program, which aims to bridge the divide between our nation and other cultures, recited a creation story the children had written and illustrated.
Annie Kiermaier and Lucie Bauer, longtime members of the congregation, presented the history of the First Universalist Church, which dates back to 1820 in Rockland, and a photo-slideshow was presented with the highlights of Rev. Glovin's work in the community over the past decade.
The evening also was a celebration of the accomplishments that the First Universalist Church in Rockland has worked toward those 10 years.
In 2005, the First Universalist Church became the first church in the state to develop a Community Supported Agriculture partnership with an organic farm.
In 2006, church members traveled to New Orleans to provide help to those affected by Hurricane Katrina.
In 2008, building on the success with the CSA, the First Universalist Church worked with the Midcoast Fishermen's Association to establish the first Community Supported Fishery partnership.
In 2009, Rev. Glovin stood with other Maine clergy at a legislative hearing in Augusta in support of Marriage Equality.
In 2010, the church earned a Green Sanctuary Certification from the national Universalist Unitarian Association for their action in response to environmental issues, including their action with The Window Dressers to make window inserts for the midcoast community.
Another milestone celebrated was the decision in 2005 to start giving one half of the Sunday cash offertory plate to a chosen charity. In recent years, plate offerings benefited Out! As I Want to Be, Mid-Coast Health Net and Rockland District Nursing Association, among others.
For information on the First Universalist Church in Rockland, call 594-8750, or email mail@uurockland.org. The First Universalist Church is located at 345 Broadway.

Maine drug plan's funding source could complicate passage

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Leaders in the Maine Legislature have proposed funding most of a $4.8 million package aimed at curbing the state's drug epidemic with money gained in a settlement with a Wall Street ratings agency.
The funding mechanism is supported by Attorney General Janet Mills, the Democrat who controls the money, but Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, has challenged her authority over it before and it could emerge as a point of contention on the bill, which will have public hearings on Tuesday.
A bipartisan group of legislative leaders including Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, and Senate Minority Leader Justin Alfond, D-Portland, rolled out the plan earlier this month.
That proposal would provide money to hire 10 new drug agents and expand treatment, education and prevention efforts in Maine, which had 174 drug overdose deaths in the first nine months of 2015 and is on pace for up to 250 this year, which Mills' office said would be a record. The proposal allocates $2.4 million for enforcement and $2.4 million for treatment and education.
But specifics on how to fund it weren't made public until text of the bill was posted online by Tuesday. It calls for moving $2.5 million in settlement money to the state's General Fund to pay part of the bill. The rest will be funded by the Legislature's surplus, according to spokespeople for Eves and Alfond.
Maine won $21.5 million as part of a settlement with Standard & Poor's announced by Mills' office in February. The federal government and 19 states, including Maine, accused the agency of defrauding investors in the run-up to the most recent recession.
In February, Mills said her office would control the money, which would be spent on consumer protection. But later that month, LePage challenged her authority over the money, calling it "repugnant" under the Maine Constitution.
On Wednesday, Tim Feeley, a spokesman for Mills, said she was consulted about the bill and "feels this is an appropriate use for the settlement funds."
LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett declined comment, as the office normally does on initial legislative proposals.
It could change as legislative committees consider the bill, which will begin with public hearings before the Legislature's budget-writing, public safety and health committees on Tuesday. Testimony on the funding mechanism will be taken that morning and afternoon.
House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, who has withheld support for the anti-drug plan so far, said while he understands the importance of addressing the drug crisis, the proposed funding source "muddies the water" about finding a solution.
"I think it raises a certain complexity to the issue of looking at not only drug prevention treatment, but now looking at a controversial funding source," he said.
But Thibodeau and House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, defended the proposal, with McCabe noting that the settlement money didn't come from taxes.
"If somebody's got a better idea, then by all means, we're all ears," Thibodeau said. "That seemed like a reasonable compromise to me."

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine's papermakers in 2015 received many of the biggest payments from a program that gives tax breaks for equipment and facilities.
The state has allowed businesses to recover property taxes paid on certain equipment and facilities put in service roughly between 1995 and 2007. About 1,400 companies tapped that reimbursement program in the last year. Among the top were papermakers such as Verso, Lincoln Paper and Tissue and Sappi.
The state makes the payments through the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement program, or BETR (pronounced "better"). Payments from BETR totalled about $33.3 million, or around 1 percent of the state's annual budget, during the state's fiscal year ended June 2015.
Those payments for the state's 2015 fiscal year went out to reimburse companies for equipment they had in operation during the 2013 calendar year, with some of the largest reimbursements going to paper companies, some of which stopped operating this year.
Of the total reimbursed against 2013 property taxes, about 10 percent went to companies owned by Verso Paper Corp., controlled by Apollo Global Management.
Other major recipients of reimbursements include the parent company of paper maker Sappi, Poland Spring owner Nestle, Hannaford owner Delhaize and National Semiconductor owner Texas Instruments and Bath Iron Works owner General Dynamics.
Those aren't the only tax breaks received from the state, but those under the BETR program are the only ones disclosed individually. For some companies, Bath Iron Works in particular, the state's annual report discloses other incentives, including the at least $3 million-per-year shipbuilding facility credit that the company can claim for 20 years. That credit started in 1997.
As a condition of that credit, the company has to report its annual investments, which it listed as $389 million through 2014, when it invested another $30.5 million in facility improvements.
A new model
In recent years, the state has shifted away from the reimbursement model for such business equipment incentives, preferring local exemptions for the equipment.
The difference is that a business benefits from the exemption immediately, rather than having to pay the local tax and then file for a reimbursement check from the state in a later year. The shift has contributed to a steady decline in major recipients for the BETR program.
The total going to companies receiving $1,000 or more in reimbursements has decreased in recent years.
The Legislature's reduction in reimbursement rates also contributed to that decline during the past two years, dropping to 90 percent and then 80 percent in 2014. The full reimbursement will be available to companies in the budget approved for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.
The shift away from a reimbursement model for those tax breaks has many implications, which came to the forefront in budget talks during the last legislative session, when Gov. Paul LePage's initial budget proposed transitioning companies using the BETR program to the exemption program, called BETE.
The change stood to lower tax revenue for municipalities, raising opposition from many communities, including Bangor, which has about 300 businesses with property that is reimbursed under the BETR program, according to legislative testimony earlier this year by Bangor assessor Philip Drew.
The city collects about $1.7 million in taxes from that property, which is then reimbursed in full or in part (the rate declines after 12 years of exemptions). Under the exemption program, the state reimburses municipalities for 50 percent of the revenue they don't collect, meaning the current revenue on any property in the BETR program would have been cut in half.
For disclosure, the shift to BETE means one other thing: property tax breaks will not need to be individually disclosed by business.
Since the BETR checks are cut by the state, the Department of Economic and Community Development and Maine Revenue Services discloses that all in one place. That will continue until all of qualifying property is out of commission.
But disclosures of exempt property under the BETE program likely won't be as detailed. New accounting rules that take effect in fiscal year 2017 require municipalities to report tax abatements with economic development goals by program, but don't require disclosure by recipient.

Texto completo:   The University of New Hampshire men's hockey team wasted little time dispatching the University of Maine Black Bears on Wednesday night, receiving goals 15 seconds apart from freshmen Ara Nazarian and Marcus Vela in the first 2 minutes, 10 seconds en route to an easy 7-0 nonconference victory at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Seven players scored for UNH, which extended its unbeaten streak to six games (5-0-1) and improved to 8-6-4.
The streak includes three wins and a tie in four games against the Black Bears, including a 5-4 win Tuesday night in Portland.
Sophomore goalie Danny Tirone made 21 saves in posting his third career shutout and first of the season. It was the sixth time Maine has been shut out this season.
Maine is winless in its last four games (0-3-1), all against UNH, and fell to 4-11-4.
It is the worst loss suffered by a Maine team under third-year head coach Red Gendron.
"We were awful," said Gendron. "That's my responsibility. End of story."
Gendron called it the team's worst performance of the year "by far."
Dan Correale scored a valuable power-play goal with 32 seconds left in the first period, his fourth power-play goal in the four games with Maine, to increase the lead to 3-0.
Maxim Gaudreault extended the lead just 1:56 into the second period, sophomore Michael McNicholas notched his first career goal 5:14 later to make it 5-0 and Kyle Smith expanded the lead later in the period.
Nazarian scored for the third consecutive game against Maine just 1:55 after the opening whistle.
Vela took a shot from the top of the right circle that was kicked out by Maine goalie Matt Morris. But the rebound spilled over to an unattended Nazarian in the bottom of the left circle and he swept it home before Morris could scramble over.
Fifteen seconds later, Nazarian and Vela converted a two-on-one as Vela one-timed a Nazarian pass behind Morris.
"Those early goals deflated us a little. But they shouldn't have," said Maine junior center Cam Brown. "They're a good offensive team, they got some chances and they capitalized."
Correale scored his eighth power play goal of the season and 13th overall by redirecting Matias Cleland's shot from the point behind Morris.
UNH outshot UNH 11-6 in the first period and finished with a 39-21 edge.
Gaudreault converted a Kyle Smith rebound early in the middle period and McNicholas scored from a tight angle at the bottom of the right circle.
That ended the night for Morris, who finished with 11 saves on 16 shots.
He was replaced by sophomore Sean Romeo, who made his first appearance since Oct. 20 when he played the third period of a 4-0 loss to Quinnipiac.
Smith knocked in a pass from Gaudreault that deflected to him off Romeo.
Jason Salvaggio capped the scoring with a power-play goal in the third period.
Gaudreault had two assists to go with his goal. Salvaggio, McNicholas, Vela, Nazarian and Smith all had a goal and an assist.
Romeo wound up with 21 saves on 23 shots.
Maine will entertain ECAC team Colgate University on Jan. 8-9 in Orono.

Texto completo:   At last, on Tuesday, at our house in Stockton Springs and all across the state, it snowed. When I awoke at 2:30 a.m., as is my unfortunate habit, the panes of the big window beside the bed were silver, not black, and a gentle but persistent wind was nuzzling along the north wall of the house. As I lay listening, a plow truck scraped past the end of our driveway for the first time this season. Its headlights scattered golden shadows across the ceiling as it rumbled off down the lonely road, and quiet descended again.
The calm snowfall triggered an enjoyable "earworm" -- a familiar, repeating melody in my brain. Back in mid-December, I had the pleasure of performing in a winter holiday program with the Bangor Choral Society. Among the pieces we sang in our three concerts was an arrangement of the first stanza of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's melancholy poem, "Snow-flakes."
Snow-flakes
Out of the bosom of the Air,
Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
Silent, and soft, and slow
Descends the snow.
Longfellow, who lived from 1807 to 1882, was a native of Portland, a graduate of Bowdoin College and, by many accounts, the most popular and prolific poet of his day. He is best-known for his long story-poems, including "The Song of Hiawatha," "The Wreck of the Hesperus," "Paul Revere's Ride" and "Evangeline, a Tale of Acadia." But generations of Americans have embraced "Snow-flakes" for its simple, muted expression of grief. Despite the poem's inherent sadness, it was a joy to sing it with my fellow choristers.
There were several other snow-themed numbers on our holiday program, too, which amused the singers and our audiences as well, given the balmy temperatures and near-total absence of snow in the whole southern half of the state. I think we all enjoyed a certain sense of reprieve, along with most Mainers -- especially after last winter's harshness -- but also experienced some uneasiness as Christmas came and went with daytime temperatures in the 50s and 60s, without a flake of snow to be seen.
The truth is, I love winter. I moved to Maine from Virginia over 40 years ago, in part because of the clear delineation of the seasons and the reliable opportunity to explore the out-of-doors in the silent beauty of a recent snowfall. The prospect of a Maine winter without snow makes me not only sad, but nervous.
So all day on Tuesday, as I watched the snow accumulate quietly in the low meadow that fronts the road, I hummed the snowy tune I had practiced so diligently in the weeks leading up to my choral performances. I wasn't feeling melancholy at all. I fed wood into the old kitchen cookstove and contemplated pulling on my cold-weather gear and tromping outside to help Douglas clear the dooryard and the long, sloping driveway. I felt both calmed and elated by the promise of a clean, cold, white winter ahead.
By mid-April, I know, I'll be aching to see the early buds rising on the willows and to sniff the sweet scent of the warming earth. But for now -- Tuesday, today, tomorrow and in the weeks ahead -- I am grateful for Longfellow's sweet, sad, wintry poem, this soft blanket of snow and Maine's four-season beauty.

Texto completo:   If you thought you spotted blossoms on your rhododendron and forsythia plants just days before much of Maine was blasted by the first winter snow and sleet storm of the season, your eyes did not deceive you.
The topsy-turvy December temperatures -- on Christmas, Bangor tied its record high of 54 degrees and Portland broke the record with 62 degrees -- meant that some plants got confused and decided to start to bloom earlier than normal, according to University of Maine Cooperative Extension horticulturist Kate Garland.
"It's basically jumping the gun on the next season," Garland said, adding that the unseasonable blooms shouldn't be a big deal to the plant in the long term.
According to the horticulturist, plants such as forsythia and rhododendrons require a certain amount of cold for the flowers to develop. Then, the blooms will open up with the right amount of warmth. This fall, both of those things happened.
"In some years, we have this wacky series of days," Garland said. "The bud has met its chilling requirement, and all of a sudden, we get this window of enough warm degree days for that flower to open."
The flowers that have opened will not bloom again next spring, she said. However, it doesn't mean there won't be flowers come spring -- whenever that is.
"It's usually not a high percentage of the flowering plants. It's not a huge deal," Garland said. "Those flower buds will not rebloom in the spring, but probably there will be plenty more flowers."
Maine trees, on the other hand, do not usually flower or dramatically leaf-out drastically early.
"Our trees are very robust," Garland said.
While some plants need the requisite chilling and warming before they burst into bloom, others, such as poinsettia, are triggered solely by the amount of daylight. Also, Garland said that some onion plants will not form a bulb unless the days are short or long enough.
"Plants are wildly confusing, and they vary from type to type," she said. "I almost try to liken it to being a vet for thousands of species."
Garland said that because this year has been wacky, temperature-wise, gardeners who have bulbs in the ground are encouraged to insulate the ground with material such as straw or boughs.
"We can always count on the fluctuating of temperature," she said. "This year, it seemed to happen a little earlier."

Texto completo:   Support our local police
I have a sign in my front yard that reads "I support local police."
I was listening to the news about the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, and I was impressed by the response of the local police there. This got me thinking about our local police in Bucksport and how they are our neighbors, their kids go to our local schools, they pay property taxes to our town and, quite often, we'll run into them at the local grocery, hardware or drug stores.
And if terrorists were to attack Bucksport, our local police would become our first line of defense and it could cost them their lives as they defend us.
Why wait for a tragedy to show our support? Support our local police now.

No workers or no jobs?
According to a Dec. 18 Bangor Daily News editorial, Maine lacks educated workers. Business owners claim that a "lack of qualified candidates" is the "most common reason" jobs go unfilled. We've heard this many times before. It may well be true.
On the other hand, we've been told over and over (sometimes in BDN editorials) that Maine graduates are leaving the state in droves because there are no jobs for educated people. I don't know which problem we have, but holding contradictory thoughts probably won't solve it.

Stand with the Penobscot Nation
I am disheartened and frankly angry about federal Judge George Singal's ruling against the Penobscot Nation over its claim to the eponymous river. The ethic of preservation and mutual enjoyment of that waterway -- which the state argued it is protecting -- is central to the Penobscots' way of life.
Attorney General Janet Mills has pursued this classification change without clearly stating on whose behalf this territorial reduction is being pushed. If the question is which group would best preserve and protect the river, the Penobscot Nation, with its reservation including islands in the river, has the strongest interest in maintaining the Penobscot River's vitality and balance as its ancestral homeland and sustenance food source.
This ruling and Mills' actions betray the best interests of this watershed and its people. Removing territory from indigenous people is a practice that should be stopped. This action furthers a confrontational posture with the Penobscot Nation that is both inappropriate and oppressive.
Please join me and many others in holding Mills to account and supporting our friends and neighbors, in the spirit of peace and unity this holiday season and year-round.
I'll end with a few words from Dawnland Environmental Defense's Facebook page: "Citizens of the state need to pressure their government; Penobscots cannot be responsible for leading this charge after 195 years of territorial theft and losses at the hands of state government, we need your help. Do what you can, where you can."

Whither the new Chase Smith, Muskie?
The season of giving this year has been marked instead by fear mongering, blaming the victims, talk of wall building, closing borders, racism and religious prejudice.
I am not worrying about Syrian refugees or welfare recipients playing the lottery. Instead, I worry about climate change, mass shootings at malls, schools and Planned Parenthood clinics.
I worry about the proliferation of American hate groups, food insecurity and welfare cuts, inappropriate drug and mental health services.
I also worry about the attempt to gut the Land for Maine's Future and other environmental programs.
Where is this generation's Margaret Chase Smith or Ed Muskie?

Texto completo:   Subhead: Local members earn awards
PORTLAND -- The 40th annual American Agri-Women (AAW) Convention was held in Portland recently with 147 in attendance. Maine Agri-Women hosted the event, with the theme "Harvesting for the Future."
Two local women were recognized for their dedication to the AAW. Pam Townsend of Mars Hill, president of Maine Agri-Women, and Diane Hemphill of Presque Isle received the AAW President's Award.
The Maine delegation included Sue McCrum, National AAW president; Pam Townsend, Maine Agri-Women president; and Carol Adams, Diane Hemphill, Sandra Durepo, Dixie Delong, Kristie Bray, Nancy Wright, Roberta LaBrie, Martha Lavertu, Kristin Devoe, Mary Anne Buck, Judy Kenney, Joan Flewelling, Valorie Flewelling, Ann Fitz-Patrick Jones, Patti McCrum, Brianne O'Leary and Deena Albert Parks.
A variety of issues concerning many aspects of agriculture and the future were addressed by speakers, including Walt Whitcomb, Maine Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry; Marge Kilkelly, senior policy adviser to Sen. Angus King; and John Rebar, executive director of the University of Maine Cooperative Extension.
Also speaking were Karen Worcester, executive director of Wreaths Across America; Lt. Col. (Retired) John J. McDaniel, founder of Wounded Warriors in Action Foundation, Inc; and Kathy Day, RN, patient activist and advocate. A "Maine Lobster Event" was held at Pineland Farms in New Gloucester with downeast humorist Gary Crocker providing entertainment. Entertainment at the annual banquet and awards presentation was provided by the band "Ted and the Boys" from Houlton and Portland.
Two days of annual business sessions focused on the many aspects and diversities facing agriculture today. The election of officers was held, along with National Committee and Executive Board meetings.
The Veritas Award was presented to Michael Coffman, PhD, president of Environmental Perspectives Incorporated (epi-us.com) and CEO of Sovereignty International (sovereignty.net) in Bangor. He has had over 30 years of university teaching, research and consulting experience in forestry and environmental sciences. The coveted Veritas Award is given to a person or persons who have given public witness to the "pursuit of truth" in accordance to the principals and the AAW's statement of philosophy.
Tours during the convention were taken to Pineland Farms Dairy, Hydroponic Greenhouse and Creamery; Green Thumb Farms; Maine Line Products; Allagash Brewing Company; Linda Bean's Lobster Facility; Breakwater Vineyards; and the LL Bean Flagship Store, along with a stop at Owl's Head Lighthouse and Linda Bean's Maine Kitchen and Topside Tavern.
The midyear AAW policy meeting will be held in Wichita, Kansas in March, and there will be a fly-in/symposium in June in Washington, D.C. The next annual convention will be held in Raleigh, N.C.
American Agri-Women is a national coalition of more than 40,000 farm, ranch and agribusiness women representing 60 state and commodity affiliates. It is a grassroots, all-volunteer organization and the oldest women's agricultural organization in the country, recognized as one of the top 12 U.S. women's business groups by the Business Women's Organization. Membership is comprised of individual members, plus 56 state and commodity organizations.
Since 1974, AAW members have worked together to educate consumers, advocate for agriculture and offer networking and professional development opportunities.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine - Winter weather that spun off a series of deadly storms in the Midwest brought the season's first big punch to the Northeast on Tuesday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain greasing roads, sending drivers spinning and keeping people indoors amid sub-freezing temperatures.
Parts of northern New England already had about 6 inches of snow by early evening, and isolated areas could get 10 inches or more by the time it ends late in the day, according to the National Weather Service.
The weather made for a sloppy mess in parts of metro Boston, where memories linger of last winter's record-breaking snowfall. But as Fernando Gonterman waited for a train from Harvard Square to his job at Massachusetts General Hospital, he was unfazed.
"Weather is weather. Just deal with it, right?" he said.
In snow-loving Vermont, Chassidy Byrd, the assistant manager at a gas station and convenience store in Plainfield, said the storm returned the state to a sense of normal.
Without any snow, "it didn't feel like Vermont," she said.
Mike Kistner, of the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, said the storm that chilled the Northeast is linked to the system that produced deadly tornadoes in the Midwest beginning Saturday, then brought heavy snow, ice, rain, flooding and blustery winds as it moved toward the Great Lakes. That storm system killed dozens, including many who drowned in floodwaters and others caught up in tornadoes.
Kistner said the northeastern spur of the system was tracking toward Cape Cod, Mass., before it blows out to sea late Tuesday.
Forecasters said snowfall totals would range from an inch or less in parts of southern New England before turning over to rain and sleet, while northern regions would see more. In central and northern New York, 4 to 8 inches of snow was anticipated and police were investigating whether slick roads caused a crash overnight that killed a state corrections officer driving home from work.
The snow went a long way toward making up for a warm, snowless December in the Northeast where several spots are flirting with record warmth for the month. The temperature topped 60 degrees on Christmas Day in Maine, and normally, Portland would have seen more than a foot of snow by Tuesday, Kistner said.
There were no major traffic problems, but some vehicles got stuck in the mounting snow around rush hour. Traffic was mostly light because schools were closed for Christmas vacation and many businesses were closed.
Portland resident Aaron Lovely said he walked through the worst of the snow for about 20 minutes to get to his job at a downtown record store, which was mostly empty late Tuesday morning. He said the trek through the snow "wasn't the worst," and the winter's lack of weather so far was perhaps more unnerving.
"It was kind of weird that there wasn't snow until now," Lovely said. "It's about time."
Eric Janelle, of Weare, N.H., was happy for the businesses that rely on the snow, but memories of last year's relentless onslaught tempered his enthusiasm.
"It's good that it's finally snowing here at the end of December, but on the other hand, it was so bad last year that it's nice to have a little bit of a break," he said.
A minute later, as he hopped over a pile of slush on Concord's Main Street, he shouted over his shoulder: "I sure didn't miss this!"

Texto completo:   Especially in a rural state like Maine, a valid driver's licence is key to independent living and taking part in routine activities, such as getting to medical appointments and haircuts, shopping for groceries and visiting with friends and family. While older drivers and their families fret about losing that independence as driving skills diminish with age, car manufacturers are busy developing technologies that can make it safer for Mainers to stay on the road well into their 70s, 80s and even longer.
"Permanently giving up the keys can have severe consequences for the health and mental well-being of older adults," Peter Kissinger, president and CEO of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, said in a recent news release. "New technologies and a focus on safe driving can help seniors remain behind the wheel for years to come."
Based on recent research, the AAA Foundation identified six new safety technologies -- three aimed at improving parking -- as providing "high value for older adults" by reducing the risk of crashes and improving driver comfort.
-- Forward collision warning with mitigation. This feature detects an impending collision with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal or other object in the road and automatically applies the brakes.
-- Automatic crash notification. Emergency notification systems, such as OnStar, use built-in sensors and call-button features to connect with a live responder in the event of a collision, illness or other problem.
-- Navigation assistance. GPS technology provides a map display and voiced directions, boosting driver confidence and reducing anxiety and confusion.
-- Parking assistance with camera display. Cameras provide clear vision in every direction, lessening the chance of hitting an adjacent vehicle or other object while parking.
-- Cross-traffic warning. Sensors alert driver to oncoming traffic when backing out of a parking space.
-- Semi-autonomous parking assistance. This technology takes over steering and braking while moving the vehicle into a parallel or perpendicular parking space.
From padded dashboards, lap belts and power steering to airbags, cruise control and back-up beepers, car safety features have evolved steadily over the years, according to Jim Prescott, general sales manager at the Darling's Honda Nissan Volvo dealership in Bangor.
And, he noted, consumers have met many of those developments with skepticism. But with time and refinement, he said, these and other features have been widely accepted.
"Initially there were concerns that the car was somehow running itself. Now drivers expect these features. Cruise control is as standard these days as air conditioning and power steering," he said. And, he added, newer technologies already are attracting forward-looking buyers, including older drivers and their safety-minded families.
In addition to the AAA Foundation's list, Prescott said older drivers are very accepting of "blind spot" technology that detects another car approaching in a passing lane and flashes a small warning light on the side-view mirror.
Other popular options include a sensor that automatically corrects steering if the vehicle strays out of its travel lane, adaptive cruise control that brakes automatically to maintain a set distance between vehicles and a transparent display that appears on the driver-side windshield, as on a teleprompter, to keep track of travel directions, speed limits and other vital information without the driver having to glance at various instrumentation.
These new safety technologies are not inexpensive, Prescott acknowledged -- a fully loaded Volvo sport utility vehicle on his lot runs upward of $68,000. But similar features are available on many less pricey vehicle makes, he said, including Hondas, Subarus and Fords.
Changes you can make yourself
"Staying in your own home and living independently as you age is 100 percent tied to your ability to drive," said Susan Poole, a 73-year-old volunteer from Holden who teaches a one-day course in safe driving techniques for AARP Maine. In addition to brushing up their on-road skills, participants age 55 and older typically earn a discount off their car insurance. Poole's course costs $15 for AARP members, $20 for nonmembers and is offered through the Eastern Area Agency on Aging in Bangor.
According to Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles statistics, 950,580 people held a Maine Class C driving license in 2014. Of these, 125,705 were 70 years old or older -- 56,192 men and 69,513 women. Older drivers live in every part of the state, but rural areas are likely to have a higher percentage of older drivers than urban areas.
Maine law requires that drivers have a vision test on the first license renewal after turning 40 years of age, at every second renewal after 40 and at every renewal after turning 62. Other than that, older drivers are subject to a complex set of provisions related to specific medical, emotional and cognitive disorders that apply to drivers of all ages. Review of an individual driver's competency can be triggered by reporting from a medical professional, a law enforcement agency or a concerned citizen and is conducted by a medical advisory board within the bureau of motor vehicles.
Poole said there is no surefire way to predict at what age an individual's driving skills will begin to deteriorate. But older drivers often make voluntary changes in their driving behaviors, she said, such as avoiding driving at night, in bad weather, in unfamiliar areas, in heavy traffic and on the highway. Other practical strategies include keeping more distance between vehicles to allow for slower reaction times and being extra disciplined about using lights and turn signals.
Poole said new vehicle safety technologies can seem daunting to older drivers, but she reminds her students that they have adapted to many changes over time.
"When we were 16, there were no turn signals: You rolled down the window and signaled with your arm," she said. "There were no seat belts, no sideview mirrors, no pushbuttons to roll down a window, no little interior levers to open the gas cap or release the trunk latch.
"These [new safety features] will help you drive more safely and comfortably," she said. "The trick is to find the ones you want to pay for. And then, don't leave the dealership without learning to use them."

Texto completo:   Celebrate the Hello Kitty tree
We all choose to symbolize this joyus time of year in a different way, but sometimes this expression can be clouded by political red tape. Unfortunately, that was the case last week at Bangor High School. A teacher's attempt to bring joy to her students was censored in the drive for political correctness. In this culture of equality, we have overlooked the meaning of the season.
By putting up a pink Hello Kitty tree, Catherine Gordon was attempting to bring her students joy during the tough mid-year period of the school year. Unfortunately, the stigma of the symbol overtook her good intentions.
The tree was called into question because school administrators believed it favored one religion over another, producing religious inequality. This, however, is simply not the case. If we truly want to strive for equality for all, then all symbols of the season should be welcomed.
The way in which the school department handled the fallout of this event must also be called into question. In her press release, Superintendent of Schools Betsy Webb said, "Our focus is educating students to become global citizens with the necessary 21st century skills for college and career readiness for their future success."
If this truly is the mission of this school department, then religious tolerance is what should be emphasized. As students, a time will come in our lives when we will work with someone who has views different than our own. If the school department strives to teach us to succeed in the future, then tolerance for all beliefs must be emphasized over political correctness.

A living wage for Maine
So a national report says the living wage in Maine is $15.77. Doesn't surprise me. Perhaps we need to look at why owners of businesses need to make so much more than the people who actually make them the money.

Clean the Penobscot River
The Dec. 17 Bangor Daily News article on the ruling on Penobscot Nation's lawsuit over its rights to the Penobscot River posed more questions than answers. I found federal Judge George Singal's interpretation of the Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act confusing and even conflicting, so I read the whole decision and found instead of the ruling being contradictory, it was instead the law that made no sense. As I understand it, the law restricts tribal territory to the land on the islands but provides sustenance fishing rights in the Penobscot River. The judge provided clarification and interpretation of the wording of the law and in the process has pointed out some of its weaknesses.
Separate but related to this ruling is the issue of the clean water standards of the Penobscot River. The Environmental Protection Agency has set two different standards for Maine's waters -- one for sustenance fishing practiced by tribal peoples and one for standard consumption expected for most Maine residents. These standards involve safe levels of arsenic, mercury and several other toxins. Maine is suing the EPA over this issue.
Why would it be a bad thing to rid the waters of the Penobscot River of these toxins and keep them at levels below what is considered safe for sustenance fishing? Is it possible that it is because of the money it would cost the industries and municipalities further up the river to clean the water? Perhaps we should consider spending our tax dollars on cleaning up the river instead of fighting not to.

True Maine spirit
After reading the Dec. 21 BDN article about the Springfield Community Chapel donating a house to the Dare-Hill family, I am proud of what I think the true Maine spirit is all about. This is the feeling I grew up with and think Mainers still have. People are good everywhere, but it's a few bad people who make a lot of good people look bad.
Money, greed and apathy are not the norm but sometimes seem that way. Everyone has it good, maybe not as good as the Dare-Hill family.
I am proud to be a native Mainer. I just wish I could read more articles like this one.

Texto completo:   More than 1 million Maine voters are among more than 190 million from across the country whose information was leaked onto the Internet this week through the release of a mysterious, misconfigured voter database.
The leaked data included information a person gives when he or she first registers to vote: name, address, date of birth and party affiliation. The leaked information also includes whether an individual voted in recent general and primary elections dating as far back as 2000, according to Databreaches.net. The email addresses and phone numbers of some voters also may have been among the leaked information.
No one has been able to identify the owner of the database nor how the data of Maine voters made its way into the database. Databreaches.net confirmed Monday night that the database is no longer publicly accessible.
Maine officials aren't aware of any malicious attempt to access the state's central voter registration system, Kristen Muszynski, the Maine secretary of state's office spokeswoman, said Monday afternoon. But there are a few plausible paths to explain how more than 1 million Maine voter records made their way online.
Maine voter data are considered "quasi-public" under state law, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said Tuesday afternoon. It's not a public record, but political parties, party committees, campaign committees and political action committees can purchase voter data -- names, addresses and whether a Mainer voted in recent elections -- for a political party's activities, get-out-the-vote efforts and campaigns.
The state does not sell other information, such as voters' phone numbers and email addresses, to political groups, though Dunlap noted that once they acquire a state's voter registration data, political groups and campaigns may aggregate information from other databases to add phone numbers and emails.
Political groups that obtain voter registration data are prohibited under state law from using it for commercial purposes or to sell and distribute it, Dunlap said. He said it's unlikely the leak will result in legal action on the part of the state because it appears to have been accidental. But without further information about the nature of the leak and who is responsible, Dunlap could not rule out any state action to address the leak.
While names, addresses and party affiliation data are not particularly useful on their own, if the data were combined with sensitive information -- such as Social Security numbers -- obtained from data breaches, it could be useful to identity thieves, said Jane Carpenter of Maine Identity Services, a company that advises victims and law enforcement agencies across the country on how to deal with identity theft.
"The reality is we have a lot of information about ourselves out there," Dunlap said.

Resumen: BeInformed For Gov. Paul LePage and Mary Mayhew, this is clearly more about partisan political ideology than it is about the economics of improving health care access, decreasing uncompensated care costs, increasing state's GDP and creating health care sector job growth, that all studies show are happening in states that expanded Medicaid. --

Texto completo:   Sun Journal writer Scott Thistle, " Addiction care at heart of latest push for Maine Medicaid expansion":
MaineCare needs to be expanded for many reasons. One being many working, taxpaying residents are falling through the cracks. They make too much money to qualify for MaineCare and too little to be able to buy from the exchange -- with one huge kicker in all this, they also don't qualify for a hardship exemption.
Thanks, GOP and Gov. Paul LePage, for making it impossible for some working people in Maine to purchase or qualify for health insurance in this state.
-- Eibhlihin
Expansion would provide insurance for 70,000 hardworking Mainers.
At the same time, Gov. Paul LePage is trying to cut EBT benefits, General Assistance and any safety net people had. There would be less reliance on these programs if more residents were insured. Insurance = prevention = healthier residents = less hospital debt = increased revenue and jobs, all while the feds cover 100 percent through 2016. It's no brainer, which pretty much sums up this administration.
-- rplantlover
It is not insurance if you don't pay a premium. It is an entitlement program -- period.
-- Bass Harbor
Unfortunately, people such as Gov. Paul LePage just don't care about the poor. They remind me of that oft quoted line uttered by Ebenezer Scrooge about dying and decreasing the surplus population.
-- 66readerwriter
Just my opinion, but I think Gov. Paul LePage cares about the poor grandmother who lives on Social Security and needs help to buy food and heating fuel. But I think he doesn't care much about the 25-year-old heroin addict who lives in his mom's basement, doesn't work and instead staggers around in a methadone daze all day.
-- BeInformed
For Gov. Paul LePage and Mary Mayhew, this is clearly more about partisan political ideology than it is about the economics of improving health care access, decreasing uncompensated care costs, increasing state's GDP and creating health care sector job growth, that all studies show are happening in states that expanded Medicaid.
-- Street_Medic
People without health insurance are more likely to forego preventive care and delay treatment until what was once a minor treatable condition becomes life-threatening and expensive. That's when they show up in the emergency room.
Yes, some hospitals are better than others. But if a person with a Cadillac health insurance plan shows up in the emergency room with a cough, they get all kinds of tests. If a homeless person shows up with lung cancer, they get a cough drop.
-- Bob S
Enough with Gov. Paul LePage. This was a problem long before him and will continue to be for decades after he is gone.
-- Jason Murphy
We can't afford it. It's a deke on the part of the federal government. Expand Medicaid, and we'll pay for it. Until next week. And who do you think the "we" is? The government doesn't make money, they take money.
-- yathink2011
We'll pay for it one way or another. Doesn't it make sense to share the cost among a national pool of payers rather than through our meager numbers here in Maine?
-- hpmcg
And who is going to pay for these druggies? Sorry, but I'm tapped out.
-- FiddleFaddle
We all pay for those not covered anyway.
-- d lew
Just what we need. More money thrown at druggies. It has worked so well so far. Maine needs real treatment centers that dispense hope, not drugs.
-- allrs14
No!!!
-- Liberalone
Gov. Paul LePage just needs to hold out for a few more months. The Republicans will have several plans far better than Obamacare ready to roll when President Ted Cruz takes office. Obamacare is imploding as I type this. Accepting Medicaid expansion would have accelerated the tax and spend death spiral for the state as Medicaid would eat a larger and larger share of the budget in future years.
-- g8torNmaine
It's a sad life for these folks to deal with drug issues.
-- Clint Davis

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Kennebunk charcoal maker Wicked Good Charcoal Inc. has sued a New Jersey company for allegedly stealing customers by using its trademark.
Wicked Good filed a lawsuit against New Jersey-based The Ranch-T LLC, alleging the two companies reached a settlement earlier this year over The Ranch's sale of "Wicked Good Blend" charcoal. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court earlier this week seeks to enforce that settlement.
The three-person Kennebunk company claims Ranch-T has since violated that agreement, continuing to sell charcoal using that name, and has asked the court for a preliminary injunction ordering Ranch T to stop selling charcoal under Wicked Good's name and barcode.
"Wicked Good has already lost a major distributor to [Ranch-T], attracted by the lower cost and larger supply of [Ranch-T] knockoff products, and has every reason to believe that Ranch-T will continue to capitalize on Wicked Good's hard-earned goodwill by claiming an association with Wicked Good that does not exist, and by saturating the marketplace with low-quality versions of Wicked Good's products," the company wrote in its injunction motion.
The Maine company said it lost about $160,000 in business in connection with that distribution agreement with Associated Energy Systems, which distributed its charcoal in 13 western states.
A settlement agreement filed with the motion called for Ranch-T to stop selling any inventory labeled "Wicked Good Blend" by Dec. 1. Wicked Good said it has found stores, including one in Scarborough, that have received such orders after that date.
Several store owners, the company stated, had understood that the product from Ranch-T was the same product, was a replacement for the Maine-based company's product or that Wicked Good had gone out of business.
Wicked Good claims the dispute between the companies stemmed from an earlier buyout offer from another company with the same owner, Thomas Tarantin, which Wicked Good owner Larry Johnson stated he turned down, according to court documents.
The Maine company sued the New Jersey-based charcoal maker on five counts, for breaching the settlement agreement, false designation of origin on its charcoal products, false advertising, violating the Maine Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and business interference.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- The New York man charged with two counts of murder in connection with the shooting deaths of a local couple early Christmas morning made his first court appearance Wednesday at the Capital Judicial Center.
David W. Marble Jr., 29, of Rochester, New York, and Augusta was not asked by Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy to enter pleas as he has not yet been indicted by the Kennebec County grand jury. The Kennebec County grand jury is next scheduled to convene on Jan. 22.
Marble was dressed in orange jail clothes Wednesday. His ankles were shackled, and his hands remained handcuffed at his waist.
Marble clearly said "yes" when Murphy asked if he understood the charges.
Marble was arrested Tuesday afternoon and charged in connection with the shooting deaths of Eric Williams, 35, and Bonnie Royer, 26, both of Augusta, who were found inside their SUV along Sanford Road in Manchester. Police said the shootings were drug related.
More than a dozen members of the victims' families and friends attended the brief hearing. All but Royer's paternal grandfather, Paul Mansir Sr. of Pittston, left the courthouse without speaking to the press. He spoke briefly to reporters at an impromptu press conference outside the courthouse.
Mansir said that his son, Royer's father, was doing "about as could be expected." He said that he has not seen his great-granddaughter, Royer's daughter, 6-year-old McKenzie, who is living with her father in Cumberland County.
"There isn't much you can do, though. You just have to move on," he said.
A gofundme.com account has been set up to raise money to cover Royer's funeral expenses. As of 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, 32 people in three days had contributed $1,670 toward the $5,000 goal.
The page was set up by Vicky Beloin, who identified herself as the girlfriend of Royer's father, Paul Mansir Jr. of Whitefield.
"The family was blindsided with the tragic news Christmas Day when we were told that Bonnie was gone," the gofundme page states. "It was completely out of the blue, and unexpected. We are all just trying to process what has happened.
"You can never really prepare when someone you love passes, but it's even harder when it's someone so young. She was full of life, and had such a kind, big heart. She loved her family very much," the gofundme page states.
Marble will be held without bail at the Kennebec County Jail until an April 8 hearing. He may waive the hearing and agree to be held without bail pending the outcome of the case. If bail were to be set, it most likely would be high because until recently Marble lived out of state.
At the time of the homicides, Marble was living in an Augusta apartment, according to Maine State Police. Information about how long he had lived there before he was arrested has not been released.
Marble has a criminal history in New York, according to the Office of Court Administration in the New York State Unified Court System. He was convicted in 2006 and 2009 of criminal possession of a controlled substance. Both times he served sentences of less than six months.
In 2010, Marble was convicted of 3rd degree robbery and sentenced to two to four years of probation.
Murphy also granted the prosecution's motion to seal the affidavit in the case until after Marble is indicted because the investigation by the Maine State Police and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency is ongoing.
Defense attorneys Pamela Ames and David Geller, both of Waterville, were appointed to represent Marble. Ames said outside the courthouse that she had just received the affidavit and had not had time to go over it with her client.
Williams had a criminal history in Maine that included convictions for misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct. Royer had no criminal history in Maine.
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese said Wednesday outside the courthouse that the investigation is continuing but declined to answer specific questions about what type of drug or drugs might have been involved. She said that Marble and the victims knew each other but did not say how or for how long. Marchese also declined to say whether more arrests in the case are expected.
Williams and Royer lived together on Easy Street in Augusta, less than a mile from where the vehicle was found on the side of Sanford Road, state police spokesman Stephen McCausland said earlier. Sanford Road is a dirt road near a number of sand and gravel pits. There are no houses in the immediate area.
McCausland said one of the victims called 911 about 3:30 a.m. on Christmas. The name of the person who made the call has not been released.
If convicted, Marble faces between 29 years, because of the use of a firearm, and life in prison.
Marchese said outside the courthouse that because there were two victims, Marble, if convicted, could be ordered to serve the sentences consecutively.
A memorial vigil is planned for the couple from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Friday outside their Augusta home, according to the Kennebec Journal.
Williams' funeral will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at Plummer Funeral Home in Augusta.

Texto completo:   In 2015, elected officials in Maine and across the U.S. passed a slew of ordinances and laws attempting to restrict who can fly drones and when, where and how. But with the new year at hand, the Federal Aviation Administration wants legislatures and city councils to get out of the drone-regulating business.
While states and cities pass these regulations to protect their residents' privacy and safety, the FAA said in a memo released before Christmas this will lead to a "patchwork quilt" of regulations that will "severely limit the flexibility of the FAA in controlling the airspace and ensuring safety and an efficient air traffic flow."
Already, drones have created their share of unsafe conditions overhead, with 780 incidents of drones flying too close to commercial aircraft between January 2015 and August 2015, three times as many as reported in all of 2014. That includes one incident last March at the Portland International Jetport. Consumers purchased an estimated 700,000 drones in 2015, according to the Consumer Technology Association, so close calls with aircraft and people on the ground could become more common in 2016.
"It does seem like they are trying to get control [of the airspace] at a time when they need to get control," said Michael Bosse, an attorney at the Portland law firm Bernstein Shur.
But with no federal drone regulations yet on the books, state and local policymakers often face more immediate pressure to address nuisance drones.
Federal pre-emption
The FAA states in its memo that it has complete authority "to regulate the areas of airspace use, management and efficiency, air traffic control, safety, navigational facilities and aircraft noise." As a result, and despite the absence of federal regulations, the FAA is asserting that its rules -- once they're released and effective -- will pre-empt city and state drone regulations.
The FAA missed a congressionally mandated deadline in September to integrate drones into the airspace. But the agency has taken steps to make its drone-regulating authority known.
In February 2015, the FAA released draft regulations for the flight of small drones that would bar operators from flying drones higher than 500 feet, beyond their line of sight or at night. In early 2015, the FAA began to expedite limited commercial drone flights. And in December, it began requiring hobbyists to register their drones with the federal government.
The FAA is asserting that its regulations will pre-empt local laws because "it's well-known that the federal government regulates aircraft," Bosse said.
But some legal analysts suggest that because drones often operate in non-navigable airspace -- airspace below 1,000 feet, the minimum safe altitude for manned flight -- the FAA's authority over navigable airspace may not allow it to pre-empt state and local drone regulations within non-navigable airspace.
Not in my airspace
State and local governments began passing laws and ordinances to restrict drones in 2013, filling what they saw as a regulatory void left in the absence of federal regulations.
Not only that, when state or city residents encounter a reckless drone operator or have other drone-related concerns, they are more likely to go to their local city council, state representative or police department, not the FAA, to demand action.
Local governments are left wondering "what they should do and what can they do" about drones, said Eric Conrad, spokesman for the Maine Municipal Association, which has received a number of calls in the last year calls from members with questions about the use of drones and how local governments can respond to nuisance drones. Among the top concerns is keeping drones from observing people and taking pictures in violation of their privacy.
No Maine city has yet passed an ordinance restricting where, when and how people fly drones, although several elsewhere in the U.S. have erected barriers, legally speaking, to fend off errant drones.
St. Bonifacius, Minnesota, passed the first municipal ordinance banning drones within the city limits out of concern that the aircraft would be used to violate residents' privacy. Its ordinance banned drone flights in the airspace within 400 feet above the city, with exceptions made for law enforcement and residents flying drones over their property.
Other cities, including Pittsburgh and Chicago, have acted to ban drone flights over schools and playgrounds, near airports and elsewhere within the city limits, so long as the drones are flying no higher than 400 feet. The area above 400 feet is considered the exclusive regulatory territory of the federal government.
According to the National Council of State Legislatures, 45 states considered 168 drone use-related bills in 2015. To date, 26 states have related laws on the books.
The Maine Legislature considered two bills in 2015 that would restrict the use of drones. One bill that requires police to obtain a search warrant before using a drone as part of a criminal investigation became law in October. A second bill that would have barred drones from flying over private property without permission died in committee.
Legislators worried that, by passing the bill, they would be overstepping the state's authority by regulating the airspace. They also worried that the bill could open the state up to a challenge by federal regulators.
No local drone regulations so far have been struck down on the grounds of federal pre-emption, and the fate of existing regulations (and even future regulations) is uncertain.
Attempts to reach FAA legal representatives to learn what action could be taken against these regulations were unsuccessful.
Evolving area of law
Cities and states with local drone regulations may not receive answers about the fate of their rules until the FAA releases its omnibus drone regulations sometime in 2016, well after its initial September 2015 deadline.
Without a federal regulatory framework, it's impossible to pinpoint when and where state and local regulations will conflict with those of the federal government.
Bosse said there could be "a sliding scale" to determine what restrictions cities and states can impose on drone use. The FAA in its memo appears to leave room to maneuver, recommending that states and cities consult with the FAA about restrictions on drone flights before putting them into force. States and cities can, without consulting the FAA, require police to obtain search warrants before using drones and prohibit drones from being used for hunting and fishing.
Drones are pushing the FAA into new territory that doesn't have tidy precedents, legal analysts say. The FAA has even acknowledged that it may not have the resources to enforce regulations on this ubiquitous technology and that state and local police will be in the best position to stop reckless drone use. So a degree of flexibility in allowing state and local governments to manage drones in the non-navigable airspace could be to the agency's benefit.

Texto completo:   Traditions. We all hold some very dear.
One of my most time-honored traditions is using my final column of the year to present to you a gift: bold predictions for the coming year. It's something I have done every year since 2011, guaranteed to be right 78.9 percent of the time.
Last year, for instance, I told you the governor was going to "go big or go home" on the issue of tax reform, and boy was that ever right. I also predicted Angus King would continue to be invisible in the U.S. Senate; that talk of Susan Collins, Mary Mayhew and Roger Katz for governor would already begin; Bruce Poliquin would become a pragmatist and raise an incredible amount of money; Maine's economy would continue to improve; and presidential candidates would actually spend time and set up operations in Maine.
Of course, I also told you "Republicans will be a great deal more cohesive, compared to 2011." Oops.
Still, my predictive powers are indeed remarkable. Here is what you can expect in 2016:
Bold prediction 1: The Maine Legislature will do everything possible to adjourn before anyone even notices they are in session.
Bold prediction 2: Ranked choice voting will fail.
Bold prediction 3: The marijuana legalization referendum will pass, as will -- regrettably -- a massive minimum wage hike.
Bold prediction 4: Political ad spending in the U.S. will reach $6 billion. In Maine, every single one of you will consider turning off your television because it will be so bad in the fall.
Bold prediction 5: Community Health Options will close its doors because of financial insolvency.
Bold prediction 6: Emily Cain will defeat Joe Baldacci in the Democratic primary for Congress in the Second District, then go on to lose to Bruce Poliquin in their general election rematch.
Bold prediction 7: In an odd twist, the Maine Senate will return to the hands of Democrats while the Maine House actually turns back to the Republicans.
Bold prediction 8: America will not actually #FeelTheBern, with Bernie Sanders dropping out and endorsing Clinton after Super Tuesday. He also will lose Maine to Clinton.
Bold prediction 9: Ted Cruz will win Iowa. New Hampshire will end up a three-way deathmatch among Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie. If Trump wins, Rubio, Christie and the others will disappear, and Trump will duel Cruz for the nomination (and lose), with the establishment ultimately (and hilariously) backing Cruz as the less terrifying candidate to their interests. If Rubio or Christie wins New Hampshire, they will become the clear establishment alternative to Cruz, Trump will fade after losing the first two nominating contests and having been supplanted by Cruz, and the remaining primary fight will be a long, bloody battle.
Bold prediction 10: That battle will end with Sen. Marco Rubio becoming the Republican nominee. He will choose Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina as a running mate and position his campaign as a choice between a young, diverse, optimistic vision of the future and an old and tired representation of the divisive political battles of the past in Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.
Bold prediction 11: Donald Trump will stay true to his word and will not run as a third-party or independent candidate. Unless, that is, there is a brokered convention and he ends up on the losing end of the brokering. Then all bets are off.
Bold prediction 12: Rubio will be elected the next president of the United States and will be the first Republican to accumulate 300 electoral votes since 1988.
Bold prediction 13: The U.S. Senate will end in a 50/50 tie. The House will remain solidly Republican.
Bold prediction 14: The new Republican administration will end up looking like a modern day team of rivals from the primary. Chris Christie will be named Attorney General. Bobby Jindal will be Secretary of Health and Human Services. Rand Paul will be the new chairman of the Federal Reserve (just kidding).
Bold prediction 15: Leonardo DiCaprio will finally win that Oscar. No, seriously, the man is fighting a bear in his latest flick. Just give it to him already.
Bold prediction 16: In July, I will be -- in my single-minded quest to repopulate Maine -- welcoming a third child into my family. Since I already knew that but don't know the gender, my official prediction is that it will be a baby girl.
Happy New Year, everyone. Save this column, and I will see you next year.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine * Winter weather that spun off a series of deadly storms in the Midwest brought the season's first big punch to the Northeast on Tuesday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain greasing roads, sending drivers spinning and keeping people indoors amid sub-freezing temperatures.
Parts of northern New England had about 6 inches of snow by early evening, and isolated areas could get 10 inches or more by the time it ends, according to the National Weather Service.
The weather made for a sloppy mess in parts of metro Boston, where memories linger of last winter's record-breaking snowfall. But as Fernando Gonterman waited for a train from Harvard Square to his job at Massachusetts General Hospital, he was unfazed.
"Weather is weather. Just deal with it, right?" he said.
In snow-loving Vermont, Chassidy Byrd, the assistant manager at a convenience store in Plainfield, said the storm returned the state to a sense of normal.
Without any snow, "it didn't feel like Vermont," she said.
Mike Kistner of the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, said the storm that chilled the Northeast is linked to the same system that produced deadly tornadoes in the Midwest beginning Saturday, then brought heavy snow, ice, rain, flooding and blustery winds as it moved toward the Great Lakes. That storm system killed dozens, including many who drowned in floodwaters and others caught up in tornadoes.
Kistner said the northeastern spur of the system was tracking toward Cape Cod, Mass., before it blows out to sea late Tuesday.
Forecasters said snowfall totals would range from an inch or less in parts of southern New England before turning over to rain and sleet, while northern regions would see more. In central and northern New York, 4 to 8 inches of snow was anticipated and police were investigating whether slick roads caused a crash overnight that killed a state corrections officer driving home from work.
The snow went a long way toward making up for a warm, snowless December in the Northeast where several spots are flirting with record warmth for the month. The temperature topped 60 degrees on Christmas Day in Maine, and normally, Portland would have seen more than a foot of snow by Tuesday, Kistner said.
There were no major traffic problems, but some vehicles got stuck in the mounting snow around rush hour.
In Andover, Mass., police say a man pulled an unloaded gun on a snow plow driver after nearly crashing into the plow. The man's lawyer said his client was attacked first and pulled out the gun in self-defense.

Piano tuner setting up shop in coshocton

Texto completo:   COSHOCTON - Piano technician David Chadwick said he recently moved to Coshocton from Las Vegas to "do some work, enjoy myself and go fishing."
After tuning pianos for 21 years in Las Vegas, Chadwick sold his business there and moved to Ohio in November. He now rents a house in town, but he is looking to buy a home in a more rural setting with a shop where he can work on pianos.
He owns and plans to rebuild three vintage grand pianos: a 1923 Steinway, a 1931 Mason & Hamlin and a 1924 Bush & Gerts. He keeps them in storage until he opens his shop.
Chadwick, 61, now works as a shop assistant for his friend and fishing buddy, Pete Skjold, who crafts bass guitars at his business, Skjold Design Guitars LLC in Warsaw. They met in Las Vegas, and Chadwick visited Skjold in Warsaw before moving to Ohio.
He said he loves the people, the countryside and even the climate.
"It could rain for 30 days and it wouldn't bother me," he said, "because I've been rain-denied for 21 years in Vegas."
He's not worried about Ohio's winters, either. Born in Boston, Chadwick lived in Maine for years, working in construction and boat refinishing before moving to Las Vegas.
Chadwick acquired his first piano, a Merrill upright, from his uncle's front porch in Augusta, Maine. It had five coats of paint, which Chadwick stripped away to reveal the instrument's African mahogany. He was never happy with its tuning.
His wife at the time suggested: "Get one of those hammer things and do it yourself," he recalls.
That started a hobby that evolved into a profession. He joined the Piano Technicians Guild, apprenticed under master technicians and took a home study course, as well as attending three courses at the Steinway & Sons factory in New York. Chadwick worked extensively with the Steinway dealer in Las Vegas, who endorsed him for the company's courses.
He also tuned a Yamaha C-5 grand piano twice weekly for the Cirque du Soleil show, "Zumanity," at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for 10 years. He spent up to two hours tuning the instrument each session.
"There's always something I can do to improve the touch," he said. "I always try to leave it -- not only sound-wise, but also cosmetically -- better than when I found it."
A piano generally has anywhere from 220 to 245 strings, Chadwick said: "That's how many pins I'm touching. Most of them have three strings for one note."
A tuning can require one or two passes: the first to bring the piano up to pitch; the second to fine-tune it. In Las Vegas, Chadwick charged $125 for a single pass and $140 for both raising the pitch and fine-tuning the instrument.
He said he does not know what local technicians charge for the service, but he's willing to work with customers.
"In the meantime, I'm happy to meet folks and make their piano sound good," he said.
Chadwick recommends tuning a piano twice a year to adjust for major shifts in temperature and moisture, but he admits most owners opt for service only once a year.
He incorporates an electronic program into his tuning process, but he relies on his ears.
"I'm not going to be happy if I hear a buzzing or vibration or something that is not a clean, in-unison note," he said.
Trained classically in piano, Chadwick has never played out much.
"I'm not a performer. I've played for the living room walls," he said, but also during "piano recitals, when I was taking lessons, one or two Christmas parties. I think that was about it."
He also plays the banjo and electric, acoustic and bass guitars, and admits he would like to play with other musicians.

Texto completo:   Asheville is finishing the year high on a list of America's great beer cities.
A survey by SmartAsset.com says Asheville is the nation's second-best town for beer drinkers.
The ranking gives the top spot to Portland, Maine, followed by Asheville, which was honored for "beautiful scenery with a vibrant music scene and, of course, great beer." Buncombe County now has 21 craft breweries, with most of those in the city and many breweries downtown along the South Slope brewing district. More breweries are in the works including New Belgium, which is wrapping up work on its expansion in West Asheville along the French Broad River.
Portland, Maine is one of just two cities (with Asheville) to have more than 10 breweries but fewer than 100,000 residents. Portland, Oregon ranked third, followed by Billings, Montana; Denver; Seattle; Wilmington, North Carolina; Missoula, Montana; Pittsburgh and Cincinnati..
SmartAsset said it considered the total and per-capita number of microbreweries and brewpubs in each city, plus Yelp ratings for them.

Texto completo:   Police have arrested a Wells woman and are seeking her boyfriend on charges that they were operating a methamphetamine manufacturing lab in a camper where they lived with their three children.
Police have arrested a Wells woman in Maine and her boyfriend in New Hampshire, both on charges that they were operating a methamphetamine manufacturing lab in a camper where they lived with their three children.
Jennifer Boudle, 28, was arrested Monday during a traffic stop in Wells on a warrant for a charge of unlawful operation of a meth lab. Her boyfriend, John Regan, 41, of Wells, was arrested Tuesday in Concord, New Hampshire, according to Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Their arrests come after local police and agents from both the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency and federal Drug Enforcement Administration executed a search warrant at their home on Nov. 16 at 859 Post Road in Wells and discovered a meth lab in the camper.
The investigators found Boudle, Regan and their three children, whose ages range from infancy to 10 years old, at the camper. Investigators allowed the family to leave as they prepared their paperwork to search the camper. They made the arrests after completing their investigation and obtaining arrest warrants for the parents on Dec. 23, McCausland said in a news release.
McCausland said the children are being cared for by other relatives.
Boudle was taken to the Wells Police Department after her arrest and freed on $500 bail. Regan remains in custody in New Hampshire while authorities arrange for his extradition back to Maine to face the charge here.
Unlawful operation of a meth lab is a Class B felony under state law punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Authorities in Maine have seen a spike in the number of meth manufacturing labs here in recent years, including an increasing number in more densely populated areas in York, Cumberland and Penobscot counties, Roy McKinney, the director of the MDEA, said in an interview last week.
The number of meth lab incidents in Maine rose from seven in 2011 to 15 in 2012, 20 in 2013, then 37 in 2014, and 55 so far in late 2015.
The MDEA has also dedicated more resources into combating meth manufacturing here, from 17 investigations in 2011 to 76 investigations in 2015, as of Nov. 30. Scott Dolan can be contacted at 791-6304 or at: sdolan@pressherald.com Twitter: scottddolan

Resumen: The number of distilleries in Maine has grown so much that Constance Bodine, co-owner of Sweetgrass Winery and Distillery, and Ian Michaud of Liquid Riot (who is also president of the Maine Distillers Guild) are putting together a Maine Distillery Trail that will feature the state's 10 licensed distilleries. After a yet-to-be-determined number of stamps, send the postcard back to the guild and you'll be entered into a contest to win dinner and drinks with your favorite distiller.

Texto completo:   A roundup of what foodies in Portland and Maine have to look forward to next year.
It's about time to flip the last page of the calendar, which means it's also time for the perennial list of food happenings and restaurant and bar newcomers that will open their doors in the coming year.
The winter months are often the best time to visit your favorite restaurants because a) it will get you out of the house b) there are no tourists to deal with and c) the winter is when restaurants need your support the most. A lot of places come up with creative specials to lure you out into the snow and cold. The best one I've seen so far is from Bao Bao Dumpling House in Portland, which recently announced on its Facebook page that it will offer all of its dumplings at half-price between 2 and 4 p.m. Wednesday through Friday - all winter long. If you're lucky, they'll still have some of the Junmai sake panda cups they started carrying earlier this month. The cups were manufactured to celebrate the arrival of pandas at the Tokyo zoo and have become wildly popular in Japan. Order sake, and you get to keep the cup.
Look for Petite Jacqueline 2.0 in the New Year. The French bistro is closing after its New Year's dinner to relocate... somewhere. I'm sure the change will be fine as long as they keep making French onion soup that's so good you want to bathe in it.
Krista Desjarlais will open her Purple House bakery/restaurant in Yarmouth. Expect all of her fans who remember the amazing food at Bresca to make a pilgrimage to pay their respects to the goddess of good food.
And we can't wait to hear more about the upcoming restaurant collaboration between the Hunt & Alpine Club and Piccolo.
Vinland is opening a bar, and Maine & Loire will open The Drifter's Wife, the first local bar serving only natural wines. Another new distillery, Hardshore Distilling Co., is slated for Washington Avenue - they'll be making gin to start - and plenty more brew pubs are coming to the greater Portland area as well.
The number of distilleries in Maine has grown so much that Constance Bodine, co-owner of Sweetgrass Winery and Distillery, and Ian Michaud of Liquid Riot (who is also president of the Maine Distillers Guild) are putting together a Maine Distillery Trail that will feature the state's 10 licensed distilleries. The map will come out sometime this winter, Bodine said. The trail map comes with a postcard that will be stamped at each site. After a yet-to-be-determined number of stamps, send the postcard back to the guild and you'll be entered into a contest to win dinner and drinks with your favorite distiller.
From my perch, it seems as if at least one restaurant or bar or brewery - sometimes two - opens every day in the greater Portland area. So many new places are expected for 2016, let's just look at a cross-section.
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH SCALES?
One of the most anticipated openings is Scales, the new waterfront seafood restaurant from Dana Street and Sam Hayward. Like most restaurants-in-progress, little actual news has come out as construction delays push back the opening date.
Sam Hayward now tells me they're still waiting for "essential equipment" and that some infrastructure has been delayed until after the New Year. "My reply to friends when asked when we're opening is 'sometime between mid-January and early March - 2018.' (Just kidding.)," he wrote in an email. "I think I can safely say that the dining area and bar are really beautiful and are worth the wait for the impact I hope the room will have."
A chef, however, is already on board. Mike Smith, who grew up in Old Orchard Beach, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 2005. After graduation he worked at Duckfat and Hugo's in Portland and The Cheese Iron in Scarborough. In 2008 he landed at Toro in Boston, where he became chef de cuisine. He moved back to Maine in 2014 and worked the front of house at Duckfat, then came on board with the Scales group in early December. (Read what chef Smith has to say about his 10 tattoos at http://bit.ly/1ZxsfUv.)
Hayward said he had a lot of great candidates for the chef position, but he felt that he and Smith "had strong chemistry and spoke the same language about food."
"I'm really pleased to have someone with a strong work ethic, proven high-volume experience in restaurants that serve excellent food, and he wants to contribute in a positive way to Maine's food community," Hayward said. "I can't wait to begin recipe testing and tasting trials."
Maybe Scales will actually open in mid-January. Ever since Fore Street finally updated its web page, I feel like anything is possible.
AT THOMPSON'S POINT
This year saw lots of announcements about food-and-beverage businesses that will be going into the new development at Thompson's Point. I'm told the Cellardoor Winery tasting room and Stroudwater Spirits, which will make small-batch bourbon, whiskey, vodka and gin, are scheduled to open in late May. And expect at least two more announcements about new tenants, including a major brewer.
FOR A CASUAL BITE
If you work around Monument Square, like I do, there are other new places to look forward to in 2016 - El Rayo's new casual spot on Free Street, for example, and the Hero sandwich shop from the owners of Otto and Empire, coming together in the old Soakology location.
TIKI, ANYONE?
Rhum, the newest venture from Jason Loring, Mike Fraser and Nat Towl, was supposed to open sometime before Christmas, but the time to really appreciate this tiki bar/restaurant will be in the middle of February, when temperatures are the coldest and we (usually) have lots of snow. Portland hasn't had a real tiki lounge since the Hawaiian Hut, which opened in the basement of the Eastland Hotel in 1963 and closed in 1978.
Rhum will be located in a subterranean space at 4 Free St. (behind Arabica). The drink mugs will be appropriately kitschy - skulls! - but will be filled with classic, not-too-sweet tiki cocktails, Loring says. In the kitchen will be Frank Anderson and Rebecca Ambrosi, chefs whose impressive resumes include stints at Animal in Los Angeles and in the kitchens of chefs Thomas Keller and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
I sampled some of the food and drink at a recent preview at the Bramhall Pub, and the menu (think pork riblets falling off the bone) seems promising. The Painkiller - a concoction made with pineapple, coconut, rum and nutmeg, with toasted coconut on top and a pink umbrella - was, well, killer. Perfect for those brutal winter nights when you long for a ticket to Hawaii, or a virtual escape that makes you feel like you're a little closer to the equator.
The best thing? Rhum will be right across the street from my office.
ON THE AVENUE
Washington Avenue saw significant growth in food-related businesses this past year, with more to come. Paul Lively, a classically trained French chef, chocolatier and pastry chef who owned a truffle shop in Brewster, Massachusetts, for six years, will be opening a 35-seat cafe and dessert spot called The Lively Palate at 54 Washington Ave. Lively told me recently that he'll be serving soups, sandwiches and salads during the day and housemade pates, charcuterie (smoked duck, housemade sausages), desserts and wines at night. Among the 185 truffles in his repertoire are chocolate truffles infused with flavors such as bacon, garlic, nuts and vegetables.
"There are so many restaurants you can go to (in Portland)," he said, "but there aren't that many places you can go to and get a good dessert."
If 2016 is anything like the past, these new places are only the beginning. So when you lift a glass to the new year Thursday night, be sure to toast Portland's hopping restaurant scene - including those places that are still to come.

Texto completo:   Twenty-four days later, not much had changed for the Maine hockey team.
The Black Bears returned to the ice against New Hampshire and were plagued by undisciplined play, shoddy defense and some bad luck, falling 5-4 Tuesday before an announced crowd of 3,809 at the Cross Insurance Arena.
The Wildcats had defeated Maine 5-2 on Dec. 5 before the Black Bears took a three-week break.
The hiatus was either too long or not long enough. New Hampshire jumped to a 2-0 lead after one period, then made Maine pay for every mistake whenever its lead got cut to a single goal.
"Soft people say, 'Jeez, Maine kept battling.' That's true," Black Bears Coach Red Gendron said. "But we're in the second half now and we've got to learn from the lessons that we so painfully endured in the first half. We took penalties we didn't need to. We took penalties sometimes because of a complete lack of discipline."
Maine (4-10-4) was whistled for eight infractions. New Hampshire (7-6-4) entered the game with the nation's fourth-best power play at 26.7 percent. The Wildcats added two more goals with the man advantage.
"Every time we scored they got one back and kind of killed the energy," Maine center Will Merchant said. "We kind of gave them all their goals once again."
Freshman Rob McGovern got the start in goal for the Black Bears and wasn't nearly as sharp as in his previous outing in Portland - 44 saves in a 1-1 tie with North Dakota.
New Hampshire's first goal came on a long rebound that Jason Salvaggio collected in stride and fired past McGovern. Its fourth goal happened after McGovern blocked a Matt Dawson shot, then looked helplessly around him as the puck dropped out of his padding, allowing Andrew Poturalski to skate in and whack it into the net for his nation-best 17th goal.
Merchant scored twice for Maine, pushing his team-leading total to eight. His first, 29 seconds into the second period, cut the deficit to 2-1.
In the third period, with the Black Bears on the power play, Merchant struck again, pouncing on a rebound in the slot, wheeling and firing the puck past New Hampshire goaltender Danny Tirone in one motion. That trimmed the lead to 4-3.
"The puck just squirted out. I just decided to take a quick shot on net," Merchant said. "I tried to put it low, so if not a goal it could be a rebound for someone else."
But Dan Correale responded with a power-play goal, lifting the puck over McGovern while on his knees to restore a two-goal lead for New Hampshire.
Maine defenseman Dan Renouf scored at 13:36 to make it a 5-4 game. Forward Steven Swavely hit the post twice on a subsequent shift. And then Correale gave great effort late to pin the puck in Maine's zone, preventing Gendron from lifting McGovern for an extra attacker until 33 seconds remained.
The Black Bears were whistled for being offside with 15.2 seconds left, and Merchant voiced his displeasure and frustration. He was given a game misconduct penalty and Maine never got off a quality shot.
"I said a few things and just went from there, and he threw me out. I had one foot in the zone and one on the other side," Merchant said. "It would have given us a six-on-five. Looking back on it now, I wish I hadn't done it."
Said Gendron: "As it turned out, it was a neutral-zone faceoff so the odds were piled pretty high against us at that point. But he's a guy we count on."
Maine and New Hampshire meet again for a fourth and final time at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in Manchester, New Hampshire. This week's games don't count in the Hockey East standings. But the Black Bears know what's at stake after two losses and a tie against the Wildcats in their previous three games.
"It's our last game of the season with these guys and they're our rival," Merchant said.
"We want revenge." Mark Emmert can be contacted at 791-6424 or at: memmert@pressherald.com Twitter: MarkEmmertPPH

Texto completo:   Gov. Paul LePage has nominated a second military official to become to the next Adjutant General of the Maine Army National Guard.
Gov. Paul LePage on Tuesday nominated Maine Air National Guard Col. Douglas A. Farnham to become the next adjutant general of the Maine National Guard.
The announcement came less than a week after Brig. Gen. Gerard Bolduc, who was serving as an interim leader of the Guard, withdrew his name 24 hours after his nomination was announced.
For the past three years, Farnham has been the wing commander of the 101st Air Refueling Wing in Bangor.
The adjutant general is the supreme military officer of the state and concurrently serves as commissioner of defense, veterans and emergency management.
"The next adjutant general will serve at an important time for Maine airmen and soldiers," Farnham said in a written statement. "Shrinking national resources are putting intense pressure on future Department of Defense budgets. As we've seen, the entire relationship between the active-duty force structure and the reserve components is and will continue to be under debate. Our adjutant general needs to be engaged at the national level to ensure Maine is part of the discussion on emerging missions and force structure."
He declined to be interviewed until his Senate confirmation is finalized in mid-January, and LePage's office offered little elaboration on Farnham's selection, other than listing basic resume information about his career.
Farnham graduated from Brewer High School and the Air Force Academy, and has served in the military for the past 31 years as a pilot, flight instructor and commanding officer. He also holds a master's degree in business administration from Chapman University, and is the fourth-generation owner of Getchell Bros. Inc., a family-owned ice packaging company based in Brewer.
It is still unknown why Bolduc withdrew his nomination Dec. 23, only a day after he was named by the governor as the nominee. Bolduc has not responded to repeated requests for comment.
The governor's office declined to elaborate on Bolduc's decision this week, but did say that Farnham was on the short list of candidates recommended to the governor by an 11-person advisory committee.
The committee convened in May to find a permanent replacement for Brig. Gen. James Campbell, who was fired by LePage in March. Campbell's sudden departure came shortly after the LePage administration read more than 200 pages of emails turned over to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram in a Freedom of Information Act request.
Those emails detailed how Campbell privately initiated a plan to swap Maine's celebrated 133rd Engineer Battalion with a unit of infantry soldiers, a side deal made outside the larger federal budget process that would ultimately reduce the size of the Maine National Guard.
Publicly, however, Campbell blamed the swap on the Obama administration and the overarching force reduction, saying that swapping units was the best way to save jobs in Maine. LePage fired Campbell on March 24, saying he had "lost faith" in Campbell's ability to lead.
Engineer units are sought-after by state governments because engineers, with their access to heavy machinery and expertise in construction and earth moving, are equipped to respond to natural disasters and other civil emergencies. The units also provide exceptional opportunities for women, and job training in construction skills that apply outside of the military.
Since Campbell's ouster, LePage and members of the Maine congressional delegation have vowed to keep the 133rd in the state. Matt Byrne can be contacted at 791-6303 or at: mbyrne@pressherald.com Twitter: MattByrnePPH

He also holds a master's degree in business administration from Chapman University, and he is the fourth-generation owner of Getchell Bros. Inc., a family-owned ice packaging company.
It is still unknown why Bolduc withdrew his nomination Dec. 23, only a day after the governor announced he was the nominee. Bolduc has not responded to repeated requests for comment.
The governor's office declined to elaborate on Bolduc's decision this week, but it did say that Farnham was on the short list of candidates recommended to the governor by an 11-person advisory committee.
The committee convened in May to find a permanent replacement for Brig. Gen. James Campbell, whom LePage fired in March. Campbell's sudden departure came shortly after the LePage administration read more than 200 pages of emails turned over to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram in a Freedom of Information Act request.
Those emails detailed how Campbell privately initiated a plan to swap Maine's celebrated 133rd Engineer Battalion with a unit of infantry soldiers, a side deal made outside the larger federal budget process that ultimately would reduce the size of the National Guard.
Publicly, however, Campbell blamed the swap on the Obama administration and the overarching force reduction, saying that swapping units was the best way to save jobs in Maine. LePage fired Campbell on March 24, saying he had "lost faith" in Campbell's ability to lead.
Engineer units are sought after by state governments because engineers, with their access to heavy machinery and expertise in construction and earth moving, are equipped to respond to natural disasters and other civil emergencies. The units also provide exceptional opportunities for women and job training in construction skills that apply outside of the military.
Since Campbell's ouster, LePage and members of the Maine congressional delegation have vowed to keep the 133rd in the state.

Texto completo:   DOT decision to award Casco Bay Bridge maintenance to Florida firm raises red flag
Several lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee want the state's transportation chief to explain his decision to subcontract operations and maintenance of the Casco Bay Bridge to a private firm in Florida.
The agency's action, which reflects a public sector privatization trend that has gained favor in the LePage administration, did not sit well with several members of the committee that oversees transportation policy in Maine.
Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, said the committee probably will request an explanation from Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, possibly as early as next week. He said the Maine Department of Transportation should have explained its decision to the committee before moving forward with a significant policy change. The agency's failure to do so, he said, could "poison" a good working relationship while "creating a lot of suspicion" about other changes pursued by DOT.
"This is a potentially precedent-setting decision with implications on bridge safety, public workers and public dollars," Diamond said. "It seems to me that such a decision should not be made without the oversight committee's direct knowledge or involvement."
DOT announced Monday that it awarded a five-year, $3.8 million contract to Miami-based FDI Services Inc., marking the first time that the state has turned over bridge operations to a private firm. While the request for bids was made public in October, Democrats on the transportation panel criticized DOT for not explaining the reasons for privatizing operations of a busy bridge that links the state's largest city with South Portland, another commercial and retail hub.
Although the recession prompted many states to privatize transportation and other services to cut costs, lawmakers were critical of a plan that DOT officials described as "cost neutral" and a re-prioritizing of the state work force.
Several lawmakers said Bernhardt notified them of the new contract around noon Monday. Diamond said individual lawmakers have inquired about the privatization bid since the state's request for bids surfaced in October. He and other lawmakers planned to tour the bridge today but postponed the visit because of weather. Now Diamond wants Bernhardt to explain the change to the committee.
"The commissioner said (Monday) that he's willing to meet with us," Diamond said. "I expect we will have a lot of questions."
Republican Sen. Ron Collins, co-chairman of the Transportation Committee, was less concerned about the move. He said Bernhardt told him nearly a year ago that the DOT was considering subcontracting bridge operations to a private firm.
"It's been discussed and described to me as a way for the state to save money and use that money for the capital fund (for infrastructure improvements)," Collins said. "Anytime I hear that the state is being active in saving money and putting money into the capital fund, I say, 'Hurray, let's do it.'"
Collins could not quantify the projected savings, saying it was up to DOT to "publicize it."
DOT officials have said that any savings are secondary to the main goal of reassigning bridge staff to infrastructure projects better suited for state workers and at a higher priority for DOT.
"It's not about a payoff in X number of years," DOT spokesman Ted Talbot said. "It's about asking if we should have these employees assigned to a drawbridge or preserving our infrastructure such as the rehabilitation of our roads."
FDI Services Inc., which also does business as Florida Drawbridge Inc., won the bid over Maine-based Cianbro, Talbot said. He said Cianbro's bid was "a little higher," but cost was only part of the contract qualifications, which included experience maintaining and operating other bridges and references.
FDI Services Inc. will provide the same service as DOT, with two-person crews operating the bridge around the clock, and doing light maintenance. The state will continue to have an on-site supervisor at the bridge and will handle heavy maintenance and structural work.
FDI Services Inc. also will use the same procedures at the bridge, undergo the same training as current bridge employees and follow all of the same emergency plans.
According to 2014 state payroll data, DOT bridge operators earn $25,000 to $33,000 annually.
The privatization of public services has proceeded in fits and starts since the early 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan advanced the view that the public sector is a cumbersome and inefficient bureaucracy best replaced by the innovative and efficient private sector. Reagan's view continues to be embraced by libertarian conservatives, including the Reason Foundation, which compiles and analyzes state-led efforts to privatize services, such as roads, prisons, liquor operations and state lotteries.
The quest for privatization has been carried forward by some Republican governors, was well as mayors of several large cities. Some of the changes have been motivated by budgetary pressure. In 2010 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, created a task force to evaluate whether privatizing some public services would help close the state's budget gap.
In Maine, the LePage administration has shown an interest in privatizing part of the corrections system and mental health services, especially the residential treatment now offered at Riverview Psychiatric Center.
Studies of privatization have produced mixed results. John Donahue, an expert on privatization at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, told The Atlantic last year that private firms can deliver efficiencies when the service is explicitly defined and subject to competition. However, privatization can sometimes go wrong. In Chicago, for example, an independent auditor found that the city received $1 billion less than it should have from a deal to privatize parking meters.
It's unclear why DOT officials felt the need to privatize operations of the Casco Bay Bridge, since the move hasn't been cast as a solution to a fiscal problem, but as a way to focus the agency's resources on other tasks.
"The need to privatize isn't clear to me," Diamond said in a statement released Tuesday. "The state workers on the bridge have done a fine job and run a tight ship, but now they face layoffs. Meanwhile, the state doesn't save any money. I have a lot of questions about the benefits of this contract."

Texto completo:   Plow crews and police departments in central Maine saw few major problems Tuesday as they dealt with the region's first significant snowfall of the season, which slowed traffic, caused some minor car accidents and led some businesses to close early.
Four to 8 inches of snow fell in Kennebec County, according to estimates from the National Weather Service, while areas of Franklin and Somerset counties were expected to get greater accumulations before the snow tapered off and turned to freezing rain later Tuesday.
"There were some minor equipment breakdowns, but we always expect to have to work those things out during the first storm of the season," Waterville Public Works Director Mark Turner said. "For the most part things went as well as we could have expected."
Augusta police Sgt. Christian Behr said officers in his city were busy responding to cars disabled in the snow and minor fender-benders but that no major accidents were reported in the city.
"That's all we've really had," he said. "Minor crashes and disabled motor vehicle-type calls."
For today, the National Weather Service is predicting a chance of snow and freezing drizzle before noon, with some snow and sleet until about 3 p.m.
Shoppers hit the stores Monday in preparation for the storm, buying shovels and rock salt to get ready. Local plow crews said they were ready for the storm, which arrived during school vacation week and just days after a warm stretch of weather that brought temperatures into the 50s on Christmas.
By mid-morning Tuesday, the National Weather Service had received just two reports of snowfall totals in Kennebec County, said Mike Kistner, a meteorologist. In Winslow, 1.7 inches was reported around 7 a.m.; and in Wayne, 3 inches was reported at 7:30 a.m. Total snowfall accumulations were not available later in the day and were not expected until Wednesday morning, Kistner said.
Early reports in Franklin County indicated snowfall of 2.5 inches just north of Rangeley at 6 a.m.; and in Somerset County, 3.5 inches was reported in Harmony around 7 a.m.
Meanwhile, few weather-related accidents were reported early Tuesday morning; and in many parts of the region, ski areas and outdoor recreation centers were celebrating the winter's first significant snowfall.
At the Sugarloaf ski resort in Carrabassett Valley, several inches of snow had fallen by mid-morning Tuesday, adding to a base of about 5 inches that fell on Sunday, said Director of Marketing Ethan Austin. Twenty trails are open at Sugarloaf, out of the mountain's 160 trails and glades, but additional lifts and trails are expected to open by the end of the week, Austin said.
"It was a slow start, just like it was for everyone in New England. It was just unseasonably warm for the first part of December, but this week has been great," Austin said. "The long-term forecast is looking good too, so we're very optimistic that winter is here to stay."
At the Quarry Road Recreation Area in Waterville, all 6 miles of the area's cross-country ski trails were groomed for the first time this winter on Tuesday morning, said Waterville Parks and Recreation Director Matt Skehan.
"This is the latest snow we've had in six years," Skehan said. "We've been taking a lot of calls from kids on vacation looking to come up. We're very happy (the trails) are going to get the use that we want them to get now that we have full coverage."
Friends Melanie Kazenel, Jennie Hatch and Emily Estes were among the first skiers and snowshoers on the Waterville trails Tuesday, after the weather forced them to cancel plans to visit Baxter State Park in Millinocket.
"It's fantastic," said Kazenel, 27, of Canton, Massachusetts. "It's great to get outside."
The speed limit on the Maine Turnpike from the New Hampshire line to Gardiner was reduced to 45 mph for much of the day Tuesday because of the snow, according to the turnpike authority.
Lt. Mark Brooks, of Maine State Police Troop C in Skowhegan, which patrols Interstate 95, said it was "near white-out conditions" on the interstate Tuesday morning. Brooks said traffic was light, with only a few traffic accidents, none involving injuries. He said the Maine Department of Transportation "has been staying up with the snow so far, and the interstate has been safe as long as motorists go slow, as the 45 mph signs are on."
Several municipal buildings and court offices closed Tuesday, including the Somerset County Courthouse and county business offices in Skowhegan.
"I went in and got there about 5:45, and it was a scary drive in," said Somerset County Administrator Dawn DiBlasi, of Fairfield, in an email. "And when the court closed, we closed."
The Skowhegan Municipal Building remained open Tuesday, with town officials and others braving the storm to attend a memorial service at the high school for longtime teacher and sports coach Donald Finley, said Town Manager Christine Almand said.
Around 9:30 a.m. there were just four reports of traffic accidents in Somerset County, and relatively few accidents were reported later in the day, said Somerset County Emergency Management Director Michael Smith. The accidents that were reported were "slip and slide" accidents with no injuries reported, Smith said.
"It's been relatively quiet," Smith said. "Of course, with schools being closed (because of vacation week) and everything else, there aren't a lot of people out on the roads."
In the foothills of western Maine, Farmington Public Works Director Denis Castonguay said Tuesday afternoon that the road conditions there were "not too bad" to deal with, in part because of the snowfall's light texture.
"It's a lot easier when the snow tends to blow off the roads," Castonguay said.
Farmington Public Works had 10 plow trucks out since 4:30 a.m. Tuesday working eight plow routes, while also sanding and salting the roads as needed. Two sidewalk plows also were out clearing public walkways.
Because of Farmington's location in the foothills, some parts of town in higher elevations have received more snow fall than others and therefore have been plowed more than areas in lower elevations.
"It was a little treacherous for a few hours when we were getting 3 inches an hour," Castonguay said. "It seemed like the higher elevations got a little more and had to be plowed more than others."
Skowhegan Road Commissioner Greg Dore said he managed to fill two vacant spots on the Highway Department roster Tuesday, with former employees Matt Quinn and Mike McKenney offering to take up the slack. Dore said earlier this week that two seasonal hires quit the 12-man department.
"It's very slippery underneath," Dore said of road conditions. "The snow is light, so it doesn't take much to get it stirred up and make the visibility difficult. Right now it's coming down pretty good."
Dore said the snow started about 4 a.m. in Skowhegan. The temperature hovered around 12 degrees for most of the day. He said the cold temperature made the snow easier to plow for what is the first real snow event of the winter.
"It's a nice break into the season," he said. "It's cold enough that it's not packing and icing up. The snow is light. Heavy, wet snow can create a lot of problems."
In Waterville, public works crews were expected to work until around 10 p.m. Tuesday clearing roads and then continue downtown cleanup after midnight, said Turner, the public works director.
"Right now a lot of the road surfaces aren't (cleared) down to the pavement, but we're hoping to be able to break most of this stuff up," Turner said late Tuesday afternoon. "We are continuing to advise folks to drive slowly and, if possible, stay off the roads."
A winter weather advisory was expected to stay in effect through midnight Tuesday in Kennebec and interior Waldo counties while winter storm warnings were expected to stay in effect in Franklin and Somerset counties through 3 a.m. today, according to the National Weather Service.

The announcement came less than a week after Brig. Gen. Gerard Bolduc, who was serving as an interim leader of the Guard, withdrew his name from consideration 24 hours after his nomination was announced.
For the past three years, Farnham has been the wing commander of the 101st Air Refueling Wing in Bangor.
The adjutant general is the supreme military officer of the state and concurrently serves as commissioner of defense, veterans and emergency management.
"The next Adjutant General will serve at an important time for Maine airmen and soldiers," Farnham said in a statement. "Shrinking national resources are putting intense pressure on future Department of Defense budgets. As we've seen, the entire relationship between the active duty force structure and the reserve components is and will continue to be under debate. Our adjutant general needs to be engaged at the national level to ensure Maine is part of the discussion on emerging missions and force structure."
He declined to be interviewed until his Senate confirmation is finalized in mid-January, and LePage's office offered little elaboration on Farnham's selection, other than listing basic resume information about his career.
Farnham graduated from Brewer High School and the Air Force Academy, having served in the military for the last 31 years as a pilot, flight instructor and commanding officer. He also holds a master's degree in business administration from Chapman University, and he is the fourth-generation owner of Getchell Bros. Inc., a family-owned ice packaging company.
It is still unknown why Bolduc withdrew his nomination Dec. 23, only a day after the governor announced he was the nominee. Bolduc has not responded to repeated requests for comment.
The governor's office declined to elaborate on Bolduc's decision this week, but it did say that Farnham was on the short list of candidates recommended to the governor by an 11-person advisory committee.
The committee convened in May to find a permanent replacement for Brig. Gen. James Campbell, whom LePage fired in March. Campbell's sudden departure came shortly after the LePage administration read more than 200 pages of emails turned over to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram in a Freedom of Information Act request.
Those emails detailed how Campbell privately initiated a plan to swap Maine's celebrated 133rd Engineer Battalion with a unit of infantry soldiers, a side deal made outside the larger federal budget process that ultimately would reduce the size of the National Guard.
Publicly, however, Campbell blamed the swap on the Obama administration and the overarching force reduction, saying that swapping units was the best way to save jobs in Maine. LePage fired Campbell on March 24, saying he had "lost faith" in Campbell's ability to lead.
Engineer units are sought after by state governments because engineers, with their access to heavy machinery and expertise in construction and earth moving, are equipped to respond to natural disasters and other civil emergencies. The units also provide exceptional opportunities for women and job training in construction skills that apply outside of the military.
Since Campbell's ouster, LePage and members of the Maine congressional delegation have vowed to keep the 133rd in the state.

Texto completo: Difficulty: Easy to moderate, depending on how much of the trail network you choose to explore. The trails total about 2.5 miles.
How to get there: From Route 11 in downtown Brownville, turn onto High Street, which might not be marked with a sign but is across the street from Church Street and Robinson's Mobil store. On High Street, drive 4.4 miles. You'll travel up Brown Hill and past the Moses Greenleaf monument, and the road will change to Williamsburg Road. At 4.4 miles, the pavement ends and a road veers off to the right. Stay straight, continuing on Williamsburg Road (now dirt) for about 1 mile to Piscataquis Community Demonstration Forest parking area, which will be on your right.
Information: The 180-acre Piscataquis County Demonstration Forest is a certified tree farm in the American Tree Farm System and features more than 2.5 miles of interpretive trails open to the public year round. Among the many highlights of the trail network are the remains of two large homesteads, a beautiful stand of tall red pines and a canyon formed by a glacier thousands of years ago.
Located in Williamsburg Township, the forest is maintained by the Piscataquis County Soil and Water Conservation District, which leads tours on the property about forest management practices, soil and water conservation, vernal pools and other topics, according to the Piscataquis County Tourism Development Authority.
The trails on the property are fairly wide and smooth, forming three loops great for hiking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Throughout the network are many colorful displays about forestry practices, local wildlife and the history of the property.  These displays include old photos provided by the Brownville Historical Society and illustrations by local children.
From the forest's small parking lot, a wide path leads to the trailhead kiosk, where a detailed trail map and harvest-type map are located. Beyond the kiosk is a clearing that serves as an outdoor classroom, and nearby is the historic site of the Decker and Lovejoy Homestead, built in the 1800s. All that remains today are the foundations and an old well, both marked with interpretive signs.
To the right of the trailhead kiosk, just beyond the gate, is where the trail network begins. All trails are marked with blue blazes and signs posted on tree trunks.
In the pavilion, I took off my pack, as well as Oreo's dog pack and coat, which was soaked. He was shivering. Fortunately, I thought to pack a second dog coat of dry, warm fleece. Once he had that on, he seemed much happier.
After a snack of granola bar (for me), dog treats (for Oreo) and water (for both of us), we retraced our steps, jogging now and then to warm up. As we sped through the canyon and ducked under icy branches, clouds gathered and glowed pink in the darkening sky. By the time we reached the car, tiny snowflakes were falling.
CAPTION:In the canyon. The Canyon Trail dips down into the canyon and crosses a narrow wooden bridge, then climbs back out to meet the Plantation Loop, which travels through a beautiful stand of red pine trees planted on a 12-acre field in 1957 as a timber crop. The tall, straight trunks of the pines are covered with rough, red-tinged bark, and the pines' long needles litter the forest floor. Also on the Plantation Loop are educational displays about the homesteaders who first settled this region in the late 1800s. They built their house foundations with granite quarried nearby and cleared the land for farming.
CAPTION: The old homestead The north end of the Plantation Loop visits the historic Larson and Decker Homestead, and near the remains of the homestead's large cellar, a short side trail leads to a clearing dotted with apple trees. This open area provides a great view to the north of Saddleback, Jo-Mary and Ebeemee mountains. A large pavilion was recently constructed at this vista so that visitors can take shelter, sit at a picnic table and take in the view. Continuing on, the final loop of the trail network is the Larson Loop, which visits an old hemlock growth and examples of new and old clear cuts. Though all trails are marked with signs, it's best to carry a trail map with you the first couple times you visit the property. Maps are available at the Soil and Water Conservation District Office at 42 Pine Crest Drive in Dover-Foxcroft. You could also photograph the trail map posted on the trailhead kiosk. The interpretive displays are numbered, so you can use them to figure out where you are on the map if you get lost. In 2007, the district was awarded two national awards from the Maine Association of Conservation Districts for their work in the forest, and the Maine Audubon Society has listed the Demonstration Forest in their "Maine Birding Trails" directory. The trails are for foot traffic (including skis and snowshoes) only. Dogs are permitted if kept on leash. Fires are not permitted. For information, call 564-2321.
CAPTION: Oreo Personal note: A thin layer of fresh snow covered Bangor, the hub of holiday shopping madness, on Dec. 16, when I escaped for a hike with my dog, Oreo. As I drove north, the landscape quickly changed. Snow clung to evergreens lining the road and piled up in the fields of Corinth and Charleston. By the time I reached Brownville, I was dealing with about 8 inches of fresh, white powder. I'd never been to Williamsburg Township before, but it wasn't hard to find. It's just north of Brownville, another Pleasant River town.
CAPTION: Picnic tables near the trailhead The road leading to the Piscataquis County Demonstration Forest was lined with birch trees, which have a tendency to bend under the weight of ice and snow. That was the case on Dec. 16. Their tops dangled into the road so that I was forced pull to the side and continue on foot about 0.3 mile to the trailhead parking area. The adventure began with what I thought at the time was a near disaster. I approached an interpretive display by the trailhead kiosk and read "old well." It took a slow moment for me to process that the sign must be marking the location of said well. I looked down and saw that Oreo, who was on a paracord leash, was sniffing around by a pile of sticks and snow that probably covered the well. In a panic, I yanked him toward me and we

Texto completo:   In 2014, 21 Maine-bought guns were used in crimes in other states, according to theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the least of any state. Per capita, we're about average.
The ATF traced the source of 170,000 guns used in crimes in 2014 and found that 28 percent were bought in different states from where the crime was committed. Christopher Ingrahamof the Washington Post's Wonkblog crunched the numbersand made this map of guns per state.
When ranked per capita, Maine ranked 26th with 18.95 guns used in out-of-state crimes per 100,000 residents. Here's that map:
Why does it matter? For one thing, it shows how states' gun laws don't necessarilykeep guns out. While states like Massachusetts, New York andNew Jersey enact strict gun laws, it's easy for guns from states like Georgia andVirginia to cross state borders.
Ingraham notes that, on average, the crimes are committed more than 10 years after the guns were first sold. Thatmeans most of these guns probably weren't originallybought with a crime in mind but got into criminals' hands anyway.
So how do these legally-bought guns end up in criminals' hands? Maybe those 21 guns from Maine were all stolen from people's homes, or maybe they were bought secondhand. We'll likely never know.
According toIngraham, there's no way to research that because of a 2004 amendment that "makes it unlawful for ATF's detailed gun trace data -- which contains information on individual purchasers,guns and retailers -- from being used for any purpose other than crime investigation."

Texto completo:   The state's attorney general and a Kennebec County district attorney won't pursue a criminal investigation into Gov. Paul LePage's actions that led a private school in Fairfield to withdraw its job offer to Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves.
AUGUSTA -- Maine's attorney general and a Kennebec County district attorney won't pursue a criminal investigation into Gov. Paul LePage's actions that led a private school in Fairfield to withdraw its job offer to Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves.
Attorney General Janet Mills and Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney announced their decision Tuesday in a letter to three state lawmakers who had requested a criminal inquiry into whether the governor abused his authority. The decision isn't surprising given that either Mills or Maloney could have initiated an investigation at any time since the controversy involving the governor's threat to pull funding from Good Will-Hinckley surfaced in June.
Their determination that there isn't enough evidence to support a criminal charge weakens any effort to impeach the governor. Historically, most governors who have been impeached faced a criminal charge, according to the Council of State Governments. Nationally, there have been 17 such impeachment proceedings and eight convictions, but no Maine governor has ever been convicted in an impeachment trial.
Independent Rep. Jeffery Evangelos of Friendship and Democratic Reps. Ben Chipman of Portland and Charlotte Warren of Hallowell have said they are considering bringing articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives. In early December, the trio asked Mills and Maloney to investigate whether LePage's actions constituted an abuse of power, a criminal offense.
Mills concluded that it didn't.
"My office has carefully reviewed all available information and all relevant provisions of the criminal code, including 'official oppression,' and concludes that there is there is no basis at this time for us to pursue a criminal investigation," she said.
Under the criminal code, Mills wrote, "Conduct cannot be judged solely by its result. Even though conduct may be viewed as offensive or inappropriate, it will not rise to the level of criminal wrongdoing if it does not satisfy the specific elements that constitute a criminal offense."
TRIO'S impeachment effort to continue
The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Evangelos, reached by phone Tuesday, said that despite Mills' announcement, the impeachment effort will continue with a bill that is set to be introduced in January.
"This just makes our impeachment effort more inevitable," Evangelos said. "Some legislators have said 'Enough.' (LePage) has crossed a line."
Evangelos said that he, Chipman, Warren and Rep. Pinny Beebe-Center, D-Rockland, have retained Augusta attorney Walter McKee to research the legal basis for impeachment, and have concluded that they have a strong case. Evangelos believes there's a group of 20 to 40 legislators who would strongly support impeachment, and that as the effort moves forward that number could grow.
However, the four legislators seeking impeachment likely would face difficult prospects, even though Democrats control the House. Democratic leadership has not committed to supporting impeachment.
Even if the House votes to impeach LePage, the trial would be held in the Republican-controlled Senate.
House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said the governor's actions were irresponsible, but he would not commit to supporting impeachment.
"From the get-go there was many of who felt this abuse of power - this trend of abuse of power - is unacceptable going forward," he said. "Going forward, it's really trying to figure out a way to condemn these actions and figure out a way of preventing them in the future."
SPEAKER'S LAWSUIT PROCEEDS, MAY TAKE YEARS
Eves released a statement from David Webbert, an attorney who is representing him in a lawsuit against LePage.
"The decision of the attorney general comes as no surprise," Webbert said. "The speaker will continue to focus on his federal civil rights lawsuit because it is the most effective way to hold Gov. LePage personally accountable for his reckless abuse of power and to set a legal precedent to protect Maine's people from future such abuses by a governor."
Republican House leader Kenneth Fredette of Newport said he was glad that Mills and Maloney responded quickly to the request for a criminal investigation, so lawmakers could put the issue behind them for the legislative session that begins in January.
The Legislature's Government Oversight Committee investigated the controversy and concluded that LePage's threat to pull $530,000 in state funding from Good Will-Hinckley led to the organization's decision to terminate Eves' contract as president of a charter school operated by Good Will-Hinckley, the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences.
The oversight committee and the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, the legislative watchdog agency overseen by the panel, were charged with fact-finding, but not with making a determination of wrongdoing.
Results from OPEGA's fact-finding inquiry are likely to figure in Eves' lawsuit, which accuses LePage of violating his First Amendment rights and of oppression by intimidation. The court case is expected to last at least two years. Steve Mistler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at: smistler@pressherald.com Twitter: stevemistler

Texto completo:   Law enforcement officials plan to announce details of a " major drug investigation in Oxford County" at a news confence at 2 p.m. at the county jail in South Paris. Among those taking part will be Public Safety Commissioner John Morris, MDEA Director Roy McKinney, and Oxford Sheriff Wayne Gallant.
SOUTH PARIS -- Law enforcement officials on Tuesday announced the arrests of 15 people indicted in what they called the largest drug investigation in Oxford County history.
Those arrested were part of a ring that smuggled Mexican heroin through a supplier in Lowell, Massachusetts, to dealers in Maine, who had imported and distributed nearly 18 pounds of heroin since 2013 in various locations throughout Oxford County, the officials said. That much heroin represents about 80,000 doses with an estimated street value of $3.2 million, they said.
Maine Public Safety Commissioner John Morris, Maine Drug Enforcement Agency Director Roy McKinney and Oxford County Sheriff Wayne Gallant announced the culmination of the two-year investigation at a joint news conference held at the Oxford County Jail in South Paris.
They made the announcement after authorities in Massachusetts on Tuesday morning arrested the man they identified as the key supplier for the ring - Brian Aquino, 34, of Lynn, on felony charges of aggravated trafficking of heroin and drug conspiracy.
McKinney said Aquino would supply two other key members of the ring - Del Hathaway, 26, of Saco, and Brianna Thayer, 26, of Tennessee - with heroin they bought at $500 a "finger" and resold for double that amount in Maine. Hathaway had moved from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Maine to oversee the distribution ring, officials said.
Although investigators believe the ring moved 17.8 pounds of heroin, officers who made the arrests seized only an ounce of heroin in Maine and 10 ounces of heroin - or nearly 2,800 doses - in Lowell.
MDEA FOCUSES ON OUT-OF-STATE DEALERS
Heroin has become an increasingly large problem in rural states such as Maine, where the drug is cheaper to obtain than prescription opiates. A Maine Sunday Telegram investigation this month found that drug cartels in South and Central America are funneling thousands of dollars worth of heroin to the Northeast, which they view as an emerging and lucrative market.
The result is more addicts and an increased effort on the part of political leaders, medical officials and law enforcement to combat the epidemic. In Maine, the number of people seeking treatment more than tripled from 1,115 in 2010 to 3,463 in 2014. Overdose deaths in that same period spiked from 16 to 100.
Gov. Paul LePage has called for more drug enforcement agents to deal with the illegal trafficking of drugs, especially heroin, into Maine. The state Legislature last week came up with a plan to increase funding for drug treatment and hire more law enforcement agents, although the governor has criticized the comprehensiveness, detail and timing of the plan.
"This is the path the MDEA will continue on, and that is going after the organized, out-of-state dealers and not concentrate on the individual users. There are better ways to help those who are sick with addiction. We must disrupt the out-of-state gangs and organizations," said Morris, the public safety commissioner.
Although state and federal authorities in Maine have conducted large-scale drug investigations elsewhere in the state, particularly in urban areas like Portland and Lewiston, Morris said the Oxford County investigation shows how deeply out-of-state drug dealers have penetrated even the most rural parts of the state.
ADDITIONAL HEROIN TRAFFICKING CASES
Tuesday's arrests come just one day after drug agents and police cracked down on what authorities are describing as a significant heroin trafficking operation based in Orland, a small, rural community in Hancock County.
In that operation Monday, police arrested three people on charges of aggravated trafficking in heroin and conspiracy to traffic in heroin. Drug agents seized 400 grams of heroin and 22 pounds of marijuana along with 750 oxycodone pills, more than a dozen firearms and $40,000 in cash from a home in Orland. That investigation took one year to complete.
"The arrests disturb a significant source of the heroin being distributed within western Hancock County," drug agents and police said in a joint statement.
Also Monday, Maine State Police arrested two men on heroin and cocaine charges after they tried to elude police during a traffic stop along Route 202 in Alfred.
In the Oxford County drug investigation, the three officials said their agencies worked together after a state trooper made a traffic stop in 2013 that served as the launching point for the investigation, which lasted from January 2013 to April 2015.
An Oxford County grand jury indicted 15 people as a result of that investigation - all on felony drug-conspiracy charges and some on Class A felony trafficking charges, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
"This is the poison killing our people," Gallant said.
Morris said that in addition to charges in Maine, Aquino likely will face charges in Massachusetts for his role in the ring there.
"This investigation reveals just the staggering amount that just one group brings in to Maine," McKinney said.
He said the MDEA has launched more drug investigations this year than in years past and plans to release some of that data later this week.
SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AT STORE, SURRENDERS
In addition to Aquino, Hathaway and Thayer, the others arrested are: Brandon Blood, 23, of Bethel; Morgan McKinney, 20, of Bethel; Dana Ingerson, 29, of Buckfield; Courtney Moulton, 23, of Tennessee; Scott Billings, 24, of Milton Plantation; Kevin Litchfield, 28, of Oxford; Richard Labay, 38, of West Paris; Michael Farnum, 24, of Bethel; Cameron Gervais, 26, of South Portland; Gregory Ford, 54, of Scarborough; and Matthew Ross, 23, formerly of Westbrook and now homeless. All those arrested had bail amounts set at between $10,000 cash and $100,000 cash.
At the time of Tuesday's news conference, Jacob Santillo, 25, of Rumford, was still being sought for arrest on heroin trafficking and conspiracy charges.
Santillo turned himself into a state trooper Tuesday night at the Wal-Mart in Oxford after someone in the store noticed his mugshot on a big-screen television.
"Someone else recognized him," said MDEA spokesman Scott Pelletier.
He said that after being recognized, Santillo mulled his options and decided to call 911 instead of fleeing.
"He could have fled, but he really doesn't have the means to go anywhere," Pelletier said.
A state trooper drove to the store and took him into custody. He was being held Tuesday night in the Oxford County Jail.

Texto completo:   Gov. Paul Lepage has nominated several agency heads who now hold their positions on an interim basis to become permanent commissioners.
Gov. Paul LePage has nominated a Maine Maritime Academy administrator experienced with sustainability and energy issues to lead the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Paul Mercer currently serves as the assistant to Maine Maritime Academy's president, William Brennan, on sustainability and environmental initiatives. A former associate professor and chairman of the engineering department, Mercer also worked in the private sector on renewable energy, biomass energy and power generation before joining the academy's staff in 2006.
Mercer was among three Cabinet-level nominations announced by LePage's office on Tuesday.
LePage also selected Brig. Gen. Gerard F. Bolduc as Maine's next adjutant general, overseeing the National Guard and the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management. The governor also nominated William Beardsley, the current acting commissioner of the Department of Education, to take over the position permanently. All three nominees must be confirmed by the Maine Senate, although Beardsley will also be interviewed by the State Board of Education.
While Beardsley and Bolduc are familiar faces in Augusta, having served in various high-level positions, Mercer is more of an outsider and represents a departure from the attorneys specialized in environmental and energy policy who have served as DEP commissioner for most of the past decade.
Mercer will fill a post vacated by Patricia Aho - a lawyer and former industry lobbyist - in September after a tumultuous four-year tenure during which she clashed with environmental groups but was credited with improving the DEP's relationship with the business community. Avery Day, an attorney and LePage's senior policy adviser on environmental and natural resource issues, has served as interim DEP commissioner since Aho left to join the Maine-based staff of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.
Mercer could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
According to biographical information provided by the governor's office, Mercer was lead developer of an energy project that reduced emissions from the Bucksport paper mill by 50 percent and served as president of Northeast Engineering in Bucksport from 1983 until 2008. The company provided consulting services to the power generation field, as well as project development of waste wood, biofuels, de-inking and wood products facilities. He also served as president of Bay Engineering from 1978 until 1982.
Bolduc, LePage's nominee for adjutant general, has filled the post in an acting position since the governor fired Brig. Gen. James Campbell over a proposal to swap out Maine's 133rd Engineer Battalion for an out-of-state infantry unit. Bolduc previously commanded the Maine Air National Guard and served as an assistant adjutant general at Camp Keyes in Augusta.
The adjutant general serves as the state's top military officer, as well as commissioner of the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management.
If confirmed by the Maine Senate, Beardsley would become the first education commissioner who didn't have the "acting" in front of his title since Stephen Bowen stepped down in August 2013. He is also well known in the State House and has served in numerous positions in the LePage administration.
The former longtime president and CEO of Husson University, Beardsley has served on the governing boards of the Maine Development Foundation, the Finance Authority of Maine, the Maine Higher Education Council, Maine Independent College Association and Maine Development Foundation. He served on the State Board of Education from 2012 until this past October, when he took over as acting commissioner from Tom Desjardin.
Beardsley also served as commissioner of the Maine Department of Conservation from 2011 to 2012, when the agency merged with the Department of Agriculture to form the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.

Texto completo:   Home sales were up more than 20 percent in Maine in November compared with a year earlier, outpacing increases in New England and the U.S. by a wide margin. However, the implementation of new rules designed to protect buyers from shady lending practices is expected to put the brakes on sales growth in December.
November home sales were up more than 20 percent in Maine compared with a year earlier, out-pacing other increases in New England by a wide margin.
The Maine Association of Realtors on Tuesday reported a 22.7 percent jump in sales of existing, detached single-family homes compared with November 2014. The median sale price for existing homes also continued its upward trend, rising 4.4 percent to $180,000 compared with a year earlier. The median indicates that half of the homes were sold for more and half sold for less.
Association President Marie Flaherty said in a news release that mild weather and threats of rising interest rates have had some impact on buyer decisions in the state. However, pent-up demand has had the biggest effect in Maine, she said.
"The winter season is still a great time for sellers to consider listing their home, as life changes always prompt the need to sell and buy homes - regardless of season," Flaherty said.
Portland real estate broker Michael Sosnowski of Maine Home Connection said fears about new loan-disclosure rules implemented in October slowing down the home-buying process appear to be mostly unfounded, although that could change as the market heats up next spring. One new requirement is that buyers must be given three days to consider any changes to the loan agreement.
Overall, he said, market conditions remain strong in Cumberland County, where homes have sustained a median price of over $250,000 for six consecutive months.
The key to making a successful purchase in the new disclosure environment is to work with lenders, agents and attorneys who are well-versed in the new rules, Sosnowski said.
"It's definitely more complex, and the timing requirements are real," he said.
For the three-month period ending Nov. 30, home sales in Maine were up 11.4 percent from the same period of 2014, from 3,945 sales to 4,394 sales, according to the association. The median sale price increased 5.7 percent from $175,000 to $185,000.
Among Maine's 16 counties, only two experienced sales declines for the three-month period compared with a year earlier: Androscoggin (-7.8 percent) and Hancock (-0.9 percent). Five counties had decreases in median sale price: Aroostook (-12 percent), Franklin (-4 percent), Knox (-4 percent), Penobscot (-3.7 percent) and Piscataquis (-4.1 percent).
The biggest sales increase for the three-month period was in Washington County, where sales were up 29.6 percent from 81 to 105. Washington County also had the biggest boost in median price - a 43.6 percent jump from $70,000 to $105,000.
Another report issued last week by real estate brokerage RE/MAX Integra of New England compared sales of existing single-family homes and condominiums throughout the region in November. It found that sales were up 22.1 percent in Maine, compared with 10.1 percent in New Hampshire and Rhode Island, 6.7 percent in Massachusetts, 4.3 percent in Connecticut and 3.5 percent in Vermont. The median sale price increased in all states but Connecticut and Vermont, it said. In Maine, pending home sales in November were up about 25 percent over the same month last year.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported a 4.6 percent dip in single-family existing home sales nationwide, while the national median price increased 6.6 percent to $221,600 in November. Regionally, it said sales in the Northeast were up 1.5 percent from November 2014, and the regional median of $254,800 represented a 3.2 percent rise. J.

Brazen scammer confesses, vows to not cease operation

Texto completo:   A hot tip to potential criminals: If you decide to admit to a felony while on a recorded line with police, make sure you're far out of reach while you do it.
That was the case for a police dispatcher in Scarborough, who followed up on a report of a telephone scam by calling the perpetrators back.
Incredibly, someone picked up, and the woman on the other end of the line could not have been more polite.
Scarborough public safety dispatcher Artie Green called the toll-free number. The woman who answered identified herself as being from Central Maine Power Co.'s "disconnection and billing department."
"You called a local business here threatening them with power disconnection (unless they gave you) money," Green said. "That's not how Central Maine Power operates in the state of Maine."
The woman barely pauses.
"Well sir, we don't have to operate the way they operate," she said, "because this is a scam."
In an interview Tuesday, Green said that he could hardly believe what he heard. "I was certainly taken aback, like anyone else," Green said. "She admitted it, just as plain as day."
Neither could Attorney General Janet Mills, whose office fields a few thousand complaints about such phone scams each year.
"It's amazing. It's so brazen," said Mills, after listening to a recording of the call posted on the Scarborough police Facebook page. "You know they're offshore somewhere, playing it up, figuring they're above the law. To some extent, they're right."
Prosecutions of such scammers are nearly impossible.
Mills could recall only a single case in which her office was able to forward information to authorities in Georgia, where a scammer apparently was operating.
But more often, perpetrators are far away in jurisdictions beyond the reach of any U.S. courts. The scammers also use methods to obscure the true origin of their calls, electronically "spoofing" caller identification systems to read as if the calls actually are originating from a utility company, the Internal Revenue Service or any number of agencies. A spokeswoman for CMP said the company has dealt with these scams since the summer of 2012 but has not seen a big increase recently.
Across the state, between Dec. 1, 2014, and Dec. 1, 2015, Mills' office received 3,176 complaints about such scams, a 26 percent increase from 2014, when 2,516 calls were reported. Most of the scams mirror the structure or premise of the one recorded in Scarborough, she said. A pushy caller asserts some vague authority, claims money is owed and insists on immediate payment.
Green, for his part, tried to push back during his call with the polite scammer.
"I would probably suggest that you cease calling any residents or businesses in Scarborough," he said.
Unfazed, the woman informs him that she is simply trying to meet her call quota.
"We have a couple of thousand dollars to make today," she said. "We cannot stop, sir."
Green takes it a step further.
"You do realize you just said you're operating a scam and calling local businesses trying to solicit money inappropriately and illegally," he said. "You do realize that, correct?"
The woman is as chipper as ever.
"Most definitely, sir!"
Green asks if she will stop.
"No sir, we will not stop," she said. "Merry Christmas!"
Rarely does the phone number used by scam perpetrators remain active long enough for authorities to reach them, and rarer still will someone openly admit to wire fraud. Not long after Green hung up, the number he used to reach the woman went dead.
Green has no idea where the woman had been calling from, and suspected the call was bounced around the world to disguise the true geographic origin.
"I'm sure she was in a much warmer place than we are," Green said.

Texto completo:   The names of Mainers who won cash prizes in the Hot Lotto game between 2010 and 2014 have been forwarded to Iowa officials investigating a burgeoning jackpot fixing case that may have affected winnings in at least five states.
Officials with the Maine State Lottery said Hot Lotto winners and prize amounts were shared with the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigations. To date, investigators have not discovered any link between Maine Hot Lotto winners and Eddie Tipton, a former security official for the Multi-State Lottery Association, of which Maine is a member.
The cooperation by Maine officials comes as authorities in other states are looking into whether their lotteries were compromised by an elaborate scheme that threatens to harm consumer confidence in a major source of states' revenues.
Tipton was convicted in July of fraud for an elaborate scheme in which he installed self-deleting software that rigged the selection of winning numbers in games that use random number generators. Tipton, whom Maine lottery officials confirmed had visited the state for a week in 2014 to inspect a new gaming system, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in September. The Maine visit and key testimony from a Maine State Lottery official helped secure Tipton's conviction on two fraud charges.
Michael Boardman, marketing manager for the Maine State Lottery, told a jury that he recognized Tipton's voice and mannerisms from a surveillance video in which the former security official purchased the winning ticket worth $14.3 million at a Des Moines convenience store in 2010. Tipton, whose position at the Multi-State Lottery Association barred him from playing the lottery, wore a hoodie in the video. Prosecutors alleged that Tipton tried to claim the prize just before the expiration deadline in December 2011. He did so through a New York attorney who claimed to represent a trust incorporated in Belize.
SUSPICION OF MORE JACKPOT 'FIXING'
Tipton's case is still an open investigation, according to officials with the Iowa Department of Justice. On Monday, investigators announced that two prizes in Kansas worth $44,000 were connected to Tipton or his associates. The Kansas announcement reinforces the suspicions of Thomas H. Miller, the former Iowa deputy attorney general who oversaw the investigation for more than two years. Miller told The Associated Press that "it would be pretty naive" to believe Tipton only tampered with four jackpots.
"If you find one cockroach, you have to assume there are 100 more you haven't found," he said.
Iowa officials have asked Maine and other states to assist in a probe that has expanded to games operated by the Multi-State Lottery Association. David Heidrich, a spokesman for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, the umbrella agency for the Maine State Lottery, said lottery officials have done "an extensive internal review of draw game winners for the Hot Lotto game" to determine whether Tipton or his associates collected winnings from Hot Lotto tickets purchased here.
In addition, Heidrich said Maine lottery officials have provided the names of people who won Hot Lotto prizes of more than $1,000 between 2010 and 2014 to the Iowa investigators.
Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for the Iowa Attorney General's Office, said he couldn't comment on whether investigators there had discovered any link between Maine prize winners and Tipton because of the ongoing investigation.
"To date, there is no winner information that connects Mr. Tipton to Maine prizes won," Heidrich said. The numbers of Hot Lotto tickets sold and game winners in Maine were not immediately available.
SCHEME TO ACCESS 'DRAW ROOM' system
Investigators are specifically looking for evidence that Hot Lotto prizes were awarded to any players who might have a connection to Tipton or anyone associated with him.
Maine Attorney General Janet Mills said Wednesday that Tipton's conviction raises concerns about the integrity of games.
"This office will continue to advise the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to ensure the integrity of the lottery games that are offered to the public, and we will continue to cooperate with officials in other states on these matters," she said.
Heidrich said Hot Lotto is the only game played in Maine with a connection to the Tipton case. Hot Lotto is a multistate game developed by the Multi-State Lottery Association, which employed Tipton as a security manager. The game, played in 14 states and the District of Columbia, is drawn through a random-digit generator at the Multi-State Lottery Association location in Iowa.
Prosecutors there say Tipton installed what's known as a root kit that allowed him to manipulate the winning numbers. According to court documents, he was one of four people with access to the Hot Lotto "draw room." In 2010 he entered the draw room to update the lottery system for daylight saving time. Prosecutors allege that he manipulated the room's closed-circuit cameras while installing self-destructing software that allowed him to rig Hot Lotto drawings, thereby flipping Hot Lotto's 29 million-to-1 odds of winning a jackpot.
Hot Lotto is played by picking five numbers from 1 to 47 and a so-called "hot ball" numbered from 1 to 19. All six balls must be picked correctly to win the jackpot.
Until Saturday, when a Hot Lotto ticket worth an estimated $1.1 million was purchased at a Hannaford supermarket in York, no jackpot-winning ticket had been previously purchased in Maine. Players spent $1.97 million on Hot Lotto tickets in Maine in fiscal year 2014 and $2.19 million in fiscal year 2015, Heidrich said.
He said Maine is still a part of the Multi-State Lottery Association, along with lotteries in 40 states. He said Maine has a central gaming system that allows players to purchase and redeem tickets.
"This system does not select winning numbers, and at no point during Mr. Tipton's security review did he have access to our gaming system," Heidrich said. Maine does not use any Multi-State Lottery Association software to run its Maine-based games, he said.
JACKPOT WINNERS NOT ALWAYS IDENTIFIED
Iowa prosecutors believe Tipton's scheme allowed him and his associates to collect prizes in several states, including Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas and now Kansas. His conviction centered on his attempt to collect the 2010 Iowa jackpot. Iowa is one of 44 states where the names of lottery winners are considered public information. However, the state is one of a handful that allows winners to collect through a trust organization.
Maine also allows lottery winners to collect through a trust. Heidrich said the last time a trust collected a jackpot in Maine was in 2009, after a winner claimed the jackpot in the Tri-State Megabucks game.
The Tipton case renewed calls from transparency advocates to ensure that the identity of lottery winners remains public. At least 10 states have considered shielding the identity of lottery winners, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The move toward anonymity has sparked debate among state lottery officials, whom critics accuse of promoting the winners to generate revenue that annually plows $20 billion into state budgets.
The Maine State Lottery generates about $230 million in annual revenue. Steve Mistler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at: smistler@pressherald.com Twitter: stevemistler

Texto completo:   Lack of evidence undermines effort to impeach LePage
AUGUSTA -- Maine's attorney general and a Kennebec County district attorney won't pursue a criminal investigation into Gov. Paul LePage's actions that led a private school in Fairfield to withdraw its job offer to Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves.
Attorney General Janet Mills and Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney announced their decision Tuesday in a letter to three state lawmakers who had requested a criminal inquiry into whether the governor abused his authority. The decision isn't surprising, given that either Mills or Maloney could have initiated an investigation at any time since the controversy involving the governor's threat to pull funding from Good Will-Hinckley surfaced in June.
Their determination that there isn't enough evidence to support a criminal charge weakens any effort to impeach the governor. Historically, most governors who have been impeached faced a criminal charge, according to the Council of State Governments. Nationally, there have been 17 such impeachment proceedings and eight convictions, but no Maine governor has ever been convicted in an impeachment trial.
Independent Rep. Jeffery Evangelos, of Friendship, and Democratic Reps. Ben Chipman, of Portland, and Charlotte Warren, of Hallowell, have said they are considering bringing articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives. In early December the trio asked Mills and Maloney to investigate whether LePage's actions constituted an abuse of power, a criminal offense.
Mills concluded that it didn't.
Under the criminal code, she wrote, "conduct cannot be judged solely by its result. Even though conduct may be viewed as offensive or inappropriate, it will not rise to the level of criminal wrongdoing if it does not satisfy the specific elements that constitute a criminal offense."
Mills added that there is "no basis at this time for us to pursue a criminal investigation."
The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Evangelos, reached by phone on Tuesday, said that despite Mills' announcement, the impeachment effort will continue with a bill that is set to be introduced in January.
"This just makes our impeachment effort more inevitable," Evangelos said. "Some legislators have said 'Enough.' He (LePage) has crossed a line."
Evangelos said that he, Chipman, Warren and Rep. Pinny Beebe-Center, D-Rockland, have retained Augusta attorney Walter McKee to research the legal basis for impeachment and have concluded that they have a strong case. Evangelos believes there's a group of 20 to 40 legislators who would strongly support impeachment, and as the effort moves forward, that number could grow.
However, the four legislators seeking impeachment likely would face difficult prospects, even though Democrats control the House. Democratic leadership has not committed to supporting impeachment.
Even if the House votes to impeach LePage, the trial would be held in the Republican-controlled Senate.
House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said the governor's actions were irresponsible, but he would not commit to supporting impeachment.
"From the get-go there were many of us who felt this abuse of power -- this trend of abuse of power -- is unacceptable going forward," he said. "Going forward, it's really trying to figure out a way to condemn these actions and figure out a way of preventing them in the future."
Eves released a statement from David Webbert, an attorney who is representing him in a lawsuit against LePage.
"The decision of the Attorney General comes as no surprise," Webbert said. "The Speaker will continue to focus on his federal civil rights lawsuit because it is the most effective way to hold Gov. LePage personally accountable for his reckless abuse of power and to set a legal precedent to protect Maine's people from future such abuses by a governor."
Republican House leader Rep. Kenneth Fredette, of Newport, was glad Mills and Maloney responded quickly to the request for a criminal probe, so lawmakers could put the issue behind them for the legislative session that begins in January.
The Legislature's Government Oversight Committee investigated the controversy and concluded that LePage's threat to pull $530,000 in state funding from Good Will-Hinckley led to the organization's decision to terminate Eves' contract as president of a charter school operated by Good Will-Hinckley, the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences.
The oversight committee and the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, the legislative watchdog agency overseen by the panel, were charged with fact finding, but not with making a determination of wrongdoing.
Results from OPEGA's fact-finding inquiry are likely to figure in Eves' lawsuit, which accuses LePage of violating his First Amendment rights and oppression by intimidation. The case is expected to take at least two years to settle.

Texto completo:   Ring operating out of Massachusetts ran 18 pounds of heroin worth $3.2M
SOUTH PARIS -- Law enforcement officials on Tuesday announced the arrests of 14 of 15 people indicted in what they called the largest drug investigation in Oxford County history.
Those arrested were part of a ring that smuggled Mexican heroin through a supplier in Lowell, Massachusetts, to dealers in Maine, who imported and distributed nearly 18 pounds of heroin since 2013 in various locations throughout Oxford County, the officials said. That much heroin represents about 80,000 doses with an estimated street value of $3.2 million, they said.
Maine Public Safety Commissioner John Morris, Maine Drug Enforcement Agency Director Roy McKinney and Oxford County Sheriff Wayne Gallant announced the culmination of the two-year investigation at a joint news conference held at the Oxford County Jail in South Paris.
They made the announcement after authorities in Massachusetts on Tuesday morning arrested the man they identified as the key supplier for the ring -- Brian Aquino, 34, of Lynn, Massachusetts -- on felony charges of aggravated trafficking of heroin and drug conspiracy.
McKinney said that Aquino would supply two other key members of the ring -- Del Hathaway, 26, of Saco, and Brianna Thayer, 26, of Tennessee -- with heroin they bought at $500 a "finger" and resold for double that amount in Maine. Hathaway had moved from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Maine to oversee the distribution ring, he and the others told police.
Although investigators believe the ring moved 17.8 pounds of heroin, officers who arrested 14 of the 15 people sought seized only an ounce of heroin in Maine and 10 ounces of heroin -- or nearly 2,800 doses -- in Lowell.
Heroin has become an increasingly bigger problem in rural states such as Maine, where the drug is cheaper to obtain than prescription opiates. A Maine Sunday Telegram investigation this month found that drug cartels in South and Central America are funneling thousands of dollars worth of heroin to the Northeast, which they view as an emerging and lucrative market.
The result is more addicts and an increased effort on the part of political leaders, medical officials and law enforcement to combat the epidemic. In Maine, the number of people seeking treatment more than tripled from 1,115 in 2010 to 3,463 in 2014. Overdose deaths in that same period spiked from 16 to 100.
Gov. Paul LePage has called for more drug enforcement agents to deal with the illegal trafficking of drugs, especially heroin, into Maine. The Legislature last week came up with a plan to increase funding for drug treatment and hire more law enforcement agents, although the governor has criticized the comprehensiveness, detail and timing of the plan.
"This is the path the MDEA will continue on, and that is going after the organized, out-of-state dealers and not concentrate on the individual users. There are better ways to help those who are sick with addiction. We must disrupt the out-of-state gangs and organizations," Morris said.
Although state and federal authorities in Maine have conducted large-scale drug investigations elsewhere in the state, particularly in urban areas such as Portland and Lewiston, Morris said the Oxford County investigation shows how deeply out-of-state drug dealers have penetrated even the most rural parts of the state.
Tuesday's arrests come just one day after drug agents and police cracked down on what authorities are describing as a significant heroin trafficking operation based in Orland, a small, rural community in Hancock County.
In that operation on Monday, police arrested three people on charges of aggravated trafficking in heroin and conspiracy to traffic in heroin. Drug agents seized 400 grams of heroin and 22 pounds of marijuana along with 750 oxycodone pills, more than a dozen firearms and $40,000 in cash from a home in Orland. That investigation took one year to complete.
"The arrests disturb a significant source of the heroin being distributed within western Hancock County," drug agents and police said in a joint statement.
Also on Monday, state police arrested two men on heroin and cocaine charges after they tried to elude police during a traffic stop along U.S. Route 202 in Alfred.
In the Oxford County drug investigation, the three officials said their agencies worked together after a Maine State Police trooper made a traffic stop in 2013 that served as the launching point for the investigation, which lasted from January 2013 to April 2015.
An Oxford County grand jury indicted 15 people as a result of that investigation, all on felony drug conspiracy charges and some on class A felony trafficking charges, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
"This is the poison killing our people," Gallant said.
Morris said that in addition to charges in Maine, Aquino probably will face charges in Massachusetts for his role in the ring there. "This investigation reveals just the staggering amount that just one group brings in to Maine," McKinney said.
McKinney said the MDEA has launched more drug investigations this year than in years past and plans to release some of that data later this week.
In addition to Aquino, Hathaway and Thayer, the others arrested are:
Brandon Blood, 23, of Bethel; Morgan McKinney, 20, of Bethel; Dana Ingerson, 29, of Buckfield; Courtney Moulton, 23, of Tennessee; Scott Billings, 24, of Milton Plantation; Kevin Litchfield, 28, of Oxford; Richard Labay, 38, of West Paris; Michael Farnum, 24, of Bethel; Cameron Gervais, 26, of South Portland; Gregory Ford, 54, of Scarborough; and Matthew Ross, 23, formerly of Westbrook and now homeless.
All those arrested had bail amounts set between $10,000 cash and $100,000 cash.
At the time of Tuesday's news conference, Jacob Santillo, 25, of Rumford, still was being sought on an arrest warrant on heroin trafficking and conspiracy charges.

Educator sexual contact bill gets OK

Texto completo:   Legislature to take up proposal responding to Waterville principal's case
Legislation from Benton Sen. Scott Cyrway that would make it illegal for an educator in Maine to have sexual contact with any student regardless of age is moving forward.
The proposal from Cyrway, a Republican who represents the Waterville area, came in response to allegations against Don Reiter, who was fired from his position as principal at Waterville Senior High School after he was accused of asking an 18-year-old female student to have sex with him.
Under current Maine law, it is illegal for an educator to have sexual contact with a student who is 17 or younger. The general age of sexual consent in Maine is 16.
Last week, the Legislative Council approved Cyrway's proposal to proceed as an emergency measure that will be taken up by the Legislature in the upcoming short session at the State House.
Cyrway, who previously worked for 25 years with the Kennebec County Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday he's heard only positive feedback to his proposal, and he hopes lawmakers could vote on the measure as soon as mid- to late January.
"I think everybody's on board. We're just going to fine-tune how it's going to read," Cyrway said of the bill. "It's time it's taken care of."
Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney has charged Reiter with official oppression in connection with the student allegations and said that her office would have charged Reiter with attempted sexual assault if the student had been younger than 18.
Official oppression is a misdemeanor charge, and Maloney said she brought it against Reiter for allegedly abusing his power when he asked the student for sex.
When Maloney announced her office would charge Reiter, she questioned the law's identification of 17 as the cutoff age.
"I think it is long overdue," Maloney said after Cyrway proposed the legislation. "The same unequal power dynamic exists in post-secondary education, whether the student is 17 or 18, and that is what the statute is there to protect -- to make sure that that unequal power dynamic is not exploited and a student doesn't feel pressured into doing something that the student is not ready for.
"I'm really pleased that Senator Cyrway has taken those steps."
Cyrway said he thinks the age 17 cutoff was established because it relates to the general distinction the law has made between juveniles and adults, but he added that all students need protection from a situation in which an educator could try to use power to take advantage.
While school officials always have the option of dismissing an educator despite the existing state law, Cyrway said the law is still an oversight that needs correcting.
"This is going to make it more serious, give more teeth to it," he said.

AUGUSTA -- Maine's attorney general and a Kennebec County district attorney won't pursue a criminal investigation into Gov. Paul LePage's actions that led a private school in Fairfield to withdraw its job offer to Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves.

Independent Rep. Jeffery Evangelos, of Friendship, and Democratic Reps. Ben Chipman, of Portland, and Charlotte Warren, of Hallowell, have said they are considering bringing articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives. In early December the trio asked Mills and Maloney to investigate whether LePage's actions constituted an abuse of power, a criminal offense.
Mills concluded that it didn't.
Under the criminal code, she wrote, "conduct cannot be judged solely by its result. Even though conduct may be viewed as offensive or inappropriate, it will not rise to the level of criminal wrongdoing if it does not satisfy the specific elements that constitute a criminal offense."
Mills added that there is "no basis at this time for us to pursue a criminal investigation."
The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Evangelos, reached by phone on Tuesday, said that despite Mills' announcement, the impeachment effort will continue with a bill that is set to be introduced in January.
"This just makes our impeachment effort more inevitable," Evangelos said. "Some legislators have said 'Enough.' He (LePage) has crossed a line."
Evangelos said that he, Chipman, Warren and Rep. Pinny Beebe-Center, D-Rockland, have retained Augusta attorney Walter McKee to research the legal basis for impeachment and have concluded that they have a strong case. Evangelos believes there's a group of 20 to 40 legislators who would strongly support impeachment, and as the effort moves forward, that number could grow.
However, the four legislators seeking impeachment likely would face difficult prospects, even though Democrats control the House. Democratic leadership has not committed to supporting impeachment.
Even if the House votes to impeach LePage, the trial would be held in the Republican-controlled Senate.
House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said the governor's actions were irresponsible, but he would not commit to supporting impeachment.
"From the get-go there were many of us who felt this abuse of power -- this trend of abuse of power -- is unacceptable going forward," he said. "Going forward, it's really trying to figure out a way to condemn these actions and figure out a way of preventing them in the future."
Eves released a statement from David Webbert, an attorney who is representing him in a lawsuit against LePage.
"The decision of the Attorney General comes as no surprise," Webbert said. "The Speaker will continue to focus on his federal civil rights lawsuit because it is the most effective way to hold Gov. LePage personally accountable for his reckless abuse of power and to set a legal precedent to protect Maine's people from future such abuses by a governor."
Republican House leader Rep. Kenneth Fredette, of Newport, was glad Mills and Maloney responded quickly to the request for a criminal probe, so lawmakers could put the issue behind them for the legislative session that begins in January.
The Legislature's Government Oversight Committee investigated the controversy and concluded that LePage's threat to pull $530,000 in state funding from Good Will-Hinckley led to the organization's decision to terminate Eves' contract as president of a charter school operated by Good Will-Hinckley, the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences.
The oversight committee and the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, the legislative watchdog agency overseen by the panel, were charged with fact finding, but not with making a determination of wrongdoing.
Results from OPEGA's fact-finding inquiry are likely to figure in Eves' lawsuit, which accuses LePage of violating his First Amendment rights and oppression by intimidation. The case is expected to take at least two years to settle.

Texto completo:   Links sought between Maine winners and lottery official accused of fraud
The names of Mainers who won cash prizes in the Hot Lotto game from 2010 to 2014 have been forwarded by state lottery officials to Iowa officials investigating a burgeoning jackpot fixing case that may have affected winnings in at least five states.
Officials with the Maine State Lottery said Hot Lotto winners and prize amounts were shared with the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigations. To date, investigators have discovered no link between Maine Hot Lotto winners and Eddie Tipton, a former security official for the Multi-State Lottery Association, of which Maine is a member. The cooperation by Maine officials comes as authorities in other states are looking into whether their lotteries were compromised by a deception that threatens to harm consumer confidence in a major source of states' revenue.
Tipton was convicted in July of fraud for an elaborate scheme in which he installed self-deleting software that rigged the selection of winning numbers in games that use random number generators. Tipton, who Maine lottery officials confirmed visited the state for a week in 2014 to inspect a new gaming system, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in September. The Maine visit and key testimony from a Maine State Lottery official helped secure Tipton's conviction on two fraud charges.
Michael Boardman, the marketing manager for the Maine State Lottery, told a jury that he recognized Tipton's voice and mannerisms from a surveillance video in which the former security official purchased the winning ticket worth $14.3 million at a Des Moines convenience store in 2010. Tipton, whose position at the Multi-State Lottery Association barred him from playing the lottery, wore a hoodie in the video. Prosecutors alleged that Tipton attempted to claim the prize just before the expiration deadline in December 2011. He did so through a New York attorney who claimed to represent a trust incorporated in Belize.
Tipton's case is still an open investigation, according to officials with the Iowa Department of Justice. On Monday, investigators announced that two prizes in Kansas worth $44,000 were connected to Tipton or his associates. The Kansas announcement reinforces the suspicions of Thomas H. Miller, the former Iowa deputy attorney general who oversaw the investigation for more than two years. Miller told the Associated Press that "it would be pretty naive" to believe Tipton only tampered with four jackpots.
"If you find one cockroach, you have to assume there are 100 more you haven't found," he said.
Iowa officials have asked Maine and other states to assist in a probe that has expanded to games operated by the Multi-State Lottery Association. David Heidrich, a spokesman for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, the umbrella agency for the Maine State Lottery, said lottery officials have done "an extensive internal review of draw game winners for the Hot Lotto game" to determine whether Tipton or his associates collected winnings from Hot Lotto tickets purchased here.
In addition, Heidrich said that Maine lottery officials have provided a list of Hot Lotto winners with prizes of more than $1,000 between 2010 and 2014 to the Iowa investigators.
Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for the Iowa Attorney General's Office, said he couldn't comment on whether investigators there had discovered any link between Maine prize winners and Tipton because of the ongoing investigation.
"To date, there is no winner information that connects Mr. Tipton to Maine prizes won," Heidrich said. The numbers of Hot Lotto tickets sold and game winners in Maine were not immediately available.
Investigators are specifically looking for evidence that Hot Lotto prizes were awarded to any players who might have a connection to Tipton or anyone associated with him.
Maine Attorney General Janet Mills said Wednesday that Tipton's conviction raises concerns about the integrity of games.
"This Office will continue to advise the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to ensure the integrity of the lottery games that are offered to the public, and we will continue to cooperate with officials in other states on these matters," she said.
Heidrich said Hot Lotto is the only game played in Maine with a connection to the Tipton case. Hot Lotto is a multi-state game developed by the Multi-State Lottery Association, which employed Tipton as a security manager. The game, played in 14 states and the District of Columbia, is drawn through a random-digit generator at the Multi-State Lottery Association location in Iowa.
Prosecutors there say Tipton installed what's known as a root kit that allowed him to manipulate the winning numbers. According to court documents, he was one of four people with access to the Hot Lotto "draw room." In 2010 he entered the draw room to update the lottery system for daylight saving time. Prosecutors allege that he manipulated the room's closed circuit cameras while installing self-destructing software that allowed him to rig Hot Lotto drawings, thereby flipping Hot Lotto's 29 million-to-1 odds of winning a jackpot.
Hot Lotto is played by picking five numbers from 1 to 47 and a "hot ball" numbered from 1 to 19. All six balls must be picked correctly to win the jackpot.
Until Saturday, when a Hot Lotto ticket worth an estimated $1.1 million was purchased at a Hannaford supermarket in York, no jackpot ticket had been purchased in Maine. Players spent $1.97 million on Hot Lotto tickets in Maine in fiscal year 2014 and $2.19 million in fiscal year 2015, Heidrich said.
He said Maine is still a part of the Multi-State Lottery Association along with lotteries in 40 states. He said the state has a central gaming system that allows players to purchase and redeem tickets.
"This system does not select winning numbers, and at no point during Mr. Tipton's security review did he have access to our gaming system," Heidrich said. Maine does not use any Multi-State Lottery Association software to run its Maine-based games, he said.
Iowa prosecutors believe Tipton's scheme allowed him and his associates to collect prizes in several states, including Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas and now Kansas. His conviction centered on his attempt to collect the 2010 Iowa jackpot. Iowa is one of 44 states where the names of lottery winners are considered public information. However, the state is one of a handful that allows winners to collect through a trust organization.
Maine also allows lottery winners to collect through a trust. Heidrich said the last time a trust collected a jackpot in Maine was in 2009 after a winner claimed the jackpot in the Tri-State Megabucks game.
The Tipton case renewed calls from transparency advocates to ensure that the identity of lottery winners remains public. At least 10 states have considered shielding the identity of lottery winners, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The move toward anonymity has sparked debate among state lottery officials, whom critics accuse of promoting the winners to generate revenue that annually plows $20 billion into state budgets.
The Maine State Lottery generates about $230 million in revenue.

Texto completo:   Links between Mainers, jackpot fixing sought

Texto completo:   Ring operating out of Massachusetts handled 18 pounds of heroin worth $3.2 million
SOUTH PARIS -- Law enforcement officials on Tuesday announced the arrests of 14 of 15 people indicted in what they called the largest drug investigation in Oxford County history.
Those arrested were part of a ring that smuggled Mexican heroin through a supplier in Lowell, Massachusetts, to dealers in Maine, who imported and distributed nearly 18 pounds of heroin since 2013 in various locations throughout Oxford County, the officials said. That much heroin represents about 80,000 doses with an estimated street value of $3.2 million, they said.
Maine Public Safety Commissioner John Morris, Maine Drug Enforcement Agency Director Roy McKinney and Oxford County Sheriff Wayne Gallant announced the culmination of the two-year investigation at a joint news conference held at the Oxford County Jail in South Paris.
They made the announcement after authorities in Massachusetts on Tuesday morning arrested the man they identified as the key supplier for the ring -- Brian Aquino, 34, of Lynn, Massachusetts -- on felony charges of aggravated trafficking of heroin and drug conspiracy.
McKinney said that Aquino would supply two other key members of the ring -- Del Hathaway, 26, of Saco, and Brianna Thayer, 26, of Tennessee -- with heroin they bought at $500 a "finger" and resold for double that amount in Maine. Hathaway had moved from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Maine to oversee the distribution ring, he and the others told police.
Although investigators believe the ring moved 17.8 pounds of heroin, officers who arrested 14 of the 15 people sought seized only an ounce of heroin in Maine and 10 ounces of heroin -- or nearly 2,800 doses -- in Lowell.
Heroin has become an increasingly bigger problem in rural states such as Maine, where the drug is cheaper to obtain than prescription opiates. A Maine Sunday Telegram investigation this month found that drug cartels in South and Central America are funneling thousands of dollars worth of heroin to the Northeast, which they view as an emerging and lucrative market.
The result is more addicts and an increased effort on the part of political leaders, medical officials and law enforcement to combat the epidemic. In Maine, the number of people seeking treatment more than tripled from 1,115 in 2010 to 3,463 in 2014. Overdose deaths in that same period spiked from 16 to 100.
Gov. Paul LePage has called for more drug enforcement agents to deal with the illegal trafficking of drugs, especially heroin, into Maine. The Legislature last week came up with a plan to increase funding for drug treatment and hire more law enforcement agents, although the governor has criticized the comprehensiveness, detail and timing of the plan.
"This is the path the MDEA will continue on, and that is going after the organized, out-of-state dealers and not concentrate on the individual users. There are better ways to help those who are sick with addiction. We must disrupt the out-of-state gangs and organizations," Morris said.
Although state and federal authorities in Maine have conducted large-scale drug investigations elsewhere in the state, particularly in urban areas such as Portland and Lewiston, Morris said the Oxford County investigation shows how deeply out-of-state drug dealers have penetrated even the most rural parts of the state.
Tuesday's arrests come just one day after drug agents and police cracked down on what authorities are describing as a significant heroin trafficking operation based in Orland, a small, rural community in Hancock County.
In that operation on Monday, police arrested three people on charges of aggravated trafficking in heroin and conspiracy to traffic in heroin. Drug agents seized 400 grams of heroin and 22 pounds of marijuana along with 750 oxycodone pills, more than a dozen firearms and $40,000 in cash from a home in Orland. That investigation took one year to complete.
"The arrests disturb a significant source of the heroin being distributed within western Hancock County," drug agents and police said in a joint statement.
Also on Monday, state police arrested two men on heroin and cocaine charges after they tried to elude police during a traffic stop along U.S. Route 202 in Alfred.
In the Oxford County drug investigation, the three officials said their agencies worked together after a Maine State Police trooper made a traffic stop in 2013 that served as the launching point for the investigation, which lasted from January 2013 to April 2015.
An Oxford County grand jury indicted 15 people as a result of that investigation, all on felony drug conspiracy charges and some on class A felony trafficking charges, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
"This is the poison killing our people," Gallant said.
Morris said that in addition to charges in Maine, Aquino probably will face charges in Massachusetts for his role in the ring there.
"This investigation reveals just the staggering amount that just one group brings in to Maine," McKinney said.
McKinney said the MDEA has launched more drug investigations this year than in years past and plans to release some of that data later this week.
In addition to Aquino, Hathaway and Thayer, the others arrested are:
Brandon Blood, 23, of Bethel; Morgan McKinney, 20, of Bethel; Dana Ingerson, 29, of Buckfield; Courtney Moulton, 23, of Tennessee; Scott Billings, 24, of Milton Plantation; Kevin Litchfield, 28, of Oxford; Richard Labay, 38, of West Paris; Michael Farnum, 24, of Bethel; Cameron Gervais, 26, of South Portland; Gregory Ford, 54, of Scarborough; and Matthew Ross, 23, formerly of Westbrook and now homeless.
All those arrested had bail amounts set between $10,000 cash and $100,000 cash.
At the time of Tuesday's news conference, Jacob Santillo, 25, of Rumford, still was being sought on an arrest warrant on heroin trafficking and conspiracy charges.

Texto completo:   Sales outpaced New England, nation; median price continued to rise
November home sales were up more than 20 percent in Maine compared with a year earlier, outpacing other increases in New England by a wide margin.
The Maine Association of Realtors on Tuesday reported a 22.7 percent jump in sales of existing, detached single-family homes compared with November 2014. The median sale price for existing homes also continued its upward trend, rising 4.4 percent to $180,000 compared with a year earlier.
The median indicates that half of the homes were sold for more and half sold for less.
Association President Marie Flaherty said in a news release that mild weather and threats of rising interest rates have had some effect on buyer decisions in the state. However, pent-up demand has had the biggest effect in Maine, she said.
"The winter season is still a great time for sellers to consider listing their home, as life changes always prompt the need to sell and buy homes -- regardless of season," Flaherty said.
Portland real estate broker Michael Sosnowski, of Maine Home Connection, said fears about new loan-disclosure rules implemented in October slowing down the home-buying process appear to be mostly unfounded, although that could change as the market heats up next spring. One new requirement is that buyers must be given three days to consider any changes to the loan agreement.
For the three-month period ending Nov. 30, home sales in Maine were up 11.4 percent from the same period of 2014, from 3,945 sales to 4,394 sales, according to the association. The median sale price increased 5.7 percent from $175,000 to $185,000.
Overall, he said, market conditions remain strong in Cumberland County, where homes have sustained a median price of over $250,000 for six consecutive months.
The key to making a successful purchase in the new disclosure environment is to work with lenders, agents and attorneys who are well-versed in the new rules, Sosnowski said.
"It's definitely more complex, and the timing requirements are real," he said.
Among Maine's 16 counties, only two experienced sales declines for the three-month period compared with a year earlier: Androscoggin (-7.8 percent) and Hancock (-0.9 percent). Five counties had decreases in median sale price: Aroostook (-12 percent), Franklin (-4 percent), Knox (-4 percent), Penobscot (-3.7 percent) and Piscataquis (-4.1 percent).
The biggest sales increase for the three-month period was in Washington County, where sales were up 29.6 percent from 81 to 105. Washington County also had the biggest boost in median price -- a 43.6 percent jump from $70,000 to $105,000.
Another report issued last week by real estate brokerage RE/MAX Integra of New England compared sales of existing single-family homes and condominiums throughout the region in November. It found that sales were up 22.1 percent in Maine, compared with 10.1 percent in New Hampshire and Rhode Island, 6.7 percent in Massachusetts, 4.3 percent in Connecticut and 3.5 percent in Vermont. The median sale price increased in all states but Connecticut and Vermont, it said.
In Maine, pending home sales in November were up about 25 percent over the same month last year.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported a 4.6 percent dip in single-family existing home sales nationwide, while the national median price increased 6.6 percent to $221,600 in November. Regionally, it said sales in the Northeast were up 1.5 percent from November 2014, and the regional median of $254,800 represented a 3.2 percent rise.

Texto completo:   Legislature to take up proposal responding to Waterville principal's case
Legislation from Benton Sen. Scott Cyrway that would make it illegal for an educator in Maine to have sexual contact with any student regardless of age is moving forward.
The proposal from Cyrway, a Republican who represents the Waterville area, came in response to allegations against Don Reiter, who was fired from his position as principal at Waterville Senior High School after he was accused of asking an 18-year-old female student to have sex with him.
Under current Maine law, it is illegal for an educator to have sexual contact with a student who is 17 or younger. The general age of sexual consent in Maine is 16.
Last week, the Legislative Council approved Cyrway's proposal to proceed as an emergency measure that will be taken up by the Legislature in the upcoming short session at the State House.
Cyrway, who previously worked for 25 years with the Kennebec County Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday he's heard only positive feedback to his proposal, and he hopes lawmakers could vote on the measure as soon as mid- to late January.
"I think everybody's on board. We're just going to fine-tune how it's going to read," Cyrway said of the bill. "It's time it's taken care of."
Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney has charged Reiter with official oppression in connection with the student allegations and said that her office would have charged Reiter with attempted sexual assault if the student had been younger than 18. Official oppression is a misdemeanor charge, and Maloney said she brought it against Reiter for allegedly abusing his power when he asked the student for sex.
When Maloney announced her office would charge Reiter, she questioned the law's identification of 17 as the cutoff age.
"I think it is long overdue," Maloney said after Cyrway proposed the legislation. "The same unequal power dynamic exists in post-secondary education, whether the student is 17 or 18, and that is what the statute is there to protect -- to make sure that that unequal power dynamic is not exploited and a student doesn't feel pressured into doing something that the student is not ready for.
"I'm really pleased that Senator Cyrway has taken those steps."
Cyrway said he thinks the age 17 cutoff was established because it relates to the general distinction the law has made between juveniles and adults, but he added that all students need protection from a situation in which an educator could try to use power to take advantage.
While school officials always have the option of dismissing an educator despite the existing state law, Cyrway said the law is still an oversight that needs correcting.
"This is going to make it more serious, give more teeth to it," he said.

Things that can ruin your pet's holiday season

Texto completo: In an effort to save Maine pet owners extra stress this holiday season, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry recently issued a press release that includes a number of helpful pet safety tips.
You might be surprised at some of the typical holiday items and foods that can be hazardous to your pets.
For example, did you know that pets shouldn't be fed turkey or turkey skin? Even a small amount can cause a life-threatening condition in pets known as pancreatitis, according to American Veterinary Medical Association.
"Healthy pets make happy owners. We want all Mainers and their pets to have a positive experience this holiday season," said Maine State Veterinarian, Dr. Michele Walsh, in the press release. "A little bit of forethought can go a long way toward avoiding stressful, expensive, possibly fatal trips to a veterinarian. The American Veterinary Medical Association and other organizations offer tips on how to help ensure that your pets make it through the holidays safely."
I've written about this before. In fact, I wrote about it extensively in the blog "Holiday Foods and Decor That Can Harm Your Dog."
Some of the top "people foods" that harm pets during the holidays are:
--
Chocolate.
Most people know that chocolate is toxic to dogs, but did you know it's also toxic to cats? If your pet does manage to snag a chocolate Santa from a stocking, you should call your veterinarian, and you can also get a good idea of the severity of the issue by using the
PetMD online Chocolate Toxicity Meter, which calculates toxicity based on the type of chocolate, amount consumed and size of your pet.
-- Other sweets and baked goods. These foods are often too rich for pets. Plus, an artificial sweetener often found in baked goods, candy and chewing gum has been linked to liver failure and death in dogs. It's called "xylitol."
-- Onions, raisins and grapes are poisonous to pets. Just a few raisins can be life threatening to a small dog.
-- Fatty table scraps. Things like gravy and meat fat can be hard for animals to digest and can cause pancreatitis.
If you believe your pet has been poisoned or eaten something it shouldn't have, call your veterinarian or local veterinary emergency clinic immediately. You may also want to call the ASPCA Poison Control Hotline: 1-888-426-4435. Signs of pet distress include sudden changes in behavior such as acting lethargic or manic, pain, vomiting or diarrhea.
While human food is the cause of many pet emergencies, holiday decorations have also caused problems. Many pets are curious by nature, and when something new pops into their environment -- such as a Christmas tree -- they have to check it out.
Here are a few safety tips concerning decorations, courtesy of American Veterinary Medical Association:
-- Christmas trees can tip over if pets climb on them or try to play with the lights and ornaments. Consider tying your tree to the ceiling or a door frame using fishing line to secure it.
-- Ornaments. Broken ornaments can cause injuries, and ingested ornaments can cause intestinal blockage or even toxicity. Keep any homemade ornaments, particularly those made from salt-dough or other food-based materials, out of reach of pets.
-- Tinsel, taffeta, ribbon and other holiday decorations and wrapping materials can be tempting for pets to eat. Consuming them can cause intestinal blockages, sometimes requiring surgery.
-- Flowers and festive plants can result in an emergency veterinary visit if your pet gets hold of them. Amaryllis, mistletoe, balsam, pine, cedar, and holly are among the common holiday plants that can be dangerous and even poisonous to pets who decide to eat them. Poinsettias can be troublesome as well. The ASPCA offers lists of plants that are toxic to dogs and cats.
-- Candles. Never leave a pet alone in an area with a lit candle; it could result in a fire.
-- Potpourris should be kept out of reach of pets. Liquid potpourris pose risks because they contain essential oils and cationic detergents that can severely damage your pet's mouth, eyes and skin. Solid potpourris could cause problems if eaten.
Also during the holidays, it's important to keep in mind that your pet may not be accustomed to so many visitors. All pets should have access to a comfortable, quiet place if they want to retreat from the crowd, according to ASPCA. And you'll need to watch the exits when guests come and go. It would be a shame if your pet ran out the door and became lost during the holidays. As a precaution, make sure your pet is wearing identification tags before the party gets started.
It's also considerate to inform your guests ahead of time that you have pets or that other guests may be bringing pets to your house. Some people are afraid of certain pets, and other may be allergic.
And lastly, if you're headed out to a holiday gathering rather than hosting one, be sure to unplug decorations before you leave the house. Also, take out the trash, especially if it contains any food scraps.

Texto completo:   Forget the Yule Log on Christmas Eve unless you want to break into a sweat in the eastern U.S.
Record high temperatures could soar into the 70s on Thursday, shattering Christmas Eve records in several cities, including Boston (where the record high is 61), New York City (63), Philadelphia (64), Washington (69), Charlotte (71) and Atlanta (72).
"There is a high probability for record-setting warmth up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard," AccuWeather meteorologist Rob Englund said.
Highs Thursday will range from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast. Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the U.S., he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies, the National Weather Service says.

Texto completo:   Forget the Yule Log on Christmas Eve unless you want to break into a sweat in the eastern U.S.
Record high temperatures could soar into the 70s on Thursday, shattering Christmas Eve records in several cities, including Boston (where the record high is 61), New York City (63), Philadelphia (64), Washington (69), Charlotte (71) and Atlanta (72).
"There is a high probability for record-setting warmth up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard," AccuWeather meteorologist Rob Englund said.
Highs Thursday will range from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast. Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the U.S., he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies, the National Weather Service says.

Record high temperatures could soar into the 70s on Thursday, shattering Christmas Eve records in several cities, including Boston (where the record high is 61), New York City (63), Philadelphia (64), Washington (69), Charlotte (71) and Atlanta (72).
"There is a high probability for record-setting warmth up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard," AccuWeather meteorologist Rob Englund said.
Highs Thursday will range from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast. Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the U.S., he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies, the National Weather Service says.

Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the U.S., he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
The Storm Prediction Center said northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma are most at risk for severe storms Tuesday.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies, the National Weather Service says.

Texto completo:   As members of the Purdue women's basketball team travel home during the holidays, they'll appreciate their accomplishments through the first 11 games and enjoy the progress that's been made.
Once the Boilermakers return the day after Christmas, it's time for the Big Ten. Purdue's 9-2 record shows there's a different vibe about this year's team, but how the Boilermakers perform once the league play begins will ultimately define this season.
If Purdue can carry over what it has done on the defensive end, a steady diet of victories likely awaits during the grueling 18-game schedule. How the Boilermakers are playing defensively is one storyline, including Monday night's 56-33 victory over Maine at Mackey Arena to close out the non-conference season.
The Black Bears were held to a season low in points, three days after scoring 75 against Clemson, and converted just 1 of 15 from 3-point range.
Using improved ball pressure, more awareness in helping teammates leading to a different level of trust, Purdue's defense has demonstrated the biggest turnaround from last season.
Early on, the Boilermakers established who they were going to be.
"That's what we've been talking about since last year," said senior April Wilson, who totaled 10 points and five assists. "We lost our identity and our culture and that was the biggest thing for us because our defense gets us going."
For the most part, defense has been consistent. Granted, Purdue was able to clamp down on overmatched opponents but played well enough against Louisiana State, Louisville, Stanford and Dayton to show it has made strides.
The Boilermakers held their first nine opponents to 60 points or less through regulation and allowed only 70 points once in the first 11 games.
"It gets us going," said Bridget Perry, who collected 10 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three steals. "When we're aggressive and getting in the passing lanes and pressuring the ball, we continue to feed off of each other."
The Boilermakers finished defensive possessions Monday, holding a 36-27 rebounding advantage and limiting Maine to three individual offensive rebounds. They forced 17 turnovers and outscored the Black Bears 36-24 in the paint.
Those statistics were generated because of strong defensive play, helping spark a 15-3 first-half run where Purdue hit six straight field goals and opened up a 15-point lead.
"We know our defense sets the tone for our offense and that's who we are," said coach Sharon Versyp said. "We found our identity pretty quickly this year. It's about discipline, accountability on defense and the rest will come. I feel confident on both ends, but our defense allows us to run so much better and share the ball a lot better and it calms us down when we defend the way we do."
Winning on defense alone won't cut it against Big Ten competition. The Boilermakers will need several contributions on the offensive end, but Wilson and Ashley Morrissette continue to play well on the perimeter and Perry has been steady at the power forward spot.
A strong post presence is needed on both ends and rebounding - a bright spot right now - has to continue its upward trend to give Purdue a chance of making this year's Big Ten season a successful one.
It all goes with Versyp's mantra of "nothing can be soft" once the conference starts.
"The mental toughness has to go to another level, the physicality is going to another level and we have to not allow little mistakes," Versyp said. "You can't make poor mistakes in the Big Ten."

Highs on Thursday will range from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast.
Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the USA, he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
The Storm Prediction Center said northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma are most at risk for severe storms Tuesday.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies -- up to 2-3 feet in the next few days, according to the National Weather Service forecast.

Texto completo:   Forget the Yule Log on Christmas Eve unless you want to break into a sweat in the eastern U.S.
Record high temperatures could soar into the 70s on Thursday, shattering Christmas Eve records in several cities, including Boston (where the record high is 61), New York City (63), Philadelphia (64), Washington (69), Charlotte (71) and Atlanta (72).
"There is a high probability for record-setting warmth up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard," AccuWeather meteorologist Rob Englund said.
Highs Thursday will range from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast. Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the U.S., he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies, the National Weather Service says.

Texto completo:   This is the last in a monthly, yearlong series called Age of Opportunity about Maine people, organizations, towns and businesses that are helping keep older residents safe, healthy and happy.
It has been one year since Mary Owen, Betty Carter and Margaret Staples welcomed us into their homes on the Blue Hill peninsula and spoke about the challenges of growing older. In their 80s and 90s, they were finding it harder to go about the tasks of daily living -- buying groceries, lifting up a gallon of milk, driving to appointments.
They were hardly alone. Most people say they prefer to remain in the place they know and love, even as it becomes more difficult to be independent. But Owen, Carter and Staples had something many other older adults do not: a network of people ready to bring them to the grocery store or hairdresser, deliver their prescriptions, schedule regular in-home checkups from nurses, and organize social get-togethers.
That's because a small group of residents on the peninsula set out to find a way to avoid the near inevitability of adults having to go into assisted living or senior housing, or move in with family, as they grow older.
After three years of planning and community organizing, At Home Downeast began operating in the winter of 2012 as a program of the nonprofit Washington Hancock Community Agency. We featured the group last January as the first piece in this series, and we end with a look back on its year today.
An effort that started in people's livings rooms is significantly growing its membership base and expanding to other towns, offering hope to other rural Maine communities that there is a way to help aging neighbors live in their beloved homes longer. It requires hard work, coordination and vision on the part of local people who see -- and often experience -- the challenges directly.
These days, Owen, Carter and Staples -- in addition to Dorothy Noble, who met us as she did her shopping at Tradewinds Marketplace in Blue Hill last December -- are all still members of the program and able to live at home.
A year in review
It's been a busy year for the fledgling group, which is the state's first "village" of the Village to Village Network, a national nonprofit group that supports local programs to keep seniors safe in their homes. Surviving on in-kind contributions from volunteers, private donors, grant funding and membership fees based on a person's ability to pay, At Home Downeast has been lauded by state leaders and advocates for the aging. It serves the peninsula's nine towns of Surry, Blue Hill, Brooklin, Deer Isle, Stonington, Sedgwick, Brooksville, Penobscot and Castine.
Members are guaranteed four rides per month to medical appointments within a 50-mile radius, a check-in from a nurse twice a month, weekly grocery and prescription delivery from participating merchants, a safety assessment of their homes, and social gatherings. Volunteers -- who have undergone a background check and must provide a local reference -- can do most of the work. They also may help members with home repairs, call every so often to check in, provide companionship, make an occasional meal, assist with technology and sometimes take care of pets.
The model is proving scalable. To date, the group has nearly doubled the number of people it has helped, serving a total of 117 members, up from 60 a year ago. It now has 105 volunteers, up from 80. It has added more opportunities for socializing and events -- such as bringing members to see "The Nutcracker" in Orono.
In November 2015, the program delivered 425 individual services, up from 339 in November 2014. The vast majority of members -- 90 percent -- sign up for another year. The number fluctuates if someone dies or enters a nursing home.
And it has expanded to another region. Last year, At Home Mount Desert Island began offering services to residents of the towns of Southwest Harbor, Tremont and Mount Desert, and it soon will offer them in Bar Harbor. The MDI program has 29 volunteers and nine members so far.
The work continues to evolve, especially to fine-tune the medical components, which are not found in every village model. The program expanded the number of nursing programs it contracts with to send nurses to check on members in their homes. It has reached out to more area medical centers and community members on surrounding islands to share what services it can provide patients when they return home. And it has aimed to better coordinate care with its members who might end up in the hospital.
Kara Janes, the part-time program manager and a social worker, said the work finds a way to bridge gaps in services.
"In the past it's been 'this agency does this' and 'that agency does that,' and then there are these gaps. Who's going to do the stuff in the middle for this aging community?" she said.
To help improve the ability of the community to care for older adults, the group partnered with the Island Nursing Home in Deer Isle to hold free training in November -- and will hold another this spring -- for direct care workers who play a vital role in keeping seniors at home. Direct care workers might be certified nursing assistants, people who provide personal care, or housekeepers. Or they might be family members. They don't necessarily work with At Home Downeast, but they do help seniors in the community and could benefit from knowing basic techniques, such as how to best help a senior get up or down steps, or into a car.
"Because they're so important to support people to stay in their home, I want to support them any way I can," Janes said.
Growing up
As the number of members and services has increased, so has the need for staff and funding. The budget has grown to $150,000 this year, up from about $100,000. The group hired a part-time volunteer coordinator and increased Janes' hours.
"We want it to develop and grow and expand, but not lose quality," Janes said. "It's quality first. It's quality to the members. It's making sure the volunteers are supported and enjoying themselves."
To that end, the group is figuring out ways to measure its impact. It was asked to be part of a national survey of select villages in the Village to Village Network by the University of California, Berkeley. Do members have to go to the emergency room less often? Do they fall less at home? The research will aim to answer questions relating to the return on people's well-being.
The group also is partnering with the University of Maine Center on Aging to evaluate its programs and improve its ability to track the myriad services it provides, from making phone calls on a member's behalf to giving rides to specific medical facilities.
Outreach plays a significant part in the group's efforts, too. Janes, steering committee members and Joe Perkins, with the Washington Hancock Community Agency, have traveled from Portland to Bethel to discuss their model with interested residents. Other communities are planning their own villages, or have already launched. For instance, Awesome Seniors began operating in the Boothbay region this year. At Home Downeast can provide advice based on its own experience, though each village is unique.
The group makes a point to speak at conferences and is a member of the Tri-State Learning Collaborative on Aging, which shares information on successful strategies that help older adults thrive in their homes and communities across Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. It has met with some Maine lawmakers as well to ensure they understand the model.
"We offer our experience with At Home as one solution -- certainly not the only one -- to serve elders in their cherished homes and beloved communities. Whether through helping to shape policy, offering to help draft legislation or generally advocating for the aging-in-place movement, we look forward to building on our relationship with our legislators," Perkins said.
At some point, perhaps, the village model will spread to the point that it will gain financial support from the state. Meanwhile, At Home Downeast and At Home MDI are still looking for new ways to bridge gaps in care with other agencies and programs, and grow and strengthen their base of volunteers and members.
Last July, we asked our readers to rate promising efforts across the state that are helping improve Maine seniors' quality of life. All the efforts got high marks, but one in particular earned more stars on the scale of importance than all the others. It was the idea that residents in communities across the state should organize to help older adults age in place. Essentially, they wanted to see more programs like the ones on the Blue Hill peninsula and Mount Desert Island.
If there's any broad takeaway from this series, it's that change doesn't necessarily require government intervention or sweeping reforms. Often, what it takes is a group of willing and committed individuals who see a problem in their town and get together to figure out how to address it. At Home Downeast and At Home MDI illustrate a central theme that has emerged from our year of reporting on the issue: The ancient "neighbors helping neighbors" model is often the most effective way to change a community for the better.
We all hope to live a full and long life. The question is whether we will help one another along the way.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- The massive settlement fund for the families of 48 people killed in the July 2013 Lac-Megantic oil train explosion has been transferred into a trust and will go to victims' families early next year.
The bankruptcy trustee for the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway and the official overseeing bankruptcy proceedings in Canada announced late Tuesday that the settlement is fully funded.
Bernstein Shur, the Portland law firm of the railroad's U.S. bankruptcy trustee, Bob Keach, said in a news release Tuesday that a fund to settle the wrongful death claims will receive $114 million Canadian this week, from the total settlement fund of $460 million for injury and other damage claims.
The wrongful death settlement fund is equal to $81.9 million U.S. by the current exchange rate; the total fund is $330.4 million U.S.
"We are very pleased that we will be able to fund the trust before the holidays, and that distributions will reach the families as soon as possible next year," Keach said.
The other settlement funds for personal injury, moral damage and economic and property claims will be distributed in early 2016, managed by the monitor in the Canadian bankruptcy proceeding, Richter Advisory Group Inc.
Families of the wrongful death victims "will soon receive notice" from the trustee managing the wrongful death settlement fund, the statement said, regarding the distributions of those funds.
The fiery crash on the night of July 6, 2013, killed 47 people, and a Canadian judge determined the accident caused another man's later suicide.
The court-approved settlement for families of the 48 victims calls for compensation ranging from payments of $478,000 Canadian, or 0.43 percent of the settlement, to $5.3 million, or 4.8 percent, based on a point system that factors in the age of the victim, the age of surviving children and spouse and other conditions.
The settlement was funded by 24 defendants, including Shell Oil Co., ConocoPhillips, Irving Oil Ltd., World Fuel Services Corp., insurers and rail car companies.
A Transport Canada investigation found the train's lone conductor did not set enough handbrakes before leaving the train that night on a hill about 8 miles west of Lac-Megantic.

Resumen: [...]as she walks down memory lane, telling tales from her fifth-floor apartment in what's now called Freese's Assisted Living, she lets you in on a little secret. The Maine Discovery Museum, which opened in 2001, now fills some of the lower levels, while 39 apartments, including the Freese's Assisted Living units, occupy the top floors. A visit to her apartment turns into an impromptu tour of the facility, and Hunter proudly points out the impressive features of her home: the handsome atrium space, where many of the community events take place; the well-appointed dining room; the piano; a holiday tree in the atrium that stays in place year-round, its decorations changing for each special occasion.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- In a cozy apartment overlooking the pre-Christmas bustle of Main Street, Waneta Booker says a part of her wishes that her home -- the building that held Freese's department store until its doors closed 30 years ago -- was still the gargantuan anchor of the city's shopping district.
Now 86 years old, Booker remembers shopping here herself, you see. Back when the lights shone bright, and the Christmas music played loudly, beckoning folks to step in out of the snow and browse their way through seven floors of holiday -- and everyday -- delights.
Her husband, Reginald, worked as a hairdresser in a five-chair shop on the sixth floor before opening a shop of his own on Park Street. Her children always wanted to head to Freese's each Christmas. Once? No, more than that.
"My kids all knew that Freese's [Santa] was Santa Claus," Booker said. "All the other ones in the town, on the street, were his helpers. But the real one was right here."
Booker is short and quite spry -- she sometimes makes use of a cane, which she calls her "pogo stick" -- and as you quickly learn, she loves to talk.
And as she walks down memory lane, telling tales from her fifth-floor apartment in what's now called Freese's Assisted Living, she lets you in on a little secret.
"This floor was where Santa Claus was," Booker says, gesturing toward the door that leads into the main hallway. "When my son and his wife came from Oklahoma to see me about three months after I moved in, and when we got off the elevator, my son said, 'Hey! This used to be the toy department! My mother used to bring me here to see Santa Claus!"
Santa is long-gone, she says, as is the department store that had the most to do with Bangor's Main Street being dubbed "The Fifth Avenue of Maine."
But she remembers those days. And she remembers when those days ended, as downtown shriveled in the 1980s and the store eventually shut down amid various economic and societal pressures, including an exodus by other downtown businesses to newly built malls.
There's no underestimating the role that Freese's played in the family life of mid-1900s Bangorians.
And when the store closed?
"We cried," Booker said, softly.
During its heyday, Freese's was monstrous, a 140,000-square-foot store where you could buy everything from wedding dresses to appliances and furniture. (You could also purchase popcorn or peanuts on the ground floor, or have a full meal at a lunch counter.)
According to BDN archives, in 1957 Freese's installed escalators -- a rarity at the time -- and the area's children took turns riding repeatedly the newfangled moving staircases.
After major retailers began moving to malls, and downtowns all over began to struggle in the late 1970s, Freese's became one more victim of that trend, closing in 1985. After sitting vacant for more than a decade, a transformation began: The Maine Discovery Museum, which opened in 2001, now fills some of the lower levels, while 39 apartments, including the Freese's Assisted Living units, occupy the top floors. An eatery -- The Fork and Spoon, serving smoothies, salads and more -- now occupies space in the building. A bakery, Cake Concoctions, opened recently as well.
Some of those residents admit that it's a bit odd to live in a place in which they spent so much time shopping years ago.
"I have special feelings for this building," said 92-year-old Priscilla Hunter, another fifth-floor resident. "It's a nice place to live."
Hunter grew up in Bradford but went to Bangor schools. She said that after she returned from Washington, D.C., where she worked as a teletype operator during World War II, her children looked forward to yearly trips to see Santa.
"This was the place to go, to take children, once a year," Hunter said.
Santa was here, and that was a big draw. So, too, were the peanuts and popcorn.
"But the escalator, that would attract kids, too," she said.
Hunter said that Freese's was the top store in the area, and said the staff at Freese's Assisted Living are top-notch, too.
A visit to her apartment turns into an impromptu tour of the facility, and Hunter proudly points out the impressive features of her home: the handsome atrium space, where many of the community events take place; the well-appointed dining room; the piano; a holiday tree in the atrium that stays in place year-round, its decorations changing for each special occasion.
And while she, too, lives in the former toy department, she says she'd have no list to hand to Santa, should she see him walking the halls in front of his former chair.
"I tell people, 'I don't need anything,'" she said. "Everything I've got is old, but I like it."
Gladys Neptune, 76, another resident of the former toy department, grew up in Old Town and said the scene at Freese's was always festive for shoppers.
"You'd walk outside in the wintertime, around Christmastime, and it was all lit up," Neptune said. "You'd hear the Christmas music playing. It was real pretty."
Neptune worked at Freese's for a time, as did her husband.
"I worked downstairs where they used to come in with their luggage and bags and stuff," she explained. "I'd put them in storage until they came back out [after shopping]."
Allan Neptune sold toasters and other appliances, she said.
Gladys Neptune admits she really didn't want to move into Freese's seven years ago, but has enjoyed her time here.
"I just didn't want to move into town," she said. "I'm used to living in the country. But I've gotten used to it. It's a nice place."
So nice, in fact, that 75-year-old Irving Cunningham has lived here for 11 years. Cunningham spent a short stint working at Freese's back in the 1950s while he was waiting for another job to open up, and said the store was always bustling. At Christmas, it became downright hectic.
"[At this time of year] it would have been wild," he said. "There would have been so many people in here shopping, you couldn't turn around."
Cunningham now lives on the sixth floor: a storage floor, he says, when Freese's was open.
"I've contributed to [the things that are stored]," he said with a laugh, gesturing to a couch full of dozens of stuffed animals.
Cunningham was a frequent shopper at Freese's, and looked forward to spending time in the store on Fridays and Saturdays, when he could earn double Gold Bond Trading Stamps. Cash in a book of stamps, and you got $4.50, he said, which you could redeem toward the purchase of anything in the store.
Though he happily calls the former store home now, he still mourns its demise.
"It was known as the Fifth Avenue of [Maine]," Cunningham said. "That's what they lost [when the store closed]. They lost the primary shopping place. This is where everybody went."
But in the loss, there was also, eventually, a gain.
Residents like Waneta Booker can tell you all about that.
Freese's was a grand store, she'll say. No doubt about that.
Now, it's something even more important.
"It feels like home," Booker said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage won't face a criminal investigation for threatening to withhold funding from a nonprofit that hired House Speaker Mark Eves, said Attorney General Janet Mills and another Democratic prosecutor in a Tuesday letter.
But that decision won't ease partisan tension over the issue: Eves, a Democrat from North Berwick, is suing the Republican governor over losing his job offer in June to lead Good Will-Hinckley and a trio of legislators is still expected to advance a longshot bid to impeach LePage during the January session.
The letter from Mills and Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney does take air out of the impeachment effort and bolster Republican claims that further investigation of LePage would be little more than partisan politics.
Reps. Jeffrey Evangelos, I-Friendship, Ben Chipman, D-Portland, and Charlotte Warren, D-Hallowell, who are pursuing the impeachment effort, requested an investigation of LePage, alleging "abuse of power," on Dec. 4, but it was rejected by Mills and Maloney on Tuesday.
They said while that term isn't addressed in Maine statutes, Mills' office reviewed the law and facts of the case, concluding "that there is not a basis at this time for us to pursue a criminal investigation."
Eves hasn't backed impeachment and his attorney, David Webbert, called Mills' letter "no surprise." LePage's office hasn't commented.
But in an interview, Evangelos criticized Mills, saying there's a "lack of courage in Augusta to confront the realities of what we're dealing with."
"We obviously disagree with her decision," he said. "It doesn't change our plans for impeachment. In fact, it makes impeachment more certain."
The controversy has enveloped the State House since June, but the basic facts of the case aren't in dispute: After learning that Eves was hired as Good Will-Hinckley's president in June, the LePage administration made clear that $530,000 in discretionary funding for the organization's charter school would be pulled, according to an investigation by the Legislature's watchdog arm.
That move led to concern about the nonprofit's solvency and one of its private funders, the Harold Alfond Foundation, reconsidered millions of dollars in grant funding. It was enough for Good Will-Hinckley to rescind its offer to Eves, who has blamed the governor for his firing.
LePage hasn't really denied that, criticizing Eves' past votes against charter schools and labeling his initial employment offer "a back-room deal between cronies" in a June news release.
The Legislature's watchdog panel ended its probe of LePage's actions earlier this month, but the impeachment effort looms and the court fight between Eves and LePage will likely stretch into 2017. On Friday, Eves added another charge to his civil lawsuit, accusing the governor of violating a state law prohibiting intentional interference with a contract.
Webbert called that lawsuit Eves' focus in a statement, saying it's "the most effective way" to hold LePage "personally accountable for his reckless abuse of power and to set a legal precedent to protect Maine's people from future such abuses by a governor."

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage on Tuesday nominated three lawyers, including his chief counsel, to the District Court bench.
Cynthia Montgomery of Palermo, who serves as chief counsel to the governor, Charles F. Budd Jr. of Bangor and Thomas Nale Sr. of Waterville were announced as nominees in a press release.
Montgomery became LePage's top legal adviser in February, after the governor appointed her predecessor, Carlisle McLean, to serve on the Maine Public Utilities Commission.
LePage appointed his first counsel, Daniel Billings, to the District Court bench in August 2012. Billings was elevated to the Superior Court about 18 months later.
Govs. Angus King and John Baldacci also nominated their counsels to the state court, according to previously published reports.
A native of Texas, Montgomery is a graduate of Georgia State University, where she also received her law degree in 1994, the release said. She served as a union representative and in-house counsel for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 623, from 1989 to 1995. In her private practice, she litigated discrimination actions against several urban governments and multiple national and international companies.
After relocating to Maine in 2002, she worked for the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. In 2003, she accepted a position in the Bureau of Employee Relations as a labor relations specialist, then counsel in 2006 and was promoted to the position of chief counsel in 2011 for the bureau, according to the governor's press release. She went to work in the governor's office in February.
Montgomery lives in Palermo.
Budd is a partner at Rudman Winchell who focuses his practice on criminal law, divorce and child custody, family law and personal injury law. Prior to law school, Budd worked for a member of Congress in Washington, D.C. and later for Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. Prior to joining Rudman Winchell, he worked for the Boston law firm of Hill & Barlow.
He was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the release said. A graduate of Dartmouth College and Boston College, he graduated cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center, where he served as an editor of the Tax Lawyer, an American Bar Association publication.
Nale, of Nale & Nale Law Offices, has been practicing law since he was admitted to the Maine Bar in 1979. He is a graduate of the University of New Hampshire School of Law and Thomas College. Nale specializes in divorce, family matters and litigation. With over 35 years of litigation experience, he has tried cases before the Maine District Court, Maine Superior Court, Maine Supreme Court and the United States District Court for the District of Maine.
He served as the mayor of Waterville from 1986 to 1987, the release said. Nale is a former president and treasurer of the Waterville Bar Association and is a lifelong resident of the Waterville area.

Down East wood chip export plan garners support

Texto completo:   EASTPORT, Maine -- A proposal to export low-grade wood chips to Europe received support from representatives of logging companies, pulp mills and sawmills at a meeting Tuesday.
Phyto-Charter Inc. has developed a patented system for treating wood to rid it of pathogens and pests so it can be exported and meet the standards of the European Union, according to Stephean Chute, managing director of the firm. The United States has not exported wood to Europe since 2000, when the current regulations were enacted.
Countries in the European Union have developed what Chute called an "aggressive" strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and have 20 percent of their energy needs met by renewable sources by 2020. Phyto-Charter is "part of the solution" in Europe, he said.
Chute said the opportunity to export low-grade fiber -- wood logs and chips for which there is no U.S. market -- will create a new market and benefit everyone in the industry here.
Chris Gardner, executive director of the Eastport Port Authority, expressed his support.
"It's a brand new market that has not existed," he said.
The port of Eastport was chosen because of its depth -- the water is 64 feet deep at low tide -- and its location. Shipments from Easport can reach Europe as much as two days sooner than shipments from other ports. The port also is located close to wood fiber in Maine, said Chute's partner, Larry Carrier of E.J. Carrier Inc. logging of Jackman.
Carrier, Chute and Gardner called the meeting to bring together top officials in the wood industry and educate them about Phyto-Charter's plans.
Comments made about the proposal were favorable.
"Any market will be greatly appreciated," said Jerry Poullin of Wagner Forest Management, one of about 50 people to attend the meeting.
"We need low-grade markets, we are struggling statewide," said Dana Doran of Professional Logging Contractors of Maine.
"All of the mills shutting down recently has had a traumatic impact," said Jeff Lewis of Dean Young Forestry. "Having an opportunity like this could breathe some life back into the industry."
But when several meeting participants pressed for a timetable or even a "best guess" about when they could expect the first load to ship, Phyto-Charter officials declined to be specific.
"Rest assured, it's coming soon," said Carrier. "I'll just leave it at that."
The Eastport Port Authority began working with Phyto-Charter in 2009, said Gardner. It took the port four years to install the approximately $10 million conveyor and ship loading systems that will move wood chips from the trucks down to the pier and onto the ships.
Gardner said complicated plans such as these take time.
"If it was that simple, somebody else would have [already] done it," he said.
Gardner had said previously that he believes the project will be launched in 2016.
He told those attending Tuesday's gathering that the fact Phyto-Charter called the meeting was an indication of how close they are to getting the project off the ground.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Regulators on Tuesday directed Maine's two major utilities to work out 20-year contracts to purchase power from four "community-based" renewable energy projects located throughout the state as part of a pilot program approved by the Legislature in 2009.
The long-term deals include a 9.9-megawatt solar project in the Waldo County town of Monroe, which would be the state's largest solar project to date, by far, if built.
The order from the Maine Public Utilities Commission directs Central Maine Power Co. to negotiate contracts with Clear Energy LLC and Cianbro Development Corp. for the Monroe solar farm, at a rate of 8.45 cents per kilowatt-hour.
It also directs CMP to negotiate with Georges River Energy LLC for a 7.5-megawatt biomass plant on the grounds of the Robbins Lumber mill in Searsmont and a dual project by Mayo Mill LLC for a 310-kilowatt hydroelectric plant and 85-kilowatt solar array in Dover-Foxcroft, at 9.9 cents per kilowatt-hour and 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, respectively.
The commission directed Emera Maine to enter a contract with Shamrock Partners LLC for power from a 1-megawatt wind installation in Limestone, at 8.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
Shamrock Partners, led by Freeport resident Sue Jones, had proposed a community wind project in Fort Fairfield that had won a long-term contract under an earlier request for proposals from the PUC. But that plan was essentially killed, she said this fall, by an ordinance establishing for wind projects a one-mile setback from landowners not involved in the project.
The PUC in September announced it would approve contracts with projects that, together, promise as much as 21 megawatts of generation capacity. The commission voted unanimously Tuesday to approve long-term deals for the four selected projects, out of a field of projects offering up about 80 megawatts of capacity.
It had previously approved similar contracts for Jonesport Wind, Lubec Wind and Pisgah Mountain LLC, in Clifton.
The commission's three members in their meeting Tuesday said they approved the contracts for the pilot program because they represented various energy sources and locations around the state, despite offering a price that's above the standard offer rate for electricity.
Under an amendment this year, the state law creating the community-based renewables pilot program allowed projects to qualify if they offered prices of 10 cents per kilowatt-hour or less within each contract year. They are also required to be owned by residents or entities based in Maine, including on tribal land.
The commission's written order issued Tuesday afternoon was the first disclosure of the corporations behind each renewable project and did not include more detailed information about the exact project locations or timelines.
The PUC through its request for proposals sought projects that could be completed within three years. Regulators said they would issue a later order providing more detail on their reasoning for selecting each project.
The Monroe solar array would be larger than the 1.2-megawatt solar farm at Bowdoin College and larger still than other solar projects proposed around the state, including developer Kim Kenway's proposal in April for a 2.8-megawatt solar farm in Gouldsboro and, according to the Portland Press Herald, proposals for 10- to 20-megawatt solar arrays in Winslow and Sanford by the Yarmouth-based company Ranger Solar.
The Monroe project is a partnership between Cianbro and Clear Energy, owned by Evan Coleman. Coleman was also involved through Clear Energy in Energy Management Inc.'s bid for a natural gas power plant in Rockland.
The decision Tuesday is the PUC's latest move toward grid-scale solar power. Regulators previously approved a term sheet with Dirigo Solar to develop contracts with utilities for up to 75 megawatts of solar capacity at locations around the state.
The PUC's approval calls for the term sheet to expire in one year. The term sheet approved offers with starting prices of about 3.5 cents per megawatt hour, with annual 2.5 percent increases, for a 20-year term, with various options for how much of the total 75 megawatts would be developed.

Pineland Farms at hub of value-added food movement in Maine

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/pineland-farms-at-hub-value-added-food-movement/docview/1751243738/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: With an eye toward "value added," Denekas said Pineland Farms decided to avoid the bagged whole potato markets and instead develop prepackaged diced and mashed potatoes at its processing facility in Mars Hill. The packaged potatoes are sold to Applebee's, Walt Disney World, Cracker Barrel, Bob Evans, Golden Corral and Hannaford grocery stores, according to Denekas.

Texto completo:   FORT KENT -- For almost a century, the cluster of brick buildings in New Gloucester housed the state's institution for developmentally disabled people -- originally called the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded -- before it fell on hard times in the 1970s and finally shut its doors in 1996.
Today, the buildings, grounds and gardens are home to Pineland Farms and are at the center of the state's locally produced and value-added food movement with operations stretching from southern Maine to the St. John Valley.
"When it was a mental hospital, it had two large farms on either side of it," Craig Denekas, president of the Libra Foundation, said.
In 2000, Libra -- the private philanthropic foundation created by the late Elizabeth Noyce in 1989 -- purchased the original 1,600-acre property from the state to build what is now a 5,000-acre working farm, diverse business campus and educational and recreational venue.
"Libra was really sort of the originator of Pineland," Denekas said. "When we acquired the buildings, we also got those two farms -- Hill Farm and Valley Farm."
Back when it was a state hospital, some residents tended to the animals to produce eggs, milk and cheese and grew vegetables, Denekas said.
"We got it in 2000 and then commenced a very large-scale rehabilitation project," he said. "We renovated every building top to bottom with the idea the farms themselves could be home for a Maine product base with cheese, potatoes and beef."
The thinking at the time, according to Denekas, was that Maine could benefit by combining its high-quality food with a branded image, much like what has already been done in the state with Stonewall Kitchen or in Vermont with Ben & Jerry's.
"We know we can grow a quality potato in Aroostook County as well as Idaho, if not better," he said. "But Idaho has really succeeded in marketing their brands."
With an eye toward "value added," Denekas said Pineland Farms decided to avoid the bagged whole potato markets and instead develop prepackaged diced and mashed potatoes at its processing facility in Mars Hill.
"We'll run between 60 million and 70 million pounds of potatoes through that plant this year," he said. "That plant supports 180 well-paying jobs with good benefits."
The packaged potatoes are sold to Applebee's, Walt Disney World, Cracker Barrel, Bob Evans, Golden Corral and Hannaford grocery stores, according to Denekas.
"Sales are so good, we are having a hard time keeping up," he said. "We doubled the capacity of the plant, and we may have to double it again."
Pineland owns about 900 acres in St. Agatha currently in potato production, Denekas said, adding that the bulk of the spuds used in Mars Hill are purchased from farmers around central Aroostook County.
"It's hard to say the total land base involved," he said. "But I would guess we buy nearly 10 percent of the potato crop in Aroostook County."
Nothing pairs with a good, Maine potato like a nice steak or roast, so in 1995, Pineland Beef was born.
"We started it as an alternative for our dairy farmers," Denekas said. "We wanted to provide an outlet for farmers that have the farms, fields and barns for cattle [because] in Maine we have some of the best grass in the country for grazing despite our short growing season."
Today, Pineland Beef purchases 30,000 head of cattle raised specifically for the company by farmers from around the state and other parts of New England.
"The niche we wanted was antibiotic-free and hormone-free cattle," Denekas said. "People are more concerned about where their food comes from."
Many of the purchased cattle end up traveling to Fort Fairfield where they are "finished" on a diet of Aroostook County barley and oats before being shipped to Pennsylvania for slaughter and processing.
"You will see our beef in restaurants in Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Los Angeles," he said.
On the retail consumer side of things, Denekas said one of Pineland's largest beef customers is Whole Foods, which carries the products in its stores from Maine to Virginia and west to Ohio.
Every bit of the cow is used either for human grade food, pet food or leather, Denaksis said.
Then there is Pineland Cheese, produced in a 13,000 square-foot creamery on the Pineland Farms New Gloucester campus.
Cheddar, feta, jack and baby Swiss cheeses are shipped out daily nationwide, Denekas said.
"We are making 800,000 pounds of cheese a year," he said.
To make all that cheese, Pineland purchases 8 million pounds of milk annually from Maine dairy farmers.
"It is Maine cheese made from Maine milk from Maine cows," Denekas said.
Eventually, beef, potatoes and cheese may come together in products such as prepared frozen shepherd's pie, he said.
"We are always looking at value-added products," Denekas said. "We look for new ways to present new versions of our existing products."
The potential is huge, said Bill Haggett, CEO at Pineland Farms Potato Company and Pineland Farms Natural Meats.
"I've grown up in Maine and have been aware of the importance of potatoes grown in Aroostook County to the economy of the state," he said. "When I got involved [with Pineland], I realized it was a tremendous opportunity to add value to a crop that is tied closely to the state of Maine [and] adding value to what's grown in Aroostook County just seems to make a lot of sense."
In addition to the beef on the hoof, Haggett said, Pineland also ships out cow manure from the Fort Fairfield cows to be used for compost and buys locally raised barley and oats to feed the cows.
"You really get an economic multiplier effect from having all that cattle in northern Maine," he said. "There is a lot of spinoff."
Denekas said Pineland directly employs close to 330 people among the potato, beef and cheese operations but also counts the close to 1,000 employees working at the 45 tenants from dentists to accountants housed on the New Gloucester campus when talking about economic impacts.
Much of what Pineland does, he said, is thanks to investments made by Libra, though the foundation has not done any in-depth, specific analysis of the economic impacts of those investments.
"One thing we do know for sure are those employment numbers," Denekas said. "But as for other numbers, we have never studied the economic dollars and cents impacts."
However, he did say Libra has made $100 million in investments into Pineland and its related projects over the last 15 years.
"That is pretty significant," he said.
"We try to figure out the right way to invest our assets in areas we are interested in," Denekas said. "It happens we are interested in the state of Maine and local food companies."
While the Pineland Farm in New Gloucester operates as a nonprofit, Denekas stresses that the food operations are for-profit businesses.
In addition, he said Pineland voluntarily pays property taxes on its tax exempt, nonprofit real estate.
"We felt it is appropriate to do that," Denekas said. "We make a point to pay our fair share."
Also living on the New Gloucester farms are 160 Holstein dairy cows, 400 egg-laying chickens and two dozen horses that are part of Pineland's equestrian program where future Olympic hopefuls train.
"The Libra Foundation got this idea to purchase this campus and turn it into a business park, and then they got the idea for sustainable agriculture here in Maine," Brian Mailhot, Pineland's director of marketing, said. "We see a lot of people come through our doors who learn about Maine food and how it is raised and grown."
The farm is open year-round for guided and individual tours, he said. While there, visitors can nosh on breads, pastries, ice cream and cheeses made onsite using local ingredients from the farm.
Pineland also maintains miles of trails for running, hiking, snowshoeing and skiing and sponsors programs for military veterans' adaptive sports.
"It's really pretty cool down here," Mailhot said. "There is always so much going on."

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage on Tuesday nominated three people to Cabinet-level posts within his administration.
LePage nominated Brig. Gen. Gerard F. Bolduc to be the Maine National Guard's adjutant general; William Beardsley to be the Maine commissioner of education; and Paul Mercer to be the state's commissioner of environmental protection.
Bolduc, who serves as the current acting adjutant general, has been in his post since March, when LePage fired Brig. Gen. James Campbell as adjutant general of the Maine National Guard. Prior to his current position, Bolduc was commander of the Maine Air National Guard and assistant adjutant general.
Bolduc joined the Air Force in 1982 and was commissioned through the Academy of Military Science in Tennessee. He was assigned to the Bangor Air National Guard Base after he completed aviator training.
Education commissioner
Beardsley, the former president and CEO of Husson University in Bangor and former Maine commissioner of conservation, has been acting education commissioner since October of this year, when LePage chose him to be acting commissioner.
Beardsley, who ran unsuccessfully against LePage in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary, has served on numerous boards, including the Maine Development Foundation, Finance Authority of Maine, Maine Higher Education Council, the Maine Independent College Association, the Maine State Board of Education and the Maine STEM Council.
Beardsley holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Earlham College in Indiana and a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University. He took the helm of the Department of Education in October, replacing interim Commissioner Tom Desjardin. Beardsley's nomination is subject to vetting by the Maine Board of Education and the Legislature's Education Committee, followed by confirmation by the Maine Senate.
Environmental protection commissioner
To lead the Department of Environmental Protection, LePage has nominated Paul Mercer, who has been an associate professor, among other posts, at Maine Maritime Academy since 2006. Those posts have included engineering department chairman, member of the senior leadership team and assistant to the president for sustainability. He also has extensive background in environmental issues including renewable energy development, solid fuels, biomass energy systems and emissions reductions, according to a press release.
Mercer, who holds a bachelor's degree in marine engineering from Maine Maritime Academy, was president of Northeast Engineering in Bucksport from 1983 until 2008 and was president of Bay Engineering from 1978 until 1982.
Mercer's nomination requires vetting by the Legislature's Environment and Natural Resources Committee and confirmation by the Senate. If successful, Mercer would take over for Acting Commissioner Avery Day, who has been in that role since August of this year.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- Prep cook Cameron Arsenault leans over his workspace, focused on the soft dough rolled into a long tube on the table before him. He cuts flour-and-potato mixture into small, uniform pieces, one at a time, until a pile of freshly made gnocchi sits beside him, ready to drop into a pot of boiling water when needed.
Much like the gnocchi, the pasta at Timber Kitchen and Bar, one of Bangor's newest restaurants and operated by Ocean Properties Ltd., is homemade. From spaghetti to ravioli, the restaurant's employees painstakingly craft each dish.
But the pasta isn't the only item on Timber's menu made by hand. Mini Wild Maine Blueberry Pie, Rustic Apple Farm Tarts and the crisp cookie spoons that decorate the Farm House Chocolate Pots de Creme are all made from scratch by pastry chef Molly Harding, who originally is from Trenton.
The menu, which was created by regional executive chef Ryan Phillips of Bar Harbor, features dishes that display a dedication to eating local, from the dried strawberry chips in their Maple Brook Farms Hand-Pulled Burrata to the Maine Lobster Bisque and the locally farmed beans in the Backyard Garden Burger.
Dishes such as these are prepared by Timber's kitchen staff and finished off by executive chef Mattaeus Schkrioba, 29, who grew up in Windham. About a dozen other employees fly in and out of the doors leading to the food pickup station, the sounds of contented restaurant-goers' laughter and conversation filtering in with each swing of the doors.
Schkrioba graduated from the culinary arts program at Southern Maine Community College. Growing up in the food service industry -- his grandparents owned a restaurant they opened in the '70s called Red Sands in Windham -- he remembers washing dishes and the early morning wake-ups for his family members, who hustled off to bake bread.
"I never even thought of being a chef, but once you hit the real world, it's like, 'OK, well, that's an opportunity,'" Schkrioba said.
He has worked at the Portland Marriott at Sable Oaks in South Portland and The Sagamore Resort in Bolton Landing, New York, both of which were developed by Ocean Properties.
Ocean Properties was started in the 1950s by Thomas T. Walsh as a small Maine family business. His first hotel was The Plaza Hotel in Brewer, and the company grew from there. Ocean Properties is now one of the largest privately held hotel operating and development groups in North America and operates over 100 hotels. Timber Kitchen and Bar, one of its newest undertakings, was an important one for its owners, according to Fletcher.
"Because they're from the Bangor area, they wanted to do something special," Fletcher said.
Outside the busy kitchen, patrons enjoy their meals in the lavishly designed space. In the dining area, a white marble-topped bar spans the length of the room with a wood stone oven blazing behind it, firing handmade pizzas. Metal lights hanging from the ceiling create a warm glow as the illumination combines with the wood climbing the walls. Hostesses at the entryway stand behind the roots of a massive yew tree from County Laois, Ireland, complete with a top that transforms it into a functional centerpiece to greet patrons.
Line cook Jordan Vandiver, a 23-year-old from Florida, works behind the chef's bar, providing food preparation and entertainment for patrons. From pizza making to firing desserts, he creates delicious food and an experience. On a recent evening, he slid a small, square chocolate cake into the oven, preparing the plate while it cooked, spreading a homemade sour cherry syrup as the bed for it to rest on.
"We have this mirror up here so everyone in that window can see what happens," Vandiver said, pointing above him first and then to the window behind him, where patrons were seated and watched him intently.
He pulled the cake out of the oven, placed it on the plate and finished off the dish with chocolate twigs and a scoop of gelato.
The restaurant was carefully constructed and designed. Although most of the wood comes from Ireland, the feel of the space is rooted in Maine's lumber mill history. Intended as a tribute to the work that built Bangor, once the lumber capital of the world, it hearkens back to the days when the forest industry reigned as king of the area's economy. According to general manager Suzanne Fletcher, it has been met with nothing but admiration since the restaurant opened its doors on Oct. 12 of this year.
A line of wait staff emerge from the kitchen, dishes balanced carefully on their palms. They circle a table of 10 and set the plates down in front of patrons simultaneously, their efforts met with murmurs of approval and sparkling eyes ready to tuck into a feast prepared by Schkrioba and his staff.
On an average Friday or Saturday, Schkrioba and his crew turn out meals for as many as 450 people between 11 a.m. and 10 p.m. in the 150-seat restaurant, which is housed in the five-story Residence Inn by Marriott on Bass Park Boulevard in Bangor.
For Fletcher, who has a long history in the food service industry, Timber's staff is what makes it successful. Timber employs about 60 people, including several pulled from the Ocean Properties developments in Bar Harbor, where they worked during the summer.
Many patrons enjoy the professional and welcoming staff in addition to the food and atmosphere, including Paul and Cheryl Morrow, who have established themselves as regulars. The couple visits the restaurant about once per week.
"We've always been received very warmly, and from the get-go we've been treated like family. It's nice to go some place where they remember your name and that you matter. It's like going to a best friend's house to have dinner," Cheryl Morrow said. Her favorite dish is the Maine Lobster Bisque -- "it's a must," she said -- while Paul Morrow's is the Crab Crusted Haddock. For dessert, the two usually share the Ice Box Tasting, which offers three flavors of gelato.
As for the future of Timber Kitchen and Bar, plans are in motion to bring patrons the opportunity to enjoy more unique specialities, including the Glacier Ice Bar and Lounge, which is set to offer handcrafted cocktails at the restaurant on Jan. 29 and 30 and Feb. 5 and 6. The Morrows plan to check that out once it comes as well.
Also in the works is something they've dubbed "Sunday Supper," which intends to re-create an old tradition of the classic meal Sunday evenings that brought family around the table. Though details are still being hammered out, the concept plans even mention of the ringing of a bell, a throwback to times when parents would ring for their kids to come in to eat.
Overall, the restaurant tries to create a casual dining experience, which is reflected in a comfortable and inviting atmosphere for others to relax in and enjoy.
"We don't consider ourselves fine dining, but we do like to provide that level of service," Fletcher said.
Back in the kitchen, Arsenault's workspace had been cleared of the gnocchi he had been working on for the past few hours. He then disappeared into another part of the space, moving on to his next task in the busy restaurant kitchen.

Maine grown potato chips as 'simple as it gets'

Texto completo:   FREEPORT, Maine -- A hot mound of golden brown potato chips rests seductively on a baking sheet. With a deft flick of the wrist Scott Brodeur sprinkles on maple sugar. A hissing sound fills the air.
Is this a snack addict's hallucination? Not at all. It's just another day of production at Vintage Maine Kitchen, a small-batch potato chip company that turns Maine potatoes, Maine sea salt and Maine maple syrup into farm-to-pouch gold.
"We wanted food coming from a single source," co-owner Brodeur, a burly man in a Red Sox cap, said. "We produce chips the old-fashioned way."
Inside a nondescript storefront on Route 1, Brodeur grabs fistfulls of sliced potatoes grown nearby and drops them into a bubbling vat of sunflower oil. He separates the floating spuds with tongs. Moments later they transform into chips.
"Some of the potatoes we get from Bell Farms really taste like butter," his wife and business partner, Kelly Brodeur, said. "So we try to keep that flavor in the chip."
Generations of Mainers grew up on Humpty Dumpty Potato Chips, founded in South Portland in the '40s. For this couple, who moved here from Massachusetts in 2007, it was Royal Feast, a now-defunct Methuen chip maker that was an early favorite.
Once settled in Freeport and after giving birth to their daughter Merrill, "we wanted to bring back the tradition of a family chipper," Kelly Brodeur said.
Vintage Maine Kitchen is the latest small food company to find success by doing it their way. Self-taught, self-motivated and self-fulfilled, these startups are popping up all across Maine.
With a degree from Johnson and Wales University, Kelly Brodeur worked in a string of restaurants from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Galway, Ireland. She has always loved potatoes. Her husband, who has cooked in his share of hotels and bars, does too. Before launching Vintage Maine Kitchen last summer, Kelly Brodeur tried different cooking methods with a Dutch oven at home.
"It came down to using the right potato," she said, standing over sacks of spuds grown in Lewiston, Auburn and neighboring Durham. Turns out Bell Farms' Norwis and Keuka Gold are the winners.
So far the company has two flavors: original and the sweet and savory Maine maple. "Mainers love maple," Scott Brodeur, who has yet to see another maple chip made here, said.
Unlike Cape Cod Potato Chips' thick kettle-style, Vintage Maine Kitchen chips are thin and crisp. Starting with a local potato, few ingredients follow: sunflower oil and salt, or maple sugar for Maine maple. "Our chips are as healthy as you can get. It's not processed food," she said. "It's as simple as it gets."
How did the couple know reclaiming the potato chip would work?
"From the look on the faces of customers after they try it," Scott Brodeur, who worked for years at L.L. Bean in distribution and manufacturing, said.
So far the chips are sold in Freeport shops and specialty food stores, including Lois' Natural Marketplace in Portland and Scarborough. They can be found a far north as Center Coffee House in Dover-Foxcroft and as far south as The Noshery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. They also ship all over the U.S.
"Business is doubling every month, and we can make about 120 cases a week with our current staffing," Kelly Brodeur said. "We plan to double that again soon."
They are sold in single-serving bags because they are "so addictive," Scott Brodeur said, one of three people who bag each batch by hand.
For now, the couple is ramping up for the summer tourist season.
"We want these chips served by the side of every lobster roll," Kelly Brodeur said. "It's the perfect combination."

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Utilities regulators Tuesday voted to continue investigating a request from Maine Natural Gas Corp. to raise rates in Augusta and Brunswick to support costs of its gas pipeline expansion into the Kennebec Valley.
The three-member Maine Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to reject a settlement that called for gas supply surcharges on new customers in Augusta and delivery rate increases for customers in Augusta and Brunswick.
The decision to reject that settlement leaves open a dispute about how much of the $40.2 million expansion project the company would be allowed to recover through its rates.
The commission's staff had recommended excluding $19.9 million from the amount the company could recover, saying in an early report that Maine Natural Gas could not prove those costs were unavoidable.
The settlement called for the company to exclude $6 million in project costs, with the possibility of excluding another $7.8 million in rates if it met certain targets. It also agreed to phase in $10 million of the expansion costs into rates over three years.
The recovery method included a gas supply surcharge on new customers in Augusta, whose service is more likely dependent on the expansion, and a 17 percent increase in delivery rates across all of its service area for three years. Those rates would have declined starting in 2019.
The city of Augusta and Maine public advocate's office signed on to the settlement, but a group of Brunswick intervenors -- including Bowdoin College, the town and the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority -- argued the delivery rate increases were unfair, placing cost burdens on customers who did not stand to benefit from the expansion.
The public advocate's office argued the settlement struck a balance between protecting ratepayers and allowing the company to recover appropriate costs "by allowing the recovery of investments that are found to be used and useful, while holding MNG responsible for its poor planning and management."
The office also raised concern that treating Augusta and non-Augusta customers differently would result in even steeper rate increases for Augusta customers.
Commissioners voted Tuesday to state that the parties did not prove the settlement was in the public interest, which is one of four required conditions for resolving such disputes through a settlement.
Mark Vannoy, the commission's chairman, said during deliberations Tuesday that approval of the settlement would appear to contradict 16 years of case history ruling against having a utility's customers in one area bear costs for improvements that help it compete in another area.
"This allows the company to entrepreneurially expand and enter special contracts at shareholder risk and management's discretion. When that doesn't work, who bears that burden?" Vannoy said.
In response to a PUC staff report recommending denial of the settlement, the public advocate's office argued that such "cross subsidies" from one area to another have only been denied when they affect competition.
"There is no evidence that allocating costs across MNG's customers by maintaining a single revenue requirement would 'unbalance' the competitive market for natural gas in the Kennebec River Valley by giving MNG a competitive advantage," members of the OPA's office wrote. "Indeed, the effect of the Stipulation will be to increase the delivery rates for MNG gas in Augusta, making MNG's rates less competitive."
The utility has competed against Summit Natural Gas of Maine for customers in the Kennebec Valley, where both have completed major pipeline expansions.
Hearings in the MNG rate case had been postponed to hash out the settlement rejected Tuesday. The PUC will continue hearings in the case to establish what of Maine Natural Gas' expansion costs it may recover through rates and how it would recover those costs.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- Bangor High School teacher Catherine Gordon spent late Tuesday afternoon in her classroom putting back up the pink Christmas tree decorated with Hello Kitty ornaments she had been told to take down Friday afternoon.
Gordon, who has taught math at the school for 30 years, said Principal Paul Butler told her he had reversed his decision as the final bell rang Tuesday.
"He told me he could have handled things a bit differently and I told him I could have handled things a bit differently, but I think this opened up a dialogue with everyone," Gordon said in a telephone interview.
The tree will be up one day. The district's winter break runs Thursday through Monday, Jan. 3.
Butler reversed his decision after Gordon created a social and news media storm when on Friday she posted a statement on her Facebook page saying she had been told to remove the tree. She spent Monday and Tuesday fielding phone calls from and being interviewed by local and national news outlets about what some viewed as a cultural clash over recognizing a religious holiday in a public school.
"It's been a whirlwind," she said Tuesday.
Gordon said in her Facebook post and told reporters that having to take down the tree made her sad, especially since she had put up similar decorations in her classroom annually for most of her career without complaint.
"All day today my students gave me small gifts -- candy, chocolate, a Hello Kitty coloring book and even a sweatshirt with a Christmas tree on it," she said Tuesday. "I really appreciate their support and the messages I've gotten from parents and strangers."
Butler and Bangor Superintendent of Schools Betsy Webb both issued written statements Tuesday afternoon about the issue of holiday decorations in public schools.
"On Friday of last week, a concern was shared with me regarding an inconsistency with our balanced approach to holiday observances, which I communicate annually," Butler wrote. "I contacted the teacher, shared and then clarified the concern about a classroom Christmas tree, and offered an opportunity to meet and discuss the situation in person.
"While this conversation ultimately did not take place," he said, "I did review various reasoned perspectives on the topic that have satisfied an important professional responsibility: to ensure that the sharing of any one tradition ultimately highlights the universal nature of holiday celebration.
"The Christmas tree that has been the focus of this discussion does so, and is therefore appropriate for the school setting," Butler said. "Moving forward, I continue to believe that it is not only important but also possible to broadly discuss and observe traditions with the mindset that inclusive, planful consideration of many does not weaken any single one -- a critical element of a balanced approach."
Webb in her statement that said she wanted to clarify the department's expectations regarding the education of culture, traditions and holidays.
"It is appropriate to educate students about traditions and cultures during the holiday season and throughout the school year," she said. "In public schools, it is permissible to teach students about religion. Yet, it is not permissible to observe religious holidays or practice religion in public schools. Religious music, literature, decorations and art are permissible to advance students' knowledge of society's cultural heritage. However, these lessons should not dominate school activities.
"Schools may be decorated to recognize holiday seasons, but schools must not send a message that a certain religion is endorsed or favored," she said. "Appropriate secular seasonal attire and/or decorations, including trees, have not been banned. A balanced approach is expected."
Webb said the district does not have a specific policy on classroom decorations or holidays.
"The Bangor School Department uses guidance from various sources to maintain a balanced, educational approach," she said, citing a national expert at The First Amendment Center in Washington, D.C. "Our goal is to promote understanding of traditions, holidays and cultures while adhering to the First Amendment. Educating students of the religious freedom upon which our nation was founded is critically important in preparing students to achieve college and career readiness."
In a release Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, praised Butler for reversing his decision.
"Thank you to Principal Paul Butler for doing the right thing in allowing for a Christmas Tree to be displayed in a classroom of Bangor High School," Poliquin said. "The Christmas Tree is a traditional American symbol of the holiday and it is common sense that it be welcomed and celebrated, especially in a classroom."
The controversy was a topic of discussion among students the past two days at the high school, Nick Danby, president of the senior class, said after school Tuesday.
"A lot of people are proud of Ms. Gordon for standing up for the tree," said Danby, who is the son of Bangor Daily News cartoonist George Danby. " Some students are for it, some are against it but there's been a robust discussion about it. Many students saw it not as a religious symbol, but as a long tradition in her classroom, and a lot of people are happy Mr. Butler decided it can go back up."

Texto completo:   ROCKLAND, Maine -- The Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit seized a variety of computers and cellphones last week from a Rockland home as part of an investigation into child pornography.
No one has yet been charged as a result of the search conducted Dec. 15 at a home on Acadia Drive in Rockland.
The investigation began in September when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children came upon a website where child pornography was being uploaded, according to an affidavit filed by state police in Knox County Unified Court. The center assists families with children who are missing or being sexually exploited. The group also assists law enforcement officials when they discover child pornography.
The investigation led to an Ottawa, Illinois, man's computer, which in turn led to two computer addresses in Maine -- one for an inn in Camden and another for a Rockland man's residence, according to the affidavit. The investigation further determined that the person at the Rockland residence worked at the Camden inn and that the inn provided wireless Internet access.
State police obtained a search warrant on Dec. 10 from District Court Judge Valerie Stanfill and searched the Rockland home on Dec. 15.
According to an inventory filed with the court, the list of what was taken from the home includes two laptops and numerous cellphones that can upload images.
An email message sent late Tuesday morning to the Maine Department of Public Safety requesting information about the status of the investigation was not immediately returned.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Single-family home sales in Maine jumped more than 22 percent in November compared with last year, a spike the Maine Realtors Association attributed to pent-up demand, mild weather and the promise of a December interest rate hike.
Figures from the Maine Association of Realtors showed 1,201 Maine homes changed hands in November, compared with 979 during the same month one year ago. It was the largest year-over-year increase for any month in 2015.
Marie Flaherty, the association's president, said in a news release that the November increase likely had many causes.
"The mild weather and threats of rising interest rates certainly has had some impact on buyer decisions," Flaherty said. "However, pent-up demand has had the biggest effect."
The Federal Reserve did raise its benchmark interest rate earlier this month to between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent. The change in monetary policy means the cost of borrowing for expenses like buying a home will rise.
The median price of homes in Maine also continued to increase in November, jumping about 4 percent from November 2014 and continuing a steady year-over-year rise in prices this year.
While Maine's sales volume jumped 22.7 percent in November, New England home sales were up 1.5 percent and national sales dropped by 4.6 percent. The median price in New England rose 3.2 percent, to $254,800, and rose nationally by 6.6 percent, to $221,600.

Texto completo:   LAGRANGE, Maine -- Zak Mills probably could have provided any college sports fan all he or she needed to know about the Duke University men's basketball program long before his excellent adventure with the Blue Devils this month.
Given that Zak is just a 12-year-old seventh-grader at Penquis Valley Middle School in Milo, he's more likely best versed in the team's most recent successes -- such as its run to the 2015 NCAA Division I national championship.
But while Duke was reveling in March Madness last spring, Zak was undergoing treatments after doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in the radius near his right wrist late last year.
No doubt the Blue Devils' success helped one of their biggest young supporters cope with the chemotherapy sessions that led up to surgery, but the chance for Zak -- now back at school and playing on his middle-school basketball team -- to fully savor his team's good fortunes didn't come until just this month.
For most fans who adopt Duke or another major-college power as their favorite sports team, it's a long-distance relationship founded in televised perspectives of the players and coaches.
And while there are some connections between the Duke athletic department and the state of Maine -- Blue Devils women's basketball coach Joanne Palombo-McCallie played high school basketball in Brunswick and coached at the University of Maine, while current Duke athletic director Kevin White once held the same post at UMaine -- there was little reason to believe young Zak Mills would find himself face to face with the key personalities of one of the nation's signature athletic programs.
But from Zak's medical challenges came a rare opportunity as he and his parents, Andrea and Jason Mills, traveled to the Duke campus in Durham, North Carolina, to watch the Blue Devils play the University of Buffalo -- an early Christmas present of sorts arranged by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Duke won 82-59, but that was merely one aspect of a memorable weekend that began with a limousine ride to Bangor International Airport and went on to include campus tours and a chance meeting with NBA Hall of Famer David Robinson -- whose son is a walk-on with the Duke basketball team -- even before game time.
Duke's home court at Cameron Indoor Stadium is one of the more unique venues for a major college basketball program. The venerable facility, which opened in 1940 at a construction cost of $400,000, has a capacity of 9,314 fans -- quite modest by today's major Division I standards.
Every seat was filled that night, with the Mills family situated two rows behind the scorer's table. Among those sitting nearby was former Duke All-American Nolan Smith, with whom Zak shared a brief chat.
Duke led by 10 at halftime and pulled away to victory behind Zak Mills' favorite Blue Devil, sophomore guard Greyson Allen, who scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.
"The game was great," said Jason Mills. "Great crowd, like a high school gym with everyone packed on top of each other. The atmosphere and crowd were incredible."
Zak was given an official stat sheet at intermission and with his parents was escorted to the postgame press conference by Debbie Savarino -- a Duke representative who turned out to be the daughter of legendary Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski.
That connection was good not only for a front-row seat at the press conference, but a handshake and a few words with Coach K and the opportunity to pose the first question.
Zak thought quickly in front of the gathered media from around the country and asked Krzyzewski if Allen had grabbed a career high in rebounds during the game.
Krzyzewski's response was that Zak's query was, "a great question, and why don't the rest of you ask questions like that?!"
And while Coach K wasn't immediately sure of the answer, it turned out Zak knew exactly what he was talking about and that Allen indeed had established a career high on the boards that night.
Once the press conference ended, Savarino took the Mills family into the back hallway where Zak met all the players as well as Krzyzewski again, with all of them signing a Duke basketball for him. He also had his picture taken individually with all the players as well as with Coach K, then toured the team's training room and locker room facilities to cap off a busy night.
Zak and his parents visited the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill the next day and that night went to an NHL game featuring the Carolina Hurricanes in Raleigh, where a referee came over during the contest and presented Zak a game puck.
The Mills family returned to Bangor the next day and were greeted by Make-A-Wish staff person Lisa Fox and employees from Bangor Savings Bank who helped sponsor the trip and were armed with a few more Duke-related gifts for Zak.
A limousine then took the family back home.
Zak Mills is scheduled for his next three-month checkup in January, and while the family undoubtedly would trade the visit to Duke for uninterrupted good health, they are grateful for all the community support they have received since Zak's initial diagnosis and appreciative for the chance to live out one of their son's sporting dreams.
"It was the trip of a lifetime," said Jason Mills.

Resumen: Unlike other snowshoe makers that steam their wood to make it bendable for the frames, Theriault and his father use fresh brown ash trees, cut into strips with a skill saw.

Texto completo:   When Edmond Theriault was growing up around Fort Kent in the 1920s and '30s, wooden snowshoes were a necessity in the winter.
Long, cold walks through deep snow prepared Theriault well for training as a B-17 pilot during World War II. Now 92, he had an easy time hiking long distances with heavy gear while his training companions struggled, Brian Theriault recalls his father telling him.
"What are you guys taking a break for?" Edmond Theriault would tease his fellow trainees, according to Brian.
The younger Theriault hasn't had too much time for long breaks himself in the last two years. He was busy writing a guide to making wooden, rawhide snowshoes using designs he and his father developed over the last 40 years.
"We spent so much time together, talking about snowshoes all the time," Theriault said at the Presque Isle library recently discussing his new book, "Leaving Tracks: A Maine Tradition." Co-authored with his dad, it offers guides to four styles of snowshoes -- large and small versions of the bear paw and cross country -- and pays homage to the continuing utility of snowshoes in Maine over the last century.
Theriault's dad grew up at a time when local woodworkers in many towns made snowshoes and Norway, Maine, was the "snowshoe capital of the world." But he didn't really get into the craft until the 1970s, when he and his wife had kids -- 11 of them.
"I guess my father was thinking there's just too many kids and I'm going to have to make some snowshoes," Theriault said. "We wanted snowshoes, but we couldn't afford it."
His father, a U.S. Postal Service worker, had learned the basics of snowshoe making from an older man in town, and was fairly successful early on.
"Eventually, once we all had two or three pairs and my father gave a bunch away, some people wanted to buy them. That's why we continued," Theriault said.
People used them, as they still do, for trapping, fishing, hunting, maple syrup harvesting and exploring in the snow. Back then, even with snowmobiles, "you had to stay on the trail," Theriault said. "Not so with snowshoes. You could go wherever you wanted."
As the third-oldest child, Theriault stuck with the craft of snowshoe making while learning carpentry and forestry and working in the lumber industry.
"I was interested in the process," said Theriault. He and his father made snowshoes, used them, and then tried to improve the shoes and "designed everything for a purpose."
Unlike other snowshoe makers that steam their wood to make it bendable for the frames, Theriault and his father use fresh brown ash trees, cut into strips with a skill saw. They stretch the cow rawhide in the center of the shoe, which accommodates today's heavy boots and adds a sort of levity in keeping the walker above the snow. And they rely on a three-way pattern for stringing the rawhide, forming a series of triangles that hold the rawhide in place while letting snow pass through during strides.
"It's easy walking," Theriault said of a good wooden snowshoe. The metal-frame snowshoes that predominate today leave the walker "working too hard and not staying afloat," he said.
In the Great Depression, Theriault's dad saw snowshoes for sale for $2 -- around $35 in today's dollars. Today, L.L. Bean retails a pair of handmade white ash snowshoes for $300. On Amazon, there are Canadian hand-made bear paw snowshoes selling for $205. Near the town of Moscow, the Maine Guide Snowshoe hand-makes wooden snowshoes with rope and rawhide lacing, starting at $215.
Back in 2007, Theriault was selling snowshoes for between $200 and $230, while also earning income managing rental properties and in the lumber industry.
Now, he'll sell them for as much as $400. But, as he nears retirement age, he's more interested
in helping people figure out how to make their own snowshoes -- to preserve the craft. Although he has taught apprentices and interest in crafts has surged recently among young people, Theriault fears that the small number of people who do know how to make snowshoes is gradually shrinking. (In 2005, Presque Isle farmer Frank Hemphill passed away, leaving behind his snowshoe and cedar canoe making work.)
"I've worked so hard and my father has too, and we don't want this to go away," Theriault said. "To help keep this alive is one of my goals."
Along with promoting the book and a DVD version, Theriault is planning to sell kits with the ash sticks or with them pre-bent into frames, with instructions for putting together the rest.
"A lot of people, they look at it and think it's too much and too complicated," Theriault said. "You do it process by process" -- and reap a return on the investment. "Snowshoes will last two lifetimes and more, if you take care of them," Theriault and his father wrote in their book.

Texto completo:   FREEPORT, Maine -- Nearly 150 people turned out Tuesday morning to support the Freeport flag ladies, who last week moved away from the spot where they've been holding American spirit rallies every Tuesday since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to avoid sharing the sidewalk with a woman holding signs supporting immigrants.
The self-proclaimed flag ladies, who have garnered attention across Maine and the United States, arrived at their spot on the corner of Main and School streets last week to find it occupied by Liza Moore, who held signs supporting immigration of Syrians into the United States. Moore's late husband died in the 9/11 attacks.
The flag ladies -- Elaine Greene, JoAnn Miller and Carmen Footer -- relocated across the street. It was the first time in 14 years, including in pouring rain and blizzards, that the flag ladies did not stand in their customary location, where a granite bench is erected in their honor.
Greene said Tuesday morning that she was "humbled and honored" by the strong turnout.
"My heart is so filled right now," she said.
Moore and her son, James Roux III, whose father died on a plane that terrorists crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, stood opposite the flag ladies earlier this month to offer a counterpoint to the trio's message.
Roux, against whom the flag ladies have filed a temporary protection from harassment order, had been taken into police custody Sept. 11, 2015, after he disrupted a 9/11 observance led by the three women. He has described himself as "a pacifist and a patriot" and previously said he objected to the ceremony's "program of military force" and its "exploitation of 9/11 victims, such as my father."
Moore and Roux were not present Tuesday. In their place stood a group of Freeport High School students who said they support Moore's cause. Moore, a part-time computer teacher at Mast Landing School in Freeport, could not be reached for comment.
Greene previously has said she and her cohorts support Moore's right to free expression, but Roux's combative posture during past encounters has made them fear for their safety in his presence.
Although Tuesday's rally was of a peaceful nature, there were several people in the crowd who didn't appreciate the presence of the immigration supporters.
"I'm 500 percent American. If they don't like it, they should go home," Joyce LaGasse of Durham said in reference to the Freeport High School students who gathered in support of Moore. "They're not forced to be here. Leave our flag ladies alone."
The high school students who held signs that read "Refugees Welcome" and "Acceptance" said they had taken criticism Tuesday from a few individuals and were told by members of the Patriot Riders motorcycle club to move off the corner, where they had assembled across the street from the flag ladies' location. The group of students was much younger than the rest of the crowd and vastly outnumbered.
"We're here to stand with Liza," said Ella Russell, a Freeport High School senior from Durham. "We're a minority right now. This is a corner of a street, and it doesn't belong to someone."
Russell said one of the flag ladies approached her Tuesday morning to thank her for being there and being respectful, but several others were not so polite.
"Some people have treated us almost like we're little children," Russell said. "Still, it's not nearly as scary as some of the things refugees have been through."
Maddie Squibb, another Freeport High senior, said she supports the flag ladies but said there should be room enough in Freeport for people exercising First Amendment rights to communicate more than one message.
"We should be able to stand here for what we believe in," Squibb said.
Greene said she was proud of the students.
"I told them they had as much right to be here as we did and to stand tall in what they were doing," Greene said. "I firmly believe that they took time out [to be at the rally] because they believe in something and that's what we believe in: Get involved with what you believe in."
Among the attendees at Tuesday's rally was Ann LePage, the governor's wife, who joins the flag ladies about once per month in Freeport. LePage said the silver lining in the controversy is that it brought 150 patriots to Freeport on Tuesday and heightened awareness about the work of the flag ladies.
"The Freeport flag ladies are the most patriotic people I know," LePage said. "It's sad to hear this be politicized. They're just three women who are committed. They're everything."
Greene said she was sorry Roux "doesn't seem to get it or who we are or what we do" but that Tuesday's rally turned a controversy positive.
"Those young people down there with their signs? I'm proud of them," she said.
The spirit of Tuesday's rally was dampened at around 9 a.m. when a woman, Rhoda "Bunny" O'Leary of Norway, was struck by a vehicle as she crossed School Street. O'Leary, a frequent supporter of the flag ladies who also is involved with the Patriot Guard Riders and Wreaths Across America, was taken away by Freeport EMS. She was listed in fair condition late Tuesday afternoon at Maine Medical Center in Portland, according to a hospital representative.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine was one of seven states with fewer people in 2015 than the year before, according to census estimates released Tuesday.
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that Maine's population dropped by about 928 people from July 2014 to July 2015. The Pine Tree State joined Connecticut, Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, Vermont and West Virginia as states with estimated population declines.
Decreases in each of the states reflected minor dips relative to each state's total population. Maine's decline represented about a 0.1 percent drop, to an estimate of 1,329,328.
The decreases in two states -- Mississippi and New Mexico -- were basically zero when measured as a percentage of each state's population.
The estimates are the first stab at population change and what drove those changes for the year that's coming to a close.
Maine's population was estimated to increase in 2014 because migration from other states and international migration offset a higher number of deaths than births for the year.
The latest data estimated Maine had about 450 more deaths than births for the year, with negative domestic migration outpacing an influx of about 1,500 new international immigrants to the state.

Texto completo:   Forget the Yule Log on Christmas Eve unless you want to break into a sweat in the eastern U.S.
Record high temperatures could soar into the 70s on Thursday, shattering Christmas Eve records in several cities, including Boston (where the record high is 61), New York City (63), Philadelphia (64), Washington (69), Charlotte (71) and Atlanta (72).
"There is a high probability for record-setting warmth up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard," AccuWeather meteorologist Rob Englund said.
Highs Thursday will range from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast. Christmas Day should be about 10 degrees cooler than Christmas Eve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but high temperatures will still be well above average. The Southeast should stay toasty on Christmas Day, with highs in the 70s and 80s.
The temperature surge this week is from a high-pressure area offshore, Weather.com meteorologist Matt Sitkowski said. The high pressure will pump warm, southerly winds to the eastern half of the U.S., he said.
Parts of the South will see heavy rain, thunderstorms and even the chance of a few tornadoes this week.
Farther west, a parade of winter storms will continue. Snow will be plentiful in the Cascades, Sierra and northern Rockies, the National Weather Service says.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Kennebec Technologies employees have known for a while that company President Charles "Wick" Johnson has been thinking about retiring.
"I had always expected I would put the company up for sale," Johnson said.
With no clear succession path to pass the company on to a family member, he said he looked at the possibility of putting the company, a manufacturer of precision parts, on the market a year ago.
But last summer, Johnson started to consider a different option.
In recent years, an increasing number of companies in Maine, including GAC Chemical Corp. and Sargent Corp., have used employee stock ownership plans to establish succession.
On Monday, Johnson announced to Kennebec Technologies' 65 employees that rather than selling to an outside entity, he is, in effect, selling it to them.
Johnson has been working with members of the company's senior management on the conversion, which will take effect Jan. 1.
After the changeover, company operations should look essentially the same to both employees and customers. Johnson and his senior management will remain in place.
"If we pull this off, these shares could become quite valuable," he said.
The employee stock ownership plan will cover 100 percent of the company's shares and will allocate a portion of them to employees every year. On their retirement, employees can sell the shares back to the plan. This program enhances the existing retirement offering that includes a 401(k) plan.
"I expect this development will give our workforce a greater than ever sense of pride, investment and incentive to be productive, innovative and dedicated," he said.
Kennebec Technologies makes parts for a company that produces flap actuators for airplanes.
"If you hear whirring when the flaps are deploying, some of our parts are what's going around," Johnson said.
The company also makes thrust reversers, which slow the engine down and brake the plane.
HISTORY OF HELPING
The company has a history of helping employees succeed by paying for a large portion of educational expenses and rewarding performance through quarterly bonuses. Johnson said those bonuses have been paid out without interruption every quarter for five years.
From an economic perspective, a manufacturing company like Kennebec Technologies is highly sought after.
"I like to think of us as a 100 percent exporter," Johnson said, because all the parts the company makes are sent outside Maine and every dollar that comes as a result is, he said, "from away, and that circulates two or three times through the economy."
Bart Haley, Kennebec Technologies' vice president for sales and marketing, said if the company had been sold, the alternative could have been a new management team with a new set of goals for the company and its employees.
"In Maine, what you see happening sometimes is that a buyer acquires the book of business and the jobs go out of state," Haley said.
But to Johnson, perhaps as important as the economic impact is the role in the community that a company like Kennebec Technologies and its employees can fill.
"If I sell to an investment bank or engage in a strategic buyout, the whole civic leadership piece goes away," he said.
"Wick has had a tremendous sense of stewardship over the years," Haley said.
He has served on the University of Maine System board of trustees, including time as its chairman. He has also been involved in a number of civic and business organizations, and has served as co-chairman of the Friends of the Lithgow fundraising campaign.
Patrick Mirza, communications director for the ESOP Association, said the conversion can be a complicated process, and one of the challenges is educating employees about their new role as owners. But the move has some benefits.
"If you do it well, you'll find over time that as an employee, you are much more likely not to be laid off, and to keep your job longer," he said, citing industry research.
FOUNDED IN 1972
Kennebec Technologies got its start as Kennebec Tool & Dye in 1972 in the garage of Ed Prendergast.
By 1980, the company had started making aerospace parts for the space shuttle fuel cells.
Johnson bought the company in 1984, and it moved to Church Hill Road in Augusta and expanded in the decade that followed.
The company continued to grow and invest in itself. In 2009, it became Kennebec Technologies.
In 2013, it was named Manufacturer of the Year by the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Jessica Lowell can be contacted at 621-5632 or at: jlowell@centralmaine.com Twitter: JLowellKJ

Texto completo:   A land conservation group has closed a deal that will add more than 2,700 in Central Maine to DIF&W's wildlife management areas. It is the first LMF project to receive funding since the LePage administration freed up money.
A conservation group has purchased more than 2,700 acres in central Maine and donated the land to the state as part of the first project to benefit from the thaw in funding for the Land for Maine's Future program.
Plum Creek Timber Co. agreed to sell five separate tracts totaling 2,730 acres in Embden, Burnham, Detroit and Ripley to The Trust for Public Land. The trust, in turn, transferred the land on Monday to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, which plans to add the land to the state's wildlife management area system.
The $1.9 million Central Maine Sportsman's Access project was financed with $500,000 from the Land for Maine's Future program and with $1.4 million from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Wildlife Restoration Program. LMF funds are generated from the sale of voter-approved bonds.
The Central Maine Sportsman's Access project is the first to receive a share of $2.2 million in available cash that had been frozen for months as Gov. Paul LePage sought to use the LMF program as a bargaining chip with legislators.
LePage agreed in October to release the $2.2 million left over from previous bond sales in order to allow a handful of projects already approved by the LMF board to move forward. Then last week, LePage surprised many by announcing plans to sell $5 million in voter-approved bonds for LMF next year as well as $6.5 million in expired bonds if they are reauthorized by the Legislature early next year.
LePage had been sitting on the bonds as he pressured lawmakers - unsuccessfully, to date - to allow more timber harvesting on state-owned lands to help pay for a home heating assistance program for low-income and elderly Mainers.
But LePage's political tactics have contributed to a backlog of LMF projects and forced some land trusts to either seek extensions on purchase agreements or find alternate sources of money. The uncertainty over the bonds affected more than 30 projects that were approved for funding by the LMF board.
The architects of the Central Maine Sportsman's Access project said the land includes roughly 1,000 acres of "deer yard" habitat - areas used by deer for shelter and safety during the winter - as well as 1,000 acres of wetlands used by moose and waterfowl.
"Hunting, fishing and wildlife-watching are a central part Maine's culture and economy," Wolfe Tone, Maine state director of The Trust for Public Land, said in a statement. "We are proud to work side-by-side with sportsmen, guides, the state, and federal partners to protect these great traditions."
The Central Maine Sportsman's Access project was not expected to be the first through the gate for LMF funding but was able to complete all of the necessary paperwork and final reviews before other projects. The central Maine project will receive $500,000 out of the $1.6 million available for land conservation and recreation, with the remaining $600,000 going toward the preservation of farms or working waterfronts.
Supporters of the Central Maine Sportsman's Access project cheered its completion.
"The great thing about these properties is they are right in everybody's backyard," Clint Southard, a Palmyra resident who runs Full Circle Guide Service, said Monday evening. "They are right in central Maine and you don't have to travel far to get there, so I think they are a real jewel for sportsmen."
Projects that preserve deer wintering areas will likely benefit when LePage sells the $5 million in LMF bonds next year as well. That's because the bond measure - approved by 58 percent of Maine voters in June 2012 - instructs the state to give "preferential consideration during scoring" to projects that protect deer wintering areas. Other projects, such as the controversial Howard Hill project in Augusta strongly opposed by LePage, are also working to finalize their paperwork to receive funding.
The Trust for Public Land said that game-tagging data show that central Maine has some of the highest numbers of hunters statewide, but the region has the lowest amount of conservation land with guaranteed public access. To receive LMF funding, all projects must provide public access to the land for recreation.
"Generations of Maine sportsmen, through the purchase of ammunition and firearms, have paid into the Wildlife Restoration Program," David Trahan, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, said in a statement. "Putting this money towards important habitat protection and public access is exactly what needs to happen to ensure the next generation of sportsmen have places to hunt and fish."
Plum Creek, which is one of Maine's largest private landowners with more than 900,000 acres, is also involved in another LMF project moving through the final stages. The Cold Stream Forest Project involves more than 8,000 acres in Somerset County. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@mainetoday.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo:   Maine posted the biggest quarterly personal income gain in New England, buoyed by increases in wages and salaries.
Maine's personal income grew from $55.8 billion in the second quarter of the year to $56.5 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, a 1.3 percent gain, according to data released Monday by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That increase was strong enough to land the state at the No. 21 spot nationally for income growth this quarter.
The average gain in personal incomes nationally was also 1.3 percent, the same as in the second quarter. Personal income grew in every state, ranging from 0.6 percent in Alaska to 2.2 percent in Nebraska and South Dakota.
Maine's income growth was led by a 1.6 percent increase in net earnings from wages and salaries, which bested the national average of 1.4 percent and the New England's average of 1.3 percent.
Earnings were particularly strong in non-durable goods manufacturing and retail trade. Maine wages rose 0.07 percent in non-durable goods manufacturing while the national average was 0.04 percent, and the gain of 0.10 percent in retail was stronger than the national average of 0.08 percent.
The largest increase compared with national averages, however, was reserved for workers in health care and social services, who saw an income gain of 0.16 percent in the third quarter versus the U.S. average of 0.12 percent.
Income from dividends and interest in Maine was 0.9 percent, lower than the U.S. and New England average of 1.2 percent.
Income from transfer receipts - payments from the government such as Social Security, welfare benefits and unemployment payments - increased 0.9 percent, the same as the U.S. and New England averages.

Texto completo:   A booming microbrewery industry has led to a shortage of the humble beer can. That's left Maine brewers scrambling to plan for the busy summer season. There's no immediate shortage leading to beer left in the tanks this season, but the company tightening futrue supply threatens brewers planning for Maine's busy summer season.
A booming business based on the nationwide popularity of craft beer has left the humble beer can in short supply.
The squeeze is specifically in small orders of 16-ounce cans, used by several Maine brewers who have reported supply problems, said Sean Sullivan, executive director of the Maine Brewers' Guild.
"There's just too many breweries," Sullivan said of the national explosion of beer makers. He said most Maine brewers have enough cans on hand to avoid a panic, but managers are scrambling to find new suppliers before they exhaust their inventories.
Most beer comes in bottles, but a segment of the craft beer industry has taken a decided turn toward using 16-ounce cans. The size differentiates it from mass-produced 12-ounce beer, and cans preserve quality since sunlight can degrade beer. Also the target market for craft brews - hipster, outdoorsy types - can more easily transport canned beer in backpacks or take them where glass bottles are forbidden, including most parks.
All of that has created a growing demand for craft beers in 16-ounce cans and strained the segment's primary supplier, Pennsylvania-based Crown Holdings. Normally, beer can suppliers deliver a minimum order of 155,000 cans - the payload of a conventional 18-wheeler. But Crown, a metal can manufacturer, developed a niche business catering to those small brewers who only needed half-truck orders.
A few months ago, word started trickling out that Crown would no longer offer half-truck orders, and was dropping some customers entirely - even if they ordered full truckloads.
That's what happened to Portland's Rising Tide, owner Heather Sanborn said.
"We were shocked by the news," said Sanborn, adding that her brewery had purchased three full truckloads of cans from Crown in 2015. "I spent probably four very sleepless nights, literally, wondering if we were going to be able to continue with our most popular brand," the Maine Island Trail Ale.
Sanborn has found a new supplier, and aside from some additional art costs to rebuild the graphic design of the cans, there was no significant financial hit. Some sales were lost when Crown delayed the delivery on the cans for Rising Tide's winter brew, dropping them off the first week of November instead of early October, as expected.
"We lost the sales we would have had for those weeks," she said. "But for us, knock on wood, it's just been a lot of stress and a lot of scrambling."
Bart Watson, chief economist for the Brewers Association, said the situation is affecting brewers nationwide.
The association's members are reporting a range of issues with Crown, which has neither put out a public statement on the situation nor offered an explanation to the Brewers Association. Crown did not return calls for comment on Monday.
Some brewers are reporting delivery delays and some have been notified that they must buy a full truck at a time, Watson said. Others, like Rising Tide, report being dropped entirely.
The shift by Crown isn't surprising, Watson said. There's not a lot of money for major can manufacturers in the small market for 16-ounce, preprinted cans.
"To quickly retool and rebuild for a change in the industry is challenging for these larger manufacturers," he said. "They're built for big, long runs."
Some brewers have adjusted by finding new suppliers, but others switched to ordering plain 16-ounce cans and putting their own shrink-wrap labels on them.
Watson said the manufacturers are trying to keep up with a booming market, adding that beer isn't even the biggest player in 16-ounce cans.
"Products like energy drinks do a lot more volume in that package, which may be one reason for some of the disruptions as well," he said.
'SMALL PLAYER IN A SMALL MARKET'
In the late 1970s, there were fewer than 50 brewing companies in the United States. Today there are 4,000.
Craft brewers, who make less than 6 million barrels a year, make up only 3 percent of U.S. beer sales. Within that 3 percent, only about 10 percent of craft brewers use cans, and those that use the 16-ounce size are "a very small minority" within that, Watson said.
And for brewers who use 16-ounce cans, they may have multiple small-batch varieties, all with different labels that require manufacturing different preprinted cans.
"It's a small player in a small market," Watson said.
Mainers, however, can be excused for thinking craft breweries play a bigger role in the beer market. Maine ranks sixth nationwide for breweries per capita, and seventh nationwide for per capita beer production, Watson said.
"(Maine) certainly punches above its weight," Watson said.
Baxter Brewing Co., which was the first regional brewery to exclusively use cans, said it wasn't affected by the situation because it has a different supplier, Ball Corp.
Sullivan, the director of the state's brewers' guild, said most Maine brewers still use bottles. It's easier, less expensive, and a switch to canning means a six-figure investment in a canning line.
But craft brewers, and their customers, like cans, Sullivan said.
"Craft brewing as an industry is definitely shifting to cans," he said. "They're easier to transport, more environmentally sound, in theory, and people appreciate them."
The supply disruption has hit several Maine brewers who use the 16-ounce cans, but none was affected immediately because Crown honored existing contracts, he said. But there is concern it could turn into a problem in 2016.
"It's not as if there is anyone left with beer in the tank that they had to dump," he said. "It's a long-term impact."
Watson agreed, considering the steady growth in the craft beer industry.
"We're not increasing the number of can manufacturers in this country," he said. "This may not be the last time we hear about this issue." Noel K. Gallagher can be reached at 791-6387 or at: ngallagher@pressherald.com Twitter: noelinmaine

Texto completo:   EMBARGOED UNTIL 3 p.m. Kennebec Technologies President Charles "Wick" Johnson is announcing the high tech manufacturing company will transition its ownership structure -- an employee stock ownership plan that will keep the company in Augusta and in the hands of employees. The alternative -- a sale -- would likely have jeopardized the company's future in Maine and its legacy of civic engagement.
Company President Charles 'Wick' Johnson tells workers he is selling them the business
AUGUSTA -- Kennebec Technologies employees have known for a while that company President Charles "Wick" Johnson has been thinking about retiring.
"I had always expected I would put the company up for sale," Johnson said. With no clear succession path to pass the company on to a family member, Johnson said he looked at the possibility of putting the company, a manufacturer of precision parts, on the market a year ago.
But last summer, Johnson started to consider a different option.
In recent years, an increasing number of companies in Maine, including GAC Chemical Corp. and Sargent Corp., have been taking a different succession path: an employee stock ownership plan.
On Monday, Johnson announced to Kennebec Technologies' 65 employees that rather than selling to an outside entity, he is, in effect, selling it to them.
Johnson has been working with members of the company's senior management on the conversion, which will take effect Jan. 1.
Production manager Shawn Arbour, of Chelsea, has worked for the company since 1989 and said the ESOP is a big deal for the employees.
"It gives you a piece of ownership in a company," Arbour said. "I think it's everybody's dream to own a company, and this was an easy way to do it."
After the changeover, company operations should look essentially the same to both employees and customers. Johnson and his senior management will remain in place.
"If we pull this off, these shares could become quite valuable," he said.
The employee stock ownership plan will own 100 percent of the company's shares and will allocate a portion of them to employees every year. On their retirement, employees can sell the shares back to the plan. This program enhances the existing retirement offering that includes a 401(k) plan.
"I expect this development will give our workforce a greater than ever sense of pride, investment, and incentive to be productive, innovative and dedicated," he said.
Kennebec Technologies makes parts for a company that produces flap actuators for airplanes.
"If you hear whirring when the flaps are deploying, some of our parts are what's going around," Johnson said.
Arbour and engineering manager Brent Duncan, of Jefferson, said that owning a piece of the company provides an added incentive to employees to work harder than they already do because when the company makes more money, so do the employee owners.
"It's a nice additional incentive to bonus plans that we already have in place," Arbour said, citing the sales bonuses the company already provides employees.
The company also makes thrust reversers, which slow the engine down and brake the plane.
The company has a history of helping employees succeed by paying for a large portion of educational expenses and rewarding performances through quarterly bonuses. Johnson said those bonuses have been paid out without interruption every quarter for five years.
During Johnson's presentation to employees Monday, questions were asked about the future of the company, and one employee, machinist Ron Harris, of Oakland, said it was an "early Christmas present" knowing that Johnson didn't just sell the company to an outside buyer.
"It's a whole lot better than somebody coming in and buying the place because the chance of that turning out good would be slim," Harris said. "I was concerned because you'll never get an owner or boss better than Wick, but hopefully it continues on the way it is."
From an economic perspective, a manufacturing company like Kennebec Technologies is highly sought after.
"I like to think of us as a 100 percent exporter," Johnson said, because all the parts the company makes are sent outside Maine and every dollar that comes as a result is, he said, "from away, and that circulates two or three times through the economy."
Ross Cunningham, president and CEO of the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the precision manufacturing sector is poised for substantial growth in the coming years.
"Kennebec Valley is a better place because businesses like Kennebec Technologies are making it clear that this kind of business can succeed here," he said.
Bart Haley, Kennebec Technologies vice president for sales and marketing, said if the company had been sold, the alternative could have been a new management team with a new set of goals for the company and its employees.
"In Maine, what you see happening sometimes is that a buyer acquires the book of business and the jobs go out of state," Haley said.
But to Johnson, perhaps as important as the economic impact is the role in the community that a company like Kennebec Technologies and its employees can fill.
"If I sell to an investment bank or engage in a strategic buyout, the whole civic leadership piece goes away," he said.
"Wick has had a tremendous sense of stewardship over the years," Haley said.
He has served on the University of Maine System board of trustees, including time as its chairman. He has also been involved in a number of civic and business organizations, and has served as co-chairman of the Friends of the Lithgow fundraising campaign.
Patrick Mirza, communications director for the ESOP Association, said the conversion can be a complicated process, and one of the challenges is educating employees about their new role as owners. But the move also carries with it a number of benefits.
"If you do it well, you'll find over time that as an employee, you are much more likely not to be laid off and to keep your job longer," he said citing industry research.
Kennebec Technologies got its start as Kennebec Tool & Dye in 1972 in the garage of Ed Prendergast. By 1980, the company had started making aerospace parts for the space shuttle fuel cells. Johnson bought the company in 1984, and the company moved to Church Hill Road in Augusta and expanded in the decade that followed the purchase. The company continued to grow and invest in itself. In 2009, the company changed its name to Kennebec Technologies.
Both Johnson and the company have earned recognition for their work from government and industry officials. In 2013, the company was named Manufacturer of the Year by the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership.

Texto completo:   LEWISTON -- A 2-year-old boy was critically injured Monday when he was struck by a car driven by his father in the parking lot of their apartment complex in Lewiston.
The incident occurred around 11:40 a.m. when the boy became caught beneath the car as his father, 24-year-old Ron Holmes, backed it up at Hillview Apartments on Rideout Avenue. Holmes was initially unaware that he had struck his son until someone cried out, Lewiston police Lt. Michael McGonagle said.
The boy, Lucas Holmes, was first taken by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, then flown by a medical helicopter to Maine Medical Center in Portland. McGonagle said the boy had injuries to his head and torso that he characterized as life-threatening.
"It looks like he was caught beneath the tire and that the tire was pushing him, but that's unknown," McGonagle said, adding that the incident is "under investigation still."
The boy's father, whose driver's license is suspended for motor vehicle infractions, was backing up the car at the time of the accident from a parking space in the lot to move it closer to the door. He was trying to make it easier for him and his girlfriend to load the car and put Lucas and their infant child inside, McGonagle said.
After the accident, police allowed Ron Holmes to first go to CMMC in Lewiston with his son, and then brought him to the police station for testing, which is standard procedure in crashes with serious injury. Ron Holmes took a breath test, which showed no presence of alcohol in his system, and submitted to a blood test. McGonagle said police do not believe alcohol or drugs were factors in the incident.
"He's cooperating with the investigation," McGonagle said. "He does have a suspended license, but at this point he has not been charged. The investigation is still ongoing, and charges may be coming."
Around 3:30 p.m., Ron Holmes returned briefly to his apartment before getting in a car driven by a friend to go visit his son at the hospital in Portland.
Ron Holmes said he did not know his son's condition, since he had been at the police station all day. He said his girlfriend was in the hospital room with Lucas, but he had been unable to reach her by phone.
He spoke only briefly before being driven away.

Texto completo:   Couple found dead five days after reported missing
Ed Yoshiyama, liaison officer to the United States for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was vacationing on a cruise ship Aug. 3 when he responded to a message on his cellphone about a missing couple driving through Maine from Quebec.
The message was from Detective Christian Turcotte of the Quebec Provincial Police requesting assistance in locating Francine Dumas and Martin Poulin, who hadn't been heard from since they left their home in Beauceville, Quebec, July 28 to spend a few days in New Hampshire. They were due back in Quebec on July 30 to attend a wedding, but never made it.
Because he was out at sea without cellphone service, Yoshiyama said Monday, he could not be sure exactly when the message had been sent to him. The time and date stamp since have been erased.
"I immediately contacted my colleague in Washington and provided him with the contact info for the (Maine Information and Analysis Center)," Yoshiyama said in an email Monday. "He managed to relay the messages between MIAC and the QPP that same day."
At about 2 p.m. the following day -- Aug. 4, seven days after the couple were last seen and five days after their family reported them missing -- the bodies of Dumas and Poulin, both 58, were found in the wreckage of a 2005 Nissan Altima on U.S. Route 201 north of West Forks in northern Somerset County.
The couple had been dead for some time, according to an accident report released Monday by the Somerset County Sheriff's Department after a Freedom of Information Act request by the Morning Sentinel.
The wreckage was found by family members at about the same time on Aug. 4 as the sheriff's office received an email bulletin from MIAC alerting law enforcement agencies in Maine of the missing couple -- a day after state police got the notification from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The confusion over which law enforcement agencies knew the couple were missing and when they knew is readily apparent in the 18-page Somerset County Sheriff's Office report on the accident.
The cause of the accident, which police believed happened July 28 about 35 miles south of where Dumas and Poulin crossed into Maine on Route 201, is not much clearer now than it was at the time, though the report speculates speed may have been involved. Skid marks at the scene were about 225 feet long, but may have been longer because they were fading with the passage of time.
The report, filed by Cpl. Ritchie Putnam, the primary investigator for the sheriff's office, said there was no evidence of a collision with an animal, such as a deer or a moose, and there were no alcoholic beverages inside the car.
Yoshiyama also emailed Putnam on Aug. 12, requesting a copy of the accident report. When Putnam called him back, Yoshiyama "asked several questions about the crash scene and the circumstances about our knowledge of the missing persons report," Putnam wrote in the report.
Sgt. Carlton Small at MIAC in Augusta and Turcotte in Quebec did not immediately return calls and emails Monday to clarify the timeline of communication after the couple did not return home and were reported missing.
Questions about that communication were raised by Dumas' and Poulin's family after the accident was discovered.
Dumas' son, Renald Lacasse, told the Montreal Journal after the accident that family contacted police in Hampton, New Hampshire, on Aug. 1 about the missing family members. According to the accident report, the family had already contacted Quebec police at that point.
"But it didn't proceed fast enough," Lacasse told the newspaper. "No news got back to us." He said police in New Hampshire "checked in Hampton Beach and as far as Boston" without finding any information about the couple.
Dumas and Poulin crossed the international border near Jackman at 10:38 a.m. July 28 and never answered cellphone calls or used their credit cards after that point.
"The family could not understand why our agency had not been out looking for Francine and Martin," Putnam wrote in his report summary. "I explained to them that we did not know that they had been reported missing."
The report noted that both Ross and Putnam said they didn't see the bulletin until after they had been at the scene of the crash, which Putnam was notified of at 2:13 p.m. that day.
Putnam said he also explained that the car had crashed deep into a stand of trees, some of which had collapsed onto the vehicle making it difficult to see from the road, and that no one had reported the accident or the wreckage.
Family members of the couple finally ventured off on their own, fearing something bad had happened, according to the report. They found the wreckage and flagged down Detective Lt. Carl Gottardi of the sheriff's office as he was driving by.
Gottardi noted skid marks and evidence that showed that the car had skidded sideways as it left the paved road. The car had struck a large spruce tree and had "completely collapsed around this tree, almost folding in half" around the tree, breaking it off at the base, he said in Putnam's report.
Police think the accident occurred the same day the couple crossed the border, noting that their cellphones and credit cards had not been used after they entered the United States, according to the sheriff's department. The two-lane road rises slightly near the scene but is mostly straight. The speed limit there is 55 mph.
There were no witnesses to the accident.
James Ross, chief deputy at the Somerset sheriff's office, said investigators may never know what happened.
"We'll never know," Ross said Monday. "There's some marks there. It could be as simple as falling asleep. It could have been avoiding an animal. They could have been distracted. I don't know."

Texto completo:   A conservation group has purchased more than 2,700 acres in central Maine and donated the land to the state as part of the first project to benefit from the thaw in funding for the Land for Maine's Future program.
Plum Creek Timber Co. agreed to sell five separate tracts totaling 2,730 acres in Embden, Burnham, Detroit and Ripley to The Trust for Public Land. The trust, in turn, transferred the land on Monday to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, which plans to add the land to the state's wildlife management area system.
The $1.9 million Central Maine Sportsman's Access project was financed with $500,000 from the Land for Maine's Future program and with $1.4 million from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Wildlife Restoration Program. LMF funds are generated from the sale of voter-approved bonds.
The Central Maine Sportsman's Access project is the first to receive a share of $2.2 million in available cash that had been frozen for months as Gov. Paul LePage sought to use the LMF program as a bargaining chip with legislators.
LePage agreed in October to release the $2.2 million left over from previous bond sales in order to allow a handful of projects already approved by the LMF board to move forward. Then last week, LePage surprised many by announcing plans to sell $5 million in voter-approved bonds for LMF next year as well as $6.5 million in expired bonds if they are reauthorized by the Legislature early next year. LePage had been sitting on the bonds as he pressured lawmakers -- unsuccessfully, to date -- to allow more timber harvesting on state-owned lands to help pay for a home heating assistance program for low-income and elderly Mainers.
But LePage's political tactics have contributed to a backlog of LMF projects and forced some land trusts to either seek extensions on purchase agreements or find alternative sources of money. The uncertainty over the bonds affected more than 30 projects that were approved for funding by the LMF board.
The architects of the Central Maine Sportsman's Access project said the land includes roughly 1,000 acres of "deer yard" habitat -- areas used by deer for shelter and safety during the winter -- as well as 1,000 acres of wetlands used by moose and waterfowl.
"Hunting, fishing and wildlife-watching are a central part of Maine's culture and economy," Wolfe Tone, Maine state director of The Trust for Public Land, said in a statement. "We are proud to work side-by-side with sportsmen, guides, the state, and federal partners to protect these great traditions."
The Central Maine Sportsman's Access project was not expected to be the first through the gate for LMF funding but was able to complete all of the necessary paperwork and final reviews before other projects. The central Maine project will receive $500,000 out of the $1.6 million available for land conservation and recreation, with the remaining $600,000 going toward the preservation of farms or working waterfronts.
Supporters of the Central Maine Sportsman's Access project cheered its completion.
"The great thing about these properties is they are right in everybody's backyard," Clint Southard, a Palmyra resident who runs Full Circle Guiding Service, said Monday evening. "They are right in Central Maine and you don't have to travel far to get there, so I think they are a real jewel for sportsmen."
Projects that preserve deer wintering areas will likely benefit when LePage sells the $5 million in LMF bonds next year as well. That's because the bond measure -- approved by 58 percent of Maine voters in June 2012 -- instructs the state to give "preferential consideration during scoring" to projects that protect deer wintering areas. Other projects, such as the controversial Howard Hill project in Augusta strongly opposed by LePage, are also working to finalize their paperwork to receive funding.
The Trust for Public Land said that game tagging data show that Central Maine has some of the highest numbers of hunters statewide, but the region has the lowest amount of conservation land with guaranteed public access. To receive LMF funding, all projects must provide public access to the land for recreation.
"Generations of Maine sportsmen, through the purchase of ammunition and firearms, have paid into the Wildlife Restoration Program," David Trahan, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, said in a statement. "Putting this money towards important habitat protection and public access is exactly what needs to happen to ensure the next generation of sportsmen have places to hunt and fish."
Plum Creek, which is one of Maine's largest private landowners with more than 900,000 acres, is also involved in another LMF project moving through the final stages. The Cold Stream Forest Project involves more than 8,000 acres in Somerset County.

Resumen: Once the tests are completed, Edgar will compile the test results and submit them for peer review before they ultimately go to the American Lumber Standards Committee, a quasi-governmental organization based in Washington, D.C., that has the ultimate authority to approve Norway spruce for use in the construction industry. On an annual basis Maine sawmills produce roughly 425 million board feet of construction lumber from spruce, pine and fir logs, which means Norway spruce would increase the supply by roughly 5 percent, according to Easterling.

Texto completo:   ORONO -- Standing in his laboratory at the University of Maine, Russell Edgar watches a piece of lumber slowly bend to its breaking point. A sharp "crack!" pierces the air.
Looking at his computer, Edgar notes it took exactly 4,089 pounds of force applied to this particular two-by-eight board -- sawed from a Norway spruce log harvested in northern Maine -- before it snapped.
Edgar, wood composites manager at UMaine's Advanced Structures and Composites Center, and his team have put roughly 125 pieces of lumber through this type of test. They're only getting started. Over the next four to six weeks they'll put more than 1,000 two-by-fours, two-by-sixes and two-by-eights -- all sawed from Norway spruce trees from Maine, New York, Wisconsin and Vermont -- through these same strength tests.
"We are ready to kick into high gear at this point," Edgar said.
The project's goal? To determine if Norway spruce grown in the United States is strong enough to be used in this country for building construction.
The tests are making history, at least within the forest products industry. The last time a new species was tested for use in construction was more than two generations ago, according to Jeff Easterling, president of the Northeast Lumber Manufacturers Association, which is based in Yarmouth.
"This is the first time in probably 80 years that a new species has been tested from logs grown in the United States," Easterling said. "There will probably never be another one, so that's the amazing thing from our standpoint -- this could be a once-in-a-lifetime event."
It's also a historic event for another reason. The Norway spruce being tested at UMaine come from some of the estimated 3 billion trees of various species planted around the country during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps, an effort of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's to put people back to work. The CCC workers planted the trees to reclaim abandoned farmland and used primarily Norway spruce in the Northeast and Great Lakes region, according to Easterling. In Maine, most of the trees were planted in Aroostook County, but there are significant plantations of the non-native species in nearly half a dozen Maine counties, according to his organization's research.
While builders in Europe have used Norway spruce for ages, it is off-limits to the U.S. construction industry because the proper strength tests were never conducted on the trees grown in this country.
"It's important that we categorize and monitor this wood resource over time," Edgar said. "Norway spruce here in the U.S. has never been tested for inclusion in the building codes and that's what we're up to."
Preliminary tests look promising, he said. The two-by-eight board that snapped at more than 4,000 pounds of pressure easily exceeded the range of strength needed for commercial lumber used as floor joists, rafters or studs, said Easterling. Other metrics must be taken into account, though, before the board passes muster for commercial use.
Once the tests are completed, Edgar will compile the test results and submit them for peer review before they ultimately go to the American Lumber Standards Committee, a quasi-governmental organization based in Washington, D.C., that has the ultimate authority to approve Norway spruce for use in the construction industry. As of now, the group is expected to consider the Norway spruce at its meeting in April 2016.
The Norway spruce is recognizable among other evergreen species by its long branches, which curve upwards near the end, and its long, tightly packed pine cones. It's a species often used in landscaping for ornamental purposes and wind breaks.
It's not known how many Norway spruce seedlings were planted during the Great Depression, but the U.S. Forest Service has estimated that around 2.1 billion board feet of standing saw timber are currently scattered across 13 states, the majority in New York.
The federal agency estimated Maine contains roughly 12.1 million board feet in Aroostook and Knox counties.
But Easterling and his team say the forest service's sampling methodology underestimated the amount of Norway spruce in Maine. Easterling said his organization found significant plantations of the species in Oxford, Somerset and Penobscot counties. Easterling thinks it's safe to assume there are at least 24 million board feet of Norway spruce in Maine.
On an annual basis Maine sawmills produce roughly 425 million board feet of construction lumber from spruce, pine and fir logs, which means Norway spruce would increase the supply by roughly 5 percent, according to Easterling. That's a "significant amount" of potential building material that is currently blocked from entering the supply chain, he said. Durable wood products, such as lumber, accounted for 6 percent of the state's $5.1 billion manufacturing sector in 2013.
"When you're talking in half-billion units, that's sizable," he said.
The seedlings planted during the Great Depression are now between 80 and 100 feet tall and their diameter at breast height ranges from about 16 inches to 26 inches. In other words, perfect for lumber.
If the strength tests are successful, Easterling said the introduction of Norway spruce into the construction industry could have a major economic impact for three main groups: landowners who have Norway spruce on their properties, the loggers hired to harvest the trees and the sawmills that turn the logs into lumber. To date, Norway spruce in this country has been harvested for pulpwood, but lumber has a higher-value use.
The economic impact will be especially strong if the economy continues to improve and there is a steady increase in home construction.
"What they did 80 years ago could really boost the economy and create a whole new resource that wasn't in existence then, but now is," Easterling said.
Alan Orcutt, mill manager at J.D. Irving's Dixfield sawmill, said the ability for mills to procure more lumber translates into added hours for millworkers, increased lumber production and potentially more jobs.
One group that will likely not be affected by the addition of Norway spruce to construction grade lumber is the average consumer. Anyone walking into a Home Depot to buy two-by-sixes to build a new deck would never be able to tell a Norway spruce from a similar species - or notice a difference in price.
"Once it's delimbed you cannot tell those logs from those of native spruces," Easterling said. "Same with lumber -- you'd not be able to notice the difference at Home Depot."
The research at UMaine's Advanced Structures and Composites Center was funded with a nearly $300,000 competitive grant the lab received in 2013 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The project is a perfect example of a public-private partnership between the university and industry, said Stephen Shaler, director of UMaine's School of Forest Resources and associate director of the composites center.
The Northeast Lumber Manufacturers Association, Easterling's organization, isn't providing money to UMaine, but it spent a significant amount of the man-hours and resources to find the trees, harvest them, transport them to the mills to be sawed, edged and planed and then shipped to UMaine, Shaler said.
"They haven't paid the university for the testing, but they have spent a lot of resources to make it happen, so it's a partnership," he said. "It's leveraging federal dollars with industry participation. That's a wonderful situation that doesn't always happen."

Texto completo:   EMBARGOED UNTIL 3 p.m. Kennebec Technologies President Charles "Wick" Johnson is announcing the high tech manufacturing company will transition its ownership structure -- an employee stock ownership plan that will keep the company in Augusta and in the hands of employees. The alternative -- a sale -- would likely have jeopardized the company's future in Maine and its legacy of civic engagement.
Kennebec Technologies' Charles 'Wick' Johnson selling business to employees
AUGUSTA -- Kennebec Technologies employees have known for a while that company President Charles "Wick" Johnson has been thinking about retiring.
"I had always expected I would put the company up for sale," Johnson said. With no clear succession path to pass the company on to a family member, Johnson said he looked at the possibility of putting the company, a manufacturer of precision parts, on the market a year ago.
But last summer, Johnson started to consider a different option.
In recent years, an increasing number of companies in Maine, including GAC Chemical Corp. and Sargent Corp., have been taking a different succession path: an employee stock ownership plan.
On Monday, Johnson announced to Kennebec Technologies' 65 employees that rather than selling to an outside entity, he is, in effect, selling it to them.
Johnson has been working with members of the company's senior management on the conversion, which will take effect Jan. 1.
Production manager Shawn Arbour, of Chelsea, has worked for the company since 1989 and said the ESOP is a big deal for the employees.
"It gives you a piece of ownership in a company," Arbour said. "I think it's everybody's dream to own a company, and this was an easy way to do it."
After the changeover, company operations should look essentially the same to both employees and customers. Johnson and his senior management will remain in place.
"If we pull this off, these shares could become quite valuable," he said.
The employee stock ownership plan will own 100 percent of the company's shares and will allocate a portion of them to employees every year. On their retirement, employees can sell the shares back to the plan. This program enhances the existing retirement offering that includes a 401(k) plan.
"I expect this development will give our workforce a greater than ever sense of pride, investment, and incentive to be productive, innovative and dedicated," he said.
Kennebec Technologies makes parts for a company that produces flap actuators for airplanes.
"If you hear whirring when the flaps are deploying, some of our parts are what's going around," Johnson said.
Arbour and engineering manager Brent Duncan, of Jefferson, said that owning a piece of the company provides an added incentive to employees to work harder than they already do because when the company makes more money, so do the employee owners.
"It's a nice additional incentive to bonus plans that we already have in place," Arbour said, citing the sales bonuses the company already provides employees.
The company also makes thrust reversers, which slow the engine down and brake the plane.
The company has a history of helping employees succeed by paying for a large portion of educational expenses and rewarding performances through quarterly bonuses. Johnson said those bonuses have been paid out without interruption every quarter for five years.
During Johnson's presentation to employees Monday, questions were asked about the future of the company, and one employee, machinist Ron Harris, of Oakland, said it was an "early Christmas present" knowing that Johnson didn't just sell the company to an outside buyer.
"It's a whole lot better than somebody coming in and buying the place because the chance of that turning out good would be slim," Harris said. "I was concerned because you'll never get an owner or boss better than Wick, but hopefully it continues on the way it is."
From an economic perspective, a manufacturing company like Kennebec Technologies is highly sought after.
"I like to think of us as a 100 percent exporter," Johnson said, because all the parts the company makes are sent outside Maine and every dollar that comes as a result is, he said, "from away, and that circulates two or three times through the economy."
Ross Cunningham, president and CEO of the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the precision manufacturing sector is poised for substantial growth in the coming years.
"Kennebec Valley is a better place because businesses like Kennebec Technologies are making it clear that this kind of business can succeed here," he said.
Bart Haley, Kennebec Technologies vice president for sales and marketing, said if the company had been sold, the alternative could have been a new management team with a new set of goals for the company and its employees.
"In Maine, what you see happening sometimes is that a buyer acquires the book of business and the jobs go out of state," Haley said.
But to Johnson, perhaps as important as the economic impact is the role in the community that a company like Kennebec Technologies and its employees can fill.
"If I sell to an investment bank or engage in a strategic buyout, the whole civic leadership piece goes away," he said.
"Wick has had a tremendous sense of stewardship over the years," Haley said.
He has served on the University of Maine System board of trustees, including time as its chairman. He has also been involved in a number of civic and business organizations, and has served as co-chairman of the Friends of the Lithgow fundraising campaign.
Patrick Mirza, communications director for the ESOP Association, said the conversion can be a complicated process, and one of the challenges is educating employees about their new role as owners. But the move also carries with it a number of benefits.
"If you do it well, you'll find over time that as an employee, you are much more likely not to be laid off and to keep your job longer," he said citing industry research.
Kennebec Technologies got its start as Kennebec Tool & Dye in 1972 in the garage of Ed Prendergast. By 1980, the company had started making aerospace parts for the space shuttle fuel cells. Johnson bought the company in 1984, and the company moved to Church Hill Road in Augusta and expanded in the decade that followed the purchase. The company continued to grow and invest in itself. In 2009, the company changed its name to Kennebec Technologies.
Both Johnson and the company have earned recognition for their work from government and industry officials. In 2013, the company was named Manufacturer of the Year by the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership.

A booming business based on the nationwide popularity of craft beer has left the humble beer can in short supply.
The squeeze is specifically in small orders of 16-ounce cans, used by several Maine brewers who have reported supply problems, said Sean Sullivan, executive director of the Maine Brewers' Guild.
"There's just too many breweries," Sullivan said of the national explosion of beer-makers. He said most Maine brewers have enough cans on hand to avoid a panic, but managers are scrambling to find new suppliers before they exhaust their inventories.
Most beer comes in bottles, but a segment of the craft beer industry has taken a decided turn toward using 16-ounce cans. The size differentiates it from mass-produced 12-ounce beer, and cans preserve quality since sunlight can degrade beer. Also the target market for craft brews -- hipster, outdoorsy types -- can more easily transport canned beer in backpacks or take them where glass bottles are forbidden, including most parks.
All of that has created a growing demand for craft beers in 16-ounce cans and strained the segment's primary supplier, Pennsylvania-based Crown Holdings. Normally, beer can suppliers deliver a minimum order of 155,000 cans, the payload of a conventional 18-wheeler. But Crown, a metal can manufacturer, developed a niche business catering to those small brewers who only needed half-truck orders.
A few months ago, word started trickling out that Crown would no longer offer half-truck orders and was dropping some customers entirely even if they ordered full truckloads.
That's what happened to Portland's Rising Tide, owner Heather Sanborn said.
"We were shocked by the news," said Sanborn, adding that her brewery had purchased three full truckloads of cans from Crown in 2015. "I spent probably four very sleepless nights literally wondering if we were going to be able to continue with our most popular brand," the Maine Island Trail Ale.
Sanborn has found a new supplier, and aside from some additional art costs to rebuild the graphic design of their cans, there was no significant financial hit. They did lose some sales when Crown delayed the delivery on the cans for Rising Tide's winter brew, dropping them off the first week of November instead of early October as expected.
"We lost the sales we would have had for those weeks," she said. "But for us -- knock on wood -- it's just been a lot of stress and a lot of scrambling."
Bart Watson, chief economist for the Brewers Association, said the situation is affecting brewers nationwide.
The association's members are reporting a range of issues with Crown, which has neither put out a public statement on the situation nor offered an explanation to the Brewers Association. Crown did not return calls for comment on Monday.
Some brewers are reporting delivery delays, and some have been notified that they must buy a full truck at a time, Watson said. Others, like Rising Tide, report being dropped entirely.
The shift by Crown isn't surprising, Watson said. There's not a lot of money for major can manufacturers in the small niche market for 16-ounce, pre-printed cans.
"To quickly retool and rebuild for a change in the industry is challenging for these larger manufacturers," he said. "They're built for big, long runs."
Some brewers have adjusted by finding new suppliers, but others switched to ordering plain 16-ounce cans and putting their own shrink-wrap labels on them.
Watson said the manufacturers are trying to keep up with a booming market, adding that beer isn't even the biggest player in 16-ounce cans.
"Products like energy drinks do a lot more volume in that package, which may be one reason for some of the disruptions as well," he said.
In the late 1970s, there were fewer than 50 brewing companies in the United States. Today there are 4,000.
Craft brewers, who make less than 6 million barrels a year, make up only 3 percent of U.S. beer sales. Within that 3 percent, only about 10 percent of craft brewers use cans, and those that use the 16-ounce size are "a very small minority" within that, Watson said. For brewers who use 16-ounce cans, they may have multiple small-batch varieties all with different labels that require manufacturing different pre-printed cans.
"It's a small player in a small market," Watson said.
Mainers, however, can be excused for thinking craft breweries play a bigger role in the beer market. Maine ranks sixth nationwide for breweries per capita and seventh nationwide for per capita beer production, Watson said.
"(Maine) certainly punches above its weight," Watson said.
Baxter Brewing Co., which was the first regional brewery to use cans exclusively, said it wasn't affected by the situation because it has a different supplier, Ball Corp.
Sullivan, the director of the state's brewers' guild, said most Maine brewers still use bottles. It's easier, less expensive and a switch to canning means a six-figure investment in a canning line.
But craft brewers and their customers like cans, Sullivan said.
"Craft brewing as an industry is definitely shifting to cans," he said. "They're easier to transport, more environmentally sound in theory and people appreciate them."
The supply disruption has hit several Maine brewers who use the 16-ounce cans, but none were affected immediately because Crown honored existing contracts, he said. But there is concern it could turn into a problem in 2016.
"It's not as if there is anyone left with beer in the tank that they had to dump," he said. "It's a long-term impact."
Watson agreed, considering the steady growth in the craft beer industry.
"We're not increasing the number of can manufacturers in this country," he said. "This may not be the last time we hear about this issue."

Texto completo: I explored about 50 different hiking trails throughout Maine in 2015. Each week of the year, I walked a new trail, with the exception of a few weeks when I decided to explore a pond in my kayak instead, and I can't remember a time when I was disappointed. Some hikes were on easy nature trails, while others were strenuous day-long climbs. Most fell somewhere in between. And I enjoyed them all for different reasons.
The Edgar M. Tennis Preserve comprises about 145 acres of coastal land on Deer Isle, between Pickering Cove and Southeast Harbor. The public can explore the preserve year round on a network of walking trails, which are maintained by the Island Heritage Trust and the Maine Department of Conservation. It's a popular spot for recreators, but due to its limited number of parking areas, it's never crowded.
After picking up a turkey sandwich at Harbor Ice Cream in Deer Isle, I headed to the Edgar M. Tennis Preserve on Aug. 27, with my dog, Oreo. In my opinion, this preserve is home to one of most beautiful mossy forests I've ever seen. I also enjoyed the rocky outlooks located along the shore, as well as a few small beaches covered in pink sand.
Mount Megunticook in Camden
The highest of the Camden Hills, Mount Megunticook rises 1,385 feet above sea level at the heart of Camden Hills State Park. Though the mountain's summit  is forested, there are several open granite ledges located along its slopes that offer stunning views of the Penobscot Bay.
I hiked the mountain for the second time in November with Derek and Oreo. I'd previously snowshoed the mountain in 2011. The two adventures were quite different, though they were on the same trails.
During the November hike, the weather was brisk and the sun was shining. After spending time at each of the outlooks along the ledges of Megunticook, we headed into an evergreen forest to hike to the summit. That section of the trail, in the dark mossy woods, was my favorite part of the hike. here we stepped over pools of ice, which had frozen in interesting geometric patterns, and listened to the scolding chatter of red squirrels. Mosses and lichens carpeted the forest floor, crept up tree trunks and covered boulders. In the brown world of November, we were surrounded by green.
CAPTION:Billings Falls Known as the "Grand Canyon of Maine" or the "Grand Canyon of the East," Gulf Hagas is a slate gorge carved out by the West Branch of the Pleasant River near Brownville. Over the course of three miles, the river drops about 500 feet, forming several spectacular waterfalls and swimming holes. In some places, the rock walls the border the river are more than 100 feet tall. The hike is moderate-strenuous in difficulty. Not everyone who hikes to the waterfalls of Gulf Hagas completes the entire loop, which is about 9 miles long. I hiked the Gulf Hagas loop in June with my husband (then fiance) Derek and our dog, Oreo. It was a beautiful, sunny day, and we saw a few other groups of hikers out on the trail. My favorite of all the waterfalls was Billings Falls. Morse Mountain and Seawall Beach in Phippsburg To reach the beautiful, sandy Seawall Beach in Phippsburg, you have to hike along an old road for two miles, up and over Morse Mountain. For this reason, this giant beach isn't as crowded as more easily accessible sandy beaches in the area. Just make sure to watch out the endangered piping plovers, tiny birds that nest in the sand dunes along the edge of the beach. The hike to the beach travels through the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area and is full of opportunities to view wildlife. Along the way, you'll pass through a mature forest and wetlands that are home to a variety of birds. And atop Morse Mountain, you can sit on a bench and enjoy a view of the ocean and a nearby river. I hiked Morse Mountain to Seawall Beach in May, alone, since dogs aren't permitted on the property, and I saw a variety of wildlife, including a snowy egret, a great blue heron, a Cooper's hawk and a bald eagle. I don't know if I've ever seen a more beautiful beach. South Turner Mountain in Baxter State Park

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- A man has been charged in connection with kicking a puppy on the Kennebec River rail trail last month, according to Augusta police.
Michael Hein, 45, of Augusta was running along the rail trail and apparently kicked a puppy that a woman had been walking, according to Lt. Kevin Lully. Hein was charged with animal cruelty on Friday.
According to the woman's complaint, Hein approached her and the dog and after a brief exchange of words, Hein passed by and kicked the dog, Lully said.
The dog suffered minor injuries.
Hein's attorney, Scott Hess of Augusta, said in an email Monday night that Hein denies kicking the dog.
"He in no way, shape or form kicked or otherwise harmed the dog and intends to contest the matter in court," Hess wrote. "He has confidence that once all the facts are brought to light, he will be cleared of the charge."
Hein worked as an administrator for the Christian Civic League of Maine from June 2006 to August 2010, when he was fired.
In 2012, Hein was sentenced to seven days in jail after pleading guilty to a charge related to encouraging 15 people to falsely claim they made personal contributions to qualify him for Maine Clean Election Act funding. Hein was running for the Maine House of Representatives at the time.
A court date for Hein has not been set.

Texto completo:   BRUNSWICK - We said goodbye to Donald Gordon Faragher, 82, in the quiet of the evening at Mid Coast Hospital on November 30th. His oldest daughter Emily was holding his hand. He had carefully managed serious heart conditions for many years. He faced his death with acceptance, peace, and good humor in his last days, and spent loving time with his daughters, grandchildren, and many other friends and family members who visited and called.
Don was born on October 6, 1933, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He was the son of Blanche Carson and William Faragher. Don described his mother as his "guardian angel." During Don's youth, his mother worked at a movie theater for a time, and Don had the chance to see thousands of films. In Don's middle school years, his mother remarried and Don gained a kind stepfather, "Dinny" Redfield. Don graduated from Woodbury High School, then worked in the library at Temple University while taking classes there. He studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he met Anne Perry of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Their teacher advised Don and Anne to go to Maine to paint. They married in 1965, went to Mount Desert Island, built a home in Bar Harbor, and had three daughters, Emily, Sarah, and Kate. Don worked as an estate gardener, and Anne and Don founded a free school called Small Change. Although their marriage ended in the early 1970s, they remained understanding of each other.
Don moved to New York City, where he lived for over 35 years. He worked at Carnegie Hall, NBC News, and Blum & Weprin Associates. Don had an artist's eye and was a painter and street photographer in his younger life. Don loved his city and said, "The best thing about New York is a thousand new faces a day." He is remembered as an intellectual and reader, and revered art, literature, music, and film. He spent many hours with friends sitting in parks and coffee shops in New York City talking over the nuances. He was moved by works of the imagination, and reread Lewis Carroll's "Alice" books every year of his adult life. Don was known for completing The New York Times crossword puzzles neatly in ink. He took pride in the creations, careers, and families of his daughters, and found great meaning in connecting with his daughters and grandchildren. Don was a faithful correspondent with family and friends.
In 2012, Don's daughter Emily asked him to return to Maine to make a home closer to her, and he did. He settled in at a modest apartment in Brunswick, where he lived peacefully until the time of his death. Don's radio was always tuned to classical music stations. He spent significant time at the Curtis Memorial Library, researching directors, actors, composers, conductors, musicians, artists, and poets. Both in New York City and in Brunswick, Don was recognized as a memorable gentleman-about-town.
Don is survived by: his daughters, Emily Weir and her daughter Rose Edwards; Sarah Faragher and her husband Ryan King; and Kate Faragher Houghton, her husband Matthew Faragher Houghton and their sons Colby Houghton, Noah Faragher Houghton, and Arlo Faragher Houghton; Anne (Perry) Weir and her partner Thomas Godfrey, Jr.; four half-siblings, Robert Faragher, David Faragher, Steve Faragher, and Judy Scull, and their families; two special cousins, Jean Roll and Mary Lynn Carson, and their families; and his many friends.
Don's family extends gratitude to the stellar staff of Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick, particularly the ICU Nursing Staff.
Donations in Don's name and memory may be made to Don's favorite senior center, The Caring Community, Greenwich House, Center on the Square, 20 Washington Square North, New York, NY, 10011, or to National Public Radio's "From the Top," 295 Huntington Ave., Suite 201, Boston, MA, 02115 or at fromthetop.org. Don, with his love of music and kids, enjoyed this program every Monday. From the Top empowers young classical musicians through scholarships.
A memorial service honoring Don's life will be held in the spring of 2016. To share memories, stories, or photographs online, please visit www.brackettfuneralhome.com.

Resumen: Blue Devils women's basketball coach Joanne Palombo-McCallie played high school basketball in Brunswick and coached at the University of Maine, while current Duke athletic director Kevin White once held the same post at UMaine -- there was little reason to believe young Zak Mills would find himself face to face with the key personalities of one of the nation's signature athletic programs.

Texto completo:   LAGRANGE, Maine -- Zak Mills probably could have provided any college sports fan all he or she needed to know about the Duke University men's basketball program long before his excellent adventure with the Blue Devils this month.
Given that Zak is just a 12-year-old seventh-grader at Penquis Valley Middle School in Milo, he's more likely best versed in the team's most recent successes -- such as its run to the 2015 NCAA Division I national championship.
But while Duke was reveling in March Madness last spring, Zak was undergoing treatments after doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in the radius near his right wrist late last year.
No doubt the Blue Devils' success helped one of their biggest young supporters cope with the chemotherapy sessions that led up to surgery, but the chance for Zak -- now back at school and playing on his middle-school basketball team -- to fully savor his team's good fortunes didn't come until just this month.
For most fans who adopt Duke or another major-college power as their favorite sports team, it's a long-distance relationship founded in televised perspectives of the players and coaches.
And while there are some connections between the Duke athletic department and the state of Maine -- Blue Devils women's basketball coach Joanne Palombo-McCallie played high school basketball in Brunswick and coached at the University of Maine, while current Duke athletic director Kevin White once held the same post at UMaine -- there was little reason to believe young Zak Mills would find himself face to face with the key personalities of one of the nation's signature athletic programs.
But from Zak's medical challenges came a rare opportunity as he and his parents, Andrea and Jason Mills, traveled to the Duke campus in Durham, North Carolina, to watch the Blue Devils play the University of Buffalo -- an early Christmas present of sorts arranged by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Duke won 82-59, but that was merely one aspect of a memorable weekend that began with a limousine ride to Bangor International Airport and went on to include campus tours and a chance meeting with NBA Hall of Famer David Robinson -- whose son is a walk-on with the Duke basketball team -- even before game time.
Duke's home court at Cameron Indoor Stadium is one of the more unique venues for a major college basketball program. The venerable facility, which opened in 1940 at a construction cost of $400,000, has a capacity of 9,314 fans -- quite modest by today's major Division I standards.
Every seat was filled that night, with the Mills family situated two rows behind the scorer's table. Among those sitting nearby was former Duke All-American Nolan Smith, with whom Zak shared a brief chat.
Duke led by 10 at halftime and pulled away to victory behind Zak Mills' favorite Blue Devil, sophomore guard Greyson Allen, who scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.
"The game was great," said Jason Mills. "Great crowd, like a high school gym with everyone packed on top of each other. The atmosphere and crowd were incredible."
Zak was given an official stat sheet at intermission and with his parents was escorted to the postgame press conference by Debbie Savarino -- a Duke representative who turned out to be the daughter of legendary Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski.
That connection was good not only for a front-row seat at the press conference, but a handshake and a few words with Coach K and the opportunity to pose the first question.
Zak thought quickly in front of the gathered media from around the country and asked Krzyzewski if Allen had grabbed a career high in rebounds during the game.
Krzyzewski's response was that Zak's query was, "a great question, and why don't the rest of you ask questions like that?!"
And while Coach K wasn't immediately sure of the answer, it turned out Zak knew exactly what he was talking about and that Allen indeed had established a career high on the boards that night.
Once the press conference ended, Savarino took the Mills family into the back hallway where Zak met all the players as well as Krzyzewski again, with all of them signing a Duke basketball for him. He also had his picture taken individually with all the players as well as with Coach K, then toured the team's training room and locker room facilities to cap off a busy night.
Zak and his parents visited the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill the next day and that night went to an NHL game featuring the Carolina Hurricanes in Raleigh, where a referee came over during the contest and presented Zak a game puck.
The Mills family returned to Bangor the next day and were greeted by Make-A-Wish staff person Lisa Fox and employees from Bangor Savings Bank who helped sponsor the trip and were armed with a few more Duke-related gifts for Zak.
A limousine then took the family back home.
Zak Mills is scheduled for his next three-month checkup in January, and while the family undoubtedly would trade the visit to Duke for uninterrupted good health, they are grateful for all the community support they have received since Zak's initial diagnosis and appreciative for the chance to live out one of their son's sporting dreams.
"It was the trip of a lifetime," said Jason Mills.

Texto completo:   In BDN Maine's recent project on ways to grow the economy,we identified education as one of the top-three drivers of economic growth and an area where Maine can greatly improve -- specifically by getting more low-income students through some type of college.
For the high school graduating class of 2008, just 40 percent of lower-income students graduated from a four-year college in six years, compared with 60 percent of students from higher-income families, according to the Mitchell Institute, which conducts research on education topics in Maine.
Maine students who attend four-year collegesgraduate with an average of nearly $31,000 in debt, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. That's the sixth highest average in the nation. Sixty-eight percent of students graduate with some debt, according to the organization.
According to the Finance Authority of Maine, only 62 percent of high school seniors in the state had filled out aFree Application for Federal Student Aid by last May.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-23SMf5DyQ
The organization, which is holding sessions where financial aid expertshelp students fill out FAFSA forms, says that's a problem.
"Completing the FAFSA as early as possible is one of the best ways to minimize student loan borrowing," Martha Johnston, Director of Education at FAME, said in a news release. "Too often, students fail to complete the FAFSA or submit it after critical deadlines. These students miss out on potential grants and end up borrowing more than they would have needed to, if only they had filed the FAFSA on time. Significant financial aid does exist and the earlier families apply the more aid they may be able to receive."
FAME is holding 22 FAFSA help sessions next month. Here is the list showing where and when they are.

Texto completo:   SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- On Monday, the U.S. Postal Service's busiest delivery day, employees at the cavernous distribution center serving much of Maine don't get to see the packages delivered to doorsteps or the smiles of the recipients.
Neither does Shawn Patton, manager of the plant, but he said his employees know the importance of all the packages as they slip onto a conveyer belt and out toward their destination.
"It's almost like Santa's workshop," Patton said inside the U.S. Postal Service's processing and distribution center in Scarborough. "These are the elves of the postal service."
This year, that workshop is busier than past years during the crucial season for the federal mail system that has continued to face financial challenges, amassing about $54.5 billion in net losses since 2007, according to its latest financial statement.
Nationally, the postal service expected Monday to break its one-day record for total mail handled, with the number of packages delivered during the holiday season on track to increase by a higher than expected 15 percent.
That comes as first-class mail during the rest of the year failed to meet targets for its 2015 fiscal year, ending Sept. 30.
The Postal Service hasn't revealed exact state-level or regional traffic totals for the holidays, but Patton said the number of packages handled locally is set for a similar increase, driven primarily by increases in online shopping.
John Budzynski, national consumer advocate for the USPS, said that trend cuts across most communities.
"We've seen double-digit increases in package volumes and in rural, suburban and urban areas as people take advantage of having packages shipped straight to the home," he said.
The Postal Service expected to deliver about 600 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve, a 10 percent increase compared with last year. As of Monday morning, Budzynski said the latest projection puts that growth at closer to 15 percent.
And that's likely the trend across the state, based on increased package volumes out of Scarborough and at the post office in Machias, where postmaster Pat Nelson was waiting on a steady stream of customers Monday afternoon.
Nelson said this year has been the busiest in recent memory, particularly for packages, but also for its more traditional lines of business.
"I have sold all my Christmas stamps, and I didn't think that was possible," she said. "We always have extra. I guess we're back in the Christmas card business."
Patton said letter volumes have been down in Scarborough compared with last year but remain higher during the holiday season than the rest of the year.
The Postal Service has dealt with the increased volume of packages and holiday mail, in general, by continuing to deliver mail Sunday, between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, for the second year in a row.
"We're averaging more than 5 million [packages] on those Sundays alone," Budzynski said. "It's a way to make sure that we stay fluid and it's been a successful plan."
Patton said the addition of Sunday delivery has helped smooth a bottleneck that letter carriers faced on Monday mornings during the holidays, when mail to be delivered was about double the normal volume. He added many more people are home to receive packages on Sundays, as well.
While Monday was the busiest day for deliveries, the postal service still has late delivery options that will keep operations churning through to the Christmas holiday.
Budzynski said packages sent priority mail express by Dec. 23 should arrive by Christmas Day. For all holiday shippers, he offered two tips: Make sure to adequately pad packages with packing peanuts or other cushioning material to prevent damage and place a second address label inside of the box, as deliveries can be delayed or diverted if there's any damage to the outer label.
Customers can also sign up at usps.com for real-time notifications about their package's travel.
Those late shipments will keep post offices including Nelson's churning through holiday deliveries this week. Nelson said letter carriers out of Machias will keep working through Christmas Eve, which could mean delivering later than the office's closing time of 2 p.m. Thursday.
In Scarborough, at the 500-employee distribution center, the season for overtime pay will continue through the holiday, with some employees working on Christmas Day in preparation for regular delivery Saturday.
"We're tired, but we love it because we know this is our bread and butter," Patton said.

Texto completo:   BRUNSWICK, Maine -- The Maine Army National Guard's commitment to environmental stewardship was recognized as the best in nation by the National Guard Bureau's 2015 Environmental Stewardship Award competition.
Lt. Gen. Timothy Kadavy, director of the Army National Guard, and Brig. Gen. Gerard Bolduc, acting Adjutant General of the Maine National Guard, were able to present the award to the Maine Army National Guard's environmental and training site staff at the Brunswick Readiness Center in front of a large audience.
All National Guard facilities are regularly evaluated for compliance with state and federal land use, waste, water quality and air quality regulations by an independent auditor. The Environmental Stewardship Award competition ranks the 54 state and territorial National Guards on the basis of their overall environmental program compliance.
"This award speaks to the outstanding commitment of the Maine National Guard family that works tirelessly to be good stewards of Maine's pristine environment," said Bolduc. Maine has received national environmental awards in the past, as recently as 2013, however this is the first Best in Nation level award.
This singular annual award is presented to the State or territory that is determined to have the best National Guard environmental program overall.
Col. Dwaine E. Drummond, Director of Facilities and Engineering for the Maine Army National Guard, credits their success to the overall efforts of the entire organization and to the excellent communication between the Maine Guard, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, National Guard Bureau, Army Corps of Engineers and other regulatory agencies.
"Our partners are many and equally dedicated to improving our soldiers' readiness posture, while sustaining our environment," said Drummond. "Our program is only successful when our soldiers, civilian employees, and contractors aspire for the same goals we do. The efforts by our soldiers in the field, in the maintenance shops, and in the readiness centers makes all of the difference in our program."
The award was won during a period of limited resources and increased requirements, Drummond said. "We had two major military construction projects under construction, one in design, and one in the planning phase. Each of these projects has unique environmental considerations that take considerable time and effort to ensure we comply with our permits, minimize our footprint, and investigate all potential impacts," said Drummond.
As a result of the budget setbacks, the MEARNG environmental team was also challenged to complete a lot of in-house plans and assessments that were previously contracted to highly specialized consultants.
Andrew Flint, the environmental program manager for MEARNG, said "completing projects in house with our qualified staff not only resulted in cost savings, it gives us flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing operational environment." "Rigorous self-examination is a key part of our continual improvement over the years." Flint said. "Our annual internal, and tri-annual external compliance audits examine the entire range of potential environmental issues, [and] we are not afraid to seek unique solutions."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- Catherine Gordon has taught math at Bangor High School for 30 years. Nearly every year, she has put a Christmas tree in her classroom, and no student, no parent and no administrator told her it was inappropriate, she said, until Friday.
That's when she received an email from Principal Paul Butler telling her she had to remove the 32-inch-tall, artificial pink tree, decorated with Hello Kitty ornaments, from her classroom.
"It had no religious symbols on it, no crosses, no angels, no stars, just pink Hello Kittys," Gordon said Monday afternoon, referring to the well-known Japanese cartoon character. "And, in the 30 years that I've decorated for the holidays, I've had not one parent contact me, not one parent phone call, not one parent email. Not one child has come up to me and said they thought it was inappropriate and students at this age are very vocal."
The veteran teacher also said that she received no notice that there had been a change in policy about holiday decorations in classrooms.
"Since my tree has been up for years and years, I thought it was fine to put up a tree up for the 30th year," Gordon said. "The email said that he thought it favored one religion over another and he thought it was inappropriate."
Attempts on Monday to reach Butler for comment on school policy regarding the situation were unsuccessful.
Gordon said she put the tree up Wednesday and was told to take it down Friday.
"I've been very sad about this whole issue," Gordon said Monday. "I'm not an activist, I'm not even overly religious. I just thought it was a pink, fun tree and my students really enjoyed it.
"They were sad when they came to class today and saw it was gone," she said. "They said, 'Where's our tree? Not 'Where's your tree?'"
Because Gordon had posted a picture of the tree in her classroom on her Facebook page after she assembled it last week, she said she felt obligated to share that she had to remove it.
In her post Friday night, Gordon commented on how the School Department's attitude toward observing Christmas has changed.
"When I first started teaching, we had parties the last day of school before vacation and the kids would bring in cookies and we played holiday music -- none of that is allowed now," she said. "I feel that this is definitely a turning point in our society -- when everything offends everyone all the time -- it just sucks the joy out of everything."
Reaction to Gordon's social media post about the situation was widespread.
The teacher's Facebook post had been shared more than 400 times by Monday evening, garnered more than 100 comments and captured the attention of the media in and out of state. She was scheduled to do three phone interviews Tuesday morning with talk radio hosts in Bangor, Portland and Lewiston.
"When I got out of class and turned on my phone, I had 77 messages," she said.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, on Monday afternoon criticized the principal's directive to Gordon.
"Displaying a decorative Christmas tree is a longstanding tradition in our country," he said in a news release. "It should not be condemned, especially in our classrooms.
"Our local school teachers and parents should have the ultimate say in how to run their classrooms so long as it does not pose any danger to students or the community," the congressman continued. "I find the school department's decision baseless and completely counter to all that our nation stands for."
Bangor School Superintendent Betsy Webb issued a statement Monday in response to media requests for an explanation of why Gordon was told to remove the tree from her classroom:
"In alignment with national and state standards, the Bangor School Department educates students about culture, traditions and holidays through curriculum ties in English language arts, music, art, social studies and world languages," Webb said. "Our focus is educating students to become global citizens with the necessary 21st century skills for college and career readiness for their future success.
"Maintaining consistency with this approach has not been an issue for the Bangor School Department, as faculty and staff are committed to what is in the best interest of students and working towards our mission of academic excellence for all," Webb said.
Zachary Heiden with the Maine Civil Liberties Union of Maine declined to comment on Gordon's situation.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee has posted on its website a guide for administrators and teachers titled "Know Your Rights: Religion in Public Schools." It includes a section on holiday celebrations.
"The United States Supreme Court has determined that schools may celebrate the holidays and create displays as long as they so do within 'the context of the Christmas season' and the religious component of their display does not dominate but simply represents one element of a holiday that has obtained secular status in our society," it states. "Under [a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court] ruling, a Christmas tree would be appropriate, while a cross or a nativity scene would not. Crosses and nativity scenes are purely religious symbols that have not gained secular status in our society and therefore may not be displayed in public schools."
The city of Bangor each year displays a donated holiday tree in West Market Square.
Gordon said that she hopes the media attention will spark a dialogue about what is appropriate and what isn't during the holiday season.
"We have male faculty members wearing 'The Grinch That Stole Christmas' ties and we have female staff members wear holiday sweaters and that's OK that you can wear a tree on a tie or a sweater but not have one in your classroom? So, I think that a good dialogue will come from this and that's always a good thing if people can talk about an issue calmly. Maybe some good will come of this."

Texto completo:   Bill to ban talking on cellphones while driving axed
The Maine House of Representatives again rejected a bill Wednesday that would prohibit drivers from using handheld cellphones behind the wheel. As a result, the measure probably is dead for the year unless a sudden political shift takes place in the chamber.
The Maine Senate voted more than a month ago to pass the bill, which would expand Maine's current ban on texting while driving to include talking on a handheld cellphone. The penalty, as originally proposed, would have been a $250 fine for a first offense and $500 on subsequent offenses. But it was later amended by the Senate to lower the fines to $75 and $150, respectively.
The House rejected the measure a week later. Since then, the bill has bounced back and forth between the House and the Senate.
Another attempt Wednesday to pass the bill in the House failed on a 65-82 vote after considerable debate.
"You can't legislative common sense," said Rep. Richard Pickett, R-Dixfield. "We have a law that is already on the books right now for distracted driving. The law enforcement community, if we have to do something, has to do a better job of enforcing that."
But supporters of the bill, L.D. 185, cited studies showing the dangers of talking on a handheld cellphone while driving, including some research suggesting that the effects of the activity are on par with driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08, the legal threshold for impaired driving.
"We do, in fact, legislate common sense in this building," said Rep. Gay Grant, D-Gardiner. "We have required people to wear seat belts. We have required people to do a lot of things with regard to driving because they are life-saving laws."

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers are considering a raft of ideas to pay for long-neglected road and bridge repairs, ranging from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles.
The problem, which Maine shares with the rest of the country, is that modern fuel-efficient vehicles - especially electric and hybrid cars - are using less gas and driving down revenue from the gas tax. And that decline is contributing to crumbling rural roads in Maine, which was rated Tuesday among the 10 states that have the worst bridges and rural roads in the country.
On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee weighed funding alternatives that include repealing the state's gas tax and replacing it with a flat road tax, surcharges on electric and hybrid vehicles, and a seasonal gas tax designed to extract more revenue from summer tourists.
Gov. Paul LePage also made note of the dilemma during a news conference held at the State House last week. The governor noted that fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles have produced a steady decline in gas tax collections.
"A lot of people are getting freebies," he said. "Do you go with a gas tax or do you go with a road tax? I don't know."
About 61 percent of Maine's Highway Fund is derived from the gas tax. Those collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen commensurate with the declining revenues. In the meantime, projects lined up in the state's capital improvement plan have languished as the transportation agency struggles to maintain the existing infrastructure.
The Legislature is expected to adopt a largely status quo transportation budget of $627 million for the next two years. The budget includes $73.2 million for improvements in highways and bridges, but none for the projects identified by the Maine Department of Transportation's capital plan.
Although LePage has applauded his agency's efforts to stretch limited dollars, independent surveys assessing Maine's road infrastructure continue to deliver bad news.
On Tuesday, the national research group TRIP released a report that described Maine's bridges and rural roads as among the worst in the nation. TRIP, which promotes policies that reduce traffic congestion, said 26 percent of Maine's rural roads have pavement that is in poor condition, and that only seven other states have roads that are worse.
The report also found that 15 percent of the state's rural bridges are structurally deficient. Only eight other states have a higher percent of deficient bridges, according to the report.
Maine's standing in both categories is unchanged from a year ago.
Rural roads, highways and bridges are funded by a combination of local, state and federal governments. Federal funds for highway and transit improvements are largely generated through an 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.
According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommended increasing the federal funding from $88 billion to $120 billion. The association said the current backlog in projects totals $740 billion.
Political gridlock has erected daunting barriers to a long-term funding solution in Congress. Federal lawmakers have openly lamented the condition of the nation's transportation infrastructure, but little has been done to correct it. The current federal highway budget is due to expire at the end of the month, although the House passed a two-month extension Tuesday and the Senate is expected to vote on it later this week.
The federal gas tax has been the same since October 1993. Raising it is considered a political liability for lawmakers in both parties. Additionally, policymakers have been unable to coalesce behind alternative funding solutions.
The situation is not much different in Maine. Collections from the state's 30-cent gas tax have fallen with the increased prevalence of fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the state's revenue predicament is also partially self-inflicted.
In 2011, LePage signed the Republican-controlled Legislature's bill halting the state's indexing of the gas tax to adjust for inflation. Republicans reasoned that Maine's gas tax, currently third-highest in New England, was already too high.
Some Maine lawmakers are open to restoring the inflation indexing for the gas tax, but there are those who wonder if the primary funding mechanism for Maine's road and bridges is due for an overhaul.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is the lead sponsor of L.D. 1110. The proposal is a concept draft, meaning it doesn't recommend a specific funding mechanism for the Highway Fund. However, McLean told lawmakers on the Transportation Committee during an April 28 public hearing that "the way we fund our transportation projects is at a crossroads." He noted that according to a briefing from Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, the money collected from the gas tax can fund the engineering and design of road and bridge projects, but not actual construction.
"Think about it," McLean said. "Unless we come up with a bond or some other manipulation of Highway Fund dollars, we don't have a penny to spend on a road or a bridge. Nothing. Imagine what will happen to the (MDOT) work plan if we don't have any money to build a bridge or road."
For now, state lawmakers have been unable to overcome their ambivalence. On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Transportation Committee moved to carry over McLean's bill to next year. They unanimously voted to accept a different bill, L.D. 706, which creates a commission to study how the state should fund its transportation infrastructure.
McLean remained hopeful the commission would develop a strategy that's "economically and politically feasible."
"There are a lot of solutions out there," he said, adding that a lack of political courage in Washington, D.C., had forced states to act.
LePage, meanwhile, has resorted to proposing state borrowing projects to fund the transportation infrastructure. He has asked state lawmakers to approve L.D. 1415, a $175 million bond measure that would need the approval of voters if it clears the Legislature.

More homeless shelter funds get first OK from Maine lawmakers

Resumen: Currently, they argue, the facilities lean on a patchwork of funding and private donations to serve clients who are often suffering from mental illness or substance abuse or fleeing domestic violence. According to a budget report by the state housing authority, a quasi-public agency, emergency homeless shelters received $500,000 in state funding beginning in 1988.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- A bill designed to increase state funding to Maine homeless shelters received approval from a legislative committee Tuesday.
The proposal, L.D. 443, is sponsored by Sen. Justin Alfond, D-Portland, and backed by many of the operators running 42 shelters statewide. The Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee supported the bill, 9-2, but not before making some changes to garner a bipartisan endorsement.
The original bill proposed providing $3.5 million in state funding to relieve financial pressure and, in some cases, prevent further closings of emergency shelters. However, the version of the bill approved by the committee Tuesday would provide $2 million in state funding.
During a March 17 public hearing, advocates for shelters noted that the state appropriated only $364,000 in direct funding. That includes two city-run shelters in Portland, where state budget changes are forcing the city to consider closing an overflow emergency shelter.
In addition to increased funding, the version of the bill approved by the committee Tuesday would create a new shelter for human trafficking victims. The issue has been a focus of Sen. Amy Volk, R-Scarborough, who co-chairs the labor committee and voted to support the bill on Tuesday.
The amendment also proposes to use funds from Maine's share of a $1.37 billion legal settlement against Standard & Poor's if the state's Department of Health and Human Services funding for the bill is inadequate.
The Maine piece of the Standard & Poor's settlement, $21.5 million, is one of many conflicts between Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, and Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat. LePage has submitted legislation that would wrest control of the settlement money from Mills, but it faces long odds in the divided Legislature.
It's unclear if the shelter funding proposal will win the backing of the governor, who rarely comments on legislation until the final version reaches his desk.
Nonetheless, advocates for L.D. 443 have said the bill is required to prevent shelter closings or reductions in services. Currently, they argue, the facilities lean on a patchwork of funding and private donations to serve clients who are often suffering from mental illness or substance abuse or fleeing domestic violence.
The legislation was submitted before the LePage administration began pressuring Portland to stop using General Assistance funding to reimburse stays at the two city-run homeless shelters. However, Alfond has said he hopes the debate over the state's initiative will illuminate the challenges faced by struggling shelters.
In March, he said the focus on Portland has highlighted that "General Assistance was never intended to fund shelters on a daily basis," but more importantly, that shelters are inadequately funded.
"No one chooses to be homeless," he said. "Our shelters serve as the last line of defense for the neediest among us. The purpose of this bill is to provide a dedicated and stable funding source to ensure that our most vulnerable Mainers have a safe place to sleep at night."
Annual point-in-time surveys conducted each January show the overall homeless population in Maine was 2,726 people in 2014, a decline from 3,016 people in 2013 and roughly equal to the 2,769 people in 2005. Those figures include people in emergency shelters, transitional housing and outdoors, with no shelter at all.
The emergency shelter population increased by 50 percent in the past decade, climbing from 731 in 2005 to 839 in 2009 and to 1,102 in 2014, according to HUD. The agency also found that Maine has one of the lowest percentages in the nation of people with no shelter at all, at 3.4 percent.
Mark Swann, executive director of Preble Street in Portland, said that on any given night the state's 42 shelters are housing roughly 1,000 Mainers. He told lawmakers during the public hearing that shelter operators were desperate for state funding assistance.
According to a budget report by the state housing authority, a quasi-public agency, emergency homeless shelters received $500,000 in state funding beginning in 1988. Budget cuts steadily reduced the subsidy to $364,000 last year. The housing authority also provides $2.8 million to the shelters through what's called the House Opportunities for Maine Fund, or HOME. However, that fund was originally created by the Legislature in 1983 to provide long-term affordable housing, not emergency shelters.
The funding struggle is particularly acute in Portland. A state audit in 1985 eventually led to a billing arrangement between the city and the state that allowed Portland to tap General Assistance funds to pay for shelter stays. At the time, Portland had one homeless shelter with 53 beds. But it became a destination for the state's mentally ill as the state began shrinking the size of its mental health facilities.
The agreement was a settlement to a political dispute that surfaced again in February.
In fiscal year 2014, the state paid for all but $28,000 of the $2.7 million it cost to run Portland's two shelters and overflow facilities, mostly through General Assistance. Steve Mistler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at: smistler@pressherald.com Twitter: stevemistler

Texto completo:   Early in his 33-year reign as the king of late-night TV, David Letterman did a recurring skit called "Brush with Greatness." Audience members would recount memorable celebrity encounters, like the flight service manager who said Barbra Streisand's dog threw up on him, or the podiatrist who gleefully recalled how he almost hit Jerry Lewis with his car.
But those anecdotes pale compared with the life-changing encounters that some Mainers have had with Letterman himself.
There are people in Bangor, for instance, who are still basking in the glory of Letterman's televised, headline-grabbing effort to get them to watch his show. Dan Cashman, of Brewer, became so fascinated with Letterman as a grade-schooler that he grew up to create, fund and host a statewide Letterman-style talk show. And nationally known Maine comedian Bob Marley counts his 1999 "Late Show with David Letterman" appearance as one of his big breaks, calling the laughs he got from Letterman "something I will never, ever forget."
Call these moments a "Brush with Daveness."
Letterman will host his last "Late Show" Wednesday on CBS, with his record as the longest-tenured late-night host in TV history secured (sorry, Johnny Carson). So while the entertainment writers continue to heap praise on Letterman for his wit and longevity, consider the Mainers who felt Letterman's full comedic power in a very personal way.
Here are their stories:
PLEASE, BANGOR, WATCH MY SHOW
Cary Weston was a sophomore at Bangor High School, sitting in class one morning in 1987, when a classmate came in and said that Letterman had called his home the night before.
"No one believed him, because none of us stayed up that late," said Weston, 42, a co-owner of the Sutherland Weston marketing agency in Bangor. "But it was true. And then it was all over the media. It kind of put Bangor on the map."
On his Sept. 29, 1987, show, Letterman started reading the recent TV ratings for his "Late Night with David Letterman" on NBC, and saw his very lowest ratings were in Bangor. The number was less than 1 percent of all viewers.
So he decided to court Bangor viewers over the next several episodes. On some shows, Letterman showed maps of Bangor, or pictures of lumber or moose. He read names out of the Bangor phone book (thinking people would tune in to hear their own names) and even called Bangor residents at random to find out why they didn't watch his show.
Newspapers and TV stations ran stories about the Bangor campaign. The New York Times even came to cover the story, quoting locals about how Bangor's streets rolled up at 9:30 p.m., or how Bangor residents were going to start taping Letterman's 12:30 a.m. shows and watch them sometime after sunrise.
Weston says Bangor folks did start watching Letterman after the campaign, and he and a whole generation became hooked on "Stupid Human Tricks" and Top Ten lists.
"Bangor wasn't known, or we didn't think it was known, so to see it in the national spotlight, and on the national TV news, because of Letterman, was pretty powerful," Weston said.
A FAN IS BORN DURING SLEEPOVER
Dan Cashman of Brewer was 9 years old and having a sleepover in his parents' basement when he and his friends decided to turn on the TV. His friends went back to roughhousing and joking while Cashman found himself transfixed by Letterman's gap-toothed grin and razor-sharp wit.
"I just stopped paying attention to whatever was being said and concentrated on this wildly weird show," said Cashman, 37, who runs Cashman Communications, a public relations firm. "I decided pretty soon after, that's what I wanted to do."
As a middle schooler, he sat behind a desk at home and pretended to interview people. While a freshman at the University of Maine, he convinced Bangor TV station WBGR to run the first version of his current statewide show, "The Nite Show with Danny Cashman." After college, Cashman got married, had a child and started his business. But his dream of hosting his own Letterman-style show would not die.
About five years ago he resurrected "The Nite Show." He hosts, books guests, writes jokes, sells ads and negotiates deals with local stations. Now "The Nite Show" is seen Saturday nights on commercial stations in all three of Maine's TV markets: Portland, Bangor and Presque Isle. Guests have included Maine celebrities and politicians, and a few nationally known folks as well.
Cashman's persona on the show is somewhat reserved, sometimes goofy, sometimes dry and witty.
"His (Letterman's) influence is everywhere on our show. I try not to emulate him, but it's hard," Cashman said.
'HE'S UP THERE RIGHT NOW, MARCIA'
Bob Marley was just eight years into his stand-up comedy career when he auditioned for Letterman's "Late Show" in 1999. The day before his appearance, he stayed at a hotel across the street from the Ed Sullivan Theater and spent the night staring at Letterman's name blaring at him in neon. He had never been on a network late show.
Marley's first joke was about how a "very friendly" girl on a Manhattan street corner offered to spank him for $20, causing Marley to call his mother in Maine and say "Ma, you could make a lot of money down here."
"I heard the laugh (from the crowd), and I heard Dave laughing behind me, which is something I will never, ever forget," said Marley, 48, of Falmouth. "I'm waiting for the applause (to stop) and I can hear my parents in the front row, arguing, 'He's up there right now, Marcia, if you'd just shut it.' 'Why don't you put a sock in your pie hole, Bob.'"
Marley said he was mortified for a moment that his parents would "derail" his five-minute spot. But no one other than Marley apparently heard them, and he continued with his act.
Since then, Marley has been on many of the big-name late shows, including ones hosted by Jay Leno, Jimmy Fallon and Craig Ferguson.
But he says the experience of going on Letterman's show was unlike all others.
"At the end when (Letterman) shook my hand, I just stood there and stared at him, I was so star-struck," Marley said. "It was like was I just watching him and didn't know I was actually on the show. It was surreal." Ray Routhier can be contacted at 791-6454 or at: rrouthier@pressherald.com Twitter: RayRouthier

Texto completo:   Maine's trees can be used to make much more than paper, a fact that offers a potentially bright future for Maine's forest products industry if the right pieces fall into place.
That was the message Tuesday morning at an event in Portland hosted by E2Tech, an organization that supports Maine's environmental, energy and clean technology sectors.
The event also served as an introduction to Biobased Maine, a reimagined organization supporting efforts to encourage research and development in new technologies that enable manufacturers to turn Maine's most abundant natural resource - trees - into biobased fuels, chemicals and advanced materials. The organization was formerly known as the Sustainable Bioplastics Council of Maine, but the name was changed in January to reflect much wider potential beyond just bioplastics, according to Charlotte Mace, who was hired last September to reboot the organization. She is the organization's first full-time executive director.
Developing technologies can extract high-value biobased chemicals, fuels and materials from wood pulp, which can then be used in clothing, coatings, adhesives, industrial chemicals and structural components, according to Mace.
"There are a lot of everyday products that involve biobased materials," Mace said. "Virtually anything we make out of crude oil and natural gas can be made out of plants."
Biobased Maine says global demand for biofuels is projected to increase from $82.7 billion in 2011 to $185.3 billion by 2021. The biobased product markets are already significant in the United States - representing more than 2.2 percent of gross domestic product, or more than $353 billion in economic activity in 2012, according to a recent report from the National Research Council.
Cellulose, one of the core materials extracted from wood pulp, is "the oil of Maine," said Tony Jabar, CEO of Cerealus, a Waterville-based company that is developing new products and processes for the forest products industry. Maine has 17 million acres of forests.
"We have a natural resource here that we can, with innovation, turn into a high-value industry in the state of Maine," Jabar said Tuesday morning.
Three factors are driving renewed interest in biobased materials, according to Mike Bilodeau, director of the University of Maine's Process Development Center: new technologies that have lowered the cost of the manufacturing processes; novel applications for the materials; and shifting national priorities that have made available more federal funding.
Bilodeau said the research and development going on at his center will help paper mills diversify and find new products to help them remain relevant. A paper mill in Turner Falls, Massachusetts, recently began using technology developed at UMaine to make higher-quality paper, Bilodeau said.
Maine's forest products industry has for a century been dominated by making paper, but that industry doesn't have the economic impact it once did. Paper mills in East Millinocket and Bucksport have closed within the last year and a half, while others in Lincoln and Rumford have made layoffs.
"Over the years, investments have been made in trying to save jobs (in the paper industry) - for good reason, ... but the bottom line is that market is going away and we need to find something to replace it," Jabar said.
Mace added urgency to the issue. "We need to re-engineer our economy," she said. "We can't jump off the cliff still making paper or we're going to see Maine continue to decline."
The extraction of biobased materials from wood pulp offers the best chance to revitalize those areas of the state that historically depended on the paper industry, Mace said.
"Biobased manufacturing is the only economic development strategy that does everything we need," Mace said. "It uses our natural resource in a sustainable way, it creates high-paying manufacturing jobs, it responds to global demand (for these biobased materials) and it reduces our reliance on volatile crude oil."

What will Maine look like in 2030?

Texto completo:   Researchers can't foretell the future completely, but they can project realistic population scenarios based on historical trends. That's what the Urban Institute has done with its "Mapping Americas Futures" project.
For decades, Maine's birth rate has been declining, and the death rate has been increasing. Recently, the two lines on the graph overlapped. There are now slightly more deaths than births.
Average
So it makes sense that the Urban Institute's population mapping tool projects more of the same for Maine. If birth, death and migration rates -- all drivers of population change -- remain average between 2010 and 2030, it shows that Maine's population, as it continues to age, will decline 0.21 percent. (It projects the population over age 65 will increase 78 percent.) Here's agraphic showing that trend: Meanwhile, the areas around Presque Isle and Calais would see a population decline of more than 11 percent, as more people leave for southern sections or die.
Higher
But what if all things don't stay the same? What if Maine attracts more people to the state who, in turn, start families and have more children? Even with a realistically higher birth rate, higher migration rate and lower death rate, the regions around Presque Isle and Calais would still see a decline in population between 2010 and 2030. The Urban Institute estimates it would be around 5 percent.
But the Bangor and Portland areas could see a great benefit. Each region -- which is broken up by commuting zone -- could see as much as 13-percent growth with a lower death rate and higher rates of birth and migration.
Lower
What about the worst-case scenario -- a lower birth rate, lower migration rate and higher death rate than average? If that were to happen, the Bangor and Portland areas could see as much as 10-percent declines in population by 2030. And Presque Isle and Calais could see as much as 18-percent population declines in that time.
The point
Demographics can be destiny if states let them be destiny. But federal, state and local policies lend some control over the outcome. It's highly unlikely that regions in Maine will see the 40- or 70-percent population increases that regions in other states may see. But continued population decline isn't inevitable.

Maine regulators won't reconsider Efficiency Maine 'and' case

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- State regulators won't revisit their reading of a sentence that cut possible funding for an energy efficiency program in half, leaving the issue to the Legislature to clarify.
The Natural Resources Council of Maine, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Maine Association of Building Efficiency Professionals together asked the Maine Public Utilities Commission to reconsider its 2-1 vote in March on the case. Maine Public Advocate Tim Schneider filed a separate reconsideration request.
Both requests argued that PUC Chairman Mark Vannoy and Commissioner Carlisle McLean should have considered what they called the clear intent lawmakers had for energy efficiency funding when they passed the 2013 Omnibus Energy Act.
The PUC had two choices in the case: deciding to set an annual funding cap of about $23 million or $59 million for the Efficiency Maine Trust, which subsidizes energy savings projects at businesses and homes.
Lawmakers approved the wide-ranging energy bill expecting the higher cap, but they approved a final version of the massive bill that included a clerical error, removing an "and" that Vannoy and McLean said could only result in the lower cap.
The PUC still has additional oversight of Efficiency Maine's spending plan within that total cap.
Michael Stoddard, Efficiency Maine's executive director, said the lower cap stands to limit the agency's heating efficiency programs in coming years as it expects demand for electricity efficiency projects to rise. State law requires the trust to first make investments for electricity savings that are cheaper than buying the amount of electricity those investments avert.
Vannoy and McLean reiterated their initial decision Wednesday, arguing that the reconsideration requests did not present any new information and can wait for resolution in the Legislature.
"I gave pause to the commission taking this up prior to Legislature taking action," McLean said.
The cap will affect funding for the Efficiency Maine Trust when it submits a three-year budget this fall, outlining spending starting in July 2017. The PUC recently approved an $18.5 million payment from the state's electric utilities to the Efficiency Maine Trust for 2016
In his last vote as a PUC commissioner, David Littell, who was appointed six years ago by then-Gov. John Baldacci but not reappointed by Gov. Paul LePage, reiterated his dissent, arguing that the lower funding cap is out of line with the Legislature's broader intent to increase efficiency funding and hand authority over the process to the PUC.
Opponents have until mid-June to appeal the PUC's decision against reconsidering the case to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.

"While I eagerly anticipated being part of USM's resurgence, the tremendous sense of obligation I have to Stockton University means I must forgo the opportunity to lead the University of Southern Maine," Kesselman wrote in a statement issued to the USM community Wednesday morning.
He officially had been scheduled to take over the USM presidency July 1, 2015.
Glenn Cummings, interim president of the University of Maine at Augusta who was a finalist for the USM post, will take Kesselman's place that same date. System officials announced the leadership change during a Wednesday morning news conference on the USM campus.
Cummings, a Portland resident and former Speaker of the Maine House, said the university needs to work to reverse trends of declining enrollment and figure out why it's losing students to other schools in the region, despite the system's commitment to hold tuition flat for four straight years.
Cummings and Kesselman were finalists in an eight-month national search process that drew 80 applicants from across the country, which ended in March with Kesselman's selection.
Kesselman will continue serving as acting president of Stockton University, a post he has held since April, when he took over for President Herman Saatkamp, who resigned citing medical reasons.
Shortly after the resignation, the Stockton faculty nevertheless took a no-confidence vote against Saatkamp, according to the publication Press of Atlantic City. There was unrest and legal controversy surrounding plans to use a former casino, purchased for $18 million by the school in December, as an island campus and private hotel.
A conflict with the Trump Taj Mahal also has been holding up the plans for the casino redevelopment project, according to local media.
Earlier this week, Madeleine Deininger, chairwoman of the Stockton University board, wrote to UMS Chancellor James Page, asking Kesselman be allowed to withdraw from his contract with UMS, citing the problems at Stockton and the need for an experienced leader. Page granted the request, according to the system.
"Harvey Kesselman's long, capable service and dedication to Stockton University were among the qualities that made him such an appealing choice to join our leadership team in Maine," Page said in a statement issued Wednesday. "While we sincerely enjoyed getting to know Dr. Kesselman and looked forward to working together, we respect his decision and admire his devotion to Stockton."
During interviews after his selection, Kesselman told reporters "[Maine] is my home now. I made a commitment here, and this is the place I belong now."
The sudden change in leadership plans comes at a vital time for the University of Southern Maine. Facing a $16 million budget gap, the university cut 51 faculty positions and five academic programs in the past year. The controversial actions taken during that period drew the ire of several faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, which recently issued a report criticizing the steps the university took to close the gap and denying that serious financial problems exist at the system level.
Outgoing President David Flanagan was brought on board in July 2014, charged with stopping USM's fiscal decline and presenting a viable budget. He accomplished both goals, according to Page.
"It's been challenging and it has been difficult, but it was the right thing to do," Flanagan said during the news conference. "I believe we have set the stage for a vibrant, successful future for USM."
"Like a Maine spring, USM is slowly and beautifully emerging from a dark winter," Cummings, a 15-year professor of economics and education at the school, said Wednesday.
"Glenn has a firsthand appreciation for the needs of our students and the workings of this institution," Page said. "Just as important are the first-name relationships Glenn has with many of our dedicated faculty and staff."
Page said Cummings will need to build on the "financial stability achieved under President Flanagan to move the campus and the entire community forward."
Cummings said he anticipates more difficult decisions ahead, but he stressed changes would need to be made in the interest of the university's "common welfare" as it strives to right itself and work toward becoming a metropolitan university. A vital next step will be reversing the trend of declining enrollment at USM, which is projected to continue into the fall semester in spite of increased marketing investments.
Several community leaders and faculty members spoke during Wednesday's announcement, lauding the hiring of Cummings.
Thomas Parchman, a music professor and chairman of the faculty senate, said Cummings would have a strong understanding of the issues and concerns faculty face, as well as a deep understanding of the university itself.
"I look forward to an open and honest relationship with him," Parchman said.
Numerous lawmakers, including House Republican Leader Ken Fredette, House Speaker Mark Eves, Senate President Mike Thibodeau, Senate Democratic Leader Justin Alfond, and U.S. Sen. Angus King, issued statements Wednesday congratulating Cummings on his appointment.
The search for the University of Maine at Augusta's next president already is underway, according to system officials. The final decision is expected in November. Page expects to appoint an interim UMA president in late June before Cummings transitions to USM.
"To [Kesselman's] credit, his heart was in New Jersey," Cummings said Wednesday. "Mine will always be in Maine."

Texto completo:   America East Baseball Championship
No. 3 MAINE vs. No. 2 MARYLAND BALTIMORE COUNTY
Time, site: Thursday, 5 p.m., LeLacheur Park, Lowell, Massachusetts
Records: Maine 24-26, UMBC 32-18
Series, last meeting: Maine leads 40-9, UMBC 6-3 on 4/26/15
Key players: Maine -- 3B Luke Morrill (.357, 2 home runs, 28 runs batted in), CF Sam Balzano (.316, 19 RBI, 8 stolen bases), 2B Brett Chappell (.321, 2 HR, 36 RBI), LF Scott Heath (.301, 6 HR, 29 RBI), 1B Brenden Geary (.283, 3 HR, 19 RBI); UMBC -- 2B Vince Corbi (.305, 1 HR, 35 RBI, 13 SB), CF Andrew Casali (.303, 2 HR, 37 RBI, 11 SB), 1B Anthony Gatto (.297, 4 HR, 22 RBI, 28 RBI), C Hunter Dolshun (.298, 1 HR, 28 RBI)
Pitching matchups: Maine -- RH Justin Courtney (5-5, 2.83 earned run average, 37 strikeouts); UMBC -- RH Matt Chanin (5-2, 1.85, 38 K)
Game notes: The Black Bears are hoping to ride a strong stretch run to an America East title. UMaine won nine of its last 13 contests to gain the No. 3 seed in the four-team, double-elimination tournament. The Bears encounter the upstart Retrievers, who claimed the No. 2 seed. UMBC has won 16 of its last 19 games. A key dynamic in this one will be the ability of UMaine pitchers to keep the speedy Retrievers off the bases and for strong-armed catcher Jon Salcedo to gun them down if they do reach safely. UMBC ranks second in pitching in AE games with a 3.56 team ERA. The Retrievers are third in batting at .280. UMaine is last in the league in batting (.249) and fielding (.959) and LeLacheur's natural surface isn't likely to help that dynamic. The Bears' pitching staff ranked third at 3.82. UMBC took two of three in the regular-season series at Baltimore.

Texto completo:   Black flies getting you down? Sick of the pollen that's making your allergies act up? Well, things could be worse: You could have bears in your bacon. Earlier this week I was reminded of the fact that our state's bear population has emerged from dens, and are looking for some chow. A reader wrote to tell me of her family's bear problem -- it seems a bruin she calls "Bruno" has figured out that there's often good food in the freezer in the garage. So far, Bruno has stolen a ham, some apple slices and a bunch of bacon. So here's the message for the day: Don't waste bacon on bears! It's far too tasty! But seriously, it is time to think about moving your bird feeders and other bear attractants inside, away from hungry bears. Remember: Bruno is watching. And sniffing. It's up to you to discourage him from stopping by for a visit.
-- John Holyoke
Got fish? You will soon: Maine's spring stocking effort underway
Brianna Pelkie was only trying to help, but the bucketful of frisky landlocked salmon didn't see it that way.
"Thanks for giving me a bath, fish," the fisheries technician for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said as she lifted her five-gallon pail and received a tail-flapping, water-flinging greeting from the fish it held.
One fish got exactly what it sought for a moment: Freedom.
Legislature overrides LePage's veto on moose permit transfers
The Maine Legislature on Tuesday unanimously voted in both the House and the Senate to override Gov. Paul LePage's veto of a bill that will allow the transfer of a moose permit to a hunter's family member in certain circumstances.

Act Out with Aislinn: 1-minute paddle: Jones Pond in Gouldsboro
Join Aislinn and Derek on a paddle of the 467-acre Jones Pond, where they run into a "turtle party," a pair of loons and a nesting goose, among other things.
Out There: Presque Isle bear raids freezer, gobbles bacon, apples
"There was a pile of garbage under a pine tree by our deck that turned out to be five packages of bacon and a three-pound bag of Easter ham, all torn apart and eaten. We decided that 'Bruno' was back at it, or [nighttime freezer raids] ran in the family and it was one of his kids."
An editorial comment: In addition to a powerful snout, the bear has good taste. Bacon? Ham? Sign me up!
On the horizon
Coming up, BDN reporter Aislinn Sarnacki will be writing about the programs Maine Winter Sports Center is offering this summer in an effort to boost outdoor sports throughout the state. She also plans to write about her recent move from a bustling city to the woods, and all the challenges and joys that have come with it.
BDN Outdoor editor John Holyoke plans to tell some tales from turkey hunting season, which will be over before you know it. And he's been visiting the nearby rivers a lot lately, so it's possible he'll have a few fishing tales as well.

Texto completo:   Difficulty: Easy. Jones Pond is quiet water -- calm and without strong currents or rapids. However, the surface can become choppy if the wind picks up. Also, the pond is open to motorboats, which can create wakes that certainly will rock your boat.
How to get there: Boat access and parking is available at Jones Pond Recreation Area in Gouldsboro. From Ellsworth, drive east on Route 1 to West Gouldsboro. Turn right onto Route 195 and drive about 0.4 mile, then turn right onto Recreation Road. Drive another 0.3 mile to the parking area.
Information: Filled with lilypads, turtles and brown trout, Jones Pond covers 467 acres in the coastal town of Gouldsboro. Many cabins and homes line its shore, but the pond's undeveloped areas are home to a variety of wildlife, including beaver and nesting loons.
Jones Pond is a popular place for recreationists. Dotted with small islands, the freshwater pond is easily accessible from a public boat launch at Jones Pond Recreation Area, which includes Co Bradley Memorial Park. The recreation area is maintained by the town and features picnic tables, a playground, restrooms and a small beach and swim area.
Starting at the boat launch, which is located on the northeastern shore of the pond, it is a little more than 1 mile to paddle to the southernmost point of the pond if paddling in a straight line. However, the majority of wildlife will be spotted along the shore, where songbirds dart through the thick sweetgale bushes and turtles loaf on logs and rocks. Also, a beaver lodge is located near the mouth of a stream in the southeast arm of the pond.
There are seven small islands scattered throughout the pond, according to a map in the second edition of "Quiet Water Maine: Canoe & Kayak Guide" by Alex Wilson and John Hayes. This useful resource includes information on 84 calm-water trips located throughout Maine, including driving directions, descriptions, maps and nature essays. I used this book to identify sweetgale as well.
Historically, this pond has been home to brown trout, smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, minnows, golden shiner, white sucker, hornpout, banded killifish, american eel and alewife, according to Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife surveys from 1952-1994.
Located close to the coast, the pond also is frequented by a variety of seabirds.
Access to the Jones Pond Recreation Area is free. Alcohol is not permitted. Dogs are permitted if on leash. Fires are permitted only in barbecue containers. And there is no lifeguard on duty; guardians are asked to watch their children while they swim.
For information about Jones Pond, call the Gouldsboro Town Office at 963-5589.
Personal note: After strapping two kayaks atop my Subaru, my fiance Derek and I drove to a little town called Gouldsboro on the coast of Maine for a paddling adventure Saturday, May 16. A white wall of clouds covered the sky, blocking out the sunshine, and a sprinkle of rain dotted the car windshield as we drove the 30 minutes or so to Jones Pond -- but you can't always wait for perfect weather to get outdoors.
Blackflies swarmed around us as we launched onto the pond from the public landing, so I sidled up to Derek's kayak to unearth the bug repellent from the hatch behind his seat. We sprayed our arms and neck with the spicy scent of 'Skeeter Skidaddler -- a Maine-made natural insect repellent I fell in love with a few years ago -- and weren't bothered much by the buggers from then on.
We started off paddling along the shore through lilypad gardens and grasses growing so thick that they nearly held my kayak captive. Soon into the adventure, we spotted an eastern painted turtle, a common critter in Maine ponds; but before I could get my camera out of a dry sack to take a photo, it slid off its log seat and into the water. For the next hour or so, we looked for turtles, paddling slowly along the shore. Along the way, we spotted two Canada geese, a cormorant, a few gulls and red-winged black birds. A variety of songbirds flitted about in the shrubs and trees lining the shore, as well.
Finally, near the mouth of a stream that empties into the pond on its southeast end, we came across two turtles sitting side by side on a log. I was photographing them when Derek shouted to get my attention and pointed to a bunch of bumps along the shore far ahead. He thought might be a whole group of turtles.
Looking through my 100-400mm camera lens, I could see he was right -- 10 turtles were lined up, almost evenly spaced, on an old log at the edge of the water. I've never seen so many turtles at once. They were all painted turtles, but Maine is home to two types of painted turtles -- the eastern painted turtle and midland painted turtle -- and they're very similar in appearance. So, I won't hazard to guess which kind they were.
Painted turtles are basking turtles, which simply means they spend a lot of time in the sun to warm themselves. While seeing 10 turtles together seemed unusual to me, it's actually not strange at all. Painted turtles often bask in groups. At one lake in Kikomun Creek Provincial Park in British Columbia, as many as 60 turtles have been seen basking on one log, according to a report by the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks.

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- A federal lawsuit brought by a Rockport man who claims a former business partner reneged on a deal that could have generated $33 million in profits by selling "sunglasses on steroids" will remain in Maine, a judge ruled Friday.
U.S. District Judge Jon Levy rejected a request by Kirk Kreutzig of Woodridge, Illinois to dismiss the federal case brought in Maine by John Galley. Kreutzig argued Maine was not the proper jurisdiction but rather should be heard in Illinois.
"In short, Kreutzig deliberately entered into a business relationship with Galley, a Maine resident, with the understanding that Galley would engage in marketing and promotional activities from his base in Maine," Levy ruled.
Also on Tuesday, Judge Levy gave Kreutzig until June 8 to file a response to the lawsuit filed in February by Galley. Galley had initially filed the lawsuit in Knox County Superior Court in Rockland but then it was refiled in federal court.
The Rockport man states in the lawsuit that he and Kreutzig have been close personal friends for more than 50 years and that he served as an adviser to Kreutzig's business for many years. The suit specifies that Kreutzig owns Spectrum Technologies International Ltd., which manufactures high-tech filters for eyewear, weapon sights, laptops and other military equipment.
Galley maintains that he had been in discussions with Kreutzig to market sunglasses using the technology.
The lawsuit indicates that Galley took courses to help market the product and discussed by email and telephone a business agreement in which Kreutzig would manufacture the sunglasses, Galley would market them and the two of them would split the profits evenly.
Galley said that based on the prior discussions and the 50-50 profit-sharing proposal, he attended further workshops and made financial investments. In September 2014, Kreutzig insisted on owning 100 percent of the new business, Galley's lawsuit alleges. A month later, however, Kreutzig disavowed all relationships with Galley and said he had no interest in the consumer eyeglass business, according to Galley's suit.

Is Bruce Poliquin the Energizer Bunny?

Texto completo:   Today, Roll Call devoted more than 1,000 words to a profile of Bruce Poliquin, the Republican representing Maine's 2nd District in Congress.
In the piece headlined "Why this vulnerable freshman is surprising people," writer Simone Path describes Poliquin as the Energizer Bunny:
"He may be new to the halls of Congress, but when the Energizer Bunny pauses, it's not for long.
"Ray-Bans shading his eyes, Maine Rep. Bruce Poliquin stood on his tip-toes after votes one recent afternoon to whisper in the ear of a guard outside the House chamber. The freshman needed directions.
"Seconds later, he scurried toward the elevators.
"For Republicans, the battery-powered bunny captures Poliquin's get-things-done energy; for Democrats, it conveys a nervous personality."
Path goes on to weigh the odds of Poliquin's re-election in 2016. The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report/Roll Call Race Ratings has labeled the race one of the country's few toss-ups.
Will Democratic former state Sen. Emily Cain best him this time?(After all, in November, he won with 45 percent of the vote; Cain got 40 percent in the three-way race that also included independent Blaine Richardson.)
Poliquin is certainly trying to prevent it. As Path writes:
"Even before posting near record-breaking fundraising numbers, Poliquin has emerged as a freshman who wants to be known.
"He canvasses the House floor to introduce himself to his Democratic colleagues, and he hasn't been shy about grabbing the ear of the president, first at the State of the Union address.
"'I purposefully positioned myself at the back of the room, nudged my way through the crowd and got his attention,' Poliquin told CQ Roll Call. 'And I held him there long enough,' he continued, to tell him about the threats to the district's paper mills. The first-term lawmaker said he made a similar move at the White House's freshman picnic.
"'I'm certain that he knows who represents Maine's 2nd District,' Poliquin said."

Long-term wind deal closer with preliminary nod from Maine regulators

Texto completo:   PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine utilities regulators want more out of a long-term agreement to buy power from a wind project in Somerset County, but are nearing a deal in the case that sparked controversy from wind industry advocates.
Maine Public Utilities Commissioners David Littell and Carlisle McLean agreed a deal was near with NextEra and ordered the PUC staff to continue negotiations, particularly over risk-sharing terms commissioners said were new to such a long-term contract.
The decision comes after renewed review of an extended 25-year contract term with NextEra for its 44-megawatt Highland Wind project in Somerset County. The initial terms called for NextEra to charge 4.7 cents per kilowatt-hour over 20 years.
SunEdison in May pulled its 73-megawatt Weaver Wind project in Somerset County from consideration in response to the commission's decision to reopen negotiations.
The vote by Littell and Carlisle on Wednesday sets the new contract on the path to approval, if the company complies with changes to still-confidential portions of the contract. With those changes to the contract terms still in flux as recently as Tuesday, McLean said her analysis leads her to believe the deal is heading toward approval.
The vote Wednesday directs PUC staff and NextEra to modify the terms and bring them for final consideration in a future vote. That vote would be limited to whether the terms align with the changes requested by Littell and McLean.
Those terms deal with the degree to which the utilities the PUC directs to enter the long-term deal or NextEra would bear risk associated with times where the regional grid operator directs the company not to generate power.
Commission Chairman Mark Vannoy split with Litell and McLean, arguing that the 25-year term would expose electricity ratepayers to risk of higher costs in the long run, with the belief that natural gas prices in New England will approach and reach those near the Marcellus Shale fields in Pennsylvania.
"I believe this is where restraint is the correct approach," Vannoy said.
The decision to reopen negotiations on the NextEra term sheet and another from developer SunEdison was one of McLean's first after her appointment by Gov. Paul LePage, raising allegations from Democrats and the wind industry that her vote had political motivations tied to LePage's dislike for wind power, which she denied during deliberations before that vote.
Outgoing commissioner Littell, appointed by former Democratic Gov. John Baldacci, has been a consistent supporter of wind power. Vannoy has generally opposed directing utilities to enter long-term contracts.
Vannoy and McLean said in February that the PUC should reconsider terms of the long-term wind contracts based on a sharp decline in natural gas and oil prices since its initial analysis of the two proposals.
Those analyses have also become a subject of dispute on the commission, with Vannoy and McLean voting down Littell's request to make its power pricing scenarios public.

Texto completo:   Common Core benefits
I was quite impressed by the May 15 BDN OpEd by middle school teacher Jennifer Dorman about the benefits of Common Core.
Those of us in the business community (I am the retired CEO of WBRC Architects/Engineers) have a vested interest in how teachers such as Dorman undertake their work. We recognize that the competence and commitment of our teachers is one of the key variables that combine to produce successful student outcomes.
It's through the dedication and hard work of these teachers that students learn what they need to move successfully from high school to either higher education or a job that has the chance to support them and their families.
The business community looks to public education to stimulate the knowledge and learning skills that will ultimately create effective employees. Therefore, we support the higher standards envisioned through the revised Maine Learning Results and we strongly back the goals of achieving those standards by expecting more from students in terms of reasoning, problem-solving and collaboration -- all skills valued in both the workplace and in a successful life.
It is important to hear a teacher endorse the aspirations behind enhancing our standards and expectations for our children, and to hear her make the case that we are on the right track and making progress.
There is no more important investment for us to make than to ensure that the generations behind us have the skills, perspective and approaches that will allow them to help keep our community and economy strong and successful.

Abortion decisions
Abortion decisions are difficult. Any decision to have surgery is difficult no matter your age. I just had an upper endoscopy. I had to have a consultation with the doctor before the procedure, which my daughter, a RN, attended with me. The procedure was performed a week later in the safety of a hospital.
But should a minor have a surgical or chemical abortion without a parent's knowledge?
LD 83, An Act To Strengthen The Consent Law For Abortions Performed On Minors And Incapacitated Persons, insures the young and vulnerable will have support and help with a difficult decision.
Kathleen Birdsall

Common Core repeal
Normally other legislators take their cues from the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. But the committee did not support LD 1396, a bill that would repeal the Common Core, voting 12-1 that it "Ought Not To Pass."
Rep. Mike McClellan, R-Raymond, was the only voice of support. Because of his vote, this bill can make it to the House floor to hopefully be opened up for a lively discussion and debate about the merits of this bill.
I believe the 127th Legislature should restore the K-12 public education in the pursuit of happiness, individualism, self-governess and continual self-improvement. Children need a teacher who can generate excitement and a desire to learn.
The Common Core Standards are copyrighted and actually owned by two private, nongovernmental organizations -- the National Governors Association Center and the Council of Chief State School Officers.
Mainers should call or email their representatives to express their thoughts about the passage of LD 1396, An Act Regarding Educational Standards for Maine Students. The only way the rest of the legislators will take notice on this bill is if they hear from their constituents.

Potholes through history
Recently, while driving through town, I wondered what it must have been like more than a century ago for Mainers to travel this great state by horse-drawn buggy and buckboard.
Then I realized it must have been just as jaw jarring as navigating a modern automobile through the pothole laden streets of downtown Bangor.
It's funny how times change yet our day-to-day life remains very much the same.
John Bonadio
Bangor
Tribal sovereignty
It is hard to believe that any governor can actually get away with being against the tightening of pollution standards in this day and age. How and why do Mainers let him get away with that?
The entire first part of Collin Woodward's March 2 Portland Press Herald article that described Gov. Paul LePage's criticism of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ruling in favor of Maine Indian tribes and the tribes desire for sustenance reminds me of a Penobscot tribal member I once knew.
In 1998, the Maine Coalition For Tribal Sovereignty asked him to identify his personal meaning of "sovereignty." He identified it as his freedom to fish off Indian Island and then eat what he caught. The answer to the question was brought down to the lowest common denominator of human existence: sovereignty equals sustenance.
How on earth can the people of Maine, the town and city councils and the selectmen along the mighty Penobscot agree to be defendants in this case?
John C. Frachella

Grow homeownership
I remember when I bought my first home. It was a great day and one that I celebrated. Too many people across the country are struggling to obtain homeownership and this feeling of accomplishment. Elected officials should be focused on trying to make homeownership more accessible and less costly for the middle class.
That's why it is beyond me as to why politicians in Augusta are considering eliminating the Maine mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for property taxes, and raising the sales tax on the services that accompany the purchase of a home.
Homeownership is the lifeblood of our communities and stronger, more prosperous middle class. Homeownership is a job creator and spurs economic activity. According to the Maine Realtors Association, for every two homes sold in Maine, the equivalent of one full-time job is created and around $25,000 is generated in state economic growth.
In 2013, there were more than 250,000 homeowners with mortgages in Maine. These are friends, neighbors and fellow Mainers. They're building their lives here in Maine and raising a family is hard enough. If the deductions for mortgage interest and property tax are eliminated, and the sales tax is raised on home buying services, we all face thousands in additional taxes.
We all need to tell our elected officials that moving the goal posts in the middle of the match is unacceptable and unfair to Maine residents.

Texto completo:   Memorial Day
Once again, it is time to remember the sacrifices of those who gave some or all to defend the freedoms we cherish, in wars around the globe. Without those sacrifices, we would be less free, enslaved or destroyed by madmen who would decide we were no more than animals, a notion we reject.
Madmen who would jail or kill their people over differences of opinion, or merely over free speech spoken.
We will never forget the sacrifices fought for our freedoms, whether the battle was lost or won, because freedom comes with a price. The red in our flag symbolizes the blood shed to secure that freedom. Honor our heroes with a visit to a parade or other ceremony. We can never repay, but we remember.

Penobscot River restoration
I am responding to the April 17 letter to the editor entitled "Dam removal wrong" by Joseph King Jr. of Veazie in which he misinformed Bangor Daily News readers about the importance of removing dams on Maine rivers. Over the last two decades, river herring populations have plummeted by 95 percent. The dramatic decline of this important fish species has lead to drastic increases in the cost of herring to local lobsterman.
Positive changes have already been realized with a substantial increase in the number of alewives returning to the river, which will help our coastal fishing economy by lowering the costs of herring used by local lobsterman. There will be more recreational fishing available and the opportunity for local fishing guides to benefit from the open rivers. To learn more, I strongly recommend reading The Herring Alliance's 2007 report, "Empty Rivers: The Decline of River Herring."
The rivers must remain open to the sea. King continues to promote poor understanding of the greater good provided by dam removal. I am thankful for the Penobscot River Restoration efforts and support the removal of any dam blocking the migratory travels of anadromous fish, such as alewives, salmon, smelt, striped bass and sturgeon.
I am sure proud of what was accomplished by the Penobscot River Restoration Project. I can't wait to see Atlantic salmon in these rivers. Let's hope it's not too late.

MaineCare cuts
For more than 17 years, I've practiced as a community mental health psychiatrist in Maine. I work for a nonprofit community mental health center that provides care for patients with all types of insurance, predominantly MaineCare.
In Maine there are very few psychiatrists and advance practice psychiatric nurses to serve such a large and primarily rural state. Many of these psychiatric providers choose to go into private practice and typically do not serve patients with MaineCare.
Gov. Paul LePage has proposed cuts to the MaineCare reimbursement rate for psychiatric medication management services, for the 2016-17 budget. The proposed realignment of payment for psychiatric medication management services in Maine will reduce current reimbursement to community mental health centers for psychiatrists by 60 percent and even greater for advance practice psychiatric nurses. Such devastating and unprecedented cuts will very likely have the following tragic effects:
-- Expansion of psychiatric services into currently underserved parts of Maine will virtually grind to a halt.
-- Some outpatient community mental health psychiatric medication management practices will close leaving many patients without vital ongoing psychiatric treatment.
-- More patients will destabilize resulting in an overutilization of expensive inpatient psychiatric hospital beds.
-- The closing of community health centers and associated job losses will have significant negative economic effects on the communities where they are based.

Taxing rent and board
My mother-in-law moved into Seaport Village, the new assisted living facility. In the current bill, they have added 5 percent for the Service Provider Tax.
I have looked up the law and find some things that are very bothersome. This info comes from " Service Provider Tax Instructions Bulletin 55."
The first statement in these instructions that bother me is: "Unlike the sales tax the Service Provider Tax is not levied on the consumer, but is instead upon the providers (seller). The law allows the provider to pass the tax on to the consumer, but only if it is separately stated and identified on the invoice to the consumer as a "service provider tax."
To include community-support business and assisted living facilities and service is absurd. It is a tax that will be levied on people who are trying to take care of people with disabilities who have less resources.
Finally, it includes living cost -- rent and board -- of private-pay clients. My mother-in-law rents a studio apartment at Seaport Village. Do colleges have to pay 5 percent on the room and board they collect from students? I believe that taxing her rent under this law treats her unfairly.

Start school later
Biological changes in sleep and circadian rhythms occur in all adolescents during puberty and have the effect of delaying sleep and wake times. These changes make it almost impossible for teens to fall asleep before 11 p.m., and equally challenging to wake before 8 a.m., when high schools begin class. This interferes with the average student's ability to obtain the needed eight to 10 hours of sleep recommended by the National Sleep Foundation.
Consequences of adolescent sleep debt and disruption have been documented for years, showing a negative effect on academic performance -- decreased attention span and higher-level cognitive skills, slowed reaction times and a reduced ability to learn and remember new information.
Equally troubling are the effects of sleep debt on mood and behavior. Research has demonstrated that insufficient sleep among adolescents results in increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, decreased impulse control and difficulty regulating emotions.
Delaying school start times could easily address many of the potential risks that Maine teens presently face. As noted on the Start School Later website, "When schools have delayed the start of the school day, communities have seen reduced tardiness, sleeping in class, and car crash rates, as well as improved attendance, graduation rates, and standardized test scores."
At present, LD 711, which would ensure schools start a little later -- 8:30 a.m. -- is set to go to the floor for a vote. It is a step in the right direction. Supporting LD 711 embodies our collective obligation to protect our youth from harm, and it affirms that we will make choices that represent their best interests.

Texto completo:   ROCKLAND, Maine -- A Port Clyde man remains in jail after he was charged with sexually assaulting a former companion.
Douglas H. Robinson, 40, was arrested shortly after 6 p.m. Tuesday and taken to the Knox County Jail in Rockland. Bail was denied until he made an initial court appearance, which occurred Wednesday afternoon in Knox County Unified Court.
The district attorney's office filed charges Wednesday of unlawful sexual contact, unlawful sexual touching and domestic violence assault. At the hearing, Judge Patricia Worth set bail at $5,000 cash.
Defense attorney for the day William Pagnano said Robinson is being held, however, on a hold order from his probation officer. Assistant District Attorney Christopher Fernald said a hearing is pending to revoke Robinson's probation.
According to an affidavit filed by Knox County Sheriff's Office Deputy Arthur Smith, the woman reported that Robinson had stopped by her residence on May 11 to drop off their child. He then asked the children in the home to leave the room and when they did, he grabbed the woman and sexually assaulted her.
Police investigated the incident and obtained an arrest warrant, before apprehending Robinson on Tuesday evening.

Portland lawmakers make pitch for legal pot

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Two Democratic legislators from Portland on Wednesday introduced their bills to legalize adult recreational marijuana use, saying the state should accept their presumption that weed is here to stay.
The question, they said, is how society should deal with that fact -- continue to outlaw marijuana or attempt to regulate it the same way society regulates the legal drugs of tobacco and alcohol.
"As a former police officer, we know that this war was lost a long time ago," said Rep. Mark Dion, a former Cumberland County sheriff and one of the lawmakers pushing legalization. Speaking during a public hearing on the two bills in the Criminal Justice Committee, he said society should treat marijuana the same way it treats alcohol -- by encouraging responsible use and seeking to help those for whom responsible use is impossible.
"We don't criminalize people if they choose to consume [alcohol or tobacco], but what we can do is try to manage those consumption patterns," he said.
Dion and his counterpart, Rep. Diane Russell, both said their bills were more necessary than ever because of grassroots efforts to put marijuana legalization on the ballot via citizens initiative in 2016.
"By planning ahead, we can inoculate ourselves from having to scramble to put policies in place after the fact," Russell said. "This is the responsible path forward and the last time it will be available to us as a tool."
Russell's bill, LD 1380, and Dion's, LD 1401, would both legalize the possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana by adults over 21 years old, and establish a legal framework for the retail sales and taxation of pot. There are differences between the bills, but the two lawmakers said they were working to combine their efforts.
Proponents of legalization say that by taking marijuana out of the black market, it will prevent needless investigation, prosecution and incarceration. That will allow the state to focus on more dangerous drugs and other crimes -- not to mention open a new tax revenue stream for the state.
Russell and Dion talked about legalization as a sort of inevitability. Four states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana use by adults, and efforts are underway in five more. In Maine, Portland and South Portland have both passed ordinances at the ballot to legalize marijuana.
Dion told the lawmakers that each of them likely knew adults who used marijuana, with nary a negative consequence.
"How many of us here, who look normal, have engaged in consuming those drugs and can move forward?" he said. "There are a lot of people in your communities who can tell stories of their experience with these drugs, who have no problem."
That may be true, but it misses the point, said Scott Gagnon, director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana Maine, a group opposed to legalization.
"With any drug -- alcohol, tobacco, marijuana -- there are certainly adults who can use it without having any problems. But you'll find that with harder drugs as well," he said in an interview.
The concern of Smart Approaches to Marijuana Maine, he said, is the overall effect that a thriving commercial marijuana industry would have on the overall health and well-being of the state -- particularly young people.
In states where recreational marijuana is legal, the industry has created and sold marijuana candies, soft drinks, chocolates and other products that Gagnon said were marketed toward children.
"This is what parents, educators and employers would have to contend with as they try to keep their homes, schools and workplaces safe for all," he said in testimony to the committee.
The Maine Public Health Association, Maine Medical Association and Communities Against Substance Abuse all oppose the bills as well. So does the American Academy of Pediatrics, which cited research indicating that marijuana had adverse effects on developing brains.
Gov. Paul LePage's administration also opposes the bills, as does the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, which said Wednesday that the state's efforts "must be focused on reducing drug use so that an individual's full potential is achievable."
While Wednesday's meeting was reserved for public comment, some members of the committee did indicate their inclination regarding marijuana legalization. Rep. Justin Chenette, D-Saco, had pointed questions for Russell.
"Just because we can do this, as a society, should we?" he said. "Why would we want to encourage smoking? Can't people find something else to do that's fun and more productive with their time? Why do we need to add another thing to the list of substances we can do?"
Russell said the issue at hand is one of personal choice.
"I drink bourbon. I drink a fair amount of bourbon. I don't drink enough that it causes a problem. But there are people out there who can't hold their bourbon," she said. "But we tried prohibition, and it failed. I don't think we should be putting moral judgments on what people choose to put into their body, or not."

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- The Ellsworth man on trial for killing his wife on Christmas Day 2013 admitted to police the he injected an opioid substitute shortly before she died.
Christopher Saenz, 32 , allegedly beat Hilary Saenz, 29, to death in their Central Street apartment while their two children, then 12 and 8 years old, were in the home.
He is charged with intentional or knowing murder and, in the alternative, depraved indifference murder in the death of his wife. Saenz has pleaded not guilty.
Saenz admitted shooting up Subutex to now-retired Maine State Police detective Warren Fernald in an interview recorded Dec. 26, 2013, in the Central Street apartment where the family lived. The video was played on the morning of the third day of Saenz's jury-waived trial in Bangor.
Subutex is prescribed for patients who cannot tolerate Suboxone, according to rxlist.com.
Fernald testified that he saw needles and cotton balls in the bedroom where Hilary Saenz was pronounced dead by an ambulance crew about 3:30 p.m. Dec. 25, 2013. Christopher Saenz was not asked how he obtained the drugs.
Saenz told detectives that he used the drugs to avoid becoming "dopesick" and experiencing the aches and pains of withdrawal.
The defendant agreed to do a re-enactment with investigators, according to his conversation with Ferland that was shown on the recording. He was not read his rights at any time during the video.
Saenz told Fernald that his wife went into their bedroom to take a shower but fell forward onto her face. He said he called the local hospital to seek advice, then tried to revive her unsuccessfully with water before calling 911 and sending the couple's two children to a neighbor's house.
When asked why he delayed calling for an ambulance, Saenz said that he was concerned that he might "be in trouble" because his wife had two black eyes. Saenz admitted striking her on Dec. 22, 2013. He told police that is why his wife had called in sick to her jobs at Wal-Mart and Eastern Maine Medical Center on Dec. 22 and 23, 2013.
The couple's son, Christopher Saenz Jr., now 9, testified Monday that he saw his father hit his mother in the forehead two days before Christmas.
Police interviews with Saenz were to be played Wednesday afternoon.
Medical experts are expected to testify for both sides later this week and next about whether Hilary Saenz died as a result of a beating or a medical condition.
Defense attorney Jeffrey Toothaker of Ellsworth said Monday in his opening statement that Hilary Saenz died of a brain hemorrhage that was a result of lingering, undiagnosed problems from a head injury suffered in a 2003 car accident.
Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman, who is prosecuting the case, said Monday that Hilary Saenz had 50 bruises on her body but died of bleeding in her brain.
The trial before Superior Court Justice Ann Murray is scheduled to last two weeks.
Murray is expected to issue a written verdict this summer.
If convicted on murder, Saenz faces between 25 years and life in prison.

Nationally, there are about 9.4 million women-owned businesses, up about 74 percent from 5.4 million firms in 1997.
Projected revenue growth for all women-owned firms in Maine was 14.4 percent between 1997 and 2015, compared with 78.7 percent growth nationally.
American Express ranked Maine 47th among the 50 states in growth of the number of women-owned firms over the past 18 years, and 50th in combined revenue growth among women-owned businesses between 1997 and 2015.

Texto completo:   PH.LETTERMAN.0520 - On the day of David Letterman's last show, after 30 years of re-defining the late night talk show, we tell three Maine stories that show the comedian's deep and lasting impact: Dan Cashman, the Brewer PR exec who is basically David Letterman in his spare time. He became so fascinated with Letterman as a boy that he has spent the last 20 years turning himself into the Letterman-style hose of "Nite Show," a Maine-based late night show that airs weekly in every Maine TV market; Bob Marley, the Maine comedian who grew up on Letterman and counts performing on his show and hearing him laugh as one of his career highlights. Plus he uses the moment in his act because he says his parents were it the Letterman audience, arguing with each other while he was trying to make Dave proud; And, Bangor, which had its moment in the sun 25 years ago when Letterman found the Maine city was the only place where he got less than 1 percent of the Nielsen rating, so he spents several nights talking about Bangor, and even spent time calling people out of the Bangor phone book. The campaign got national attention and put Bangor on the map. ROUTHIER. 20 -22 inches. ART: Wire of Letterman, file of Cashman and Marley.and Bangor
WHEN: 11:35 p.m. Wednesday
WHERE: CBS stations; WGME (Channel 13)
WHAT: David Letterman's final show after 33 years on late-night TV, meaning he is the longest-lasting host in the genre, surpassing the 30 years that Johnny Carson was on the air. "Late Night with David Letterman" aired on NBC from 1982 to 1993, and "Late Show with David Letterman" began airing in 1993 on CBS.

Texto completo:   Announcement of teams in IceBreaker tournament in Portland
University of Maine athletic officials had just announced Tuesday the field of teams they'll be hosting in the 2015 Ice Breaker college hockey tournament in Portland when discussion shifted to an even bigger prize.
What about landing an NCAA regional tournament at Cross Insurance Arena?
"We're looking at this as an opportunity to show that we can host these events if people are into supporting it," said Seth Woodcock, the Black Bears' Associate Director of Athletic Development. "The goal here isn't to get a regional. The goal is to host the Ice Breaker tournament and kill it. And we're hoping it shows we're capable of hosting other things as well."
The four-team event - considered the kickoff of the college hockey season - is in its 19th year. This is the second time Maine has hosted the event, which was held in Orono in 2001. Maine also competed in 2005 and 2012.
The Black Bears will play Michigan State at 8 p.m. Oct. 9 and North Dakota at 8 p.m. Oct. 10 at the CIA. Lake Superior State is the fourth team in the field, and will play in the early game those days, at 4:30 p.m.
Maine Coach Red Gendron, heading into his third season, was responsible for securing the other three teams in the field and is excited about providing an early test for his team, which finished 14-22-3 last winter.
"I want to schedule teams that are going to be challenging for us and exciting for our fans. I'm not trying to build wins into my schedule. We have to learn to win those games," Gendron said.
Maine will follow up its Ice Breaker appearance with two games the following weekend at Union College, the 2014 national champions, and then a rare Tuesday game at Quinnipiac.
"Double-button your chinstrap, let's go. That's Maine hockey, thank you very much," Gendron said.
"If we're going to be great again, I'm not going to do it the easy way."
Michigan State was 17-16-2 last season, while North Dakota finished 29-10-3 and reached the NCAA Frozen Four. North Dakota will be guided by first-year coach Brad Berry after Dave Hakstol was hired by the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday. Lake Superior State, which will be making its Ice Breaker debut, has a history with Maine. The Lakers ousted the Black Bears from the NCAA tournament in their first meeting in 1988. Five years later, Maine rallied to beat the Lakers for the 1993 national championship.
Tickets will cost $25 for one night and $45 for both evenings. They go on sale June 7 via Ticketmaster.
Big crowds will be crucial to help Maine recoup the cost of hosting the tournament, but also to show the NCAA that Portland is a viable market for NCAA regional tournaments. CIA's capacity is 6,733.
Maine's bid for the 2015 event was accepted two years ago. The school paid a $75,000 guarantee to College Hockey Inc., which manages the Ice Breaker on behalf of the Hockey Commissioners Association. Maine also must pay $15,000 to the three visiting schools, plus provide 17 hotel rooms for each.
Offsetting those costs will be ticket sales plus corporate sponsorships. Gorham Savings Bank has signed on as the title sponsor.
The games are not yet scheduled to be televised. NESN had a conflict with those dates. ESPN3 is willing to live-stream the games, but Maine would have to provide the production.
It's also possible the university could make the games available on its normal networks of Fox College Sports, WPME in Portland and WVII in Bangor. That decision will be made within a few weeks.
In the meantime, the Ice Breaker is leading to thoughts of more games potentially being held at the renovated CIA, which now has the four locker rooms required for such tournaments. Maine will also play New Hampshire at the Portland arena again this winter.
"We just thought it was a good opportunity to rally our alumni base down here in Portland. We put on great events in Orono all year long. This is just kind of a chance for us to expand our footprint," Woodcock said.
"When you look at the regionals now and where they're held (including Providence, Rhode Island, and Manchester, New Hampshire, in March), we feel like we can compete. We'd like to be in the mix.
"We're going to continue to play games down here in Portland. We could be looking at some conference games here. We're not looking to move out of Alfond (Arena). We're not trying to send shock waves to our supporters in Orono."

Texto completo:   PH.LETTERMAN.0520 - On the day of David Letterman's last show, after 30 years of re-defining the late night talk show, we tell three Maine stories that show the comedian's deep and lasting impact: Dan Cashman, the Brewer PR exec who is basically David Letterman in his spare time. He became so fascinated with Letterman as a boy that he has spent the last 20 years turning himself into the Letterman-style hose of "Nite Show," a Maine-based late night show that airs weekly in every Maine TV market; Bob Marley, the Maine comedian who grew up on Letterman and counts performing on his show and hearing him laugh as one of his career highlights. Plus he uses the moment in his act because he says his parents were it the Letterman audience, arguing with each other while he was trying to make Dave proud; And, Bangor, which had its moment in the sun 25 years ago when Letterman found the Maine city was the only place where he got less than 1 percent of the Nielsen rating, so he spents several nights talking about Bangor, and even spent time calling people out of the Bangor phone book. The campaign got national attention and put Bangor on the map. ROUTHIER. 20 -22 inches. ART: Wire of Letterman, file of Cashman and Marley.and Bangor
Early in his 33-year reign as the king of late-night TV, David Letterman did a recurring skit called "Brush with Greatness." Audience members would recount memorable celebrity encounters, like the flight service manager who said Barbra Streisand's dog threw up on him, or the podiatrist who gleefully recalled how he almost hit Jerry Lewis with his car.
But those anecdotes pale compared with the life-changing encounters that some Mainers have had with Letterman himself.
There are people in Bangor, for instance, who are still basking in the glory of Letterman's televised, headline-grabbing effort to get them to watch his show. Dan Cashman, of Brewer, became so fascinated with Letterman as a grade-schooler that he grew up to create, fund and host a statewide Letterman-style talk show. And nationally known Maine comedian Bob Marley counts his 1999 "Late Show with David Letterman" appearance as one of his big breaks, calling the laughs he got from Letterman "something I will never, ever forget."
Call these moments a "Brush with Daveness."
Letterman will host his last "Late Show" Wednesday on CBS, with his record as the longest-tenured late-night host in TV history secured (sorry, Johnny Carson). So while the entertainment writers continue to heap praise on Letterman for his wit and longevity, consider the Mainers who felt Letterman's full comedic power in a very personal way.
Here are their stories:
PLEASE, BANGOR, WATCH MY SHOW
Cary Weston was a sophomore at Bangor High School, sitting in class one morning in 1987, when a classmate came in and said that Letterman had called his home the night before.
"No one believed him, because none of us stayed up that late," said Weston, 42, a co-owner of the Sutherland Weston marketing agency in Bangor. "But it was true. And then it was all over the media. It kind of put Bangor on the map."
On his Sept. 29, 1987, show, Letterman started reading the recent TV ratings for his "Late Night with David Letterman" on NBC, and saw his very lowest ratings were in Bangor. The number was less than 1 percent of all viewers.
So he decided to court Bangor viewers over the next several episodes. On some shows, Letterman showed maps of Bangor, or pictures of lumber or moose. He read names out of the Bangor phone book (thinking people would tune in to hear their own names) and even called Bangor residents at random to find out why they didn't watch his show.
Newspapers and TV stations ran stories about the Bangor campaign. The New York Times even came to cover the story, quoting locals about how Bangor's streets rolled up at 9:30 p.m., or how Bangor residents were going to start taping Letterman's 12:30 a.m. shows and watch them sometime after sunrise.
Weston says Bangor folks did start watching Letterman after the campaign, and he and a whole generation became hooked on "Stupid Human Tricks" and Top Ten lists.
"Bangor wasn't known, or we didn't think it was known, so to see it in the national spotlight, and on the national TV news, because of Letterman, was pretty powerful," Weston said.
A FAN IS BORN DURING SLEEPOVER
Dan Cashman of Brewer was 9 years old and having a sleepover in his parents' basement when he and his friends decided to turn on the TV. His friends went back to roughhousing and joking while Cashman found himself transfixed by Letterman's gap-toothed grin and razor-sharp wit.
"I just stopped paying attention to whatever was being said and concentrated on this wildly weird show," said Cashman, 37, who runs Cashman Communications, a public relations firm. "I decided pretty soon after, that's what I wanted to do."
As a middle schooler, he sat behind a desk at home and pretended to interview people. While a freshman at the University of Maine, he convinced Bangor TV station WBGR to run the first version of his current statewide show, "The Nite Show with Danny Cashman." After college, Cashman got married, had a child and started his business. But his dream of hosting his own Letterman-style show would not die.
About five years ago he resurrected "The Nite Show." He hosts, books guests, writes jokes, sells ads and negotiates deals with local stations. Now "The Nite Show" is seen Saturday nights on commercial stations in all three of Maine's TV markets: Portland, Bangor and Presque Isle. Guests have included Maine celebrities and politicians, and a few nationally known folks as well.
Cashman's persona on the show is somewhat reserved, sometimes goofy, sometimes dry and witty.
"His (Letterman's) influence is everywhere on our show. I try not to emulate him, but it's hard," Cashman said.
'HE'S UP THERE RIGHT NOW, MARCIA'
Bob Marley was just eight years into his stand-up comedy career when he auditioned for Letterman's "Late Show" in 1999. The day before his appearance, he stayed at a hotel across the street from the Ed Sullivan Theater and spent the night staring at Letterman's name blaring at him in neon. He had never been on a network late show.
Marley's first joke was about how a "very friendly" girl on a Manhattan street corner offered to spank him for $20, causing Marley to call his mother in Maine and say "Ma, you could make a lot of money down here."
"I heard the laugh (from the crowd), and I heard Dave laughing behind me, which is something I will never, ever forget," said Marley, 48, of Falmouth. "I'm waiting for the applause (to stop) and I can hear my parents in the front row, arguing, 'He's up there right now, Marcia, if you'd just shut it.' 'Why don't you put a sock in your pie hole, Bob.'"
Marley said he was mortified for a moment that his parents would "derail" his five-minute spot. But no one other than Marley apparently heard them, and he continued with his act.
Since then, Marley has been on many of the big-name late shows, including ones hosted by Jay Leno, Jimmy Fallon and Craig Ferguson.
But he says the experience of going on Letterman's show was unlike all others.
"At the end when (Letterman) shook my hand, I just stood there and stared at him, I was so star-struck," Marley said. "It was like was I just watching him and didn't know I was actually on the show. It was surreal." Ray Routhier can be contacted at 791-6454 or at: rrouthier@pressherald.com Twitter: RayRouthier

Texto completo:   Decline in gas tax revenue fuels talk of alternative revenue
AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers are considering a raft of ideas to pay for long-neglected road and bridge repairs, ranging from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles.
The problem, which Maine shares with the rest of the country, is that modern fuel-efficient vehicles - especially electric and hybrid cars - are using less gas and driving down revenue from the gas tax. And that decline is contributing to crumbling rural roads in Maine, which was rated Tuesday among the 10 states that have the worst bridges and rural roads in the country.
On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee weighed funding alternatives that include repealing the state's gas tax and replacing it with a flat road tax, surcharges on electric and hybrid vehicles, and a seasonal gas tax designed to extract more revenue from summer tourists.
Gov. Paul LePage also made note of the dilemma during a news conference held at the State House last week. The governor noted that fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles have produced a steady decline in gas tax collections.
"A lot of people are getting freebies," he said. "Do you go with a gas tax or do you go with a road tax? I don't know."
About 61 percent of Maine's Highway Fund is derived from the gas tax. Those collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen commensurate with the declining revenues. In the meantime, projects lined up in the state's capital improvement plan have languished as the transportation agency struggles to maintain the existing infrastructure.
The Legislature is expected to adopt a largely status quo transportation budget of $627 million for the next two years. The budget includes $73.2 million for improvements in highways and bridges, but none for the projects identified by the Maine Department of Transportation's capital plan.
Although LePage has applauded his agency's efforts to stretch limited dollars, independent surveys assessing Maine's road infrastructure continue to deliver bad news.
On Tuesday, the national research group TRIP released a report that described Maine's bridges and rural roads as among the worst in the nation. TRIP, which promotes policies that reduce traffic congestion, said 26 percent of Maine's rural roads have pavement that is in poor condition, and that only seven other states have roads that are worse.
The report also found that 15 percent of the state's rural bridges are structurally deficient. Only eight other states have a higher percent of deficient bridges, according to the report.
Maine's standing in both categories is unchanged from a year ago.
Rural roads, highways and bridges are funded by a combination of local, state and federal governments. Federal funds for highway and transit improvements are largely generated through an 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.
According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommended increasing the federal funding from $88 billion to $120 billion. The association said the current backlog in projects totals $740 billion.
Political gridlock has erected daunting barriers to a long-term funding solution in Congress. Federal lawmakers have openly lamented the condition of the nation's transportation infrastructure, but little has been done to correct it. The current federal highway budget is due to expire at the end of the month, although the House passed a two-month extension Tuesday and the Senate is expected to vote on it later this week.
The federal gas tax has been the same since October 1993. Raising it is considered a political liability for lawmakers in both parties. Additionally, policymakers have been unable to coalesce behind alternative funding solutions.
The situation is not much different in Maine. Collections from the state's 30-cent gas tax have fallen with the increased prevalence of fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the state's revenue predicament is also partially self-inflicted.
In 2011, LePage signed the Republican-controlled Legislature's bill halting the state's indexing of the gas tax to adjust for inflation. Republicans reasoned that Maine's gas tax, currently third-highest in New England, was already too high.
Some Maine lawmakers are open to restoring the inflation indexing for the gas tax, but there are those who wonder if the primary funding mechanism for Maine's road and bridges is due for an overhaul.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is the lead sponsor of L.D. 1110. The proposal is a concept draft, meaning it doesn't recommend a specific funding mechanism for the Highway Fund. However, McLean told lawmakers on the Transportation Committee during an April 28 public hearing that "the way we fund our transportation projects is at a crossroads." He noted that according to a briefing from Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, the money collected from the gas tax can fund the engineering and design of road and bridge projects, but not actual construction.
"Think about it," McLean said. "Unless we come up with a bond or some other manipulation of Highway Fund dollars, we don't have a penny to spend on a road or a bridge. Nothing. Imagine what will happen to the (MDOT) work plan if we don't have any money to build a bridge or road."
For now, state lawmakers have been unable to overcome their ambivalence. On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Transportation Committee moved to carry over McLean's bill to next year. They unanimously voted to accept a different bill, L.D. 706, which creates a commission to study how the state should fund its transportation infrastructure.
McLean remained hopeful the commission would develop a strategy that's "economically and politically feasible."
"There are a lot of solutions out there," he said, adding that a lack of political courage in Washington, D.C., had forced states to act.
LePage, meanwhile, has resorted to proposing state borrowing projects to fund the transportation infrastructure. He has asked state lawmakers to approve L.D. 1415, a $175 million bond measure that would need the approval of voters if it clears the Legislature.

Texto completo:   The state's Labor, Commerce, Research, and Economic Development voted 9 - 2 in support of a measure to stabilize funding for Maine's homeless shelters today.
AUGUSTA -- A bill designed to increase state funding to Maine homeless shelters received approval from a legislative committee Tuesday.
The proposal, L.D. 443, is sponsored by Sen. Justin Alfond, D-Portland, and backed by many of the operators running 42 shelters statewide. The Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee supported the bill, 9-2, but not before making some changes to garner a bipartisan endorsement.
The original bill proposed providing $3.5 million in state funding to relieve financial pressure and, in some cases, prevent further closings of emergency shelters. However, the version of the bill approved by the committee Tuesday would provide $2 million in state funding.
During a March 17 public hearing, advocates for shelters noted that the state appropriated only $364,000 in direct funding. That includes two city-run shelters in Portland, where state budget changes are forcing the city to consider closing an overflow emergency shelter.
In addition to increased funding, the version of the bill approved by the committee Tuesday would create a new shelter for human trafficking victims. The issue has been a focus of Sen. Amy Volk, R-Scarborough, who co-chairs the labor committee and voted to support the bill on Tuesday.
The amendment also proposes to use funds from Maine's share of a $1.37 billion legal settlement against Standard & Poor's if the state's Department of Health and Human Services funding for the bill is inadequate.
The Maine piece of the Standard & Poor's settlement, $21.5 million, is one of many conflicts between Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, and Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat. LePage has submitted legislation that would wrest control of the settlement money from Mills, but it faces long odds in the divided Legislature.
It's unclear if the shelter funding proposal will win the backing of the governor, who rarely comments on legislation until the final version reaches his desk.
Nonetheless, advocates for L.D. 443 have said the bill is required to prevent shelter closings or reductions in services. Currently, they argue, the facilities lean on a patchwork of funding and private donations to serve clients who are often suffering from mental illness or substance abuse or fleeing domestic violence.
The legislation was submitted before the LePage administration began pressuring Portland to stop using General Assistance funding to reimburse stays at the two city-run homeless shelters. However, Alfond has said he hopes the debate over the state's initiative will illuminate the challenges faced by struggling shelters.
In March, he said the focus on Portland has highlighted that "General Assistance was never intended to fund shelters on a daily basis," but more importantly, that shelters are inadequately funded.
"No one chooses to be homeless," he said. "Our shelters serve as the last line of defense for the neediest among us. The purpose of this bill is to provide a dedicated and stable funding source to ensure that our most vulnerable Mainers have a safe place to sleep at night."
Annual point-in-time surveys conducted each January show the overall homeless population in Maine was 2,726 people in 2014, a decline from 3,016 people in 2013 and roughly equal to the 2,769 people in 2005. Those figures include people in emergency shelters, transitional housing and outdoors, with no shelter at all.
The emergency shelter population increased by 50 percent in the past decade, climbing from 731 in 2005 to 839 in 2009 and to 1,102 in 2014, according to HUD. The agency also found that Maine has one of the lowest percentages in the nation of people with no shelter at all, at 3.4 percent.
Mark Swann, executive director of Preble Street in Portland, said that on any given night the state's 42 shelters are housing roughly 1,000 Mainers. He told lawmakers during the public hearing that shelter operators were desperate for state funding assistance.
According to a budget report by the state housing authority, a quasi-public agency, emergency homeless shelters received $500,000 in state funding beginning in 1988. Budget cuts steadily reduced the subsidy to $364,000 last year. The housing authority also provides $2.8 million to the shelters through what's called the House Opportunities for Maine Fund, or HOME. However, that fund was originally created by the Legislature in 1983 to provide long-term affordable housing, not emergency shelters.
The funding struggle is particularly acute in Portland. A state audit in 1985 eventually led to a billing arrangement between the city and the state that allowed Portland to tap General Assistance funds to pay for shelter stays. At the time, Portland had one homeless shelter with 53 beds. But it became a destination for the state's mentally ill as the state began shrinking the size of its mental health facilities.
The agreement was a settlement to a political dispute that surfaced again in February.
In fiscal year 2014, the state paid for all but $28,000 of the $2.7 million it cost to run Portland's two shelters and overflow facilities, mostly through General Assistance. Steve Mistler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at: smistler@pressherald.com Twitter: stevemistler

Police arrest three after break-in at trooper's home
Three people have been arrested following a break-in at a state trooper's home in West Gardiner, according to the Maine State Police.
Trooper Tim Black's garage was broken into last week, police said. Thieves stole ammunition, a state police jacket, state police patches, a kayak, two mountain bikes and tools.
Troopers found the kayak had been advertised for sale online for $140 and were able to contact the buyer, who helped them identify the seller.
Police went to Dustin Woodworth's home on Gannett Street in Augusta and recovered the rest of the stolen items, state police said.
Police charged Woodworth, 29, and Ian Watson, 27, of Farmingdale, with burglary. Woodworth also was charged with possession of heroin, and Sarah Giampetro, 25, of Farmingdale was charged with having medication that was not prescribed for her, state police said.
All three were taken to Kennebec County jail in Augusta.
OGUNQUIT
Hotel, restaurant destroyed by blaze being demolished
A waterfront hotel and restaurant destroyed by fire in Ogunquit is being demolished.
Excavators and heavy equipment were seen ripping into the Blue Water Inn and Huckleberry's Restaurant on Monday.
Both were destroyed after a blaze started in the hotel and spread to the restaurant in late April.
The State Fire Marshal's Office says the fire started accidentally, probably caused by an electrical malfunction. Authorities say the fire burned inside the wall before moving to the rest of the seven-room bed and breakfast and into the second floor of the restaurant.
Portland
Court upholds conviction in workers' compensation case
Maine's highest court has upheld the conviction of a northern Maine man convicted of collecting more than $50,000 in workers' compensation benefits while operating an engine repair business.
An Aroostook County jury convicted Stephen Tucker Sr., 63, of theft in April 2014. He injured his hand while working as a mechanic in 2006. Maine Employers Mutual Insurance Co. later hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance of Tucker. Court records say videos show Tucker working full time and performing various tasks.
Tucker's claims include a charge that the court erred when it allowed testimony from an insurance adjuster that he believes was inaccurate and prejudiced the jury.
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court said Tuesday that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony.
Bangor
At murder trial, neighbor testifies about loud noise
A neighbor of an Ellsworth man charged with killing his wife on Christmas Day 2013 says he awoke to a loud noise and profanity on the day of the woman's death.
The neighbor said he looked outside and saw Christopher Saenz - the man on trial for murder - slamming the door, WLBZ-TV reported Tuesday. Saenz then told him his wife, Hilary, may have hit her head on the bed.
The couple's daughter and son testified Monday that Saenz physically abused Hilary Saenz in the month leading up to her death in Ellsworth.
Prosecutors say Saenz was angry because he believed his wife was having an affair.
An autopsy revealed multiple injuries, including brain bleeding.
The children, ages 8 and 12 at the time, are in the care of relatives.
Leeds
Man with firearms arsenal claims he was shooting rat
Maine State Police have charged a Leeds man who is prohibited from having guns with possessing an arsenal of firearms.
State police were called to Fish Street on Monday for a report that Guy Schultz, 43, had fired a gun too close to a neighbor's house. Schultz told troopers he was shooting at a rat.
Troopers determined that he was not allowed to have a gun because of a 1991 felony burglary conviction.
State police said they searched his home and seized several handguns, rifles, shotguns and silencers. Some of the equipment lacked the required federal registration, police said.
State police were helped at the scene by agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
SKOWHEGAN
Homeless shelter resident held on sex assault charge
A resident of the Trinity homeless shelter was arrested early Tuesday on a charge of gross sexual assault in connection with an incident at the McClellan Street shelter.
Mark Allen Johnson, 35, was charged with the Class B felony for allegedly engaging in a sexual act with a woman while she was unconscious or otherwise physically incapable of resisting and had not consented to the contact, according to Police Chief Ted Blais. The crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
The arrest came after a string of arrests at the shelter that recently prompted Blais to say the shelter adds to the town's crime rate.
AUBURN
Marijuana growing facility gets clearance to expand
The city of Auburn has given the go-ahead for a major expansion of a medical marijuana growing facility that would increase the size of the building fourfold.
Construction at Wellness Connection of Maine's growing facility is planned in several phases, the Sun Journal reported. The $2.5 million first phase is expected to break ground shortly and open in the fall.
Once finished, the building will expand from 20,000 square feet to almost 88,000 square feet, mostly to provide additional areas for growing and processing.
Medical marijuana has been legal in Maine since 1999, but the state only set up a system to sell it after a referendum vote in 2009.
Maine's eight licensed dispensaries reported more than $16.2 million in sales last year, up from $12.5 million in 2013.
AUGUSTA
LePage veto of moose hunt permit bill is overridden
The Maine Senate has overridden Republican Gov. Paul LePage's veto of a bill that would allow the state to let a hunter transfer a coveted moose hunting permit to a family member in certain cases.
The Republican-controlled Senate unanimously voted to override LePage's veto on Tuesday. LePage vetoed the bill and issued a statement that said it opens up new avenues for families to try to "game this system in new and innovative ways." Democratic Sen. David Miramant of Camden said the bill is designed to help Maine hunters who face exceptional circumstances.
The bill now goes to the House for consideration of the veto.
Maine's moose hunting permits are subject to a lottery. This year there will be 2,815 permits. There are typically more than 50,000 applications.
Councilors to consider tax break to help build hangar
City councilors plan to meet Thursday to consider giving a tax increment financing tax break to help Maine Instrument Flight build a new hangar at Augusta State Airport.
The proposal, unanimously recommended by the city's TIF Committee, would return 50 percent of the taxes, projected to be about $4,800 a year, on the new development to Maine Instrument Flight for the next 14 years and about $2,411 a year for the four additional years of the proposed 18-year agreement.
Thorndike
High school lockout follows report of student with gun
Mount View High School in Thorndike briefly locked out students as a safety precaution Tuesday morning after a report to police that a student waiting to board a school bus in Freedom was holding a gun.
Police later determined the student had been holding a pellet gun and had not taken it onto the school bus.
The school went into lockout from about 7:45 to 8:15 a.m. after receiving a report from police, according to Heather Perry, superintendent of Regional School Unit 3. A 911 caller reported that a young man was at the end of a driveway in Freedom, apparently waiting for a school bus, and was holding a handgun, according to a news release from the Waldo County Sheriff's Office.
Sheriff's deputies stopped the bus and removed the student, according to the release.
Police said the student had been in possession of a pellet gun before he got on the bus, but had left the gun at home before getting on board.
The school was in lockout while police investigated the incident.
Winthrop
After four tries, man named town manager
Serving in Winthrop's town government changed the course of Peter Nielsen's life. Now he's ready to take what he's learned in that journey and put it to work for the town that started it all.
Town councilors at the end of Monday's meeting introduced Nielsen as the next town manager. His first day on the job will be Monday.
Nielsen will replace Town Manager Jeff Woolston, who will step down June 1 after a little more than four years on the job.
Nielsen, 62, has served as town manager in four communities since 1990. He held the office most recently in Oakland, where he worked for a little more than five years before stepping down last September.
Nielsen said his interest in working full time for town government was sparked in the late 1980s during his time on the Winthrop Town Council. He has sought the Winthrop town manager's position ever since.

Texto completo:   Brief: The Sustainable Bioplastics Council of Maine has changed its name to Biobased Maine to reflect a wider mission to promote and advocate for new opportunities for Maine's forest products industry.
Maine's trees can be used to make much more than paper, a fact that offers a potentially bright future for Maine's forest products industry if the right pieces fall into place.
That was the message Tuesday morning at an event in Portland hosted by E2Tech, an organization that supports Maine's environmental, energy and clean technology sectors.
The event also served as an introduction to Biobased Maine, a reimagined organization supporting efforts to encourage research and development in new technologies that enable manufacturers to turn Maine's most abundant natural resource - trees - into biobased fuels, chemicals and advanced materials. The organization was formerly known as the Sustainable Bioplastics Council of Maine, but the name was changed in January to reflect much wider potential beyond just bioplastics, according to Charlotte Mace, who was hired last September to reboot the organization. She is the organization's first full-time executive director.
Developing technologies can extract high-value biobased chemicals, fuels and materials from wood pulp, which can then be used in clothing, coatings, adhesives, industrial chemicals and structural components, according to Mace.
"There are a lot of everyday products that involve biobased materials," Mace said. "Virtually anything we make out of crude oil and natural gas can be made out of plants."
Biobased Maine says global demand for biofuels is projected to increase from $82.7 billion in 2011 to $185.3 billion by 2021. The biobased product markets are already significant in the United States - representing more than 2.2 percent of gross domestic product, or more than $353 billion in economic activity in 2012, according to a recent report from the National Research Council.
Cellulose, one of the core materials extracted from wood pulp, is "the oil of Maine," said Tony Jabar, CEO of Cerealus, a Waterville-based company that is developing new products and processes for the forest products industry. Maine has 17 million acres of forests.
"We have a natural resource here that we can, with innovation, turn into a high-value industry in the state of Maine," Jabar said Tuesday morning.
Three factors are driving renewed interest in biobased materials, according to Mike Bilodeau, director of the University of Maine's Process Development Center: new technologies that have lowered the cost of the manufacturing processes; novel applications for the materials; and shifting national priorities that have made available more federal funding.
Bilodeau said the research and development going on at his center will help paper mills diversify and find new products to help them remain relevant. A paper mill in Turner Falls, Massachusetts, recently began using technology developed at UMaine to make higher-quality paper, Bilodeau said.
Maine's forest products industry has for a century been dominated by making paper, but that industry doesn't have the economic impact it once did. Paper mills in East Millinocket and Bucksport have closed within the last year and a half, while others in Lincoln and Rumford have made layoffs.
"Over the years, investments have been made in trying to save jobs (in the paper industry) - for good reason, ... but the bottom line is that market is going away and we need to find something to replace it," Jabar said.
Mace added urgency to the issue. "We need to re-engineer our economy," she said. "We can't jump off the cliff still making paper or we're going to see Maine continue to decline."
The extraction of biobased materials from wood pulp offers the best chance to revitalize those areas of the state that historically depended on the paper industry, Mace said.
"Biobased manufacturing is the only economic development strategy that does everything we need," Mace said. "It uses our natural resource in a sustainable way, it creates high-paying manufacturing jobs, it responds to global demand (for these biobased materials) and it reduces our reliance on volatile crude oil."

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers are considering a group of ideas to pay for long-neglected road and bridge repairs that range from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles.
The problem, which Maine shares with the rest of the country, is that modern fuel-efficient vehicles -- especially electric and hybrid cars -- are using less gas and driving down revenue from the gas tax. And that decline is contributing to crumbling rural roads in Maine, which on Tuesday was rated among the 10 states that have the worst bridges and rural roads in the country.
On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee weighed funding alternatives that include repealing the state's gas tax and replacing it with a flat road tax, surcharges on electric and hybrid vehicles, and a seasonal gas tax designed to extract more revenue from summer tourists.
Gov. Paul LePage also made note of the dilemma during a news conference held at the State House last week. The governor noted that fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles have produced a steady decline in gas tax collections.
"A lot of people are getting freebies," he said. "Do you go with a gas tax or do you go with a road tax? I don't know."
About 61 percent of the state's Highway Fund is derived from the gasoline tax. Gas tax collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen along with the declining revenue. In the meantime, projects lined up in the state's capital improvement plan have languished as the transportation agency struggles to maintain the existing infrastructure.
The Legislature is expected to adopt a largely status quo transportation budget of $627 million for the next two years. The budget includes $73.2 million for improvements in highways and bridges, but none for the projects identified by the Maine Department of Transportation's capital plan.
While LePage has applauded his agency's efforts to stretch limited dollars, independent surveys assessing Maine's road infrastructure continue to deliver bad news.
On Thursday, the national research group TRIP released a report that described Maine's bridges and rural roads as among the worst in the nation. TRIP, which promotes policies that reduce traffic congestion, said 26 percent of Maine's rural roads have pavement that is in poor condition, and that only seven other states have roads that are worse.
The report also found that 15 percent of the state's rural bridges are structurally deficient. Only eight other states have a higher percent of deficient bridges, according to the report.
Maine's standing in both categories is unchanged from a year ago.
Rural roads, highways and bridges are funded by a combination of local, state and federal governments. Federal funds for highway and transit improvements are generated largely through an 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.
According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges. The American Association of State Highway and Transporation Officials, or AASHTO, recommended increasing the federal funding from $88 billion to $120 billion. AASHTO said the current backlog in projects totals $740 billion.
Political gridlock has erected daunting barriers to a long-term funding solution in Congress. Federal lawmakers openly have lamented the condition of the nation's transportation infrastructure, but little has been done to correct it. The current federal highway budget is due to expire at the end of the month.
The federal gas tax has been the same since October 1993. Raising it is considered a political liability for lawmakers in both parties. Additionally, policymakers have been unable to coalesce behind alternative funding solutions.
The situation is not much different in Maine. Collections from the state's 30-cent gas tax have fallen with the increased prevalence of fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the state's revenue predicament is also partially self-inflicted.
In 2011, LePage signed the Republican-controlled Legislature's proposal that halted the state's indexing of the gas tax to adjust for inflation.
Republicans reasoned that Maine's gas tax was already too high. At 30 cents per gallon, it's currently third-highest in New England.
Some Maine lawmakers are open to restoring the inflation indexing for the gas tax, but there are those who wonder if the primary funding mechanism for Maine's roads and bridges is due for an overhaul.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is the lead sponsor of L.D. 1110. The proposal is a concept draft, meaning it doesn't recommend a specific funding mechanism for the Highway Fund. However, McLean told lawmakers on the Transportation Committee during an April 28 public hearing that "the way we fund our transportation projects is at a crossroads." He noted that according to a briefing from Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, the money collected from the gas tax can fund the engineering and design of road and bridge projects, but not actual construction.
"Think about it," McLean said. "Unless we come up with a bond or some other manipulation of Highway Fund dollars, we don't have a penny to spend on a road or a bridge. Nothing. Imagine what will happen to the (DOT) work plan if we don't have any money to build a bridge or road."
For now, state lawmakers have been unable to overcome their ambivalence. On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Transportation Committee moved to carry over McLean's bill to next year. They unanimously voted to accept a different bill, L.D. 706, which creates a commission to study how the state should fund its transportation infrastructure.
McLean remained hopeful the commission would develop a strategy that's "economically and politically feasible."
"There are a lot of solutions out there," he said, adding that a lack of political courage in Washington, D.C., had forced states to act.
LePage, meanwhile, has resorted to proposing state borrowing projects to fund the transportation infrastructure. He has asked state lawmakers to approve L.D. 1415, a $175 million bond measure that would need the approval of voters if it clears the Legislature.

Texto completo:   Maine daughters such as Lindsay Gifford Skilling of Gifford's rising through the ranks
Kimberly Garrett had no intention of going into the family business. In fact, her father actively discouraged it.
Not because Ed Wolak, founder of The Wolak Group in Falmouth, thought his daughter couldn't handle getting up at the crack of dawn each day to make the doughnuts at the company's small chain of Dunkin' Donuts franchises.
Running a doughnut shop can be a tiring and thankless job. Garrett remembers her father coming home with burns on his arms from being splashed with hot oil.
However, while Garrett was off at college, then pursued careers in the film and wine industries in California, got married and became a mother, The Wolak Group was rapidly growing and changing back in Maine. It grew to more than 70 franchises in three states, and the company opened an automated production facility with more than enough capacity to supply doughnuts and other baked goods to all of its stores.
Like a growing number of family business owners, Wolak eventually asked his daughter to join the company -- which now owns nearly 100 Dunkin' Donuts stores -- in an executive role.
"There was so much at stake from what he had grown," said Garrett, who is now Wolak Group vice president of operations and a franchise owner herself. "I didn't feel there was anybody else as fit to protect that as I was."
Nationally, the share of family-owned businesses headed by women has increased sixfold since 1997. At that time, only 5 percent of such businesses had a woman in the top executive role, according to a survey conducted by Mass Mutual and Arthur Andersen.
By 2014, that share had increased to 30 percent, according to the Family Firm Institute, a Boston-based trade association for family-owned businesses. Over the next 20 years, daughters are expected to eclipse sons as the go-to offspring for taking over the family business, it said.
Maine's family-owned business community is dominated by companies with male top executives, but a growing number of women have been rising up through the ranks, said Catherine Wygant Fossett, executive director of the Portland-based Institute for Family-Owned Business, which was scheduled to host its 2015 Maine Family Business Awards ceremony Monday night.
Of the Maine institute's more than 65 member businesses, eight are led by women -- about 12 percent. Even so, Wygant Fossett said that 40 to 50 women regularly participate in the institute's training and leadership-development programs.
The institute has created a number of programs aimed at women executives in recent years, she said. It even has a program to teach golf to its female members who aren't proficient at the game.
"A lot of times in the business world, a lot of work is done on the golf course," Wygant Fossett said.
The institute started a Women's Affinity Group in 2011 to specifically address some of the issues that confront women in leadership positions within family-run businesses. The group members offer support and advice to each other and an opportunity to collaborate, offering encouragement not only as women, but as leaders in family-run businesses, which often don't survive past the third generation.
One reason more women are being groomed to take over the family business is that women have surpassed men as the gender more likely to enroll in college, said Jane Hilburt-Davis, institute president emeritus and board member.
In 2012, the share of young women enrolled in college immediately after high school was 71 percent, compared with 61 percent for young men, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. Just a decade earlier, the share of young men and women enrolling in college was roughly the same.
Hilburt-Davis, president of Key Resources LLC, a consulting firm advising family-business owners, said they often look to the best-educated child as the lead candidate for succession. In a growing number of cases, that child is a daughter.
"Twenty years from now, we know more women will be leading family-owned businesses than men," she said.
Although some daughters are poised to take over national firms, as Abigail Johnson, granddaughter of Fidelity Investments founder Edward C. Johnson II, did in 2014, it is much more common for women to take over smaller, family-run companies where the hierarchy isn't as deep. Nationally, only 4.8 percent of Fortune 500 companies were headed by women in 2014.
Lindsay Gifford Skilling, general manager of Skowhegan-based Gifford's Famous Ice Cream, always hoped to work for the premium ice cream business started by her grandparents and developed further into the company it is today by her father and uncle.
"I knew at a young age that I wanted to join the family business, if they'd have me," she said.
Gifford Skilling earned a bachelor's degree in business administration and in 2006 joined Gifford's as assistant to the controller. Since then, she has risen rapidly to the top management position. Her brother, John Chester "JC" Gifford Jr., and sister, Samantha Gifford, also hold leadership positions within the company.
Gifford's, which is closing in on annual production of 2 million gallons of ice cream per year, is sold at its five ice cream stands and at hundreds of grocery stores, independent ice cream shops, colleges, universities and restaurants as far west as Nevada.
Gifford Skilling, who is 31, said it was intimidating at first to be a young female executive in an industry dominated by men. But with support from her family and an eagerness to learn, she developed the confidence to run a successful and fast-growing business.
"My dad and uncle just kind of saw something in me, I guess, so here I am," she said.

Texto completo:   Modern, fuel-efficient vehicles have reduced funds to build infrastructure
AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers are considering a group of ideas to pay for long-neglected road and bridge repairs that range from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles.
The problem, which Maine shares with the rest of the country, is that modern fuel-efficient vehicles -- especially electric and hybrid cars -- are using less gas and driving down revenue from the gas tax. And that decline is contributing to crumbling rural roads in Maine, which on Tuesday was rated among the 10 states that have the worst bridges and rural roads in the country.
On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee weighed funding alternatives that include repealing the state's gas tax and replacing it with a flat road tax, surcharges on electric and hybrid vehicles, and a seasonal gas tax designed to extract more revenue from summer tourists.
Gov. Paul LePage also made note of the dilemma during a news conference held at the State House last week. The governor noted that fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles have produced a steady decline in gas tax collections.
"A lot of people are getting freebies," he said. "Do you go with a gas tax or do you go with a road tax? I don't know."
About 61 percent of the state's Highway Fund is derived from the gasoline tax. Gas tax collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen along with the declining revenue. In the meantime, projects lined up in the state's capital improvement plan have languished as the transportation agency struggles to maintain the existing infrastructure.
The Legislature is expected to adopt a largely status quo transportation budget of $627 million for the next two years. The budget includes $73.2 million for improvements in highways and bridges, but none for the projects identified by the Maine Department of Transportation's capital plan.
While LePage has applauded his agency's efforts to stretch limited dollars, independent surveys assessing Maine's road infrastructure continue to deliver bad news.
On Thursday, the national research group TRIP released a report that described Maine's bridges and rural roads as among the worst in the nation. TRIP, which promotes policies that reduce traffic congestion, said 26 percent of Maine's rural roads have pavement that is in poor condition, and that only seven other states have roads that are worse.
The report also found that 15 percent of the state's rural bridges are structurally deficient. Only eight other states have a higher percent of deficient bridges, according to the report.
Maine's standing in both categories is unchanged from a year ago.
Rural roads, highways and bridges are funded by a combination of local, state and federal governments. Federal funds for highway and transit improvements are generated largely through an 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.
According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges. The American Association of State Highway and Transporation Officials, or AASHTO, recommended increasing the federal funding from $88 billion to $120 billion. AASHTO said the current backlog in projects totals $740 billion.
Political gridlock has erected daunting barriers to a long-term funding solution in Congress. Federal lawmakers openly have lamented the condition of the nation's transportation infrastructure, but little has been done to correct it. The current federal highway budget is due to expire at the end of the month.
The federal gas tax has been the same since October 1993. Raising it is considered a political liability for lawmakers in both parties. Additionally, policymakers have been unable to coalesce behind alternative funding solutions.
The situation is not much different in Maine. Collections from the state's 30-cent gas tax have fallen with the increased prevalence of fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the state's revenue predicament is also partially self-inflicted.
In 2011, LePage signed the Republican-controlled Legislature's proposal that halted the state's indexing of the gas tax to adjust for inflation.
Republicans reasoned that Maine's gas tax was already too high. At 30 cents per gallon, it's currently third-highest in New England.
Some Maine lawmakers are open to restoring the inflation indexing for the gas tax, but there are those who wonder if the primary funding mechanism for Maine's roads and bridges is due for an overhaul.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is the lead sponsor of L.D. 1110. The proposal is a concept draft, meaning it doesn't recommend a specific funding mechanism for the Highway Fund. However, McLean told lawmakers on the Transportation Committee during an April 28 public hearing that "the way we fund our transportation projects is at a crossroads." He noted that according to a briefing from Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, the money collected from the gas tax can fund the engineering and design of road and bridge projects, but not actual construction.
"Think about it," McLean said. "Unless we come up with a bond or some other manipulation of Highway Fund dollars, we don't have a penny to spend on a road or a bridge. Nothing. Imagine what will happen to the (DOT) work plan if we don't have any money to build a bridge or road."
For now, state lawmakers have been unable to overcome their ambivalence. On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Transportation Committee moved to carry over McLean's bill to next year. They unanimously voted to accept a different bill, L.D. 706, which creates a commission to study how the state should fund its transportation infrastructure.
McLean remained hopeful the commission would develop a strategy that's "economically and politically feasible."
"There are a lot of solutions out there," he said, adding that a lack of political courage in Washington, D.C., had forced states to act.
LePage, meanwhile, has resorted to proposing state borrowing projects to fund the transportation infrastructure. He has asked state lawmakers to approve L.D. 1415, a $175 million bond measure that would need the approval of voters if it clears the Legislature.

Texto completo:   Three people are facing charges in connection with a break-in at a Maine State Police trooper's home garage last week in West Gardiner and stealing ammunition, police patches and a jacket in an attempt to get money for drugs.
Dustin Woodworth, 29, of Augusta, and Ian Watson, 27, and Sarah Giampetro, 25, both of Farmingdale, were arrested early Sunday morning, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said in a news release.
Woodworth and Watson are charged with burglary, felony theft and criminal mischief. Giampetro is charged with unlawful possession of prescription medication.
Trooper Tim Black, of the Maine State Police, on Thursday discovered the break-in at the garage of his West Gardiner home. Maine State Police Trooper Adam McNaughton, who investigated the burglary, wrote in court documents that the burglars got in by breaking a door. The burglars also spray-painted a window black.
Black described a missing kayak and two mountain bicycles. Detectives were able to recover fingerprints from the can of spray paint and a DNA swab, McNaughton wrote.
Black called McNaughton on Saturday after finding the kayak on Craigslist. McNaughton did his own search to find the kayak, which was being sold in Chelsea for $400. McNaughton set up a meeting with the seller, later identified as 29-year-old Brandon Maxim. He initially told McNaughton and Black that he no longer had use of the kayak.
"Brandon informed me that he did not want the kayak anymore because his girlfriend wanted him to sell it because they live paycheck to paycheck," McNaughton wrote.
Maxim changed his story once he learned that McNaughton and Black were from the state police and that the kayak was stolen.
Maxim said he bought the kayak Thursday from Woodworth for $140.
Maxim said he did not know the kayak was stolen, McNaughton wrote. Last month, Maxim placed an ad on Facebook looking for a kayak, McNaughton wrote. Woodworth reportedly answered that ad Thursday morning, sending pictures of the kayak.
"Brandon also said that Dustin was selling ammunition, but did not know what kind or caliber," McNaughton wrote.
Police searched Woodworth's home at 12:45 a.m. Sunday. Woodworth, who was home at the time, admitted that he and Watson had stolen items from the garage over two nights, McNaughton wrote.
Woodworth said he had sold most of the ammunition, McNaughton wrote, but still had the bulletproof vest, pepper spray and one of the mountain bikes.
The stolen bike, foreign money and the bulletproof vest were found in Watson's Gardiner home, McNaughton wrote.
"Troopers say the money was being used to buy drugs," McCausland said.
Watson and Woodworth were being held at the Kennebec County jail in lieu of $20,000 cash bail. Both appeared before a judge Monday afternoon and their bail was reduced, but both were still at the jail as of Tuesday afternoon.
Watson was being held in lieu of $750 cash bail or $100 cash with a Maine Pretrial Services contract, and Woodworth was being held in lieu of $750 cash bail or $500 cash with a pretrial contract.
Giampetro is free on $200 cash bail.

Texto completo:   Several acres of open space along Pleasant Street have been excluded from an eventual land transfer between Regional School Unit 2 and the state of Maine and could be open to development, upsetting some in the neighborhood who thought the land would be given to the school district.
Agreement may spur growth, but counters Hallowell neighbors' wishes
HALLOWELL -- The state of Maine will keep 10 acres at the Stevens School complex instead of giving it to the local school district, a move that could spur development but goes against the wishes of city councilors and neighbors.
It's the latest flashpoint in a debate about a parcel of open space abutting Pleasant Street that is wrapped up in the state's latest effort to sell the largely vacant 64-acre campus off Winthrop Street, where Regional School Unit 2 leases its headquarters.
The district has long been discussing a land transfer with the state for the 8 acres on which its office stands and 14 acres of open space behind it. But the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services and RSU 2 have agreed to keep 10 acres of the open portion in the state's hands, with department spokesman David Heidrich saying the move "may better fit with our plans" for marketing the rest of the campus, which he said "are undetermined at present."
In February, Hallowell city councilors stood by an earlier endorsement of transferring all of that land to the district. That vote came after residents of Page and Pleasant streets expressed concern that development on the parcel could change their neighborhood.
Sharon Treat, a former Democratic legislator from Pleasant Street, said water running downhill from the parcel already affects homes on the street, a problem that could worsen if land is paved.
"We're just kind of sitting ducks here in the neighborhood," she said. "It seems like we don't have a lot of say over it."
Under the deal's current calculus, the school district would get a total of 12 acres.
An appraisal of the agreed-upon parcel of land is set for this week, and both Heidrich and RSU 2 board chairwoman Dawn Gallagher, of Hallowell, said a final agreement might be reached by the end of summer. The district has been passive on whether it would take the full 14 acres. Gallagher said the school district -- which consists of Hallowell, Farmingdale, Richmond, Dresden and Monmouth -- was willing to take the land if the community wanted to keep it public, but "it doesn't really matter to us" as long as RSU 2 gets its office and a suitable land buffer.
Councilor Alan Stearns, who lives on Pleasant Street, said the state's move to keep 10 acres calls into question its willingness to collaborate with Hallowell and Mayor Mark Walker's "ability to shape the state's approach to this parcel." But Heidrich said Hallowell "remains a valued stakeholder and will continue to be involved in the property's disposition to the greatest extent practical."
Walker, who has been working with state officials on a sale plan, said there will be "plenty of opportunities" for the city to oversee development on the land, and he said stormwater improvements should be included in any developer's plans for the property, which the city would have to review.
"I don't think they're working against our interests at all," the mayor said of the state.
The RSU deal is one part of the state's plan to shed the complex, which it tried to sell to no avail in 2008. The last state offices at the complex haven't left yet, and the property isn't yet on the market.
Still, the local concerns have been an early hurdle. Stearns said the city has "acted as if this is a municipal discussion, when in fact the state has a very big role in what happens to the Stevens School," adding that he's "not convinced that the state is working with the mayor and the process the mayor has described to the city."
However, Walker said some city and state interests are the same and that getting the property into the hands of a developer and on the city's tax rolls should be a main goal.
"That's not in the city of Hallowell's interest, to let that complex sit there undeveloped," he said. "We need to find somebody to take that over."

Texto completo:   Family-owned companies easiest place to see the trend
Kimberly Garrett had no intention of going into the family business. In fact, her father actively discouraged it.
Not because Ed Wolak, founder of The Wolak Group in Falmouth, thought his daughter couldn't handle getting up at the crack of dawn each day to make the doughnuts at the company's small chain of Dunkin' Donuts franchises.
Running a doughnut shop can be a tiring and thankless job. Garrett remembers her father coming home with burns on his arms from being splashed with hot oil.
However, while Garrett was off at college, then pursued careers in the film and wine industries in California, got married and became a mother, The Wolak Group was rapidly growing and changing back in Maine. It grew to more than 70 franchises in three states, and the company opened an automated production facility with more than enough capacity to supply doughnuts and other baked goods to all of its stores.
Like a growing number of family business owners, Wolak eventually asked his daughter to join the company -- which now owns nearly 100 Dunkin' Donuts stores -- in an executive role.
"There was so much at stake from what he had grown," said Garrett, who is now Wolak Group vice president of operations and a franchise owner herself. "I didn't feel there was anybody else as fit to protect that as I was."
Nationally, the share of family-owned businesses headed by women has increased sixfold since 1997. At that time, only 5 percent of such businesses had a woman in the top executive role, according to a survey conducted by Mass Mutual and Arthur Andersen.
By 2014, that share had increased to 30 percent, according to the Family Firm Institute, a Boston-based trade association for family-owned businesses. Over the next 20 years, daughters are expected to eclipse sons as the go-to offspring for taking over the family business, it said.
Maine's family-owned business community is dominated by companies with male top executives, but a growing number of women have been rising up through the ranks, said Catherine Wygant Fossett, executive director of the Portland-based Institute for Family-Owned Business, which was scheduled to host its 2015 Maine Family Business Awards ceremony Monday night.
Of the Maine institute's more than 65 member businesses, eight are led by women -- about 12 percent. Even so, Wygant Fossett said that 40 to 50 women regularly participate in the institute's training and leadership-development programs.
The institute has created a number of programs aimed at women executives in recent years, she said. It even has a program to teach golf to its female members who aren't proficient at the game.
"A lot of times in the business world, a lot of work is done on the golf course," Wygant Fossett said.
The institute started a Women's Affinity Group in 2011 to specifically address some of the issues that confront women in leadership positions within family-run businesses. The group members offer support and advice to each other and an opportunity to collaborate, offering encouragement not only as women, but as leaders in family-run businesses, which often don't survive past the third generation.
One reason more women are being groomed to take over the family business is that women have surpassed men as the gender more likely to enroll in college, said Jane Hilburt-Davis, institute president emeritus and board member.
In 2012, the share of young women enrolled in college immediately after high school was 71 percent, compared with 61 percent for young men, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. Just a decade earlier, the share of young men and women enrolling in college was roughly the same.
Hilburt-Davis, president of Key Resources LLC, a consulting firm advising family-business owners, said they often look to the best-educated child as the lead candidate for succession. In a growing number of cases, that child is a daughter.
"Twenty years from now, we know more women will be leading family-owned businesses than men," she said.
Although some daughters are poised to take over national firms, as Abigail Johnson, granddaughter of Fidelity Investments founder Edward C. Johnson II, did in 2014, it is much more common for women to take over smaller, family-run companies where the hierarchy isn't as deep. Nationally, only 4.8 percent of Fortune 500 companies were headed by women in 2014.
Lindsay Gifford Skilling, general manager of Skowhegan-based Gifford's Famous Ice Cream, always hoped to work for the premium ice cream business started by her grandparents and developed further into the company it is today by her father and uncle.
"I knew at a young age that I wanted to join the family business, if they'd have me," she said.
Gifford Skilling earned a bachelor's degree in business administration and in 2006 joined Gifford's as assistant to the controller. Since then, she has risen rapidly to the top management position. Her brother, John Chester "JC" Gifford Jr., and sister, Samantha Gifford, also hold leadership positions within the company.
Gifford's, which is closing in on annual production of 2 million gallons of ice cream per year, is sold at its five ice cream stands and at hundreds of grocery stores, independent ice cream shops, colleges, universities and restaurants as far west as Nevada.
Gifford Skilling, who is 31, said it was intimidating at first to be a young female executive in an industry dominated by men. But with support from her family and an eagerness to learn, she developed the confidence to run a successful and fast-growing business.
"My dad and uncle just kind of saw something in me, I guess, so here I am," she said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers are considering a group of ideas to pay for long-neglected road and bridge repairs that range from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles.
The problem, which Maine shares with the rest of the country, is that modern fuel-efficient vehicles -- especially electric and hybrid cars -- are using less gas and driving down revenue from the gas tax. And that decline is contributing to crumbling rural roads in Maine, which on Tuesday was rated among the 10 states that have the worst bridges and rural roads in the country.
On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee weighed funding alternatives that include repealing the state's gas tax and replacing it with a flat road tax, surcharges on electric and hybrid vehicles, and a seasonal gas tax designed to extract more revenue from summer tourists.
Gov. Paul LePage also made note of the dilemma during a news conference held at the State House last week. The governor noted that fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles have produced a steady decline in gas tax collections.
"A lot of people are getting freebies," he said. "Do you go with a gas tax or do you go with a road tax? I don't know."
About 61 percent of the state's Highway Fund is derived from the gasoline tax. Gas tax collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen along with the declining revenue. In the meantime, projects lined up in the state's capital improvement plan have languished as the transportation agency struggles to maintain the existing infrastructure.
The Legislature is expected to adopt a largely status quo transportation budget of $627 million for the next two years. The budget includes $73.2 million for improvements in highways and bridges, but none for the projects identified by the Maine Department of Transportation's capital plan.
While LePage has applauded his agency's efforts to stretch limited dollars, independent surveys assessing Maine's road infrastructure continue to deliver bad news.
On Thursday, the national research group TRIP released a report that described Maine's bridges and rural roads as among the worst in the nation. TRIP, which promotes policies that reduce traffic congestion, said 26 percent of Maine's rural roads have pavement that is in poor condition, and that only seven other states have roads that are worse.
The report also found that 15 percent of the state's rural bridges are structurally deficient. Only eight other states have a higher percent of deficient bridges, according to the report.
Maine's standing in both categories is unchanged from a year ago.
Rural roads, highways and bridges are funded by a combination of local, state and federal governments. Federal funds for highway and transit improvements are generated largely through an 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.
According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges. The American Association of State Highway and Transporation Officials, or AASHTO, recommended increasing the federal funding from $88 billion to $120 billion. AASHTO said the current backlog in projects totals $740 billion.
Political gridlock has erected daunting barriers to a long-term funding solution in Congress. Federal lawmakers openly have lamented the condition of the nation's transportation infrastructure, but little has been done to correct it. The current federal highway budget is due to expire at the end of the month.
The federal gas tax has been the same since October 1993. Raising it is considered a political liability for lawmakers in both parties. Additionally, policymakers have been unable to coalesce behind alternative funding solutions.
The situation is not much different in Maine. Collections from the state's 30-cent gas tax have fallen with the increased prevalence of fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the state's revenue predicament is also partially self-inflicted.
In 2011, LePage signed the Republican-controlled Legislature's proposal that halted the state's indexing of the gas tax to adjust for inflation.
Republicans reasoned that Maine's gas tax was already too high. At 30 cents per gallon, it's currently third-highest in New England.
Some Maine lawmakers are open to restoring the inflation indexing for the gas tax, but there are those who wonder if the primary funding mechanism for Maine's roads and bridges is due for an overhaul.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is the lead sponsor of L.D. 1110. The proposal is a concept draft, meaning it doesn't recommend a specific funding mechanism for the Highway Fund. However, McLean told lawmakers on the Transportation Committee during an April 28 public hearing that "the way we fund our transportation projects is at a crossroads." He noted that according to a briefing from Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, the money collected from the gas tax can fund the engineering and design of road and bridge projects, but not actual construction.
"Think about it," McLean said. "Unless we come up with a bond or some other manipulation of Highway Fund dollars, we don't have a penny to spend on a road or a bridge. Nothing. Imagine what will happen to the (DOT) work plan if we don't have any money to build a bridge or road."
For now, state lawmakers have been unable to overcome their ambivalence. On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Transportation Committee moved to carry over McLean's bill to next year. They unanimously voted to accept a different bill, L.D. 706, which creates a commission to study how the state should fund its transportation infrastructure.
McLean remained hopeful the commission would develop a strategy that's "economically and politically feasible."
"There are a lot of solutions out there," he said, adding that a lack of political courage in Washington, D.C., had forced states to act.
LePage, meanwhile, has resorted to proposing state borrowing projects to fund the transportation infrastructure. He has asked state lawmakers to approve L.D. 1415, a $175 million bond measure that would need the approval of voters if it clears the Legislature.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers advanced a bill Monday that would require legislative committees to read and review the annual reports of the 24 quasi-state agencies that the committees are charged with overseeing.
The bill was developed by the Government Oversight Committee and the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, the Legislature's watchdog agency. In 2011, the office conducted a high-profile investigation into the dealings of the Maine Turnpike Authority, a $41.2 million quasi-state agency that had engaged in inappropriate spending and governance practices. After the investigation of the turnpike authority, OPEGA and the oversight committee found that many quasi-state agencies failed to report their financial activities, including contract procurement and contributions to outside organizations, despite a reliance on state and federal taxes, grants or fees.
In 2012, the Legislature required more than two dozen agencies to file annual reports with the Legislature. However, OPEGA has since found that there's no mechanism requiring lawmakers to actually scrutinize the reports. It also found that the reports are not actively reviewed by the committees charged with overseeing the quasi-state agencies.
In many cases, the reports appear on the legislative calendar and are accepted without debate or comment.
Sen. Chris Johnson, D-Somerville, told the State and Local Government Committee on Monday that the oversight panel is concerned that "agencies might spend effort in producing these reports only to have them sit on shelves in the Legislature."
Ten of the quasi-state agencies are not subject to legislative budget review, meaning lawmakers do not review the expenditure of millions of dollars in public grants, fees or general fund money used by entities such as the Maine Port Authority, the Worker's Compensation Board or the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, the agency overseeing the redevelopment of the former Navy base in Brunswick.
In its 2014 report to the Legislature, the Maine Port Authority did not provide details of its operating budget. Instead, the agency responsible for developing marine and rail facilities provided a list of organizations to which it paid membership dues. The Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority provided far more details in its 2014 annual report, including sources of revenue and an outline of its $10.4 million operating expenditures. However, the agency is not subject to a legislative budget review. It's also unclear if lawmakers on the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee have thoroughly reviewed the agency's annual report.
The bill, L.D. 1395, would make such a review mandatory for the committees with jurisdiction over the agencies. In addition to scrutinizing the annual reports, the committees would then send an overview of the annual reports to the Government Oversight Committee. The latter panel is charged with reviewing the operations of state government, and if necessary, authorizing investigations by OPEGA.
OPEGA has reviewed several quasi-state agencies over the past several years, including the Maine Turnpike Authority and the Maine State Housing Authority, both of which are included in the list of agencies that must now file annual reports with the Legislature. In March, the Government Oversight Committee authorized OPEGA to conduct an audit of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, the agency that operates the Amtrak Downeaster.
The State and Local Government Committee unanimously endorsed L.D. 1395 after a brief public hearing. The bill will now go to the full Legislature for floor votes.

Texto completo:   Two charged with breaking into trooper's garage over the weekend.
Missing kayak on Craigslist leads to late night police search, arrests
Three people are facing charges in connection with a break-in at a Maine State Police trooper's home garage last week in West Gardiner and stealing ammunition, police patches and a jacket in an attempt to get money for drugs.
Dustin Woodworth, 29, of Augusta, and Ian Watson, 27, and Sarah Giampetro, 25, both of Farmingdale, were arrested early Sunday morning, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said in a news release.
Woodworth and Watson are charged with burglary, felony theft and criminal mischief. Giampetro is charged with unlawful possession of prescription medication.
Trooper Tim Black, of the Maine State Police, on Thursday discovered the break-in at the garage of his West Gardiner home. Maine State Police Trooper Adam McNaughton, who investigated the burglary, wrote in court documents that the burglars got in by breaking a door. The burglars also spray-painted a window black.
Black described a missing kayak and two mountain bicycles. Detectives were able to recover fingerprints from the can of spray paint and a DNA swab, McNaughton wrote.
Black called McNaughton on Saturday after finding the kayak on Craigslist. McNaughton did his own search to find the kayak, which was being sold in Chelsea for $400. McNaughton set up a meeting with the seller, later identified as 29-year-old Brandon Maxim. He initially told McNaughton and Black that he no longer had use of the kayak.
"Brandon informed me that he did not want the kayak anymore because his girlfriend wanted him to sell it because they live paycheck to paycheck," McNaughton wrote.
Maxim changed his story once he learned that McNaughton and Black were from the state police and that the kayak was stolen.
Maxim said he bought the kayak Thursday from Woodworth for $140.
Maxim said he did not know the kayak was stolen, McNaughton wrote. Last month, Maxim placed an ad on Facebook looking for a kayak, McNaughton wrote. Woodworth reportedly answered that ad Thursday morning, sending pictures of the kayak.
"Brandon also said that Dustin was selling ammunition, but did not know what kind or caliber," McNaughton wrote.
Police searched Woodworth's home at 12:45 a.m. Sunday. Woodworth, who was home at the time, admitted that he and Watson had stolen items from the garage over two nights, McNaughton wrote.
Woodworth said he had sold most of the ammunition, McNaughton wrote, but still had the bulletproof vest, pepper spray and one of the mountain bikes.
The stolen bike, foreign money and the bulletproof vest were found in Watson's Gardiner home, McNaughton wrote.
"Troopers say the money was being used to buy drugs," McCausland said.
Watson and Woodworth were being held at the Kennebec County jail in lieu of $20,000 cash bail. Both appeared before a judge Monday afternoon and their bail was reduced, but both were still at the jail as of Tuesday afternoon.
Watson was being held in lieu of $750 cash bail or $100 cash with a Maine Pretrial Services contract, and Woodworth was being held in lieu of $750 cash bail or $500 cash with a pretrial contract.
Giampetro is free on $200 cash bail.

Missing kayak on Craigslist leads to late-night police search, arrests
Three people are facing charges in connection with a break-in at a Maine State Police trooper's home garage last week in West Gardiner and stealing ammunition, police patches and a jacket in an attempt to get money for drugs.
Dustin Woodworth, 29, of Augusta, and Ian Watson, 27, and Sarah Giampetro, 25, both of Farmingdale, were arrested early Sunday morning, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said in a news release.
Woodworth and Watson are charged with burglary, felony theft and criminal mischief. Giampetro is charged with unlawful possession of prescription medication.
Trooper Tim Black, of the Maine State Police, on Thursday discovered the break-in at the garage of his West Gardiner home. Maine State Police Trooper Adam McNaughton, who investigated the burglary, wrote in court documents that the burglars got in by breaking a door. The burglars also spray-painted a window black.
Black described a missing kayak and two mountain bicycles. Detectives were able to recover fingerprints from the can of spray paint and a DNA swab, McNaughton wrote.
Black called McNaughton on Saturday after finding the kayak on Craigslist. McNaughton did his own search to find the kayak, which was being sold in Chelsea for $400. McNaughton set up a meeting with the seller, later identified as 29-year-old Brandon Maxim. He initially told McNaughton and Black that he no longer had use of the kayak.
"Brandon informed me that he did not want the kayak anymore because his girlfriend wanted him to sell it because they live paycheck to paycheck," McNaughton wrote.
Maxim changed his story once he learned that McNaughton and Black were from the state police and that the kayak was stolen. Maxim said he bought the kayak Thursday from Woodworth for $140.
Maxim said he did not know the kayak was stolen, McNaughton wrote. Last month, Maxim placed an ad on Facebook looking for a kayak, McNaughton wrote.
Woodworth reportedly answered that ad Thursday morning, sending pictures of the kayak.
"Brandon also said that Dustin was selling ammunition, but did not know what kind or caliber," McNaughton wrote.
Police searched Woodworth's home at 12:45 a.m. Sunday. Woodworth, who was home at the time, admitted that he and Watson had stolen items from the garage over two nights, McNaughton wrote. Woodworth said he had sold most of the ammunition, McNaughton wrote, but still had the bulletproof vest, pepper spray and one of the mountain bikes. The stolen bike, foreign money and the bulletproof vest were found in Watson's Gardiner home, McNaughton wrote.
"Troopers say the money was being used to buy drugs," McCausland said.
Watson and Woodworth were being held at the Kennebec County jail in lieu of $20,000 cash bail. Both appeared before a judge Monday afternoon and their bail was reduced, but both were still at the jail as of Tuesday afternoon.
Watson was being held in lieu of $750 cash bail or $100 cash with a Maine Pretrial Services contract, and Woodworth was being held in lieu of $750 cash bail or $500 cash with a pretrial contract.
Giampetro is free on $200 cash bail.

Resumen: University of Maine athletic officials had just announced Tuesday the field of teams they'll be hosting in the 2015 Ice Breaker college hockey tournament in Portland when discussion shifted to an even bigger prize. What about landing an NCAA regional tournament at Cross Insurance Arena? "We're looking at this as an opportunity to show that we can host these events if people are into supporting it," said Seth Woodcock, the Black Bears' Associate Director of Athletic Development.

Texto completo:   University of Maine athletic officials had just announced Tuesday the field of teams they'll be hosting in the 2015 Ice Breaker college hockey tournament in Portland when discussion shifted to an even bigger prize.
What about landing an NCAA regional tournament at Cross Insurance Arena?
"We're looking at this as an opportunity to show that we can host these events if people are into supporting it," said Seth Woodcock, the Black Bears' Associate Director of Athletic Development. "The goal here isn't to get a regional. The goal is to host the Ice Breaker tournament and kill it. And we're hoping it shows we're capable of hosting other things as well."
The four-team event - considered the kickoff of the college hockey season - is in its 19th year. This is the second time Maine has hosted the event, which was held in Orono in 2001. Maine also competed in 2005 and 2012.
The Black Bears will play Michigan State at 8 p.m. Oct. 9 and North Dakota at 8 p.m. Oct. 10 at the CIA. Lake Superior State is the fourth team in the field, and will play in the early game those days, at 4:30 p.m.
Maine Coach Red Gendron, heading into his third season, was responsible for securing the other three teams in the field and is excited about providing an early test for his team, which finished 14-22-3 last winter.
"I want to schedule teams that are going to be challenging for us and exciting for our fans. I'm not trying to build wins into my schedule. We have to learn to win those games," Gendron said.
Maine will follow up its Ice Breaker appearance with two games the following weekend at Union College, the 2014 national champions, and then a rare Tuesday game at Quinnipiac.
"Double-button your chinstrap, let's go. That's Maine hockey, thank you very much," Gendron said.
"If we're going to be great again, I'm not going to do it the easy way."
Michigan State was 17-16-2 last season, while North Dakota finished 29-10-3 and reached the NCAA Frozen Four. North Dakota will be guided by first-year coach Brad Berry after Dave Hakstol was hired by the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday. Lake Superior State, which will be making its Ice Breaker debut, has a history with Maine. The Lakers ousted the Black Bears from the NCAA tournament in their first meeting in 1988. Five years later, Maine rallied to beat the Lakers for the 1993 national championship.
Tickets for the Ice Breaker will cost $25 for one night and $45 for both evenings. They go on sale June 7 via Ticketmaster.
Big crowds will be crucial to help Maine recoup the cost of hosting the tournament, but also to show the NCAA that Portland is a viable market for NCAA regional tournaments.
CIA's capacity is 6,733.
Maine's bid for the 2015 event was accepted two years ago. The school paid a $75,000 guarantee to College Hockey Inc., which manages the Ice Breaker on behalf of the Hockey Commissioners Association. Maine also must pay $15,000 to the three visiting schools, plus provide 17 hotel rooms for each.
Offsetting those costs will be ticket sales plus corporate sponsorships. Gorham Savings Bank has signed on as the title sponsor.
The games are not yet scheduled to be televised. NESN had a conflict with those dates. ESPN3 is willing to live-stream the games, but Maine would have to provide the production. It's also possible the university could make the games available on its normal networks of Fox College Sports, WPME in Portland and WVII in Bangor. That decision will be made within a few weeks.
In the meantime, the Ice Breaker is leading to thoughts of more games potentially being held at the renovated CIA, which now has the four locker rooms required for such tournaments. Maine will also play New Hampshire at the Portland arena again this winter.
"We just thought it was a good opportunity to rally our alumni base down here in Portland, to show off Maine as a good tourist destination. We put on great events in Orono all year long. This is just kind of a chance for us to expand our footprint," Woodcock said.
"When you look at the regionals now and where they're held (including Providence, Rhode Island, and Manchester, New Hampshire, in March), we feel like we can compete. We feel like we have a fan base here that would embrace that opportunity. We'd like to be in the mix.
"We're going to continue to play games down here in Portland. We could be looking at some conference games here. We're not looking to move out of Alfond (Arena). We're not trying to send shock waves to our supporters in Orono."

Texto completo:   HALLOWELL -- The state of Maine will keep 10 acres at the Stevens School complex instead of giving it to the local school district, a move that could spur development but goes against the wishes of city councilors and neighbors.
It's the latest flashpoint in a debate about a parcel of open space abutting Pleasant Street that is wrapped up in the state's latest effort to sell the largely vacant 64-acre campus off Winthrop Street, where Regional School Unit 2 leases its headquarters.
The district has long been discussing a land transfer with the state for the 8 acres on which its office stands and 14 acres of open space behind it. But the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services and RSU 2 have agreed to keep 10 acres of the open portion in the state's hands, with department spokesman David Heidrich saying the move "may better fit with our plans" for marketing the rest of the campus, which he said "are undetermined at present."
In February, Hallowell city councilors stood by an earlier endorsement of transferring all of that land to the district. That vote came after residents of Page and Pleasant streets expressed concern that development on the parcel could change their neighborhood.
Sharon Treat, a former Democratic legislator from Pleasant Street, said water running downhill from the parcel already affects homes on the street, a problem that could worsen if land is paved.
"We're just kind of sitting ducks here in the neighborhood," she said. "It seems like we don't have a lot of say over it."
Under the deal's current calculus, the school district would get a total of 12 acres.
An appraisal of the agreed-upon parcel of land is set for this week, and both Heidrich and RSU 2 board chairwoman Dawn Gallagher, of Hallowell, said a final agreement might be reached by the end of summer. The district has been passive on whether it would take the full 14 acres. Gallagher said the school district -- which consists of Hallowell, Farmingdale, Richmond, Dresden and Monmouth -- was willing to take the land if the community wanted to keep it public, but "it doesn't really matter to us" as long as RSU 2 gets its office and a suitable land buffer.
Councilor Alan Stearns, who lives on Pleasant Street, said the state's move to keep 10 acres calls into question its willingness to collaborate with Hallowell and Mayor Mark Walker's "ability to shape the state's approach to this parcel." But Heidrich said Hallowell "remains a valued stakeholder and will continue to be involved in the property's disposition to the greatest extent practical."
Walker, who has been working with state officials on a sale plan, said there will be "plenty of opportunities" for the city to oversee development on the land, and he said stormwater improvements should be included in any developer's plans for the property, which the city would have to review.
"I don't think they're working against our interests at all," the mayor said of the state.
The RSU deal is one part of the state's plan to shed the complex, which it tried to sell to no avail in 2008. The last state offices at the complex haven't left yet, and the property isn't yet on the market.
Still, the local concerns have been an early hurdle. Stearns said the city has "acted as if this is a municipal discussion, when in fact the state has a very big role in what happens to the Stevens School," adding that he's "not convinced that the state is working with the mayor and the process the mayor has described to the city."
However, Walker said some city and state interests are the same and that getting the property into the hands of a developer and on the city's tax rolls should be a main goal.
"That's not in the city of Hallowell's interest, to let that complex sit there undeveloped," he said. "We need to find somebody to take that over."

Resumen: Gas tax collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen along with the declining revenue. According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Maine lawmakers are considering a group of ideas to pay for long-neglected road and bridge repairs that range from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles.
The problem, which Maine shares with the rest of the country, is that modern fuel-efficient vehicles -- especially electric and hybrid cars -- are using less gas and driving down revenue from the gas tax. And that decline is contributing to crumbling rural roads in Maine, which on Tuesday was rated among the 10 states that have the worst bridges and rural roads in the country.
On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Legislature's Transportation Committee weighed funding alternatives that include repealing the state's gas tax and replacing it with a flat road tax, surcharges on electric and hybrid vehicles, and a seasonal gas tax designed to extract more revenue from summer tourists.
Gov. Paul LePage also made note of the dilemma during a news conference held at the State House last week. The governor noted that fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles have produced a steady decline in gas tax collections.
"A lot of people are getting freebies," he said. "Do you go with a gas tax or do you go with a road tax? I don't know."
About 61 percent of the state's Highway Fund is derived from the gasoline tax. Gas tax collections have fallen steadily from a 24-year peak in 2006. Since 2011, money spent on roads and bridges has fallen along with the declining revenue. In the meantime, projects lined up in the state's capital improvement plan have languished as the transportation agency struggles to maintain the existing infrastructure.
The Legislature is expected to adopt a largely status quo transportation budget of $627 million for the next two years. The budget includes $73.2 million for improvements in highways and bridges, but none for the projects identified by the Maine Department of Transportation's capital plan.
While LePage has applauded his agency's efforts to stretch limited dollars, independent surveys assessing Maine's road infrastructure continue to deliver bad news.
On Thursday, the national research group TRIP released a report that described Maine's bridges and rural roads as among the worst in the nation. TRIP, which promotes policies that reduce traffic congestion, said 26 percent of Maine's rural roads have pavement that is in poor condition, and that only seven other states have roads that are worse.
The report also found that 15 percent of the state's rural bridges are structurally deficient. Only eight other states have a higher percent of deficient bridges, according to the report.
Maine's standing in both categories is unchanged from a year ago.
Rural roads, highways and bridges are funded by a combination of local, state and federal governments. Federal funds for highway and transit improvements are generated largely through an 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.
According to TRIP, "a significant boost in investment" is needed to improve the nation's highways, roads and bridges. The American Association of State Highway and Transporation Officials, or AASHTO, recommended increasing the federal funding from $88 billion to $120 billion. AASHTO said the current backlog in projects totals $740 billion.
Political gridlock has erected daunting barriers to a long-term funding solution in Congress. Federal lawmakers openly have lamented the condition of the nation's transportation infrastructure, but little has been done to correct it. The current federal highway budget is due to expire at the end of the month.
The federal gas tax has been the same since October 1993. Raising it is considered a political liability for lawmakers in both parties. Additionally, policymakers have been unable to coalesce behind alternative funding solutions.
The situation is not much different in Maine. Collections from the state's 30-cent gas tax have fallen with the increased prevalence of fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the state's revenue predicament is also partially self-inflicted.
In 2011, LePage signed the Republican-controlled Legislature's proposal that halted the state's indexing of the gas tax to adjust for inflation.
Republicans reasoned that Maine's gas tax was already too high. At 30 cents per gallon, it's currently third-highest in New England.
Some Maine lawmakers are open to restoring the inflation indexing for the gas tax, but there are those who wonder if the primary funding mechanism for Maine's roads and bridges is due for an overhaul.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is the lead sponsor of L.D. 1110. The proposal is a concept draft, meaning it doesn't recommend a specific funding mechanism for the Highway Fund. However, McLean told lawmakers on the Transportation Committee during an April 28 public hearing that "the way we fund our transportation projects is at a crossroads." He noted that according to a briefing from Maine Department of Transportation Commissioner David Bernhardt, the money collected from the gas tax can fund the engineering and design of road and bridge projects, but not actual construction.
"Think about it," McLean said. "Unless we come up with a bond or some other manipulation of Highway Fund dollars, we don't have a penny to spend on a road or a bridge. Nothing. Imagine what will happen to the (DOT) work plan if we don't have any money to build a bridge or road."
For now, state lawmakers have been unable to overcome their ambivalence. On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Transportation Committee moved to carry over McLean's bill to next year. They unanimously voted to accept a different bill, L.D. 706, which creates a commission to study how the state should fund its transportation infrastructure.
McLean remained hopeful the commission would develop a strategy that's "economically and politically feasible."
"There are a lot of solutions out there," he said, adding that a lack of political courage in Washington, D.C., had forced states to act.
LePage, meanwhile, has resorted to proposing state borrowing projects to fund the transportation infrastructure. He has asked state lawmakers to approve L.D. 1415, a $175 million bond measure that would need the approval of voters if it clears the Legislature.

Texto completo:   By Lance Tapley
A prominent Democratic legislator who has been pushing for looser state environmental regulations that would allow an Irving family company to mine Bald Mountain in northern Maine received $150,000 in debt relief from another Irving company.
Bankruptcy filings show that state Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, owed Irving Oil $250,000 for gasoline and diesel deliveries and other charges to a convenience store he co-owned under the corporate name Eagle Lake Outfitters in his hometown. The debt was first revealed in a 2012 news story by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting about Martin and a partner filing for bankruptcy protection for their store.
The resolution of the bankruptcy and official reduction of the debt, which the court approved in March 2014, has not previously been reported. Federal bankruptcy court papers show that Irving Oil made a legal motion that resulted in the company receiving only 40 percent - a little over $100,000 - of the amount it claimed was owed by Martin and his business partner.
Martin, 73, the former longtime House speaker, sits on the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, where he has promoted changes to mining laws to allow J.D. Irving to excavate an open-pit copper and zinc mine in his district, which includes Fort Kent. In 2012, Martin introduced the first bill to make it easier to mine for valuable minerals on Bald Mountain.
Martin refused to provide information about the bankruptcy when he was asked for details by a MCPIR reporter outside the environment committee hearing room in the State House complex.
"It's none of your business," he replied. "I don't give a (expletive) what you want. You work for a lousy outfit of people, and I have no intent of talking to you or them. Is that clear?"
Maine's ethics laws for legislators do not specifically mention bankruptcy debt, nor do they require disclosure of any debt to a creditor incurred by a legislator-owned business.
Irving's proposed mine has been vigorously opposed by environmental and conservation groups - from the Natural Resources Council of Maine to Trout Unlimited - as well as some Aroostook County residents. On Friday, the environment committee voted to pass the mining legislation, with Martin and fellow Democratic Rep. Robert S. Duchesne of Hudson joining the six committee Republicans in favor of the bill. The remaining four committee Democrats and one independent, Portland Rep. Ben Chipman, voted against the bill.
MARTIN: NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Martin said in 2012 that there was no conflict of interest between what his store owed Irving Oil and his promotion of J.D. Irving's interests because the two Canadian conglomerates are legally separate - a point also stressed by a spokesman for J.D. Irving.
Each of the two octogenarian Irving brothers controls one of the distinct business empires, and in recent years the media have chronicled how their personal and business relationships have cooled. But an expert on the Irving companies said the two corporate entities - famous for being secretive - also work together. "Yes, they do cooperate still," said Jacques Poitras, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent and author of the 2014 book "Irving vs. Irving."
Irving Oil was Eagle Lake Outfitters' largest creditor. Headquartered in Saint John, the oil company is the central unit of a set of corporations owned by billionaire Arthur L. Irving. His brother and fellow billionaire James "J.K." Irving owns J.D. Irving. Also based in Saint John, it's the largest of many companies overseen by James D. Irving, J. K's son. Vast timberlands in New Brunswick and Maine constitute the core of their businesses. Bald Mountain is located within J.D. Irving's 1,250,000 Maine acres, a holding that makes it the largest landowner in Maine.
Environmentalists fear water pollution from the proposed mine could ruin the relatively unspoiled character of a big part of the North Woods. Besides valuable metals, the mountain has significant amounts of arsenic and sulfide minerals that could contaminate the water table.
Opponents also fear that changes being considered to the mining law would allow other areas in Maine to be mined, including public lands used for recreation.
The Natural Resources Council says that mines throughout the world - including two that operated in Hancock County in the mid-20th century - have a record of pollution, often leaving the public on the hook for costly cleanups.
But J.D. Irving and its supporters argue that contemporary technology can create a non-polluting mine and that a poor part of the state would benefit from the 300 jobs the company says would be created, plus 400 indirect jobs because of increased economic activity in the area. Martin has said that he supports the Bald Mountain development because it would bring jobs to Aroostook County.
Gov. Paul LePage and his Department of Environmental Protection, business groups and many Republican legislators strongly support Irving's mining proposal.
BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT
The bankruptcy papers show that Eagle Lake Outfitters' creditors other than Irving were owed a total of $45,000. Martin's partner, Gary Voisine, wouldn't divulge details about the bankruptcy, but said debts with all the creditors had been settled.
A representative of Tulsa Inc., a gas station and "petroleum services" firm in Van Buren, which was owed $21,000, said it had been paid. A spokesperson for the state Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department said it had been paid the $2,200 it was owed for license fees. Several other creditors did not return phone calls.
In the bankruptcy settlement, Martin and Voisine paid $125,000. Of that, $101,343 went to Irving, and the balance went to court fees and other creditors. Martin and Voisine each own 50 percent of the store
In 2012, Martin told the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting that he and Voisine bought back the Route 11 store for $125,000 they got from "private business equity," but would not elaborate.
Asked about the arrangement, Voisine said "how I pay off stuff" was not the media's business.
He angrily denied that there had been any "deal" with the Irving companies. He said "we never owed" $250,000 to Irving Oil but only $100,000. The company had jacked up the amount owed with "lawyer fees for years" and "a bunch of" other charges, he said.
Anthony Banford, a spokesman for Irving Oil, responded: "It's on the public record that a judgment was granted by a Maine Court in Irving Oil's favor against Eagle Lake Outfitters for amounts the court agreed were owed to our company." Banford added that Irving Oil and J.D. Irving are "two separate companies, operated completely independently." He did not directly address the question of why the company accepted only 40 percent of what it said it was owed.
Martin's bankruptcy and involvement with the Irving companies were reported during his 2012 campaign for re-election to the House. Following that revelation, he was defeated by a political newcomer. He retook the seat in November. In the 1990s, a ballot-stuffing scandal sent a Martin aide to jail and cost the veteran legislator the speakership.
Jonathan Wayne, director of the state's Commission on Governmental Ethics and Elections Practices, would not comment on the situation with Martin and Irving. Maine ethics laws don't specifically mention bankruptcy debt. When asked whether any sections of the ethics laws could apply, Wayne said two sections that address whether a legislator is using his public position to benefit himself or another entity might.
The first one states that it is a violation of legislative ethics when "a Legislator or a member of the Legislator's immediate family accepts gifts, other than campaign contributions duly recorded as required by law, from persons affected by legislation or who have an interest in an entity affected by proposed legislation and the Legislator knows or reasonably should know that the purpose of the donor in making the gift is to influence the Legislator ... or is intended as a reward for action on the Legislator's part."
The second section that could apply states that it is a violation of legislative ethics for a legislator to engage in conduct that constitutes an abuse of office or position. That includes "granting or obtaining special privilege, exemption or preferential treatment to or for oneself or another, which privilege, exemption or treatment is not readily available to members of the general community or class to which the beneficiary belongs."
The current House speaker, Democrat Mark Eves, declined to comment when asked whether he thinks Martin's actions constitute a conflict of interest.
Rep. Benjamin Chipman, the Portland independent who sits next to Martin in the Environment and Natural Resources Committee room, said Martin probably doesn't see the debt reduction and his sponsorship of the mining bill as a conflict of interest.
"But other people see it that way," Chipman said. The Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service based in Augusta, can be contacted at: pinetreewatchdog@gmail.com Web: www.pinetreewatchdog.org

Texto completo:   Where you live can affect how likely you are to marry. It's not just a matter of certain geographies correlating with marriage rates; different places actually have causal roles, according to a New York Times analysis of data compiled by Harvard economists.
What's equallyfascinating is how the political affiliation of a place contributes to marriage rates. Liberal areas tend to discourage marriage, while conservative areas tend to encourage it.
"Spending childhood nearly anywhere in blue America -- especially liberal bastions like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington -- makes people about 10 percentage points less likely to marry relative to the rest of the country. And no place encourages marriage quite like the conservative Mountain West, especially the heavily Mormon areas of Utah, southern Idaho and parts of Colorado," wrote David Leonhardt and Kevin Quealy for The Times.
Here's a graphic (with Kennebec County highlighted) that shows the marriage rates for all counties plotted by how the county voted in the 2012 presidential election. The size of the bubbles represents population.
So it makes sense, given Maine's relatively middle-of-the-road political affiliation, that it makes marriage only slightly (0.5 percentage points) more likely.The researchers also discovered that cities tend to discourage marriage, while rural areas and small towns tend to encourage it.
Children growing up in Aroostook, Washington, Franklin or Piscataquis counties -- some of the most rural and conservative parts of Maine -- are 3 percentage points more likely to be married by age 26 than if they grew up in an "average place." They are 2 percentage points more likely to be married by age 26 if they grew up in Penobscot, Lincoln, Androscoggin or Somerset counties. And they are 2 percentage points less likely to be married if they grew up in more-liberal Cumberland County.
Oxford, York, Knox and Hancock counties apparently have no real effect on marriage rates, while children in Kennebec, Sagadahoc and Waldo counties are 1 percentage point more likely to be married by age 26 than if they grew up in an "average place."
The data line up with surveys. A Pew Research Center poll, for example, found that 59 percent of Republicans said society was better off when people made marriage and having children a priority, while only 35 percent of Democrats said so.
To determine the causal nature of place, researchers Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren studied 5 million children who moved during the 1980s and 1990s. They tracked those who grew up and were less or more likely to marry than similar people who grew up elsewhere. (They also examinedhow much they earned later in life, as we wrote about May 5.)
They were able totrack outcomes based on the age of the children when they first moved. The younger the children were who moved to New York, for instance, the less likely they were to marry by age 26.

What's the most distinctive cause of death in Maine?

Texto completo:   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a map showing the most distinctive causes of death for each state. In Louisiana, the sexually transmitted infection syphilis kills people at rates that make it unique. In Texas, it's the infectious disease tuberculosis.
And Maine? It's the flu. That's right, the preventable and treatable influenza makes Maine stand out.
To be clear, the distinctive causes of death for each state are outliers. As the CDC describes, the map is "predisposed to showing rare causes of death -- for 22 of the states, the total number of deaths mapped was under 100."
During the 2013-2014 season, 847 of 12,665 deaths (6.7 percent) reported to Maine's Electronic Death Registry System were attributed to pneumonia or influenza.
The CDC said it created the map "to present a more nuanced view of mortality variation within the United States than what can be seen by using only the 10 most common causes of death."
"Although chronic disease prevention efforts should continue to emphasize the most common conditions, an outlier map such as this one should also be of interest to public health professionals, particularly insofar as it highlights nonstandard cause-of-death certification practices within and between states that can potentially be addressed through education and training," the CDC wrote.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Maine Legislature on Tuesday unanimously voted in both the House and the Senate to override Gov. Paul LePage's veto of a bill that will allow the transfer of a moose permit to a hunter's family member in certain circumstances, according to a press release issued by the Senate Democratic Office.
The Senate voted 34-0 (with one member absent) to override the veto of LD 373, which sought to allow the commissioner of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife the ability to transfer a moose permit to family members under exceptional extenuating circumstances. Shortly afterward, the Maine House of Representatives overrode the veto in a 145-0 vote.
"The bill will become law 90 days after the Legislature adjourns sine die," according to the release.
Maine's moose permits are awarded to successful entrants in a state-run lottery. Some prospective hunters have entered the lottery for decades and never had their name drawn.
LePage had vetoed the bill, citing the long list of people who would be considered "family members" of a hunter, and saying he didn't want to change a system solely to benefit rare exceptions.
"This bill would authorize a person who receives a moose permit to transfer this permit to a family member, with 'family' being defined as a 'spouse, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, half-sister, half-brother or adopted child,'" LePage wrote in his veto letter, dated May 15. "I often hear complaints that Maine's hunting and fishing laws are too complicated and this bill simply compounds this problem by adding yet another wrinkle to our hunting laws."
In addition, LePage said the bill could lead to abuse of the existing system.
"More to the point, I also hear complaints from constituents who are frustrated that after applying for years, they are never drawn in the moose lottery," he wrote. "This bill, however, opens up a brand new avenue for families to engage in new schemes concerning the moose lottery to try to game this system in new and innovative ways."
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Dave Miramant of Camden, who filed the bill at the request of a constituent who was trying to help fulfill the dream of a man in his town who was dying of cancer, the news release said.
"I felt the suggestion made common sense and would help Maine hunters finding themselves in an unfortunate situation," Miramant said in the release. "I was surprised by the governor's objections, since the committee had worked hard to make sure that only those who fit the narrow circumstances would be allowed this privilege."
A previous version of this story misstated the Senate vote on LD 373. One member was absent, so the vote was 34-0, not 35-0.

Texto completo:   BELFAST, Maine -- Authorities are on the hunt for an alleged flim-flam man on the lam they believe stole more than half a million dollars from midcoast residents about six years ago.
A warrant was signed last week for the arrest of Robert J. Howarth, 61, who has several aliases, according to the Maine Attorney General's office. Investigators said that whether he was known as Howarth, as Robert Chiofolo, as Robert Kim Lee or as Robert Sachs, he came to the Belfast area from Massachusetts around early 2009, befriended people, then asked them to invest in his clothing business.
"He came to the area, claimed that he was a successful businessman, and seemed to back that up by having lots of cash, dressing really well and having nice things," Carrie Carney, an assistant attorney general, said Tuesday. "He convinced people to invest in his clothing business and said he'd give them significant returns on their investments."
He was so convincing, she said, that 17 people decided to invest with him. The sums of money he received from area folks ranged from $3,000 to $200,000, and Howarth is alleged to have gotten a total of $572,000 from them.
Carney said that Howarth told different people different things regarding how he would make his money, but in general he said he would buy last year's clothing from retailers at sharply reduced rates and then profitably resell the clothes overseas.
However, instead of doing this, she said, Howarth apparently left the area. As far as the Maine Office of Securities is concerned, he resurfaced in 2012 in York County, where he allegedly convinced a couple to invest $27,000 in his clothing business. York County is where Howarth first came to the attention of state and federal authorities, Carney said, and in March the York County Grand Jury charged Howarth with theft by deception, a Class B felony, and securities fraud, a Class C felony. A warrant has been issued for his arrest on those charges.
As federal investigators looked into the York County alleged theft, they learned about Howarth's Waldo County investors.
"The victims have been interviewed, and we've used that information to build our case," Carney said.
Howarth was indicted last week by the Waldo County Grand Jury and charged with theft by deception and securities fraud. According to the warrant issued for his arrest, bail on the Waldo County charges has been set at $100,000, and there is a nationwide request for his extradition.
Carney said that Howarth is white, 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighs 190 pounds and has brown hair and hazel eyes. She was trying to get a photograph of the alleged fraudster that could be shared with the media.
"We hope that we can find him, and that we can bring him to justice," she said. "We're hoping that he can make the victims whole, but I don't know what his means are."

Texto completo:   They are abundant, natural and springing up on plates at bistros, farmers market kiosks and on grocers' shelves. Ramps, also known as wild leeks, are at their peak in mid-May in parts of Maine. Like most things worth waiting for, the season is short, so don't hesitate for this taste of spring.
Foragers and fresh food distributors are leafing out with this garlicky edible, a member of the onion family, right now. In the next week, farm stands such as Jordan's Farm in Cape Elizabeth and stores such as Tiller and Rye in Brewer will begin selling ramps -- something they expect to continue until early June.
At the Crown O'Maine Organic Cooperative, a distributor of locally grown produce based in Vassalboro, employees are working diligently to get wild gathered ramps to eager customers this week.
"They will sell very fast," said Tammy Ember, a customer service and sales representative for the cooperative. "We will sell out in a matter of hours."
Ember helps chefs dream up ramp-inspired dishes. Her favorite is oyster mushrooms sauted with ramps and tucked into a tart with cheese, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper. She also suggests recipes such as wild ramp pesto from blog Food52 as gourmet go-tos.
"The taste is like a balanced mixture of garlic and onion. They're pungent, to say the very least," said Ember.
Wild foraged foods such as ramps and fiddleheads add variety to menus and offers something deeper.
"Our food system is getting so out of whack that more people are getting back in touch with food," said Frank Giglio, a trained chef who eats and forages seasonally on Three Lily Farm in Thorndike. "The seasons depict what I work with. Naturally I want to eat what's fresh and in season."
Giglio has been foraging ramps for years. To harvest sustainably, he picks only leaves (one from each stock) and returns in the fall to harvest the bulbs.
"They are the most succulent now," said Giglio, who rough chops the green leaves and sautes them in butter to give scrambled eggs more zest and frittatas added flair.
Though this "spring was a strange one," with several feet of snow that finally thawed, "now things are bursting," said Giglio.
Ramps are everywhere. But where to find them? A good rule of thumb is to look for their broad, green leaves near patches of fiddleheads.
"They grow in clusters, a large amount in small places," said Giglio. Investigate "sandy river banks or on the edge of the forest."
Though fiddleheads seem to be hogging the limelight, ramps are coming on as a popular spring ingredient. And for good reason. They are rich in vitamin A, B and have 2.6 times the amount of vitamin C as oranges per serving, according to the Delta Institute of Natural History.
What should you do with ramps?
"Brush them with olive oil, salt and pepper and a few chili flakes on the grill," said Ember, after trimming the hairy parts. Lay grilled ramps on top of pizza, or add slices to sandwiches with other roasted vegetables such as peppers.
"Ramps are more universal when grilling. You can also pickle the white burgundy bulbs," she said. "It's a great spring vegetable."
Look for ramps at these retailers starting Wednesday through early next week: Tiller and Rye in Brewer, Rising Tide Community Market in Damariscotta, Belfast Co-op, Jordan's Farm in Cape Elizabeth, Lois' Natural Marketplace in Portland and Scarborough and Rosemont Markets in Portland and Yarmouth.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Maine Attorney General Janet Mills has joined law enforcement officials from across the country to sue four phony cancer charities that allegedly scammed consumers out of more than $187 million.
Mills, along with officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Federal Trade Commission, jointly filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Arizona against Cancer Fund of America, Inc., Children's Cancer Fund of America, Inc., Cancer Support Services, Inc., The Breast Cancer Society, Inc., and their operators, according to a news release from her office.
The joint complaint alleges that most consumers' donations between 2008 and 2012 benefited only the operators of the nonprofit corporations, along with their families, friends, and professional fundraisers who often received at least 85 percent of each contribution. The charities posed as legitimate organizations with nationwide programs supporting cancer patients, according to the release.
Mills and the other plaintiffs claim the organizations misrepresented that contributions would be used for charity, specific program benefits, revenue and expenses related to international gifts-in-kind, and that the primary goal of their reported programs was to directly assist individuals in the U.S., the release states.
Five defendants -- Children's Cancer Fund, The Breast Cancer Society, Rose Perkins, James Reynolds II and Kyle Effler -- reached settlements that require the charities to dissolve and prohibit the individuals from fundraising or running any other charities.
"Through settlement with Children's Cancer Fund and The Breast Cancer Society, we have permanently stopped solicitations that were based on deceptive claims to consumers that their donations would assist children with cancer and breast cancer patients," Mills said in the release.
Mills said the plaintiffs were "committed to fight Cancer Fund of America, Cancer Support Services, and James Reynolds Sr." in court.
The four charities are registered with Maine's charitable solicitations program, which is designed to provide general information for public review and way for people to ask questions, express concerns or file complaints, according to Doug Dunbar, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation.
The program has no record of any consumer complaints against the organizations, he said. Program staff will review the settlement announced Tuesday and "take appropriate action regarding the registration of the entities named," he wrote in an email. The registrations of the other organizations not named in the settlement will be flagged and staff will monitor the pending court case, Dunbar said.
"People are urged to obtain details from more than one source before contributing to a charity, particularly one that is not well-known to the donor," he wrote.
To research a charity, call the Maine Office of Professional and Occupational Registration at 624-8603 or visit www.pfr.maine.gov/almsonline/almsquery/SearchCompany.aspx. Members of the public are encouraged to contact the Charitable Solicitations Program to express concerns or file a complaint regarding any organization's solicitations.

FOR 5:30 AM WEDNESDAY POST LePage's veto doctrine: No patience for studies, feel-good bills and piecemeal change

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage long ago established that he'll use the full breadth of his constitutional powers to advance the policy agenda he believes is best for Maine.
He has withheld voter-approved bonds, refused to nominate people for the Public Utilities Commission and Board of Corrections, and perhaps most noticeably, he issued more than 200 vetoes during his first four-and-a-half years as governor. As has been well reported, that is far more vetoes than any other governor in Maine history.
However, in the first 18 vetoes since his re-election, LePage has established another truth: there are certain kinds of bills that he'll veto every time. Here's a look at patterns that are emerging -- or in this case, re-emerging.
LePage, for the most part, does not support studies. Aside from probably the most infamous taxpayer-funded study in Maine history -- the Alexander Report, which LePage scuttled after revelations about plagiarism in its early phases -- numerous studies have fallen victim to LePage's veto pen. They have ranged from one on workplace bullying to another on whether Mainers are paying their fair share of taxes on items purchased online.
The pattern continued earlier this month when LePage vetoed LD 435, which would have continued a study of ways to reduce the threat of invasive green crabs to shellfish and lobsters. It's a concept LePage personally supported last year and which garnered unanimous legislative support this year. However, LePage's veto was upheld with a 16-19 vote in the Senate.
"Let's react to the data, not simply continue to extend this pilot," he wrote. "Now is the time to react to the information we have learned, not simply dither."
A recurring theme throughout LePage's veto letters on bills calling for studies involves his belief that if the Legislature wants a study, it should assign the work to legislative staff. A staunch defender of the executive branch's authority and autonomy, LePage bristles at the notion that administrators or staff under his purview should undertake studies proposed by legislators. It's part of his fervent and ongoing efforts to consolidate power in the governor's office.
He has no appetite for 'feel-good' bills. Evidence of this can be found in LePage's veto of LD 377, a bill that would clear the way for the state to provide low-interest loans to movie and television production companies that produce or shoot films in Maine. This is an issue that lawmakers have been trying to gain traction on for years. They have passed laws -- including LD 377, unanimously -- but have not attached any funding.
"This piece of legislation is simply a feel-good bill," wrote LePage. "Either we fund it or get rid of it. Doing neither one makes no sense."
Legislative action on LePage's veto of this bill is pending.
If there are going to be changes to the tax code this year, they'll be LePage's. Though he did not mention his intention to do so during last year's gubernatorial campaign, LePage has prioritized tax reform in his second term -- but he has signaled he'll support his own plan and no one else's.
Last month, the governor vetoed one bill that would have exempted library collaboratives from sales and service provider taxes and another bill that would have reduced registration fees and excise taxes on for for-hire vehicles for people with disabilities. Both were sustained by the Legislature. Then last week, LePage submitted a supplemental budget bill that included nearly identical language from the two vetoed bills.
"As you know, the Legislature is currently considering a comprehensive budget proposal that addresses our overall tax system and doesn't appear to have neared conclusion on those deliberations," wrote LePage in his veto letter, referring to his own biennial budget proposal. "Therefore, I do not believe it would be appropriate to support targeted exemptions on an isolated basis before the Legislature has acted."
If LePage's tax reform goals aren't supported by the Legislature -- which is looking more likely as the end of the fiscal year nears -- also going by the wayside will be the two bills LePage vetoed.
LePage vetoes bills from his own party. Though LePage has vetoed far more Democratic bills than Republican ones -- which to some degree is the result of Democrats forcing "the election is coming" bills on him that they knew he would oppose in 2013 and 2014 -- LePage has not hesitated to veto Republican bills. Four of the 18 bills LePage has vetoed this session were sponsored by Republicans.
LePage is using leverage from his convincing election win last year. Even though he did not make reducing or eliminating the state income tax a major campaign theme, LePage is acting like his win was a mandate to cut it.
"I do not believe it would be appropriate to support targeted exemptions on an isolated basis before the Legislature has acted comprehensively to address the issue of the sales tax and reduce the oppressive burden that the income tax has placed on families and businesses in Maine," wrote LePage in two veto letters this year. "That is why the Maine people elected us and why I have vetoed this bill today."
LePage has a scripted end to his vetoes. As if the reasoning within his letters is not enough, LePage ends the vast majority of his veto letters -- if not all of them -- with an identical phrase: "I strongly urge the Legislature to sustain it."

UMaine, Cross Insurance Arena to share Ice Breaker expenses, revenues

Resumen: The University of North Dakota, a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference that reached the Frozen Four last season, will take on Western Collegiate Hockey Association member Lake Superior State to open the tourney at 4:30 p.m., and Maine will face Big Ten school Michigan State at 8 p.m. The next day, Michigan State and Lake Superior State play at 4:30 p.m., and Maine and North Dakota face off at 8 p.m. Biberstein said the expenses shared by the school and Cross Insurance Arena will include $75,000 to College Hockey Inc., which manages the event on behalf of the Hockey Commissioners Association, along with $15,000 in travel expenses for each of the three visiting schools ($45,000 total) and $26,700 for three nights of hotel rooms for them ($8,670 apiece).

Texto completo:   The University of Maine and the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland will be sharing expenses and revenues from the 2015 Ice Breaker Tournament, according to Will Biberstein, the associate athletic director for internal operations at UMaine.
The men's college hockey tournament will be held Friday and Saturday, Oct. 9 and 10, and it will be a round-robin affair rather than a championship format.
Biberstein said when UMaine plays a regular-season game in Portland, the university simply rents the facility.
"This is an opportunity to expand our relationship with the Cross Insurance Arena," said Biberstein.
Global Spectrum manages the Cross Insurance Arena, as it does the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.
The University of North Dakota, a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference that reached the Frozen Four last season, will take on Western Collegiate Hockey Association member Lake Superior State to open the tourney at 4:30 p.m., and Maine will face Big Ten school Michigan State at 8 p.m.
The next day, Michigan State and Lake Superior State play at 4:30 p.m., and Maine and North Dakota face off at 8 p.m.
Biberstein said the expenses shared by the school and Cross Insurance Arena will include $75,000 to College Hockey Inc., which manages the event on behalf of the Hockey Commissioners Association, along with $15,000 in travel expenses for each of the three visiting schools ($45,000 total) and $26,700 for three nights of hotel rooms for them ($8,670 apiece).
Biberstein said the university and Cross Insurance Arena's revenues will include ticket sales, concessions and merchandise.
"It will all go into the revenue stream and, at the end of the day, we'll hopefully share the profits," said Biberstein.
The university's own expenses, including travel and hotel rooms, will come out of the profits.
The Cross Insurance Arena can hold 6,183 fans, and tickets will be $25 for a single session (two games) and a Gorham Savings Bank Power Play Pack at $45 for all four games.
Biberstein said they are working with Black Bear Sports Properties and Learfield Communications to try secure a television deal for the tournament.
"Ideally, we'd love to show all four games," said Biberstein. "It's a great college hockey matchup, and we'd love to bring more exposure to the Ice Breaker and Maine athletics."
Biberstein is optimistic that the tournament will be a money-maker, noting that fans have always turned out when the team played in Portland.
"If you go back through the numbers, when we play a high level of competition, Maine hockey fans come out and really support us. They want to see great college hockey, and with the field we've put together, they'll come out," said Biberstein.
Last year's game in Portland between Maine and New Hampshire drew a sellout crowd of 6,183. UNH won 7-4 to snap Maine's 15-game unbeaten streak in Portland (12-0-3).
The four schools have combined to win 15 NCAA Division I championships led by North Dakota's seven. Michigan State and Lake Superior State have each won three, and Maine has notched two.
"The field is phenomenal, and we have a history with each member," said Maine coach Red Gendron.
Michigan State's top scoring defenseman this past season was Travis Walsh, son of late Maine coach Shawn Walsh. He will be a senior in the fall.
Maine has played the other three schools in various Frozen Fours and won its first NCAA tournament in 1993 with a come-from-behind 5-4 win over Lake Superior State.
"This is going to be a fabulous event for the student-athletes, the visiting schools and all of our fans across the state," Gendron said. "We'll put our best foot forward for the state and for college hockey."
The Ice Breaker is an exempt tournament, meaning the games will count on their records but not toward the maximum 34 games allowed under NCAA regulations.
Biberstein and Gendron are hoping the Ice Breaker serves as a forerunner to placing a bid for an NCAA Regional.
"That is our long-term goal," said Biberstein, who noted that the recent $34 million renovation to the Cross Insurance Arena, which included the addition of locker rooms, will help their chances.

Resumen: Park opponents have said they fear a park would bring federal authority into Maine, cramp the state's forest products industries with tighter air-quality restrictions, generate only low-paying jobs and morph into a 3.2 million-acre park plan offered in the 1990s.

Texto completo:   EAST MILLINOCKET, Maine -- An organization opposed to the proposed 150,000-acre national park and recreation area will host an informational session on the proposal on Wednesday at Schenck High School.
Maine Woods Coalition President and Chairwoman Anne Mitchell, whose group is hosting the event, said she hopes it will draw a large crowd. She particularly wants to see undecided residents who will be voting in the town's nonbinding referendum on June 25.
"We want to present some information that hasn't been publicized widely," Mitchell said Tuesday.
The event is designed to counter an information session at Schenck hosted by leading park proponent Lucas St. Clair on April 16. Both came at the request of Board of Selectman Chairman Mark Scally after the board opted to hold the referendum, according to Selectman Mark Marston, the coalition's vice president. Scally wanted to ensure that residents were amply exposed to the issue before the referendum.
U.S. Sen. Angus King effectively revived the often-contentious national park debate when he asked Millinocket officials for their requirements for a park should congressional delegates write legislation seeking one. Millinocket officials revealed his request on Feb. 7.
St. Clair's proposal includes establishing a 75,000-acre national park and a 75,000-acre recreation area on family land east of Baxter State Park by 2016. St. Clair's mother, Roxanne Quimby, began a campaign to give 70,000 acres to the National Park Service in 2011.
Park opponents have said they fear a park would bring federal authority into Maine, cramp the state's forest products industries with tighter air-quality restrictions, generate only low-paying jobs and morph into a 3.2 million-acre park plan offered in the 1990s.
Proponents said a park would generate 400 to 1,000 jobs, be maintained by $40 million in private endowments, diversify a Katahdin region economy devastated by the closure of two paper mills, and coexist with existing industries.
Featured speakers at the coalition's forum will be Maine Forest Service director Doug Denico, sawmill owner Jim Robbins and Preserve Maine Traditions member Andrew Young, Marston said. Residents who own land that would be near or part of the proposed recreation area also will attend and may speak. A question period will follow the speakers.
Representatives of Rep. Bruce Poliquin and U.S. Sens. King and Susan Collins have said they will attend, Marston said.
Mitchell said that St. Clair declined the coalition's invitation to speak at the meeting. St. Clair's spokesman, David Farmer, said that St. Clair has an out-of-state engagement on Wednesday and that coalition leaders were aware of that when they scheduled the event.
St. Clair is working with town and coalition officials to schedule a forum or debate that would feature speakers from both sides, Farmer said.
The coalition opposes the park because its members believe that "the land the federal government would take for a 'National Park' is neither an uninhabited pristine forest nor a wasteland ruined by irresponsible forestry," according to mainewoodscoalition.org.
"It is, as it has been for hundreds of years, a healthy and beautiful multi-use woodland that is already extensively protected against over development, visual degradation and environmental abuse," the website states. "It is a treasured home to tens of thousands of native Mainers, seasonal visitors, and businesses, while providing a bountiful habitat for all of nature."
Park proponents are invited to attend the event and can speak at the podium. Residents from Brownville, Patten and Sherman have expressed interest in attending, Marston said.
"I hope everybody comes from all the towns. It is not just for the citizens here," Marston said of Wednesday's meeting.
The meeting is set for 6 p.m.

Texto completo:   BANGOR, Maine -- Something new has been uncorked for the third annual Tap into Summer, Bangor's beer festival. In addition to taps pouring only Maine-made craft beers, this year's festival will include Wine on the Waterfront, a companion festival showcasing Maine wines.
The Greater Bangor Convention & Visitors Bureau, which sponsors the annual Bangor Waterfront event, decided to add the new Wine on the Waterfront on the night before the beer festival at the request of patrons, Lee Speronis, board chair of the visitors bureau, said at an event announcing the two-day festival planned for June 19 and 20.
The two events coincide with performances by Train with The Fray on July 18 and Fall Out Boy on June 20, both at Darling's Waterfront Pavilion.
Wine on the Waterfront is scheduled for 5-8 p.m. June 19 and will include 20 wineries from across Maine.
"All are part of the Maine Wine Trail," said Elizabeth Sutherland of Sutherland-Weston Marketing & Communications at the press conference held at Nocturnem Draft Haus. "There is room for more. We'll also be featuring locally made cheese, meats and artisan breads," and chocolate.
Bangor's Stesha Cano will perform during the wine festival. Tickets for the wine festival cost $30 for advance purchase and $45 the day of the event.
The Crown Vics of Ellsworth will play at the beer festival, which kicks off the next day.
Lisa Sturgeon of Geaghan's Brothers Brewing said a lot of Maine brews will be pouring at the event.
"This year, we'll be joined by 21 other Maine breweries," she said.
The daylong June 20 event will feature two sessions -- a VIP tasting session from 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m. that will include exclusive beer sampling and lunch provided by Moe's BBQ, and a 1-5 p.m. general session with food available for sale from Moe's, Granny's Grilled Cheese and Taco Trio.
VIP tickets for the beer festival are $50 each and are only available for advance purchase. General session tickets are $25 in advance and $40 at the gate.
The best thing about Bangor's beer festival is that attendees really care about what they are drinking, said brewmaster Andy Geaghan.
"They want to talk about the product and meet the brewers," Geaghan said.
The list of breweries includes well-known Maine breweries such as Allagash Brewing Co., Belfast Bay Brewery and Geary's, as well as newcomers such as Orono Brewing Co. and Square Tail Brewing Co. in Amherst.
Penobscot Bay Brewery and Winterport Winery, which are owned and operated by Mike and Joan Anderson, will have their pear cider, and other selections, at both events. They started selling their fruit cider last July and sold more than 12,000 bottles by the end of the year.
"Half of my tanks are filled with pear fermenting in order to keep up with the cider [demand]," said Mike Anderson, a winemaker and brewmaster.
"It's nice to have a festival that is all Maine breweries," said Gene Beck, owner of Nocturnem. "Some of these guys are really starting to tear things up."
The craft beer industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and consumers are the ones who benefit.
The first Tap into Summer beer festival attracted 15 craft brewers from across the state and drew 1,100 brew fans. It's only grown since, Speronis said.
Tickets are available at visitbangormaine.com, waterfrontconcert.com, at Mark's Music in Brewer, or on the day of the event.

Texto completo:   OnProcess announces plans to expand to Belfast, a move that could create 350 new jobs in the midcoast area.
A Massachusetts technology company announced Monday that it plans to expand into Maine and create 50 jobs, and that the total could eventually grow to 300.
OnProcess Technology, which provides supply chain management services, has signed a five-year lease on 35,000 square feet of space at a former MBNA facility in Belfast. The technology company is based in Ashland, Massachusetts, and the Belfast facility will be its first in Maine.
The new space has capacity for more than 300 employees, but the company would not give a timeline for growth, saying in an email that it will "hire more as business needs grow." It plans to hire 50 full- and part-time employees over the next two months and will hold a job fair Wednesday and Thursday at The Hutchinson Center in Belfast, part of the University of Maine.
Ed Barry, the company's CEO, said Belfast is an "ideal location" for expansion. "Not only were we attracted by Belfast's vibrant business community and highly skilled workforce, its proximity to major universities, several of which have supply chain curricula, also make(s) the area great for recruiting employees," Barry said in a written statement.
OnProcess provides technology services to improve supply chain management for its clients, which are in the wireless, broadband, technology and medical industries. It is a global company with facilities in India and Bulgaria. In 2014, the company doubled its global workforce to more than 2,200 people.
Gov. Paul LePage welcomed the company to Maine.
"This company has experienced significant growth within the last year and could have chosen anywhere in the world for an expansion," LePage said in a prepared statement. "Its decision to start an operation in Maine is a testament to our ongoing commitment to become better partners with the private sector in attracting new investment and career opportunities for the Maine people."
OnProcess gave credit to Maine & Co., a nonprofit organization that provides free consulting services to companies looking to move to or expand in Maine. Peter DelGreco, CEO of Maine & Co., said he has worked with the company and state and local officials over the past year to make this happen.
"We are excited for OnProcess Technology's growth plans and the work environment they will create," DelGreco said. "This is a fast-growing, energetic company that we are thrilled to welcome to Maine's business community."

Texto completo:   Irving forgave $150,000 debt owed by John Martin's company
By Lance Tapley
A prominent Democratic legislator who has been pushing for looser state environmental regulations that would allow an Irving family company to mine Bald Mountain in northern Maine received $150,000 in debt relief from another Irving company.
Bankruptcy filings show that state Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, owed Irving Oil $250,000 for gasoline and diesel deliveries and other charges to a convenience store he co-owned under the corporate name Eagle Lake Outfitters in his hometown. The debt was first revealed in a 2012 news story by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting about Martin and a partner filing for bankruptcy protection for their store.
The resolution of the bankruptcy and official reduction of the debt, which the court approved in March 2014, has not previously been reported. Federal bankruptcy court papers show that Irving Oil made a legal motion that resulted in the company receiving only 40 percent - a little over $100,000 - of the amount it claimed was owed by Martin and his business partner.
Martin, 73, the former longtime House speaker, sits on the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, where he has promoted changes to mining laws to allow J.D. Irving to excavate an open-pit copper and zinc mine in his district, which includes Fort Kent. In 2012, Martin introduced the first bill to make it easier to mine for valuable minerals on Bald Mountain.
Martin refused to provide information about the bankruptcy when he was asked for details by a MCPIR reporter outside the environment committee hearing room in the State House complex.
"It's none of your business," he replied. "I don't give a (expletive) what you want. You work for a lousy outfit of people, and I have no intent of talking to you or them. Is that clear?"
Maine's ethics laws for legislators do not specifically mention bankruptcy debt, nor do they require disclosure of any debt to a creditor incurred by a legislator-owned business.
Irving's proposed mine has been vigorously opposed by environmental and conservation groups - from the Natural Resources Council of Maine to Trout Unlimited - as well as some Aroostook County residents. On Friday, the environment committee voted to pass the mining legislation, with Martin and fellow Democratic Rep. Robert S. Duchesne of Hudson joining the six committee Republicans in favor of the bill. The remaining four committee Democrats and one independent, Portland Rep. Ben Chipman, voted against the bill.
MARTIN: NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Martin said in 2012 that there was no conflict of interest between what his store owed Irving Oil and his promotion of J.D. Irving's interests because the two Canadian conglomerates are legally separate - a point also stressed by a spokesman for J.D. Irving.
Each of the two octogenarian Irving brothers controls one of the distinct business empires, and in recent years the media have chronicled how their personal and business relationships have cooled. But an expert on the Irving companies said the two corporate entities - famous for being secretive - also work together. "Yes, they do cooperate still," said Jacques Poitras, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent and author of the 2014 book "Irving vs. Irving."
Irving Oil was Eagle Lake Outfitters' largest creditor. Headquartered in Saint John, the oil company is the central unit of a set of corporations owned by billionaire Arthur L. Irving. His brother and fellow billionaire James "J.K." Irving owns J.D. Irving. Also based in Saint John, it's the largest of many companies overseen by James D. Irving, J. K's son. Vast timberlands in New Brunswick and Maine constitute the core of their businesses. Bald Mountain is located within J.D. Irving's 1,250,000 Maine acres, a holding that makes it the largest landowner in Maine.
Environmentalists fear water pollution from the proposed mine could ruin the relatively unspoiled character of a big part of the North Woods. Besides valuable metals, the mountain has significant amounts of arsenic and sulfide minerals that could contaminate the water table.
Opponents also fear that changes being considered to the mining law would allow other areas in Maine to be mined, including public lands used for recreation.
The Natural Resources Council says that mines throughout the world - including two that operated in Hancock County in the mid-20th century - have a record of pollution, often leaving the public on the hook for costly cleanups.
But J.D. Irving and its supporters argue that contemporary technology can create a non-polluting mine and that a poor part of the state would benefit from the 300 jobs the company says would be created, plus 400 indirect jobs because of increased economic activity in the area. Martin has said that he supports the Bald Mountain development because it would bring jobs to Aroostook County.
Gov. Paul LePage and his Department of Environmental Protection, business groups and many Republican legislators strongly support Irving's mining proposal.
BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT
The bankruptcy papers show that Eagle Lake Outfitters' creditors other than Irving were owed a total of $45,000. Martin's partner, Gary Voisine, wouldn't divulge details about the bankruptcy, but said debts with all the creditors had been settled.
A representative of Tulsa Inc., a gas station and "petroleum services" firm in Van Buren, which was owed $21,000, said it had been paid. A spokesperson for the state Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department said it had been paid the $2,200 it was owed for license fees. Several other creditors did not return phone calls.
In the bankruptcy settlement, Martin and Voisine paid $125,000. Of that, $101,343 went to Irving, and the balance went to court fees and other creditors. Martin and Voisine each own 50 percent of the store
In 2012, Martin told the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting that he and Voisine bought back the Route 11 store for $125,000 they got from "private business equity," but would not elaborate.
Asked about the arrangement, Voisine said "how I pay off stuff" was not the media's business.
He angrily denied that there had been any "deal" with the Irving companies. He said "we never owed" $250,000 to Irving Oil but only $100,000. The company had jacked up the amount owed with "lawyer fees for years" and "a bunch of" other charges, he said.
Anthony Banford, a spokesman for Irving Oil, responded: "It's on the public record that a judgment was granted by a Maine Court in Irving Oil's favor against Eagle Lake Outfitters for amounts the court agreed were owed to our company." Banford added that Irving Oil and J.D. Irving are "two separate companies, operated completely independently." He did not directly address the question of why the company accepted only 40 percent of what it said it was owed.
Martin's bankruptcy and involvement with the Irving companies were reported during his 2012 campaign for re-election to the House. Following that revelation, he was defeated by a political newcomer. He retook the seat in November. In the 1990s, a ballot-stuffing scandal sent a Martin aide to jail and cost the veteran legislator the speakership.
Jonathan Wayne, director of the state's Commission on Governmental Ethics and Elections Practices, would not comment on the situation with Martin and Irving. Maine ethics laws don't specifically mention bankruptcy debt. When asked whether any sections of the ethics laws could apply, Wayne said two sections that address whether a legislator is using his public position to benefit himself or another entity might.
The first one states that it is a violation of legislative ethics when "a Legislator or a member of the Legislator's immediate family accepts gifts, other than campaign contributions duly recorded as required by law, from persons affected by legislation or who have an interest in an entity affected by proposed legislation and the Legislator knows or reasonably should know that the purpose of the donor in making the gift is to influence the Legislator ... or is intended as a reward for action on the Legislator's part."
The second section that could apply states that it is a violation of legislative ethics for a legislator to engage in conduct that constitutes an abuse of office or position. That includes "granting or obtaining special privilege, exemption or preferential treatment to or for oneself or another, which privilege, exemption or treatment is not readily available to members of the general community or class to which the beneficiary belongs."
The current House speaker, Democrat Mark Eves, declined to comment when asked whether he thinks Martin's actions constitute a conflict of interest.
Rep. Benjamin Chipman, the Portland independent who sits next to Martin in the Environment and Natural Resources Committee room, said Martin probably doesn't see the debt reduction and his sponsorship of the mining bill as a conflict of interest.
"But other people see it that way," Chipman said. The Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service based in Augusta, can be contacted at: pinetreewatchdog@gmail.com Web: www.pinetreewatchdog.org

Resumen: [...]her father actively discouraged it. Maine's family-owned business community is dominated by companies with male top executives, but more women have been rising through the ranks, said Catherine Wygant Fossett, executive director of the Portland-based Institute for Family-Owned Business, which hosted its 2015 Maine Family Business Awards ceremony Monday night.

Texto completo:   A new study shows that 30 percent of family-owned business owners are grooming a daughter, not a son, to take over the business. That's a big increase from in the past. We'll examine the trend and profile two women in Maine who are preparing to assume control of the family business.
Kimberly Garrett had no intention of going into the family business. In fact, her father actively discouraged it.
Not because Ed Wolak, founder of The Wolak Group in Falmouth, thought his daughter couldn't handle getting up at the crack of dawn each day to make the doughnuts at the company's small chain of Dunkin' Donuts franchises.
Running a doughnut shop can be a tiring and thankless job. Garrett remembers her father coming home with burns on his arms from being splashed with hot oil.
Garrett went off to college, then pursued careers in the film and wine industries in California, got married and became a mother. Meanwhile, The Wolak Group was rapidly growing and changing back in Maine. It grew to more than 70 franchises in three states, and the company opened an automated production facility with more than enough capacity to supply doughnuts and other baked goods to all of its stores.
Like a growing number of family business owners, Wolak eventually asked his daughter to join the company - which now owns nearly 100 Dunkin' Donuts stores - in an executive role.
"There was so much at stake from what he had grown," said Garrett, who is now Wolak Group vice president of operations and a franchise owner herself. "I didn't feel there was anybody else as fit to protect that as I was."
Nationally, the share of family-owned businesses headed by women has increased sixfold since 1997. At that time, only 5 percent of such businesses had a woman in the top executive role, according to a survey conducted by Mass Mutual and Arthur Andersen.
By 2014, that share had increased to 30 percent, according to the Family Firm Institute, a Boston-based trade association for family-owned businesses. Over the next 20 years, daughters are expected to eclipse sons as the go-to offspring for taking over the family business, it said.
Maine's family-owned business community is dominated by companies with male top executives, but more women have been rising through the ranks, said Catherine Wygant Fossett, executive director of the Portland-based Institute for Family-Owned Business, which hosted its 2015 Maine Family Business Awards ceremony Monday night.
Of the Maine institute's more than 65 member businesses, eight are led by women - about 12 percent. Even so, Wygant Fossett said 40 to 50 women regularly participate in the institute's training and leadership-development programs.
The institute has created a number of programs aimed at women executives in recent years, she said. It even has a program to teach golf to its female members who aren't proficient at the game.
"A lot of times in the business world, a lot of work is done on the golf course," Wygant Fossett said.
The institute started a Women's Affinity Group in 2011 to specifically address some of the issues that confront women in leadership positions within family-run businesses. The group members offer support and advice to each other and an opportunity to collaborate, providing encouragement not only as women, but as leaders in family-run businesses, which often don't survive past the third generation.
One reason that more women are being groomed to take over the family business is that women have surpassed men as the gender more likely to enroll in college, said Jane Hilburt-Davis, institute president emeritus and a board member.
In 2012, the share of young women enrolled in college immediately after high school was 71 percent, compared with 61 percent for young men, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. Just a decade earlier, the share of young men and women enrolling in college was roughly the same.
Hilburt-Davis, president of Key Resources LLC, a consulting firm to family-business owners, said they often look to the best-educated child as the lead candidate for succession. In a growing number of cases, that child is a daughter.
"Twenty years from now, we know more women will be leading family-owned businesses than men," she said.
Although some daughters are poised to take over national firms - as Abigail Johnson, granddaughter of Fidelity Investments founder Edward C. Johnson II, did in 2014 - it is much more common for women to take over smaller, family-run companies where the hierarchy isn't as deep. Nationally, only 4.8 percent of Fortune 500 companies were headed by women in 2014.
Lindsay Gifford Skilling, general manager of Skowhegan-based Gifford's Famous Ice Cream, always hoped to work for the premium ice cream business started by her grandparents and developed further into the company it is today by her father and uncle.
"I knew at a young age that I wanted to join the family business, if they'd have me," she said.
Gifford Skilling earned a bachelor's degree in business administration, and in 2006 joined Gifford's as assistant to the controller. Since then she has risen rapidly to the top management position. Her brother, John Chester "JC" Gifford Jr., and sister, Samantha Gifford, also hold leadership positions within the company.
Gifford ice cream, which is closing in on annual production of 2 million gallons per year, is sold at its five ice cream stands and at hundreds of grocery stores, independent ice cream shops, colleges, universities and restaurants as far west as Nevada.
Gifford Skilling, who is 31, said it was intimidating at first to be a young female executive in an industry dominated by men. But with support from her family and an eagerness to learn, she developed the confidence to run a successful and fast-growing business.
"My dad and uncle just kind of saw something in me, I guess, so here I am," she said. J. Craig Anderson can be contacted at 791-6390 or at: canderson@pressherald.com Twitter: jcraiganderson

Texto completo:   The LePage administration presents its latest attempt to deny welfare benefits to drug users. Seems unlikely that it will pass again this year.
AUGUSTA -- The LePage administration urged lawmakers on Monday to deny welfare benefits to people with felony drug convictions and to screen applicants for substance abuse problems, saying its bill sends a message that tax dollars will not be used to reward what one official called "reprehensible personal behavior."
But civil liberties and social services organizations warned that the measure could hurt the children of addicts - as well as adults who have turned their lives around - and further stigmatize a population that already struggles to find adequate treatment in Maine.
The bill is similar to measures that Gov. Paul LePage has pursued in years past, only to see them killed by the Legislature. Although administration officials insist that the latest version, L.D. 1407, avoids the constitutionality questions raised previously, it's likely the proposal still will face an uphill challenge in the Democrat-controlled House.
This year, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services began drug-testing individuals with felony drug convictions before they receive welfare through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Those who fail the drug tests must either enter a treatment program or face the loss of benefits.
The testing was part of a compromise brokered between the administration and lawmakers in 2011. However, lawmakers have rejected several attempts to drug-test all welfare recipients.
The latest bill would allow the state to deny TANF and food stamp benefits to anyone with a felony drug conviction, without testing. Federal law already prohibits TANF and food stamp benefits from going to convicted drug felons; however, states have considerable flexibility in administering the benefits by allowing them to waive the restrictions.
The bill also would require all TANF applicants to complete a questionnaire that administration officials contend has a 97 percent accuracy rate for determining whether an individual has a substance abuse problem. Individuals who score above a certain threshold would then be required to take a test for illegal drugs.
Holly Lusk, senior health policy adviser for the governor, said the bill would bring Maine into compliance with the intent of the federal law regarding drug convictions and would help protect children by encouraging addicted parents to seek treatment.
"The department believes that adoption of this bill will serve the purpose of sending a message of condemnation of drug felonies (and) the importance of treatment to overcome addiction, and will provide assurance to the taxpayers of the state of Maine that their hard-earned money will not reward reprehensible personal behavior," Lusk told members of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee.
The Maine DHHS reported handling roughly 6,000 TANF cases in April. Among those cases are households that include a total of more than 9,900 children. A fiscal note estimating the costs of the bill was not available Monday.
The LePage administration has proposed using the same screening questionnaire - known as the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, or SASSI - that has been adopted by other states looking to screen welfare recipients. But the authors of the SASSI have said the tool should be used to help substance abusers connect with treatment, not to deny them public assistance.
"When policymakers recognize the value of providing adjunctive services such as substance abuse counseling and vocational counseling to recipients of general assistance in need of such services, the SASSI can be a helpful tool," the Indiana-based SASSI Institute wrote, according to documents provided to the committee Monday. "However, when public assistance is made contingent on participation in the assessment and treatment process, it increases the risk for violations of ethical principles and applicants' rights."
Oamshri Amarasingham, of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, called the bill "constitutionally suspect" because federal courts have consistently held that governments require reasonable suspicion before requiring drug tests. Amarasingham expressed skepticism that the questionnaire was sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion, much less probable cause, for a drug test.
Several Democratic lawmakers and critics of the bill also noted that it goes far beyond the drug traffickers and serious offenders portrayed by the LePage administration. Under Maine law, illegal possession of widely abused prescription opiates such as oxycodone and hydrocodone is a felony offense that could result in the loss of benefits.
Jack Comart with Maine Equal Justice Partners, a nonprofit that provides legal aid and advocacy to low-income Mainers, said that could penalize people and their families for decades.
"What we are saying is, regardless of if you have paid your debt to society, we are still going to punish you," Comart said.
Susan Lamb, executive director of the Maine chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, suggested that denying TANF or food stamps to addicts will inevitably hurt the children who have no control over their parents' poor behavior. Lamb cautioned against taking such steps unless the state is ready to put additional resources into the already overburdened foster family program.
Those comments prompted an exchange with committee member Rep. Frances Head, R-Bethel, who said it ultimately comes down to "adult choice" and whether drug users choose their children over their addiction.
"A lot of people in my district are adamant that something needs to be done, and this bill gets it going," Head said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Deb Sanderson, R-Chelsea, noted that police occasionally find electronic benefit cards - essentially debit cards used to allocate some welfare benefits - that are being used as the equivalent of cash to purchase drugs.
"Every dollar being spent for illicit drugs is a dollar not going to care for the child or children in the home," Sanderson said in her testimony.
The committee is scheduled to hold a work session on the bill Wednesday. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@pressherald.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo:   Educuation Committee votes on several bills dealing with Common Core, standardized tests and other stuff.
AUGUSTA -- Members of a legislative committee on Monday overwhelmingly opposed eliminating the Common Core education standards in Maine schools but endorsed a bill that would require the state to drop a current standardized test that is aligned with Common Core.
The Common Core bill, L.D. 1396, is part of a nationwide movement led by critics of the national educational standards for math and English that have been adopted by 45 states since 2009. Several states have since withdrawn from the program, amid concerns about the content and opposition by some to the trend toward nationalized education.
After hearing hours of testimony last week, members of the Legislature's Education and Cultural Affairs Committee voted 12-1 Monday to reject the bill to withdraw Maine from the Common Core standards. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Karen Gerrish, R-Lebanon.
Committee members voted 9-4 to reject another bill, L.D. 695, which would require the Maine Department of Education to notify parents of their right to opt out of standardized tests for their children.
Lawmakers did endorse a bill that would direct the Department of Education to explore a new set of standardized tests.
In March, students began taking a new state assessment test known as the Smarter Balanced test, which is aligned with the new Common Core state standards. Maine is one of 18 states participating in the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium that created the online tests. But some have criticized the tests.
L.D. 1276, which was endorsed by the committee by a unanimous vote, directs Maine to withdraw from the Smarter Balanced consortium and instead solicit proposals for new tests created with more input from educators and the public.
Legislators on the education committee had heard eight hours of public testimony on May 11 from people expressing support for eliminating Common Core education standards, dropping the annual Smarter Balanced tests, and easing the new, more rigorous proficiency-based graduation standards.
Lois Kilby-Chesley, president of the teachers union and advocacy organization Maine Education Association, said she was "ecstatic" at the committee's vote on the Smarter Balanced tests.
TEACHERS' ADVOCATE 'ECSTATIC'
"The Maine Education Association has been wary of the Smarter Balanced Assessment since it was selected by the state," Kilby-Chesley said in a statement. "For more than a year we have heard stories as to the pitfalls of the test, as well as the errors in it that confuse students and make taking the test a stressful and frustrating event."
The education committee also unanimously supported a bill to create a 15-member working group to explore how to move ahead with the state's plans for "standards-based diplomas" aimed at ensuring students are proficient in key subject areas before graduating.
"There are some major issues that need to be addressed before standards based is adopted fully throughout Maine, and I'm glad the committee recognizes this urgency." Senate Democratic Leader Justin Alfond of Portland, the bill's sponsor, said in a statement. "The transition from students sitting in their seats and getting a grade to showing proficiency is difficult and this stakeholder group is crucial to keeping momentum statewide."
The bills now go to the full Legislature for consideration. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@pressherald.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo:   Critics: Screening for substance abuse puts children of addicts at risk
AUGUSTA -- The LePage administration urged lawmakers on Monday to deny welfare benefits to people with felony drug convictions and to screen applicants for substance abuse problems to send a message that tax dollars will not be used to reward what one official called "reprehensible personal behavior."
But civil liberties and social service organizations warned the measures could hurt the children of addicts -- as well as adults who have turned their lives around -- and further stigmatize a population that already struggles to find adequate treatment in Maine.
The bill is similar to measures that Gov. Paul LePage has pursued in years past only to see them killed by the Legislature. While administration officials insist the latest version, L.D. 1407, avoids constitutionality questions raised in the past, it's likely the proposal still will face an uphill challenge in the Democratic-controlled House.
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services this year began drug testing individuals with felony drug convictions before they receive welfare through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Those who fail the drug tests must either enter a treatment program or face the loss of benefits.
The testing was part of a compromise brokered between the administration and lawmakers in 2011. However, lawmakers have rejected several attempts to drug test all welfare recipients.
The bill would require all TANF applicants to complete a questionnaire that administration officials contend has a 97 percent accuracy rate for determining whether an individual has a substance abuse problem. Individuals who score above a certain threshold -- alcohol wouldn't be included under the law -- would then be required to take a drug test.
Additionally, the bill would allow the state to deny TANF and food stamp benefits to anyone with a felony drug conviction. Federal law already prohibits TANF and food stamp benefits from going to convicted drug felons, but states have considerable flexibility in deciding how to administer the benefits by allowing them to waive the restrictions.
Holly Lusk, senior health policy adviser for the governor, said the bill would bring Maine into compliance with the intent of the federal law and help protect children by encouraging addicted parents to seek treatment.
"The department believes that adoption of this bill will serve the purpose of sending a message of condemnation of drug felonies, the importance of treatment to overcome addiction and will provide assurance to the taxpayers of the state of Maine that their hard-earned money will not reward reprehensible personal behavior," Lusk told members of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee.
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services reported handling roughly 6,000 TANF cases in April 2015. Among those cases are households that include more than 9,900 children. A fiscal note estimating the costs of the bill was not available Monday.
The LePage administration has proposed using the same screening questionnaire -- known as the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, or SASSI -- that has been adopted by other states looking to screen welfare recipients. But the authors of the SASSI have said the tool should be used to help substance abusers connect with treatment, not to deny them public assistance.
"When policy makers recognize the value of providing adjunctive services such as substance abuse counseling and vocational counseling to recipients of general assistance in need of such services, the SASSI can be a helpful tool," the Indiana-based SASSI Institute wrote, according to documents provided to the committee on Monday. "Substance abuse treatment would have a beneficial effect for both the individual and society. However, when public assistance is made contingent on participation in the assessment and treatment process, it increases the risk for violations of ethical principles and applicants' rights."
Oamshri Amarasingham with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine called the bill "constitutionally suspect" because federal courts have consistently held that governments require reasonable suspicion before requiring drug tests. Amarasingham expressed skepticism that the questionnaire was sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion, much less probable cause, for a drug test.
Several Democratic lawmakers and critics of the bill also pointed out that it goes far beyond the drug traffickers and serious offenders portrayed by the LePage administration. Under Maine law, illegal possession of such widely abused prescription opiates such as oxycodone and hydrocodone is a felony offense that could result in the loss of benefits.
Jack Comart with Maine Equal Justice Partners, a nonprofit that provides legal aid and advocacy to low-income Mainers, said that could penalize people and their families for decades.
"What we are saying is, regardless of if you have paid your debt to society, we are still going to punish you," Comart said.
Susan Lamb, executive director of the Maine chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, suggested that denying TANF or food stamps to addicts will inevitably hurt the children who have no control over their parents' poor behavior. Lamb cautioned against taking such steps unless the state is ready to put additional resources into the already overburdened foster family program.
Those comments prompted an exchange with committee member Rep. Frances Head, R-Bethel, who said it ultimately comes down to "adult choice" and whether drug users choose their children over their addiction.
"A lot of people in my district are adamant that something needs to be done, and this bill gets it going," Head said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Deb Sanderson, R-Chelsea, brought up the fact that police occasionally find electronic benefit cards -- essentially debit cards used to allocate some welfare benefits -- that are being used as cash to purchase drugs.
"There are children involved and every dollar being spent for illicit drugs is a dollar not going to care for the child or children in the home," Sanderson said in her testimony.
The committee is slated to hold a work session on the bill on Wednesday.

"The department believes that adoption of this bill will serve the purpose of sending a message of condemnation of drug felonies, the importance of treatment to overcome addiction and will provide assurance to the taxpayers of the state of Maine that their hard-earned money will not reward reprehensible personal behavior," Lusk told members of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee.
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services reported handling roughly 6,000 TANF cases in April 2015. Among those cases are households that include more than 9,900 children. A fiscal note estimating the costs of the bill was not available Monday.
The LePage administration has proposed using the same screening questionnaire -- known as the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, or SASSI -- that has been adopted by other states looking to screen welfare recipients. But the authors of the SASSI have said the tool should be used to help substance abusers connect with treatment, not to deny them public assistance.
"When policy makers recognize the value of providing adjunctive services such as substance abuse counseling and vocational counseling to recipients of general assistance in need of such services, the SASSI can be a helpful tool," the Indiana-based SASSI Institute wrote, according to documents provided to the committee on Monday. "Substance abuse treatment would have a beneficial effect for both the individual and society. However, when public assistance is made contingent on participation in the assessment and treatment process, it increases the risk for violations of ethical principles and applicants' rights."
Oamshri Amarasingham with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine called the bill "constitutionally suspect" because federal courts have consistently held that governments require reasonable suspicion before requiring drug tests. Amarasingham expressed skepticism that the questionnaire was sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion, much less probable cause, for a drug test.
Several Democratic lawmakers and critics of the bill also pointed out that it goes far beyond the drug traffickers and serious offenders portrayed by the LePage administration. Under Maine law, illegal possession of such widely abused prescription opiates such as oxycodone and hydrocodone is a felony offense that could result in the loss of benefits.
Jack Comart with Maine Equal Justice Partners, a nonprofit that provides legal aid and advocacy to low-income Mainers, said that could penalize people and their families for decades.
"What we are saying is, regardless of if you have paid your debt to society, we are still going to punish you," Comart said.
Susan Lamb, executive director of the Maine chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, suggested that denying TANF or food stamps to addicts will inevitably hurt the children who have no control over their parents' poor behavior. Lamb cautioned against taking such steps unless the state is ready to put additional resources into the already overburdened foster family program.
Those comments prompted an exchange with committee member Rep. Frances Head, R-Bethel, who said it ultimately comes down to "adult choice" and whether drug users choose their children over their addiction.
"A lot of people in my district are adamant that something needs to be done, and this bill gets it going," Head said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Deb Sanderson, R-Chelsea, brought up the fact that police occasionally find electronic benefit cards -- essentially debit cards used to allocate some welfare benefits -- that are being used as cash to purchase drugs.
"There are children involved and every dollar being spent for illicit drugs is a dollar not going to care for the child or children in the home," Sanderson said in her testimony.
The committee is slated to hold a work session on the bill on Wednesday.

Texto completo:   Legislator received $150,000 in debt relief from Irving; touts mining changes
A prominent Democratic legislator who has been pushing for looser state environmental regulations that would allow an Irving family company to mine Bald Mountain in northern Maine received $150,000 in debt relief from another Irving company.
Bankruptcy filings show that state Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, owed Irving Oil $250,000 for gasoline and diesel deliveries and other charges to a convenience store he co-owned under the corporate name Eagle Lake Outfitters in his hometown. The debt was first revealed in a 2012 news story by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting about Martin and a partner filing for bankruptcy protection for their store.
The resolution of the bankruptcy and official reduction of the debt, which the court approved in March, has not previously been reported. Federal bankruptcy court papers show that Irving Oil made a legal motion that resulted in the company receiving only 40 percent -- a little over $100,000 -- of the amount it claimed was owed by Martin and his business partner.
Martin, 73, the former longtime House speaker, sits on the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, where he has promoted changes to mining laws to allow J.D. Irving to excavate an open-pit copper and zinc mine in his district, which includes Fort Kent. In 2012, Martin introduced the first bill to make it easier to mine for valuable minerals on Bald Mountain.
Martin refused to provide information about the bankruptcy when he was asked for details by an MCPIR reporter outside the environment committee hearing room in the State House complex.
"It's none of your business," he replied. "I don't give a (expletive) what you want. You work for a lousy outfit of people, and I have no intent of talking to you or them. Is that clear?"
Maine's ethics laws for legislators do not specifically mention bankruptcy debt, nor do they require disclosure of any debt to a creditor incurred by a legislator-owned business.
Irving's proposed mine has been vigorously opposed by environmental and conservation groups -- from the Natural Resources Council of Maine to Trout Unlimited -- as well as some Aroostook County residents. On Friday, the environment committee voted to pass the mining legislation, with Martin and fellow Democratic Rep. Robert S. Duchesne of Hudson joining the six committee Republicans in favor of the bill. The remaining four committee Democrats and one independent, Portland Rep. Ben Chipman, voted against the bill.
Martin said in 2012 that there was no conflict of interest between what his store owed Irving Oil and his promotion of J.D. Irving's interests because the two Canadian conglomerates are legally separate -- a point also stressed by a spokesman for J.D. Irving.
Each of the two octogenarian Irving brothers controls one of the distinct business empires, and in recent years the media have chronicled how their personal and business relationships have cooled. But an expert on the Irving companies said the two corporate entities -- famous for being secretive -- also work together. "Yes, they do cooperate still," said Jacques Poitras, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent and author of the 2014 book "Irving vs. Irving."
Irving Oil was Eagle Lake Outfitters' largest creditor. Headquartered in Saint John, the oil company is the central unit of a set of corporations owned by billionaire Arthur L. Irving. His brother and fellow billionaire, James "J.K." Irving, owns J.D. Irving. Also based in Saint John, it's the largest of many companies overseen by James D. Irving, J. K's son. Vast timberlands in New Brunswick and Maine constitute the core of their businesses. Bald Mountain is located within J.D. Irving's 1,250,000 Maine acres, a holding that makes it the largest landowner in Maine.
Environmentalists fear water pollution from the proposed mine could ruin the relatively unspoiled character of a big part of the North Woods. Besides valuable metals, the mountain has significant amounts of arsenic and sulfide minerals that could contaminate the water table.
Opponents also fear that changes being considered to the mining law would allow other areas in Maine to be mined, including public lands used for recreation.
The Natural Resources Council says that mines throughout the world -- including two worked in Hancock County in the mid-20th century -- have a record of pollution, often leaving the public on the hook for costly cleanups.
But J.D. Irving and its supporters argue that contemporary technology can create a non-polluting mine and that a poor part of the state would benefit from the 300 jobs the company says would be created, plus 400 indirect jobs because of increased economic activity in the area. Martin has said that he supports the Bald Mountain development because it would bring jobs to Aroostook County.
Gov. Paul LePage and his Department of Environmental Protection, business groups and many Republican legislators strongly support Irving's mining proposal.
The bankruptcy papers show that Eagle Lake Outfitters' creditors other than Irving were owed a total of $45,000. Martin's partner, Gary Voisine, wouldn't divulge details about the bankruptcy, but said debts with all the creditors had been settled.
A representative of Tulsa Inc., a gas station and "petroleum services" firm in Van Buren, which was owed $21,000, said it had been paid. A spokesperson for the state Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department said it had been paid the $2,200 it was owed for license fees. Several other creditors did not return phone calls.
In the bankruptcy settlement, Martin and Voisine paid $125,000. Of that, $101,343 went to Irving, and the balance went to court fees and other creditors. Martin and Vosine each own 50 percent of the store
In 2012, Martin told the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting that he and Voisine bought back the Route 11 store for $125,000 they got from "private business equity," but would not elaborate.
Asked about the arrangement, Voisine said "how I pay off stuff" was not the media's business.
He angrily denied that there had been any "deal" with the Irving companies. He said "we never owed" $250,000 to Irving Oil but only $100,000. The company had jacked up the amount owed with "lawyer fees for years" and "a bunch of" other charges, he claimed.
Anthony Banford, a spokesman for Irving Oil, responded: "It's on the public record that a judgment was granted by a Maine Court in Irving Oil's favor against Eagle Lake Outfitters for amounts the court agreed were owed to our Company." Banford added that Irving Oil and J.D. Irving are "two separate companies, operated completely independently." He did not directly address the question of why the company accepted only 40 percent of what it said it was owed.
Martin's bankruptcy and involvement with the Irving companies were reported during his 2012 campaign for reelection to the House. Following that revelation, he was defeated by a political newcomer. He retook the seat in 2014. In the 1990s a ballot-stuffing scandal sent a Martin aide to jail that cost the veteran legislator the speakership.
Jonathan Wayne, director of the state's Commission on Governmental Ethics and Elections Practices, would not comment on the situation with Martin and Irving. Maine ethics laws don't specifically mention bankruptcy debt. When asked whether any sections of the ethics laws could apply, Wayne said two sections that address whether a legislator is using his public position to benefit himself or another entity might.
The first one states that it is a violation of legislative ethics when "a Legislator or a member of the Legislator's immediate family accepts gifts, other than campaign contributions duly recorded as required by law, from persons affected by legislation or who have an interest in an entity affected by proposed legislation and the Legislator knows or reasonably should know that the purpose of the donor in making the gift is to influence the Legislator ... or is intended as a reward for action on the Legislator's part."
The second section that could apply states that it is a violation of legislative ethics for a legislator to engage in conduct that constitutes an abuse of office or position. That includes "granting or obtaining special privilege, exemption or preferential treatment to or for oneself or another, which privilege, exemption or treatment is not readily available to members of the general community or class to which the beneficiary belongs."
The current House speaker, Democrat Mark Eves, declined to comment when asked whether he thinks Martin's actions constitute a conflict of interest.
Rep. Benjamin Chipman, the Portland independent who sits next to Martin in the Environment and Natural Resources Committee room, said Martin probably doesn't see the debt reduction and his sponsorship of the mining bill as a conflict of interest. "But other people see it that way," Chipman said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Members of a legislative committee on Monday overwhelmingly opposed eliminating the Common Core education standards in Maine schools, but endorsed a bill that would require the state to drop a current standardized test that is aligned with Common Core.
The Common Core bill, L.D. 1396, is part of a nationwide movement led by critics of the national educational standards for math and English that have been adopted by 45 states since 2009. Several states have since withdrawn from the program, however, amid concerns about the content and a pushback by some against the trend toward nationalized education.
After hearing hours of testimony last week, members of the Legislature's Education and Cultural Affairs Committee voted 12-1 on Monday to reject the bill to withdraw Maine from the Common Core standards. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Karen Gerrish, R-Lebanon.
Committee members also voted 9-4 to reject another bill, L.D. 695, which would have required the Maine Department of Education to notify parents of their right to opt out of standardized tests for their children.
Lawmakers did endorse, however, a bill that directs the Department of Education to explore a new set of standardized tests.
In March, Maine students began taking a new state assessment test known as the Smarter Balanced test, which is aligned with the new Common Core state standards. Maine is one of 18 states currently participating in the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium that created the online tests. But some have criticized the tests.
L.D. 1276, which was endorsed by the committee by a unanimous vote, directs Maine to withdraw from the Smarter Balanced consortium and instead solicit proposals for new tests created with more input from educators and the public.
Legislators on the education committee had heard eight hours of public testimony last Monday from people expressing support for eliminating Common Core education standards, dropping the annual Smarter Balanced tests, and easing the new, more rigorous proficiency-based graduation standards.
Lois Kilby-Chesley, president of the Maine Education Association, said she was "ecstatic" at the committee's vote on the Smarter Balanced tests.
"The Maine Education Association has been wary of the Smarter Balanced Assessment since it was selected by the state," Kilby-Chesley said in a statement. "For more than a year we have heard stories as to the pitfalls of the test, as well as the errors in it that confuse students and make taking the test a stressful and frustrating event."
The education committee also unanimously supported a bill to create a 15-member working group to explore how to move ahead with the state's plans for "standards-based diplomas" aimed at ensuring students are proficient in key subject areas before graduating.
"There are some major issues that need to be addressed before standards based is adopted fully throughout Maine, and I'm glad the committee recognizes this urgency." Senate Democratic Leader Justin Alfond, of Portland, the bill's sponsor, said in a statement. "The transition from students sitting in their seats and getting a grade to showing proficiency is difficult and this stakeholder group is crucial to keeping momentum statewide."
The bills now go to the full Legislature for consideration.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- The LePage administration urged lawmakers on Monday to deny welfare benefits to people with felony drug convictions and to screen applicants for substance abuse problems to send a message that tax dollars will not be used to reward what one official called "reprehensible personal behavior."
But civil liberties and social service organizations warned the measures could hurt the children of addicts -- as well as adults who have turned their lives around -- and further stigmatize a population that already struggles to find adequate treatment in Maine.
The bill is similar to measures that Gov. Paul LePage has pursued in years past only to see them killed by the Legislature. While administration officials insist the latest version, L.D. 1407, avoids constitutionality questions raised in the past, it's likely the proposal still will face an uphill challenge in the Democratic-controlled House.
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services this year began drug testing individuals with felony drug convictions before they receive welfare through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Those who fail the drug tests must either enter a treatment program or face the loss of benefits.
The testing was part of a compromise brokered between the administration and lawmakers in 2011. However, lawmakers have rejected several attempts to drug test all welfare recipients.
The bill would require all TANF applicants to complete a questionnaire that administration officials contend has a 97 percent accuracy rate for determining whether an individual has a substance abuse problem. Individuals who score above a certain threshold -- alcohol wouldn't be included under the law -- would then be required to take a drug test.
Additionally, the bill would allow the state to deny TANF and food stamp benefits to anyone with a felony drug conviction. Federal law already prohibits TANF and food stamp benefits from going to convicted drug felons, but states have considerable flexibility in deciding how to administer the benefits by allowing them to waive the restrictions.
Holly Lusk, senior health policy adviser for the governor, said the bill would bring Maine into compliance with the intent of the federal law and help protect children by encouraging addicted parents to seek treatment.
"The department believes that adoption of this bill will serve the purpose of sending a message of condemnation of drug felonies, the importance of treatment to overcome addiction and will provide assurance to the taxpayers of the state of Maine that their hard-earned money will not reward reprehensible personal behavior," Lusk told members of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee.
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services reported handling roughly 6,000 TANF cases in April 2015. Among those cases are households that include more than 9,900 children. A fiscal note estimating the costs of the bill was not available Monday.
The LePage administration has proposed using the same screening questionnaire -- known as the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, or SASSI -- that has been adopted by other states looking to screen welfare recipients. But the authors of the SASSI have said the tool should be used to help substance abusers connect with treatment, not to deny them public assistance.
"When policy makers recognize the value of providing adjunctive services such as substance abuse counseling and vocational counseling to recipients of general assistance in need of such services, the SASSI can be a helpful tool," the Indiana-based SASSI Institute wrote, according to documents provided to the committee on Monday. "Substance abuse treatment would have a beneficial effect for both the individual and society. However, when public assistance is made contingent on participation in the assessment and treatment process, it increases the risk for violations of ethical principles and applicants' rights."
Oamshri Amarasingham with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine called the bill "constitutionally suspect" because federal courts have consistently held that governments require reasonable suspicion before requiring drug tests. Amarasingham expressed skepticism that the questionnaire was sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion, much less probable cause, for a drug test.
Several Democratic lawmakers and critics of the bill also pointed out that it goes far beyond the drug traffickers and serious offenders portrayed by the LePage administration. Under Maine law, illegal possession of such widely abused prescription opiates such as oxycodone and hydrocodone is a felony offense that could result in the loss of benefits.
Jack Comart with Maine Equal Justice Partners, a nonprofit that provides legal aid and advocacy to low-income Mainers, said that could penalize people and their families for decades.
"What we are saying is, regardless of if you have paid your debt to society, we are still going to punish you," Comart said.
Susan Lamb, executive director of the Maine chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, suggested that denying TANF or food stamps to addicts will inevitably hurt the children who have no control over their parents' poor behavior. Lamb cautioned against taking such steps unless the state is ready to put additional resources into the already overburdened foster family program.
Those comments prompted an exchange with committee member Rep. Frances Head, R-Bethel, who said it ultimately comes down to "adult choice" and whether drug users choose their children over their addiction.
"A lot of people in my district are adamant that something needs to be done, and this bill gets it going," Head said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Deb Sanderson, R-Chelsea, brought up the fact that police occasionally find electronic benefit cards -- essentially debit cards used to allocate some welfare benefits -- that are being used as cash to purchase drugs.
"There are children involved and every dollar being spent for illicit drugs is a dollar not going to care for the child or children in the home," Sanderson said in her testimony.
The committee is slated to hold a work session on the bill on Wednesday.

Texto completo:   A prominent Democratic legislator who has been pushing for looser state environmental regulations that would allow an Irving family company to mine Bald Mountain in northern Maine received $150,000 in debt relief from another Irving company.
Bankruptcy filings show that state Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, owed Irving Oil $250,000 for gasoline and diesel deliveries and other charges to a convenience store he co-owned under the corporate name Eagle Lake Outfitters in his hometown. The debt was first revealed in a 2012 news story by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting about Martin and a partner filing for bankruptcy protection for their store.
The resolution of the bankruptcy and official reduction of the debt, which the court approved in March, has not previously been reported. Federal bankruptcy court papers show that Irving Oil made a legal motion that resulted in the company receiving only 40 percent -- a little over $100,000 -- of the amount it claimed was owed by Martin and his business partner.
Martin, 73, the former longtime House speaker, sits on the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, where he has promoted changes to mining laws to allow J.D. Irving to excavate an open-pit copper and zinc mine in his district, which includes Fort Kent. In 2012, Martin introduced the first bill to make it easier to mine for valuable minerals on Bald Mountain.
Martin refused to provide information about the bankruptcy when he was asked for details by an MCPIR reporter outside the environment committee hearing room in the State House complex.
"It's none of your business," he replied. "I don't give a (expletive) what you want. You work for a lousy outfit of people, and I have no intent of talking to you or them. Is that clear?"
Maine's ethics laws for legislators do not specifically mention bankruptcy debt, nor do they require disclosure of any debt to a creditor incurred by a legislator-owned business.
Irving's proposed mine has been vigorously opposed by environmental and conservation groups -- from the Natural Resources Council of Maine to Trout Unlimited -- as well as some Aroostook County residents. On Friday, the environment committee voted to pass the mining legislation, with Martin and fellow Democratic Rep. Robert S. Duchesne of Hudson joining the six committee Republicans in favor of the bill. The remaining four committee Democrats and one independent, Portland Rep. Ben Chipman, voted against the bill.
Martin said in 2012 that there was no conflict of interest between what his store owed Irving Oil and his promotion of J.D. Irving's interests because the two Canadian conglomerates are legally separate -- a point also stressed by a spokesman for J.D. Irving.
Each of the two octogenarian Irving brothers controls one of the distinct business empires, and in recent years the media have chronicled how their personal and business relationships have cooled. But an expert on the Irving companies said the two corporate entities -- famous for being secretive -- also work together. "Yes, they do cooperate still," said Jacques Poitras, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent and author of the 2014 book "Irving vs. Irving."
Irving Oil was Eagle Lake Outfitters' largest creditor. Headquartered in Saint John, the oil company is the central unit of a set of corporations owned by billionaire Arthur L. Irving. His brother and fellow billionaire, James "J.K." Irving, owns J.D. Irving. Also based in Saint John, it's the largest of many companies overseen by James D. Irving, J. K's son. Vast timberlands in New Brunswick and Maine constitute the core of their businesses. Bald Mountain is located within J.D. Irving's 1,250,000 Maine acres, a holding that makes it the largest landowner in Maine.
Environmentalists fear water pollution from the proposed mine could ruin the relatively unspoiled character of a big part of the North Woods. Besides valuable metals, the mountain has significant amounts of arsenic and sulfide minerals that could contaminate the water table.
Opponents also fear that changes being considered to the mining law would allow other areas in Maine to be mined, including public lands used for recreation.
The Natural Resources Council says that mines throughout the world -- including two worked in Hancock County in the mid-20th century -- have a record of pollution, often leaving the public on the hook for costly cleanups.
But J.D. Irving and its supporters argue that contemporary technology can create a non-polluting mine and that a poor part of the state would benefit from the 300 jobs the company says would be created, plus 400 indirect jobs because of increased economic activity in the area. Martin has said that he supports the Bald Mountain development because it would bring jobs to Aroostook County.
Gov. Paul LePage and his Department of Environmental Protection, business groups and many Republican legislators strongly support Irving's mining proposal.
The bankruptcy papers show that Eagle Lake Outfitters' creditors other than Irving were owed a total of $45,000. Martin's partner, Gary Voisine, wouldn't divulge details about the bankruptcy, but said debts with all the creditors had been settled.
A representative of Tulsa Inc., a gas station and "petroleum services" firm in Van Buren, which was owed $21,000, said it had been paid. A spokesperson for the state Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department said it had been paid the $2,200 it was owed for license fees. Several other creditors did not return phone calls.
In the bankruptcy settlement, Martin and Voisine paid $125,000. Of that, $101,343 went to Irving, and the balance went to court fees and other creditors. Martin and Vosine each own 50 percent of the store
In 2012, Martin told the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting that he and Voisine bought back the Route 11 store for $125,000 they got from "private business equity," but would not elaborate.
Asked about the arrangement, Voisine said "how I pay off stuff" was not the media's business.
He angrily denied that there had been any "deal" with the Irving companies. He said "we never owed" $250,000 to Irving Oil but only $100,000. The company had jacked up the amount owed with "lawyer fees for years" and "a bunch of" other charges, he claimed.
Anthony Banford, a spokesman for Irving Oil, responded: "It's on the public record that a judgment was granted by a Maine Court in Irving Oil's favor against Eagle Lake Outfitters for amounts the court agreed were owed to our Company." Banford added that Irving Oil and J.D. Irving are "two separate companies, operated completely independently." He did not directly address the question of why the company accepted only 40 percent of what it said it was owed.
Martin's bankruptcy and involvement with the Irving companies were reported during his 2012 campaign for reelection to the House. Following that revelation, he was defeated by a political newcomer. He retook the seat in 2014. In the 1990s a ballot-stuffing scandal sent a Martin aide to jail that cost the veteran legislator the speakership.
Jonathan Wayne, director of the state's Commission on Governmental Ethics and Elections Practices, would not comment on the situation with Martin and Irving. Maine ethics laws don't specifically mention bankruptcy debt. When asked whether any sections of the ethics laws could apply, Wayne said two sections that address whether a legislator is using his public position to benefit himself or another entity might.
The first one states that it is a violation of legislative ethics when "a Legislator or a member of the Legislator's immediate family accepts gifts, other than campaign contributions duly recorded as required by law, from persons affected by legislation or who have an interest in an entity affected by proposed legislation and the Legislator knows or reasonably should know that the purpose of the donor in making the gift is to influence the Legislator ... or is intended as a reward for action on the Legislator's part."
The second section that could apply states that it is a violation of legislative ethics for a legislator to engage in conduct that constitutes an abuse of office or position. That includes "granting or obtaining special privilege, exemption or preferential treatment to or for oneself or another, which privilege, exemption or treatment is not readily available to members of the general community or class to which the beneficiary belongs."
The current House speaker, Democrat Mark Eves, declined to comment when asked whether he thinks Martin's actions constitute a conflict of interest.
Rep. Benjamin Chipman, the Portland independent who sits next to Martin in the Environment and Natural Resources Committee room, said Martin probably doesn't see the debt reduction and his sponsorship of the mining bill as a conflict of interest. "But other people see it that way," Chipman said.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA -- Family members of a grandfather and grandson killed in a crash involving a Budget Truck van 31/2 years ago have lost their wrongful death lawsuit and will not be awarded damages.
The lawsuit was over the deaths of Dennis R. Kay, 62, of Gardiner, and his grandson, 25-year-old Carlton Norwood, of Pittston. Both were killed in the accident that occurred on an icy Brunswick Avenue in Gardiner early on Dec. 31, 2011. Investigators said Kay was at the wheel.
Representatives of Kay's estate, his son Joshua Henderson, of Pittston, and daughter Stacey Henderson, of Augusta, filed a lawsuit in July 2013 against a number of defendants, including the estate of Douglas J. Wiggins, who owned Option Rentals of Farmingdale at the time and functioned as a rental dealer and transfer vendor for Budget Truck. The Hendersons, on behalf of the estate, sought damages under Maine's Wrongful Death statute. Wiggins died in May 2013 of causes unrelated to the crash, and so his estate was represented by Tressa Springmann of Glenwood, Maryland.
A judge granted summary judgment last week in the Kennebec County Superior Court case. The judgment stands unless an appeal is filed.
"Obviously we're disappointed with the decision," said attorney Caleb Gannon, of Lipman & Katz, who represented the Hendersons. "We will be discussing it in more detail with our clients and won't make the decision about an appeal for approximately 20 days."
Justice Michaela Murphy concluded that summary judgment was warranted because the Hendersons maintained that Kay was an employee of Wiggins, so the claim was barred by the Workers' Compensation Act.
"Springmann asserted that Kay was an independent contractor who had done work for Option Rentals and Budget Truck," the judge wrote.
The judge also concluded "no reasonable juror could find that Mr. Wiggins proximately caused Mr. Kay's injuries."
Another of Kay's grandsons, Thomas G. Bourque, formerly of Randolph and now of Belgrade, who was sitting in a lawn chair in the back of the cargo van, was the lone survivor of the New Year's Eve crash.
Murphy noted that in several depositions filed in the case, relatives of Kay's stated, "Mr. Kay would not have taken his grandsons, Messrs. Bourque and Norwood, out on the road that day if he thought the road conditions would be unsafe."
In the order granting Budget Truck's motion for summary judgment, Murphy outlined the details surrounding the crash, including an apparent directive by Wiggins to Kay to do a truck transfer run on Dec. 30, 2011, in order to get paid. Kay declined to go that day, citing weather conditions.
However, Murphy noted, he made no objection to going the next day.
Murphy noted, "The court finds that an employer does not have a duty to predict localized weather events that create unsafe driving conditions."
She also wrote, "Mr. Wiggins' actions did not play a substantial part in bringing about Mr. Kay's injuries, instead those injuries were brought about due to the annual risks posed by Maine's relatively harsh winters."
Budget Truck, through attorney Michael E. Saucier, of Thompson & Bowie, maintained that the icy road conditions were the result of a flash freeze.
In her decision, Murphy wrote that the plaintiffs failed to make the case that conduct by Budget caused Kay's injuries.
"At most Budget Truck's alleged negligence gave rise to the occasion that made Mr. Kay's injuries possible," she wrote.
Saucier said Monday, "I thought Justice Murphy put together a very thoughtful and exhaustive opinion on a very tragic case that involved intricate factual interrelationship and complex legal issues involving essentially a vehicle owner, Budget Truck; a vehicle driver, Kay; the rental dealer, Option Rentals; and the transfer vendor, Wiggins."
Bourque filed a separate lawsuit in the same court in July 2014, seeking damages and reimbursement for his medical bills.
That case was apparently resolved at a dispute resolution conference early last month, but there is no indication of what that settlement might be in the docket entries in the Kennebec County Superior Court case. Saucier declined to speak about that case.

Texto completo:   A lawsuit over the deaths of a grandfather and grandson in a crash involving a Budge van 3 1/2 years ago has ended in favor of defendants.
AUGUSTA -- Family members of a grandfather and grandson killed in a crash involving a Budget Truck van 31/2 years ago have lost their wrongful death lawsuit and will not be awarded damages.
The lawsuit was over the deaths of Dennis R. Kay, 62, of Gardiner, and his grandson, 25-year-old Carlton Norwood of Pittston. Both were killed in the accident that occurred on an icy Brunswick Avenue in Gardiner early on Dec. 31, 2011. Investigators said Kay was at the wheel.
Representatives of Kay's estate, his son Joshua Henderson of Pittston and daughter Stacey Henderson of Augusta, filed a lawsuit in July 2013 against a number of defendants, including the estate of Douglas J. Wiggins, who owned Option Rentals of Farmingdale at the time and functioned as a rental dealer and transfer vendor for Budget Truck. The Hendersons, on behalf of the estate, sought damages under Maine's Wrongful Death statute. Wiggins died in May 2013 of causes unrelated to the crash, and so his estate was represented by Tressa Springmann of Glenwood, Maryland.
A judge granted summary judgment last week in the Kennebec County Superior Court case. The judgment stands unless an appeal is filed.
"Obviously we're disappointed with the decision," said attorney Caleb Gannon, of Lipman & Katz, who represented the Hendersons. "We will be discussing it in more detail with our clients and won't make the decision about an appeal for approximately 20 days."
Justice Michaela Murphy concluded that summary judgment was warranted because the Hendersons maintained that Kay was an employee of Wiggins, so the claim was barred by the Workers' Compensation Act.
"Springmann asserted that Kay was an independent contractor who had done work for Option Rentals and Budget Truck," the judge wrote.
The judge also concluded "no reasonable juror could find that Mr. Wiggins proximately caused Mr. Kay's injuries."
Another of Kay's grandsons, Thomas G. Bourque, formerly of Randolph and now of Belgrade, who was sitting in a lawn chair in the back of the cargo van, was the lone survivor of the New Year's Eve crash.
Murphy noted that in several depositions filed in the case, relatives of Kay's stated, "Mr. Kay would not have taken his grandsons, Messrs. Bourque and Norwood, out on the road that day if he thought the road conditions would be unsafe."
In the order granting Budget Truck's motion for summary judgment, Murphy outlined the details surrounding the crash, including an apparent directive by Wiggins to Kay to do a truck transfer run on Dec. 30, 2011, in order to get paid.
Kay declined to go that day, citing weather conditions. However, Murphy noted, he made no objection to going the next day.
Murphy noted, "The court finds that an employer does not have a duty to predict localized weather events that create unsafe driving conditions."
She also wrote, "Mr. Wiggins' actions did not play a substantial part in bringing about Mr. Kay's injuries, instead those injuries were brought about due to the annual risks posed by Maine's relatively harsh winters."
Budget Truck, through attorney Michael E. Saucier, of Thompson & Bowie, maintained that the icy road conditions were the result of a flash freeze.
In her decision, Murphy wrote that the plaintiffs failed to make the case that conduct by Budget caused Kay's injuries.
"At most Budget Truck's alleged negligence gave rise to the occasion that made Mr. Kay's injuries possible," she wrote.
Saucier said Monday, "I thought Justice Murphy put together a very thoughtful and exhaustive opinion on a very tragic case that involved intricate factual interrelationship and complex legal issues involving essentially a vehicle owner, Budget Truck; a vehicle driver, Kay; the rental dealer, Option Rentals; and the transfer vendor, Wiggins."
Bourque filed a separate lawsuit in the same court in July 2014, seeking damages and reimbursement for his medical bills. That case was apparently resolved at a dispute resolution conference early last month, but there is no indication of what that settlement might be in the docket entries in the Kennebec County Superior Court case. Saucier declined to speak about that case.

North Dakota, a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, went 29-10-3 and reached the Frozen Four where it was beaten by Boston University 5-3.
North Dakota will have a new head coach as longtime assistant Brad Berry is being promoted after Dave Hakstol was named the new coach of the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers on Monday.
Big Ten school Michigan State went 17-16-2 and lost to Michigan 4-1 in the Big Ten Tournament. semifinals.
The Spartans' top-scoring defenseman was Travis Walsh, son of late University of Maine coach Shawn Walsh. He will be a senior this fall.

LePage proposes drug testing for every TANF applicant

Resumen: Several people lauded a provision in the bill that allows a person to avoid being kicked off welfare because of a positive drug test if they enter a drug treatment program, but said there are far too few substance abuse treatment programs in Maine and that their cost is a barrier -- especially for people who are already at the point of asking for public help.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage's plan to prevent anyone with a felony drug conviction from collecting cash welfare benefits advanced Monday in Augusta with a bill that would extend a program launched earlier this year.
In January, LePage and his administration began administering drug tests on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families applicants who have had felony drug convictions within the past 20 years. That came after the concept received strong legislative support in 2011 and after the law was adjusted at the advice of the attorney general's office to avoid lawsuits.
Now, LePage is proposing LD 1407, which would require any applicant to the TANF program -- regardless of whether they have any kind of criminal record related to drugs -- to undergo a written, 93-question screening test and then, depending on the results, a urine test.
The test is designed to uncover if the person is or has the potential to be a drug addict. A certain score on the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory -- which is supposed to be nearly fail-proof -- would trigger a mandate for a urinalysis drug test. A positive result on the urinalysis would force the applicant to either enroll in a drug abuse treatment program or be denied state benefits.
LD 1407 also would allow the state to deny TANF or Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (food stamps) benefits to anyone who has been convicted of a drug-related felony, for life. TANF is a straight cash benefit for families that fall below certain income levels; SNAP is a food supplement program for low-income people.
Holly Lusk, LePage's health policy adviser, said the new law would serve as a powerful deterrent and a sure path to saving taxpayer dollars.
"The department believes that adoption of this bill will serve the purpose of sending a message of condemnation of drug felonies, the importance of treatment to overcome addiction and will provide assurance to the taxpayers of the state of Maine that their hard-earned money will not reward reprehensible personal behavior," said Lusk.
However, some members of the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee, as well as lobbyists who testified to the committee on Monday, said addiction is an illness and that banning someone from public assistance for life is too harsh a consequence. They said such measures could harm entire families, including children of drug convicts -- even if the conviction was decades ago.
"We believe that the use of illegal substances is a root cause of poverty, but we also believe that the best way to treat addiction is not with a game of 'gotcha,'" said Susan Lamb, executive director of the Maine chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. "People with addiction are often parents of children, and those children, living below the poverty level, are entitled to food on the table and a roof over their heads, no matter what their parents' addiction issues are."
Several people lauded a provision in the bill that allows a person to avoid being kicked off welfare because of a positive drug test if they enter a drug treatment program, but said there are far too few substance abuse treatment programs in Maine and that their cost is a barrier -- especially for people who are already at the point of asking for public help.
"Regardless of the fact they've paid their debt to society, we're still going to deny people assistance even though they've done everything we asked them to do," said Jack Comart of Maine Equal Justice Partners, which opposes the bill. "If we talk about hurting children, that's the one thing we can do to hurt children."
Rep. Frances Head, R-Bethel, said feedback from her constituents on this issue has been one-sided.
"Many people in my district are really adamant about getting something done, and this bill gets it going," she said. "Some of this is adult choice. The taxpayers are tired of it, being that we have to pay for their bad choices."
LD 1407 was one of two of LePage's welfare reform bills presented to the Health and Human Services Committee on Monday. The other, LD 1402, is designed to create a tiered welfare system in which people on public assistance lose their benefits incrementally as their income increases. The bill is similar in concept but different in details to a bill previously presented by Rep. Drew Gattine, D-Westbrook.
Several lawmakers and organizations said they supported the concepts in LePage's bill -- including one that would help people with job-related transportation costs -- though some said the first step off welfare would be too steep in the governor's proposal.

Food drive success
BANGOR -- Organizers of NEWS CENTER's 10th annual Feed Maine Food Drive to benefit Good Shepherd Food-Bank report that Mainers showed their great generosity once again.
WCSH 6 and WLBZ 2 personalities greeted the public on May 9 at Hannaford Supermarkets in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Sanford and Scarborough.
Good Shepherd Food-Bank estimated the total number of meals from this year's drive at 60,820. Cash donations in the amount of $13,665 came in, as well as 7,343 pounds of food.
This was the first time viewers could make a donation via text on their mobile phones.
"There are so many stories I could tell about the generosity that happened on Saturday," said Steve Carter, president and general manager of WCSH 6. "At one location, two people stopped and asked what we needed. The folks from Good Shepherd Food-Bank told them, and they went into the store. A few minutes later they returned with three shopping carts just overflowing with those foods. Another man handed Good Shepherd a check for $100; he said that several years ago he needed food, but now he wanted to give back. And a dad brought along his 5-year-old son to drop off their donations; he said this was a great opportunity to teach his little boy about how important it is to help others."
Nearly 15 percent of households, or approximately 200,000 people in Maine, are food insecure, ranking 17th in the nation, and first in New England. One in four Maine children are food insecure. Thirty-six percent of Maine's food insecure population makes too much to qualify for Food EBT so must rely on Good Shepherd's network of partner agencies. The Food-Bank helps to provide meals for tens of thousands of Mainers every week, according to information at the good Shepherd Food-Bank website.

Resumen: A combination of racial slurs and questionable refereeing during the Western Maine Class D schoolboy title game at the Augusta Civic Center has led administrators at the Hyde School in Bath to pull their boys basketball team out of the Maine Principals' Association and rejoin the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council. Gauld discussed the situation with his coaches, players and fans and said the "tandem of the racial slurs and officiating" led them to believe leaving the MPA for the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council was in their best interest.

Texto completo:   A combination of racial slurs and questionable refereeing during the Western Maine Class D schoolboy title game at the Augusta Civic Center has led administrators at the Hyde School in Bath to pull their boys basketball team out of the Maine Principals' Association and rejoin the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council.
The girls basketball team will remain in the MPA.
Malcolm Gauld, the president and chief executive officer of the Hyde Schools, said students and faculty at the game against Forest Hills of Jackman heard the slurs in the crowd, including the N-word.
Forest Hills won the game 64-50 on Feb. 21 and sank 28 of 45 free throws, including 16 in the fourth quarter. The game was televised by MPBN.
Gauld said the racial slurs and the discrepancy in foul shots left a bitter taste in the mouths of the players, coaches and fans.
"Our people were really rocked by this particular game," he said. "Maybe [Forest Hills] would have beaten us anyway.
"But it didn't feel right," he added.
He also pointed out that Hyde attempted just six free throws. Four Hyde players fouled out.
"I'd be curious to know if there had ever been a disparity that great in a tournament game," posed Gauld. "Maybe there has been. My guess is that there hasn't been."
Gauld, who was at the game, did not hear the racial slurs but was told about them.
However, he said he did get into two verbal altercations with fans who were abusive to his players and school.
"One of them was calling our players [juvenile delinquents] and telling them to go back to reform school," said Gauld who confronted the fan and informed him the players didn't come from reform schools.
"Why would someone say something like that?" asked Gauld.
The Hyde School is a private boarding school for grades 9-12 and postgraduates. Gauld said they have students from 30 states. Ninety-nine percent of the 150 students are boarding school students. There is also a school in Woodstock, Connecticut.
Gauld discussed the situation with his coaches, players and fans and said the "tandem of the racial slurs and officiating" led them to believe leaving the MPA for the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council was in their best interest.
"This is what's best for the kids," said Gauld.
Dick Durost, executive director of the Maine Principals' Association, said he didn't learn of the racial slurs until Laura Gauld, the head of the Hyde School and Malcolm's wife, sent him an email about them last week.
"The frustrating thing on my part is if anyone had said anything to our staff at the game, it would have been addressed on the spot," said Durost who indicated that those fans spewing racial slurs would have been removed from the premises.
"I know and respect Laura Gauld enough that if she tells me there were racial slurs, I believe her 100 percent," Durost said. "We have staff members who are responsible for making sure their diversity is respected."
He said the three key MPA staff members at the game -- MPA basketball committee chairman Ryan Wilkins, site director Doran Stout and Maine basketball commissioner Peter Webb -- were not informed about the slurs at the game.
Webb said he didn't hear any in the approximate 10 minutes he spent at the game.
Durost said he received an email from Laura Gauld 10 days after the tournament and she expressed the concern that there were no officials on Hyde's recommended list who were in the game.
Schools submit lists of referees they would like to referee their games.
"There was a legitimate reason," explained Durost. "Five of the people on their list didn't get enough votes to qualify for the tournament pool."
He added that another had a relative who worked at the Hyde School.
Durost said from time to time, there are games with wide discrepancies in free throw attempts.
"Sometimes, you have a team trying to get back into a game by fouling," said Durost.
Webb said the discrepancy in fouls "is not normal but it isn't unusual.
"If a team is playing aggressively, they're going to have more fouls," he said.
"If someone has a question about [how the game was officiated], the answer is simple: Watch the video. Break down the game," said Webb. "There was a quality crew of officials."
Webb has not watched the video yet but said he doesn't believe the officials or any officials favor one team or another.
Boys and girls basketball are the only sports in which the Hyde School participates under the MPA umbrella.
They play in the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council in all of their other sports.
The school has been in and out of the MPA in basketball. It had both high school and prep school teams at the same time, although Gauld said the school hasn't had a prep school team in 15 years.
Hyde won the Class C state title in boys basketball in 1980 and 1981 and the Class D state crown in 1997.
Hyde left the MPA after the 1981 state final because Gauld said they got tired of hearing the anti-private school complaints.
"People said we shouldn't have been in the league so we said 'Why put up with this?'" said Gauld, who has been affiliated with the school for 40 years.
Hyde decided to return to the MPA in 1987 for several reasons, according to Gauld.
"I love the [MPA] tournaments," he said. "When you play prep school games, you're playing in front of girlfriends and parents."
He said there will be advantages to returning to the prep school league.
"We have had trouble scheduling games [in the MPA]. Now we won't. And now our fifth-year students will be able to play," he said. "It will be nice to be in a league with the same types of schools."
Fifth-year students aren't allowed to play in the MPA.
There will be more travel, but not nearly as many MPA regulations pertaining to things such as when a team can start practicing.
Gauld won't rule out a return to the MPA.
Durost said since Hyde is still a full member, its boys basketball team can return at any time without having to get permission from the MPA.
"We welcome the fact their girls basketball team will still be with us, and from time to time, they'll have an individual swimmer, wrestler or tennis play who can compete [in MPA events]," said Durost.
Gauld said he has the utmost respect for the MPA and said the association once granted a waiver to one of their student-athlete to participate in sports in his fifth year after he missed an entire year due to health issues.

Texto completo:   BELFAST, Maine -- A Massachusetts-based technology company is planning to start hiring workers immediately in midcoast Maine -- and may expand to as many as 350 new jobs, according to Gov. Paul LePage -- in order to open a logistics support center in Belfast.
OnProcess Technology currently employs more than 2,200 employees in several locations around the world who work to help businesses manage their global supply chains. It will move into a 35,000-square foot office building off Route 3 that was built in the 1990s by former credit card giant MBNA.
"We are pleased to welcome OnProcess Technology to Maine," LePage said in a media release. "This company has experienced significant growth within the last year and could have chosen anywhere in the world for an expansion. Its decision to start an operation in Maine is a testament to our ongoing commitment to become better partners with the private sector in attracting new investment and career opportunities for Maine people."
OnProcess Technology has plans to hire 50 full-time employees in the next two months, and Ed Barry, the founder and CEO said that he would like to see that number expand greatly.
"I'd love to have 350 people in Maine in two or three years," he said in a phone interview from Massachusetts. "Our business is growing, and we're picking Maine as a long-term growth potential for us."
The first positions created in Belfast will be in what he calls "asset recovery," a job that will pay a competitive rate.
"That's what we founded the business on," Barry said. "It's good work, solid work."
He started the company in 1998 with just one client after realizing there was a niche that needed to be filled in supply chain management. Now, his clients are companies primarily in technology, broadband, wireless and the durable medical equipment industries and include such well-known names as Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon. When customers have problems with the products they have purchased, OnProcess often is the company that answers their calls and tries to help them. If problems can't be solved over the phone or via email, OnProcess asset recovery specialists will figure out what to do next.
"We get inventory back, fix it and reengineer it," Barry said. "We are asset-light. We are not touching or repairing anything. We're tracking inventory and getting inventory returned. We're a technology-driven service. We're focused on aftermarket services and service supply chain. We help our clients drive down costs by managing these service offerings very effectively."
Barry and OnProcess officials have been working with Maine & Company, a firm that provides free consulting services to companies looking to relocate to or expand within Maine. Last January, Belfast city officials voted to apply for a $1.1 million state community development block grant in an effort to encourage OnProcess Technology to open a branch in the midcoast city. The company, which was awarded $800,000, said if it received the grant it would match it with its own funds and pledged to create 50 full-time jobs in Belfast. Those CDBG funds would be used to provide the company with working capital, to purchase telephone, computer and other equipment and to provide job training.
Maine's congressional delegation was quick to welcome the company to the Pine Tree State, with U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine), U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and U.S. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), hailing the announcement as being a boon for the state's economy.
OnProcess will help to fill out the former MBNA campus, which now is home to athenahealth, Bank of America and Seaport Family Practice. City officials said that athenaheath and Bank of America are believed to employ around 800 people each in Belfast.
"All other things being equal, I think you'd rather have several sizeable employers as opposed to one massive employer," Belfast Economic Development Director Thomas Kittredge said Monday. "It's great to have a diversity of firms. I think that adds an element of stability to the regional economy."
Belfast Mayor Walter Ash said Monday that the news was great for the city, which has been experiencing something of a renaissance in the last few years and which has attracted some new businesses.
"It gives more people different opportunities for employment," he said. "I think it's all good. The state's open for business, and we're open for business. And what better place to locate to than Belfast? The whole council is thrilled about it."
OnProcess will hold a job fair from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Wednesday, May 20, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 21, at the Hutchinson Center in Belfast.

Texto completo:   TOPSHAM -- "Maine Indian Basketry" is an exhibition on view now through June 30 at Maine Fiberarts, 13 Main St. in Topsham. The exhibition includes 78 baskets woven by more than 30 Wabanaki basketmakers, loaned from 12 different sources. The public is invited to attend a reception and art conversation with Penobscot basketmaker Theresa Secord will take place 2-5 p.m. Sunday, May 24.
The Wabanaki or People of the Dawn include members of the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet and Micmac tribes who hail from the northern and Down East regions of Maine. They have a long standing tradition of weaving baskets prized for their utility and fine craftsmanship.
Since January, members of a curatorial committee have been gathering baskets for the Maine Fiberarts show from the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor, from Home and Away Gallery in Kennebunkport, from several private collectors, and from the artists themselves. Baskets include both historical and contemporary examples. While the materials used are mainly brown ash and sweetgrass, the techniques employed vary widely. Point baskets, curly baskets, handkerchief, alewife, button, sewing and birch baskets are all on view. Baskets shaped like corn and radishes, stand next to work baskets with handles, and baskets that are 18-inches tall. The exhibition includes the work of David Moses Bridges, Pam Cunningham, George Neptune, Clara Keezer, Molly Neptune Parker, Jeremy Frey, Fred Tomah, Mary Sanipass, Theresa Secord and Sarah Sockbeson, to name only a few.
Special programming to coincide with the exhibition will also take place. On Sunday, May 24, Theresa Secord, former executive director of the Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance, will offer an art conversation at a reception for the exhibition. Secord served as an adviser and lead curator to the project, along with Gretchen Faulkner of the Hudson Museum in Orono. On Saturday, June 13, Passamaquoddy basket maker George Neptune will offer a talk 1-3 p.m. Saturday, June 13 at Curtis Memorial Library in Brunswick on the topic of "Collecting Maine Baskets." Theresa Secord will offer a hands-on workshop, "Weaving an Ash and Sweetgrass Bookmark," 1-2 p.m. Saturday, June 20, at Topsham Public Library. Admission to the workshop is free to the first 20 people who sign up by emailing cyndi@topshamlibrary.org or by calling 725-1727.
The Maine Indian Basketry Exhibition is sponsored by Bangor Savings Bank, Maine Humanities Council, Maine Arts Commission, Maine Community Foundation and by several individuals who value this art form.
Since the year 2000, Maine Fiberarts has hosted exhibitions that change every two or three months. The statewide arts nonprofit currently hosts a free online Maine Fiberarts Tour, including a Resource Guide, News Bulletin and Fiber Folio to promote Maine's fiber community. Visit the group in Topsham 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Saturday or online at mainefiberarts.org.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- After its debut year, Maine appears to be on the path to dumping its brand new statewide test meant to measure what students have learned.
That means whatever state assessment comes next would be the third that Maine schools have seen in as many years.
On Monday, members of the Legislature's Education and Cultural Affairs Committee voted unanimously in favor of LD 1276, An Act To Improve Educational Assessments of Maine Students, which seeks to end the state's membership in the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. The Department of Education would issue a request for proposals to provide new tests.
"For more than a year, we have heard stories as to the pitfalls of the test, as well as the errors in it that confuse students and make taking the test a stressful and frustrating event," said Lois Kilby Chesley, president of the Maine Education Association. She said her organization was "ecstatic" about the vote.
The bill now goes to the House and Senate for votes.
"The committee understood that Smarter Balanced contract wouldn't be renewed by the governor under any circumstance, and the political turbulence around testing this year is intense," Rep. Brian Hubbell, D-Bar Harbor, said Monday night in an email explaining the committee's vote.
Smarter Balanced officials said Monday night that they were "disappointed" by the committee vote.
"Maine has been a leader in Smarter Balanced with hundreds of Maine teachers building the assessment," said Tony Alpert, executive director of the assessment company. "States all over the country use Smarter Balanced because it measures critical thinking and problem solving and colleges and universities have given the test their stamp of approval. In the first year of deployment, there are always bumps in the road. We worked with Maine as issues arose and believed Maine was in an excellent position to continue giving an online, high-quality assessment like Smarter Balanced."
This spring, the Smarter Balanced consortium issued its first official Maine test, replacing the New England Common Assessment Program, a test that Maine students in grades three through eight had been taking in reading and math since 2009. It also replaced the SAT, which had been used to test 11th-graders since 2006.
The Smarter Balanced contract was $2.7 million in its first -- and possibly only -- year, with $900,000 in annual dues, according to acting Education Commissioner Tom Desjardins. Desjardins said there is no financial penalty for withdrawing from the consortium.
Smarter Balanced has come under fire in other states for major failures and bugs that delayed testing. In Montana, for example, a series of widespread technical problems caused the state to make the testing optional in its debut this spring. North Dakota and Nevada also reported problems.
While Maine hasn't experienced any "major statewide disasters," according to Desjardins, representatives of the Maine Education Association say some districts or parents have reported that students experienced "freezes" while taking the test, lost work "for no explainable reason," or struggled with "vague and poorly worded questions."
During a public hearing in front of the Education Committee earlier this month, students and teachers visiting Augusta lashed out against the test.
Desjardins said that if the bill passes and the Smarter Balanced contract is severed, DOE will issue a request for proposals to provide new state assessments to Maine's school districts. Northwest Evaluation Association, Pearson, Measured Progress and Educational Testing Service are a few examples of organizations that offer these services and could be potential suitors to supply a new test for Maine.
Bangor school Superintendent Betsy Webb said Monday that if the state were to drop Smarter Balanced, she would favor using the SAT as the state's high school assessment and Northwest Evaluation Association to measure earlier grades. She said her district would prefer a computer-based test -- because of "timeliness and ease of access" -- with a testing period no longer than two weeks to cut down on lost instruction time.
"Assessment, if used wisely, is critical for helping students and schools progress to the next level of performance," Webb said.
Desjardins said it would be "foolish" for the state to return to "fill-in-the-bubble" tests, as those have lived out their useful life. Any bidders for the new statewide assessment would be required to include a computer-based testing option.
The state likely would consider companies with existing tests, as hiring a group to develop an entirely new assessment from scratch -- including the thousands of questions that come with it -- can be a costly venture, especially in a state with a small population, according to Desjardins.

Texto completo:   BATH, Maine -- Bath shipbuilders will take to the streets Thursday for a "solidarity" rally as Bath Iron Works navigates its way through the company's largest labor unrest in decades.
The action follows a March 24 event where nearly 1,000 members of the International Association of Machinists Union Local marched the length of the shipyard at midday to rally support and to protest a variety of changes proposed by BIW President Fred Harris.
Harris assumed the helm at Bath Iron Works, a subsidiary of General Dynamics, in 2013 and continues to oversee the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego.
As caps on defense spending result in fewer Naval contracts, Harris said the changes, including outsourcing work and cross-training employees, will increase the shipyard's efficiency and keep the costs of building destroyers competitive.
With two major bidding wars on the horizon, however, a disagreement between management and the shipyard's largest union over just how to cut costs has resulted in accusations, third-party arbitration and, most recently, a federal lawsuit charging BIW with violating its contract with workers.
Once the largest private employer in the United States, Bath Iron Works now counts about 5,700 shipbuilders -- up from 4,500 in 1985 and down from about 6,800 in 2003.
Best known for building Arleigh-Burke class DDG-51 destroyers, three Zumwalt-class "stealth" destroyers are also underway at the Bath shipyard.
Bath Iron Works has built Arleigh Burke-class destroyers since the late 1980s, and currently competes with Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, for contracts for the ships, which cost approximately $1.5 billion to build.
In June 2013, the Navy awarded BIW contracts for four DDG-51s, while Huntington Ingalls landed contracts for five. In March, the Navy awarded a fifth ship to BIW.
BIW officials announced at the time of the initial award that winning four versus five for Ingalls "sent a strong message about where BIW stands relative to its competition. Although BIW was awarded four ships, the inescapable fact is that BIW was not the winning bidder."
"In order to improve our competitive position to win future work, BIW must reduce the cost of building ships in Bath, Maine, to a level the Navy can afford and at a price which is lower than our Mississippi competitors," officials said, not for the first time.
Bath Iron works currently is building three DDG 51 destroyers. The DDG 115, the future USS Rafael Peralta, has been under construction since November 2011 and is slated to be christened this fall. Work on the DDG 116, the future USS Thomas Hudner, began in November 2012 and is about 45 percent complete, according to the company. Construction of the future USS Daniel Inouye, the DDG 118, began in April 2015.
The shipyard has four additional Arleigh Burke-class destroyers under contract and may snag another one depending on the Navy's interpretation of a 2002 memorandum of understanding among the Navy, BIW and Northrop Grumman, which was at the time the lead yard for the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship ( LPD-17).
That year, the Navy transferred contracts for four LPD 17s scheduled to be built at BIW to Northrop Grumman-owned Ingalls and Avondale shipyards in exchange for four DDG 51 destroyers contracted to Northrop Grumman.
The memorandum of understanding states that a fourth DDG-51 class ship "or equivalent workload" would be awarded to BIW preceding any award of a 12th amphibious transport vessel. In April, the Navy added that ship to its latest 30-year shipbuilding plan, DefenseNews reported.
BIW will also bid against Huntington Ingalls in 2016 on another multi-year contract for destroyers.
Bath Iron Works continues work on all three Zumwalt-class "stealth" destroyers, a line touted as the "most complex surface combatants the U.S. Navy has ever developed."
The high-technology Zumwalt class originally was planned by the Pentagon to replace the DDG 51 class. In 2008, however, the Pentagon scuttled that plan because of concerns about the cost to build the Zumwalt. But more recently, analysts have said the line may be extended given the Navy's investment in the Bath shipyard and hints by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert that the Zumwalt is even better than expected.
In March, Bloomberg estimated the cost of the three ships at $12.9 billion, or about $4.3 billion per ship.
Before it changed course, though, the Pentagon had agreed to construction of three Zumwalts, all of which are being built in Bath.
The first-in-class DDG 1000, the future USS Zumwalt, is now scheduled for sea trials later this year; the DDG 1001, the future USS Michael Monsoor, is approximately 79 percent complete and slated for delivery in December 2018, according to BIW officials. Work on the the DDG 1002, the future USS Lyndon Johnson, began in April 2012 and is about 25 percent complete.
Most recently, in February 2014, BIW secured a $21 million design contract for a new class of U.S. Coast Guard offshore patrol cutters.
In competition with two other shipyards, BIW also will bid next year to build the cutters, scheduled to begin construction in 2017. Among the company's competitors for the contract is Bollinger Shipyard in Lockport, Louisiana, which in late 2008 edged out BIW in a competition for new Coast Guard cutter contracts worth up to $1.5 billion.
But to win the Coast Guard contract, as well as be successful in the next multi-year procurement of DDG 51s, BIW must reduce costs, according to both analysts and management.
"If it were just about quality, Bath would probably win," Industry analyst Loren Thompson of The Lexington Group said of the Coast Guard contract. "But it's at least as much about cost, and that's where Bath is challenged."
In 2013, BIW undertook a $32 million project including a 51,000-square-foot, 11-story outfitting building. At the time, officials said improvements would add to approximately $500 million of investment by the company in the last decade and would bring nearly all shipbuilding processes inside, thus eliminating the largest disadvantage of shipbuilding in Maine: the weather.
Harris told the Bangor Daily News in January that BIW must win those bidding wars in order to keep up with employment, noting that securing the Coast Guard contract would avert laying off about 35 percent of the shipyard's manufacturing workforce -- about 1,200 employees. Of increasing efficiency, he said, "We're not going to pay people less, but we need to do more per hour than we've done."
Harris has proposed a number of changes, including outsourcing and cross-training employees, known as "additional functions."
Union officials object to both, and successfully argued against some outsourcing. They say "additional functions" is a way for management to force employees to work out of classification, pitting one group of union members against another.
Jay Wadleigh, president of Local S6, which represents about 3,000 of Bath Iron Works' approximately 5,700 workers, said cross-training was "a disaster and a morale-breaker" when it was in place from 1994 to 2000, and was one of the reasons for a 55-day strike in 2000.
Since November, Harris has on three occasions proposed outsourcing certain components of its ships from other vendors instead of making them at the shipyard, leading union leaders to suspect he is less willing to collaborate with unions than some of his recent predecessors.
In 2014, when Harris sought to outsource pipe hangars for the destroyers to NASSCO, his San Diego company, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, intervened after the union discovered NASSCO bought parts for the pipe hangars from Mexico.
The union successfully argued against some of the other outsourcing, and has filed a grievance and filed for accelerated arbitration regarding other outsourcing proposals.
In early March, Harris also sought to temporarily bring in 16 electricians from NASSCO until BIW could train enough new hires. Instead, the union negotiated an alternate plan in which current employees worked extra hours for months to accomplish the work themselves.
Most recently, on April 22, Local S6 filed a suit in U.S. District Court charging the company with violating its contract with the workers by seeking to modify job descriptions outside of a formal contract negotiation, which won't occur again until May 2016. The union also objects to the company's demand to resolve those changes before a third party in arbitration.
Union officials say increased efficiency is necessary, and agree that "some level of flexibility" could work. But they suggest greater savings could be found through other changes, such as ensuring workers have materials to do their jobs when they need them.
Thompson said Friday that while BIW still makes the best ships and is considered "a very efficient operation," changes such as cross-training are essential to keep it competitive.
"BIW doesn't have the luxury of maintaining these artificial distinctions in terms of skill sets and work boundaries," Thompson said. "If Bath is going to remain [competitive] for the long run, it needs the flexibility to get the greatest productivity out of each employee the notion that people shouldn't be allowed to cross-train even though their skills might be underutilized belongs to another age."
Craig Hooper, a former vice president at BIW competitor Austal USA who writes about the defense industry at NextNavy.com, said in January that BIW "is one of the most endangered shipyards out there."
"It hasn't built a commercial ship since the early 1980s, and it's entirely dedicated to developing and building large surface combatants," Hooper wrote. "It builds great ships, but in that constrained budget environment, it's an asset that might get sacrificed."
Still, other analysts say the Navy is best served by two competing shipyards, and is unlikely to allow one to falter.
Meanwhile, as union officials ready for Thursday's rally outside the south gate of the shipyard, and prepare to join management for arbitration before the American Arbitration Association on May 29, Congress continues to move forward on the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the shipyards' contracts.
The U.S. House of Representatives pa ssed a nearly $612 defens e bill on Friday, just as the Senate Armed Services Committee also passed its version of the bill. The bill authorizes almost $4 billion for Navy destroyer programs, including $433 million for the construction of DDG 1000s and $3.1 billion for two DDG-51s, one of which will be built in Bath. The bill also includes $400 million in incremental funding for an additional DDG 51 that the Navy could procure in the next three years, potentially at Bath Iron Works, according to U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine.
The House version of the defense act still must be reconciled with a Senate bill and adopted by both chambers before being sent to the president.

Texto completo:   AUGUSTA, Maine -- With so many Mainers looking for work, it can be hard to imagine that there are employers out there waiting to write paychecks for employees they just can't find.
But that's exactly the case for certain industries that require workers with skills that just can't be found in the pools of the unemployed, according to several industry leaders who testified Monday before the Labor Committee.
"People that would get trained in our industry have a job waiting for them," said Jim Nichols, owner of Nichols Brothers Logging in Rumford. Logging isn't what it used to be, he said. Today's logger must operate complex harvesting machinery that require much more training than a chainsaw.
The bill before the committee was LD 1373, House Speaker Mark Eves' "Put ME to Work" initiative. It's a signature jobs effort by the North Berwick Democrat, and would invest $5 million over five years to develop public-private partnerships between industries in need of skilled workers and the state's community college system.
The program would put that money on the table for businesses or industries interested in collaborating with the colleges on job training. The training must be tailored for "jobs in high-demand fields," and the businesses or industry group would be required to provide 50 percent of the program's start-up costs, which would be matched by the state. Lastly, those who complete the program must be awarded a degree or certificate universally recognized by the industry for which the training is designed.
Eves said the bill was a "down payment on growing the middle class."
"If we want good jobs and strong wages, we must bring our workers and businesses together to prepare for the jobs of the future," he said. "Maine's comeback story depends on it."
A case example, cited by Eves, was the 2013 partnership between defense contractor Pratt & Whitney and York County Community College.
The company and college, along with several other businesses and assisted by a state grant, developed a precision machining technology program. Barbara Finkelstein, president of YCCC, told the committee on Monday that the program is already churning out skilled machinists, and that many already have local job offers or internships.
Now other industries want in. Representatives from Maine's logging, manufacturing and agricultural sectors were all on hand Monday to support Eves' bill.
It's not enough for Maine to simply be "open for business," as stated by the large sign that Gov. Paul LePage had placed near the state's southern border on Interstate 95, said Stuart Jablon, president and COO of Backyard Farms in Madison.
"Underneath that, it should say 'qualified help wanted,'" he said.
Jablon said Backyard Farms' average new employee, lacking the necessary skills, must complete three months of training in plant physiology, entomology and food safety before he or she can begin de-leafing, clipping or pruning the company's famous tomatoes.
He said the company would happily invest in a shared job training program to ensure a steady supply of ready workers.
While no one spoke in opposition to Eves' job training plan, LePage's administration testified with several concerns and suggestions.
Julie Rabinowitz, spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor, said the state already has several job training initiatives, including those tailored specifically at workers laid off from the state's shrinking manufacturing industry.
She said the Put ME to Work program could complement those existing efforts, but asked that specific criteria for judging industry proposals be included in the bill's language, as well as a system for identifying who is eligible for the job training programs. She also questioned whether the entire program should be housed in the community college system, rather than offered through a more diverse range of institutions.
Eves said he's open to working with the committee to address those and any other concerns.
"We are open to whatever idea is going to be successful," he said.
The committee will discuss the bill later this week before making a recommendation to the full Legislature.

Texto completo:   ROCKLAND, Maine -- A Swanville woman was sentenced Thursday to 15 days in jail after a jury convicted her of theft at the Wal-Mart in Thomaston.
Justice Daniel Billings imposed the sentence on 32-year-old Maranda L. McCafferty in Knox County Unified Court. The sentencing came after a two-day jury trial.
The jury found her guilty of a theft charge. The defense and prosecution had agreed earlier, without the jury being informed, that whatever verdict was reached on the theft charge would result in the same finding for violating a condition of release.
The jury was out for several hours.
The offenses occurred July 3, 2014, when McCafferty was caught by Wal-Mart's store security stealing clothing. Thomaston police charged her upon their arrival.
McCafferty has had several recent run-ins with law enforcement in Maine. In April 2014, she was charged with operating under the influence and violating a condition of release after she struck a fuel delivery truck in Winterport.
She was also charged in October with drug possession and violating a condition of release.

Texto completo:   STATE -- The Summit Project will embark on a tribute trek in Maine to honor the state's fallen heroes with a novel living memorial during Memorial Weekend, May 23-25. The Summit Project, a nonprofit organization paying tribute to heroes through action, will bring together more than 150 Patriot Rider Motorcyclists who will travel more than 200 miles to transport over 55 tribute stones and relay them to three teams of 12 hikers. The stones will be accompanied by Maine's first lady Anne LePage and escorted by Maine State Police.
Surviving families of Maine's post 9-11 fallen military service members have unearthed and donated stones that uniquely represent their loved ones. Volunteers from throughout Maine and across the country, worked to discover the lives of those heroes and then carry their stones and their stories on various treks, literally shouldering the burden of the families of the fallen.
On Memorial Day, three hiking teams will summit Owl Peak on Baxter State Park. Together with more than 30 Gold Star family members they will celebrate a weekend of fellowship, healing and remembrance along the shores of Millinocket Lake, at Twin Pines Campground in Millinocket, against the backdrop of Katahdin.
"We are encouraged by the outpouring of support from all over Maine, for our second annual signature event. There is no better way to celebrate Memorial Day than through this living memorial. The Summit Project is unique in that we're encouraging a physical as well as emotional connection between the fallen, the families and the living faithful. Our hiking teams will recognize the burden shouldered by our brave Maine service members and their families. By literally and figuratively lifting each other up to higher places, we can see how The Summit Project inspires service, strengthens communities and changes lives. We are looking forward to another great event this year.," said Marine Maj. David J. Cote, founder of The Summit Project
Hikers include parents and siblings of Maine's fallen heroes. Many hikers are returning veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other hikers are teachers, small business owners, law enforcement officers, students and citizens from Maine.
Hikers are assigned a specific fallen hero they will honor by carrying his or her tribute stone, learning about that veteran's service and sacrifice.

Texto completo:   MANCHESTER -- Five years with Lyme disease has driven Rhonda Smith, of Wayne, to seek treatment at a specialty clinic in Reno, Nevada.
"I have tickets. I'm leaving on the 30th," she said.
Smith didn't take the decision lightly.
"I've seen 10 different practitioners. I spend $10,000 a year out of pocket for Lyme disease. I can't work. I can't even drive because of the seizures," Smith said on Thursday prior to a meeting of the Capital Area Lyme Support Group which gathers at the Manchester Fire Department the second Thursday of every month.
The tipping point for Smith was 71 seizures since June 8, 2014, three of them on May 9. She carries a small emergency kit of medication everywhere she goes in case of a seizure.
Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted by deer ticks.
Seizures are one of the symptoms Smith says she has experienced since the tick bite five years ago that left her with the trademark bull's eye rash. She said she received the wrong medication initially, and that left her system vulnerable to Lyme.
Smith and a number of others at the support meeting detailed symptoms they and sometimes their medical providers attribute to Lyme: aches and pains in joints, brain fog, blurred vision, swollen lower limbs, tics, spastic movements, endless fatigue and suicidal thoughts.
The group meetings that provide some catharsis are conducted by Cheryl Farley, of Manchester, a nutritionist and survivor of a particularly nasty bout with chronic Lyme disease, and Farley's husband, Dennis.
The couple has founded a group in Lewiston as well that meets Mondays at the Arc Cafe on Lisbon Street. MaineLyme, a non-profit organization aiming "to decrease the prevalence of Lyme Disease and other tick-borne illnesses in the State of Maine through awareness, prevention, education and advocacy," offers a list of all the support groups in the state as does Midcoast Lyme Disease Support and Education.
Thursday's meeting was the second anniversary of the Manchester group.
"I'm a Lyme survivor," Farley told the 15 attendees. "By the grace of God, I'm Lyme free."
She said the doctor at the Nevada clinic saved her life, and she in turn hopes to help others dealing with Lyme in terms of education and resources.
A chart offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that from 2004 to 2013, the incidence of Lyme disease in Maine grew by 84.8 percent and indicates 27,000 confirmed cases reported nationally in 2013 with another 10,000 or so probable.
"Most Lyme disease cases reported to CDC through national surveillance are concentrated heavily in the Northeast and upper Midwest with 96 percent of reported cases occurring in 13 states," according to the CDC's website. The same site says that three studies using different methods of calculation indicate that 300,000 people are diagnosed with it each year, which means many instances go unreported
Farley recommends that people view a 2008 documentary on Lyme disease found at topdocumentaryfilms.com/under-our-skin/, directed by Andy Abraham Wilson. It details the struggles of people seeking and getting help from a handful of physicians who treat symptoms of chronic Lyme disease with antibiotics long term. It also shows how several of those physicians had their medical licenses suspended for doing so.
In Maine, the Legislature is considering LD 422, "An Act to Improve Access to Treatments for Lyme Disease," which would prevent the Board of Licensure in Maine from imposing discipline or suspending a license of a physician for prescribing long-term antibiotic therapy for a patient with chronic or acute Lyme disease. That bill, sponsored by state Rep. Deborah Sanderson, R-Chelsea, got a divided report from the Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development in late April and will move on to the House for consideration.
Farley and the other attendees at Thursday's meeting said many health-care providers don't know how to properly diagnose or treat Lyme.
The Lyme and Tick-borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University in New York recognizes the difficulties in treating Lyme.
"Until medical doctors have a test that definitively identifies the presence or absence of infection (and such a test does not yet exist), the controversy about the diagnosis and treatment of chronic Lyme Disease will continue," its website says.
Farley said the disease is very hard on people.
"It completely incapacitated me. Suddenly I couldn't do anything for myself," she said.
It also made her more empathetic to people who are shut-ins.
May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, marked by green ribbons and green porch lights, but Smith said she came attired in a lime green blouse on Thursday by accident.
She spoke during the meeting directly to the other attendees.
"You can look at all of us, and we don't look sick," she said.
Then she talked of sleeping 16-18 hours a day, being unable to recognize a movie her family assured her she had seen before and being unable to retain what she learned in four months on a job despite having two college degrees.
"Enough is enough," she said.
As she and others described their symptoms, the other people nodded up and down in recognition and offered sympathy and suggestions. Then they settled into watch the documentary.
Other resources are available at Lymedisease.org, a non-profit corporation acting as the clearinghouse for Lyme disease and all tick-borne disease issues.

Texto completo:   The Conservation Law Foundation is launch a new legal services hub for farmers and food entrepreneurs on Monday. Local attorneys will provide free legal services to farmers and food entrepreneurs who need them - services such as structuring their business, developing contracts, passing on the family farm to the next generation, etc.
Norma Vela has a lot to do on her fledgling family farm in Steuben.
Fencing that needs to be put up so her horses won't get into the blueberries. A flock of registered Romney sheep need feeding and tending. And a raspberry-blueberry pick-your-own operation is in the works. Vela has no time - or money - to deal with the legal issues that come with owning Dovetail Family Farm.
You might not think such a bucolic operation would have legal issues, but you'd be wrong. Vela needs to incorporate the 72-acre farm and to protect herself from lawsuits related to her horse operation.
So Vela turned to Barry Woods, an attorney at Drummond & Drummond, for free legal advice through a new program - formally launching in Maine on Monday - that provides pro bono services to farmers and food entrepreneurs. The Legal Services Food Hub is a project of the Conservation Law Foundation. It is modeled after a similar program in Massachusetts, and organizers hope it will spread to every New England state.
"It's just basically protecting us as a farm because there's a lot of risk in selling to the public, and you're a small business," Vela said. "You want to make sure you're doing it right and following all the rules."
At least 80 people are expected to attend the launch, at the Verrill Dana law firm in Portland, and U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a farmer herself, is scheduled to speak. About 20 lawyers have already signed on - they come from solo practices all the way up to the largest law firm in the state - but Ben Tettlebaum of the Conservation Law Foundation said attorneys from the northern and Down East parts of Maine are still needed and his group plans to hold further outreach events around the state.
Tettlebaum, who is the project coordinator for the Maine Legal Services Food Hub, said a study conducted by the Farm Commons, a Wisconsin-based organization that helps farmers, found that 70 percent of small businesses in the United States will at some point use legal services, but only 10 percent of farmers will do so. A recent survey of 200 New England farmers conducted for the Conservation Law Foundation found most don't use legal services but would if such help were affordable and if they understood its benefits.
"There is a perception that people make use of a lawyer when there's conflict or potential litigation," Tettlebaum said. But farmers and food entrepreneurs may need to negotiate contracts, pay taxes, apply for patents (say, for recipes), inherit or pass down property and sign leases. The new Boston Public Market and its vendors, for example, used the Massachusetts Legal Services Food Hub to negotiate their leases and structure the market as a business.
Noah Fralich, owner of Norumbega Cidery in New Gloucester, turned to the Maine hub for help trademarking his brand.
"I got the business started a year and a half ago and had put this off because it was low on the list of things to spend money on," he said. "It became clear that it was actually something really important to do. I discovered (the legal services hub) right around that same epiphany, and so it was a no-brainer, really."
Fralich, 30, said help came fast. "Just being able to attack this and have one less thing to worry about in terms of bills was great," he said.
Other cases are more complicated.
Cynthia Flores has been working Vegetables Dance, a farm in Bethel, for 16 years with her life partner. At 43, she says she is stuck with what she calls "not pretty legal issues."
"I have no lease agreements, and we are not married," she said. "My need is a business contract as well as a need for protecting myself in the event that either he and I split at some point down the road or something happens to him, because I have made structural improvements on his land but have no legal rights."
Flores had tried to find an attorney to help her, but wasn't sure where to go - a business attorney? A divorce attorney, even though she isn't married?
After she heard about the Legal Services Food Hub at the Maine Agricultural Trade Show, she called Tettlebaum. Her case is not yet resolved, but she feels less anxious now and estimates she will save hundreds of dollars in attorney fees.
According to agricultural census data cited by Tettlebaum, about 61 percent of farms operate at a net loss every year, so many farmers in the state can't afford to hire a lawyer. To participate in the Maine Legal Services Food Hub, farmers or entrepreneurs must meet the following criteria:
n The net annual income of the operation cannot exceed $30,000.
n Household income must be below 40 percent of the federal poverty level.
n The farm or food business must have grossed at least $5,000 in the past year, or be under three years old.
Barry Woods, the Drummond & Drummond attorney who is helping Norma Vela, said his firm is taking on these cases in the hope that as these businesses grow and become profitable, they'll turn to his firm for future legal needs. The firm, he said, is trying to develop a "sustainability-oriented client base" in the areas of food and energy. The Conservation Law Foundation program happened to come along at about the same time.
"It's been a good match," he said, "and it will be a really good opportunity to grow this sector in Maine."
Woods said the hub's lawyers can help a typical farmer save thousands of dollars on legal fees - and that's being "judicious and conservative." Setting up a typical Limited Liability Company business structure, for example, usually costs a flat fee of $500 to $600, Woods said. And that's just one transaction.
Vela is grateful she can use the money she saved on lawyers to put up fencing and to buy feed. The money she'd have spent to incorporate the farm is about the same as a month's worth of feed, she said.
"But mostly, for me personally, there's a feeling of security," Vela said. "I can call Barry, and if he doesn't know, he can find out." Meredith Goad can be contacted at 791-6332 or at: mgoad@pressherald.com Twitter: MeredithGoad

Texto completo:   Southern Maine Community College awarded hundreds of diplomas at its 68th commencement Sunday afternoon at Cross Insurance Arena in Portland.
More than 500 graduates participated in the ceremony. The Class of 2015 included students from Maine, 14 other states and eight foreign countries.
The South Portland-based college awarded a total of 1,057 degrees and certificates to 1,042 students this spring. Fourteen percent of the graduates, or 149 students, are members of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.
SMCC President Ron Cantor presided over the graduation. "The Class of 2015 has distinguished itself and our graduates are destined for success," Cantor said.
Former Maine Community College System President John Fitzsimmons - who saw system enrollment increase from 3,300 to more than 18,000 students during his 25-year tenure, which ended in February - gave the keynote address.
Fitzsimmons wished awareness, confidence and happiness on the graduates.
"When they write your final chapter, let them say that as successful as you were in your career, you were an even better person. Let that be your legacy," Fitzsimmons said.
More than 94 percent of SMCC graduates enter the workforce or transfer to another school within nine months of graduation.
Among them in the Class of 2015 will be Faiz Rahman-Sabean of Singapore, who is deciding among four schools he has been accepted at to continue toward his bachelor's degree. He earned associate degrees in math and business administration at SMCC.
The Maine Community College System trustees honored Leon and Lisa Gorman, longtime supporters of Maine's community colleges, at the commencement ceremony. He is the former president and chairman of the board of L.L. Bean Inc., and she is a community activist and a founder and vice chairwoman of The Foundation for Maine's Community Colleges.

Texto completo:   MANCHESTER -- Five years with Lyme disease has driven Rhonda Smith, of Wayne, to seek treatment at a specialty clinic in Reno, Nevada.
"I have tickets. I'm leaving on the 30th," she said.
Smith didn't take the decision lightly.
"I've seen 10 different practitioners. I spend $10,000 a year out of pocket for Lyme disease. I can't work. I can't even drive because of the seizures," Smith said on Thursday prior to a meeting of the Capital Area Lyme Support Group which gathers at the Manchester Fire Department the second Thursday of every month.
The tipping point for Smith was 71 seizures since June 8, 2014, three of them on May 9. She carries a small emergency kit of medication everywhere she goes in case of a seizure.
Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted by deer ticks. Seizures are one of the symptoms Smith says she has experienced since the tick bite five years ago that left her with the trademark bull's-eye rash. She said she received the wrong medication initially, and that left her system vulnerable to Lyme.
Smith and a number of others at the support meeting detailed symptoms they and sometimes their medical providers attribute to Lyme: aches and pains in joints, brain fog, blurred vision, swollen lower limbs, tics, spastic movements, endless fatigue and suicidal thoughts.
The group meetings that provide some catharsis are conducted by Cheryl Farley, of Manchester, a nutritionist and survivor of a particularly nasty bout with chronic Lyme disease, and Farley's husband, Dennis.
The couple has founded a group in Lewiston as well that meets Mondays at the Arc Cafe on Lisbon Street. MaineLyme, a nonprofit organization aiming "to decrease the prevalence of Lyme Disease and other tick-borne illnesses in the State of Maine through awareness, prevention, education and advocacy," offers a list of all the support groups in the state as does Midcoast Lyme Disease Support and Education.
Thursday's meeting was the second anniversary of the Manchester group.
"I'm a Lyme survivor," Farley told the 15 attendees. "By the grace of God, I'm Lyme-free."
She said the doctor at the Nevada clinic saved her life, and she in turn hopes to help others dealing with Lyme in terms of education and resources.
In Maine, the Legislature is considering L.D. 422, "An Act to Improve Access to Treatments for Lyme Disease," which would prevent the Board of Licensure in Maine from imposing discipline or suspending a license of a physician for prescribing long-term antibiotic therapy for a patient with chronic or acute Lyme disease. That bill, sponsored by state Rep. Deborah Sanderson, R-Chelsea, got a divided report from the Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development in late April and will move on to the House for consideration.
Farley and the other attendees at Thursday's meeting said many health-care providers don't know how to properly diagnose or treat Lyme.
May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, marked by green ribbons and green porch lights, but Smith said she came attired in a lime green blouse on Thursday by accident.
She spoke during the meeting directly to the other attendees.
"You can look at all of us, and we don't look sick," she said.
Then she talked of sleeping 16-18 hours a day, being unable to recognize a movie her family assured her she had seen before and being unable to retain what she learned in four months on a job despite having two college degrees.
"Enough is enough," she said. Betty Adams can be contacted at 621-5631 or at: badams@centralmaine.com Twitter: betadams

Texto completo:   Southern Maine Heart Walk to be held starting at AAA building at 68 Marginal Way, Portland
For the past 15 years, Bob Hatem of Scarborough has missed the Southern Maine Heart Walk only once.
And that year he had a pretty good excuse.
"They were putting in my defibrillator," said Hatem.
Hatem, 54, is the top fundraiser for this year's walk, pulling in just under $7,000 for the cause. His wife, Gail, raised another $1,700. He said a heart attack at age 38 is a big motivator. The Hatems make the walk with their children Rachel, 21, and Robbie, 17.
"They join us every year. We used to pull them in a carriage. Now they will be pulling us along one of these days," said Hatem.
The Hatems were joined by about 3,000 people who turned out Sunday for the American Heart Association in Maine's walk around Back Cove in Portland to raise money to help end cardiovascular disease and stroke. They are the leading causes of death in Maine, says the American Heart Association in Maine, which has an office in Scarborough.
The event, which started at the AAA of Northern New England parking lot, included heart-health educational displays and activities and a heart-healthy breakfast and lunch.
In its 23rd year, the walk is expected to raise more than $300,000 by the time all donations come in during the next 30 days, said Pauline Cormier, the walk's director.
Cormier said every year more people take part.
"We just build every year," she said.
Zen Duplisea, 11, of Gorham was walking with his grandmother, Lisa Duplisea, in memory of his great-grandmother, Scottie Mercier of Madison.
"She died from heart disease," said Zen.
He and his grandmother were walking with her co-workers at the coding department at Mercy Hospital in Portland.
Lauren Roy and her daughter, Jayden, 4, of Kennebunk were walking with a team from Maine Medical Center in Portland.
"I had two grandfathers who died of heart disease in their 50s," said Roy.
About 50 Subway restaurant managers and their families showed up to walk in yellow shirts. Subway was one of the food sponsors of the event.
"We thought it would be nice to participate as a group," said Cathy LeBlanc of Saco, who owns 14 Subways in southern Maine. Beth Quimby can be contacted at 791-6363 or at: bquimby@pressherald.com Twitter: bquimby

Bills say home care work deserves better pay

Resumen: MaineCare, the state's form of Medicaid, spent an average of $558 per month for each client who received personal care services at home in 2010, compared with $4,150 per month for each nursing home resident during the same year, according to a 2012 analysis by the Muskie School of Public Service.

Texto completo:   Wrap of senior-related bills making their way through the Legislature this session, including efforts to raise wages for home-care workers.
Adelaide Manirakiza went to work Friday afternoon prepared to spend the next 48 hours caring for an 80-year-old woman who needs help with just about everything - bathing, dressing, toileting, making meals, managing medications, running errands.
Manirakiza, who lives in Westbrook, enjoys her job as a state-funded home care worker. She fondly compares her elderly clients to the women who raised her. A war widow and refugee from Burundi, in central Africa, Manirakiza is a former customs official who has been a home care worker since she came to Maine in 2007.
In that time, her pay has risen from $8.50 to $10 an hour, although she gets $7.50 an hour at night, when she's expected to be sleeping. But she doesn't sleep, concerned that she should be alert to her client's needs.
"I worry about them like they're my mother or grandmother," Manirakiza said Friday.
Manirakiza is one of more than 10,000 home health and personal care workers in Maine who, after more than a decade of stagnant wages, could finally see their compensation increase in the face of growing demand from Maine's burgeoning senior population.
Legislation proposed by House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, and Rep. Ellie Espling, R-New Gloucester, would increase the hourly Medicaid reimbursement rate paid to home care agencies from $15 to $25.
The lawmakers have proposed separate bills, now before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, that are expected to be combined in a move of bipartisan cooperation. It's one of several efforts in this waning legislative session to address the growing needs of Maine's rapidly aging population, including affordable housing and family caregiver support.
The bills on home care workers' compensation would raise their pay from about $9 an hour - usually without benefits or mileage reimbursement - to $15 an hour - possibly with health benefits and mileage reimbursement. The increase would cost taxpayers about $9 million annually.
LEAST EXPENSIVE CARE OPTION
Proponents say the increase is needed to attract and keep dedicated employees in a competitive job market where starting pay at some retail stores is now $11 an hour. The increase also would help trim long waiting lists for Medicaid-funded home care services and help save the state millions of dollars on long-term care.
The cost of caring for seniors in their homes is an average of 45 percent lower per person than the cost for assisted-living facilities and nursing homes, according to the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine.
MaineCare, the state's form of Medicaid, spent an average of $558 per month for each client who received personal care services at home in 2010, compared with $4,150 per month for each nursing home resident during the same year, according to a 2012 analysis by the Muskie School of Public Service.
"We need to pay people more than Wal-Mart to attract and keep the employees who do this important, valuable work," Eves said. "Not only do seniors want to live independently in their homes as long as possible, it's also the least expensive long-term care option."
The need for home care workers is growing fast. SeniorsPlus, a Lewiston-based agency that coordinates home care statewide, is seeking workers to provide home care services for 471 clients, said Betsy Sawyer-Manter, executive director.
"We have many people who have been approved for services but are going without because there aren't enough people to do the work," Sawyer-Manter said.
Maine's reimbursement rate for home and personal care services has been stuck at about $15 an hour since 2005. Home care agencies pay their workers about $9 an hour, and the remaining $6 an hour covers a variety of administrative, operational and training costs.
Eves' bill, L.D. 1350, would require 85 percent of the proposed $10 increase to be spent on wages and employee benefits, including health insurance and mileage reimbursement. Espling's bill, L.D. 886, also calls for rate increases for registered and licensed practical nurses who provide home care.
SERVING AN AGING POPULATION
Legislators are considering several bills this session that aim to address needs springing from Maine's growing senior population.
Maine has the highest median age - 43.9 years - and the second-highest proportion of people age 65 and older - 17.7 percent - following Florida's 18.6 percent, according to the U.S. Census.
Maine also has the nation's highest proportion of baby boomers - 29 percent of its 1.3 million residents were born between 1946 and 1964 - and they're turning 65 at a rate of 18,250 a year, according to AARP Maine. By 2030, more than 25 percent of Mainers will be 65 or older, magnifying already serious challenges facing seniors and their communities related to health care, housing, transportation and long-term care.
In addition to a pay increase for home care workers, legislators are considering a $65 million bond bill to help fund the development of 1,000 units of affordable senior housing across the state.
Sponsored by House Speaker Eves and Sen. David Burns, R-Whiting, L.D. 1205 would start to fill a current need for about 9,000 units of subsidized senior housing identified by the Maine Affordable Housing Coalition and the Maine Real Estate Managers Association.
Burns also sponsored L.D. 1078, which would provide a 4 percent increase in MaineCare payments to assisted-living facilities, which haven't had a rate increase in eight years. Maine has 130 assisted-living facilities that are home to about 4,000 seniors - 3,000 of whom are MaineCare recipients, according to the Maine Health Care Association.
To help low-income seniors stay in their homes, Eves also sponsored L.D. 1095, which would increase the maximum property-tax credit allowed for qualified residents age 65 and older from $900 to $2,000 per year.
To help family caregivers, L.D. 787, sponsored by Rep. Denise Harlow, D-Portland, would provide a state income tax credit for adult day care, respite care or hospice care, resulting in a refund of up to $500 per year.
POOR PAY FOR IMPORTANT WORK
Few have more to gain from the proposed legislation than home care workers, who make a little over $20,000 a year, on average, according to the Maine Department of Labor. Most of them, like Adelaide Manirakiza, must provide their own transportation to and from clients' homes, no matter how far, so their real pay is a lot less.
Because Manirakiza receives no employee benefits, she gets health insurance through MaineCare. She also lives in subsidized housing, and she has used family welfare benefits from time to time to make ends meet and raise her four daughters, who are in college.
Sometimes, Manirakiza borrows money from friends to help with her daughters' expenses. She'd like to be able to pay her own way.
"We do delicate, important, often difficult work," Manirakiza said. "I have a big heart. I care about people. But this job doesn't pay enough." Kelley Bouchard can be contacted at 791-6328 or at: kbouchard@pressherald.com Twitter: KelleyBouchard
